00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:25,060


2
00:00:27,072 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,756
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

4
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:40,636
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

5
00:00:40,636 --> 00:00:44,832
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

6
00:00:44,832 --> 00:00:49,980
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

7
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,624
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

8
00:00:54,624 --> 00:00:56,832
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

9
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,872
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

10
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:01,952
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

11
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:06,428
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:11,296
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

13
00:01:11,296 --> 00:01:15,484
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

14
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:21,792
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

15
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:25,120
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

16
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,428
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

17
00:01:30,428 --> 00:01:38,628
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

18
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,504
   

19
00:01:56,504 --> 00:01:59,334
   

20
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:07,759
Such fine iron poplar wood. Thank you for making this happen, Brother Luo.

21
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,319
It was a small matter. There's no need to thank me.

22
00:02:12,359 --> 00:02:14,960
Where are Brother Yue and Xiao Yue?

23
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,880
They have already set off for Luori Village.

24
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,400
Wasn't it agreed that we would set off together?

25
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,960
They are probably angry with me.

26
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,320
Perhaps it will just be the two of us traveling from now on.

27
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:37,039
It's all right. After all, we are going to the same place.

28
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:39,719
Maybe we'll meet them on the way.

29
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,539
Jinzhao, didn't you say that my past is connected with the Nine Springs?

30
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:01,360
Why didn't we stay at the Luo Mansion and ask about it?

31
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,479
I'm afraid Luo Maiming deliberately let me into the Octagonal Tower yesterday.

32
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:08,799
Even if you are related to the Nine Springs, she certainly won't tell us.

33
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:10,400
Fortunately, there's still a clue from Lord Ming.

34
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,080
Following it, we can also find out your origins.

35
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,640
But walking to Luori Village would be too tiring, wouldn't it?

36
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,419
I want to take a carriage,

37
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:23,699
drink ice water, and eat icy fruits.

38
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,980
You can dream on. Let's go.

39
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:35,960
- Brother Yue. Xiao Yue. Get into the carriage. 
 - Let's go.

40
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,799
My dream has come true.

41
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,760
Jinzhao. I, Shifang, and Zhaoyan will all wait for you together in Luori Village.

42
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,479
Let's see who gets there faster.

43
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,760
Brother Yue, you should get on quickly too.

44
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,080
Jinzhao, why are you wearing such a cold expression today?

45
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,344
Is it because you woke up too early today and haven't gotten over your morning grumpiness?

46
00:04:06,344 --> 00:04:07,759
No, it's not that.

47
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,479
It's because Jinzhao is as tough as steel.

48
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:13,360
It's all because of you.

49
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,039
I was afraid that you'd be deceived without knowing it.

50
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:23,600
Jinzhao, are you still angry at Zhaoyan?

51
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,520
Jinzhao, if you are angry with him and want to ignore him,

52
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,679
I will ignore him too.

53
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:38,540
You can keep this to yourself. There's no need to speak it aloud.

54
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,319
It's all right. I covered my mouth with my hand.

55
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,199
They won't hear it at all.

56
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,880
Really?

57
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,319
Brother Luo, eat something.

58
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,919
What are you looking at?

59
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:09,240
Nothing.

60
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,919
When we were in the carriage, you said we were on the same team.

61
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,200
Now, seeing others eat something tasty makes you regret it.

62
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,640
I feel a bit regretful that I didn't get those snacks.

63
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,520
But I don't regret being on the same team as you.

64
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,139
Jinzhao, why did you argue with Zhaoyan?

65
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,399
Are you still thirsty?

66
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:52,480
It is such hot weather. The sun is scorching.

67
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:05,880
Brother Yue. Xiao Yue. Have some snacks.

68
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,559
Thank you.

69
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,040
Brother Ju, let's go find a water source.

70
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,519
The two of us?

71
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,119
Carrying these is cumbersome. Here.

72
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:26,539
- Let's go. 
 - Well...

73
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:28,799
Jinzhao is so clever.

74
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,380
Zhaoyan,

75
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:40,039
I'm so thirsty. Do you have any water with you?

76
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,720
Thank you.

77
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,240
Miss Yue, on your journey so far, you seem to always be thirsty.

78
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,559
Jinzhao always says I'm like a fish that can't live without water.

79
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,920
Brother Yue treats you well.

80
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,359
You also treat me well.

81
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,119
I...

82
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,040
I suspect you are Lord Ming. I haven't been very nice to you.

83
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,599
If I really were the Lord Ming, would you kill me?

84
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,639
Yes.

85
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,320
Sorry.

86
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,200
It's okay. You don't need to apologize.

87
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,920
Everyone has the right to choose their own stance.

88
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:30,720
I didn't expect you to be so understanding.

89
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,820
Jinzhao told me it.

90
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:40,500
Beat him.

91
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,920
Beat him hard.

92
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,440
Being favored by Lord Ming is your good fortune.

93
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,760
How dare you escape?

94
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,320
Beat him.

95
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,399
Beat him until he has no strength to escape.

96
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,399
That's outrageous.

97
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:17,480
You... You...

98
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,079
How dare you? I will surely take your life today.

99
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,040
Lord Ming, please protect me.

100
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,639
I am not Lord Ming. I am Yue Qi.

101
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,280
Are you afraid of revealing your identity?

102
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,799
Lord Ming, it's okay. Kill all these people.

103
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:34,519
Then your whereabouts won't be revealed.

104
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,979
If anyone is to be killed, it should be you.

105
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:39,519
No.

106
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,280
You really aren't Lord Ming.

107
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,079
Otherwise, why would you time and again oppose our holy sect?

108
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:46,799
Go get her!

109
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:33,320
Abiding by nature is the gate of righteousness.

110
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,679
Brother Yue, do I look like a hero this way?

111
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,760
This way, you do.

112
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,440
All right, Hero Ju, it's time to find the water.

113
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,539
You don't want to end up dying of thirst before becoming a hero.

114
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,880
Brother Yue, what did you call me just now?

115
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,619
Hero.

116
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:06,720
Hero... I am a great hero.

117
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,240
Brother Yue.

118
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,079
Gao Xiao!

119
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,920
Brother Yue! Brother Yue.

120
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,560
Brother Yue.

121
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:09,720
It doesn't seem like there is a water source nearby.

122
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,680
What's wrong with you?

123
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,999
I'm not sure. I can't quite explain the feeling.

124
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:18,839
I feel a bit anxious.

125
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:22,720
You're worried about Miss Xiao Yue, aren't you?

126
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,040
Indeed, Xiao Yue is frail...

127
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,999
and gentle,

128
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:33,820
yet adorable.

129
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,120
It's perfectly normal for you to worry about her.

130
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,560
However, Master Luo is reliable.

131
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,419
You can be at ease.

132
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:46,120
Hero Ju, clearly, you do not know Qi.

133
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,700
Let's go.

134
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,499
Oh no.

135
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:54,120
Brother Yue!

136
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,040
Xiao Yue is actually so formidable. I was foolish with my comments.

137
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,639
 After consuming the Qiyuan Orb, Qi's power has increased quite a bit. 

138
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,839
Are you okay?

139
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,639
Shifang, keep an eye on that person.

140
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,079
Brother Luo, let's cooperate with each other.

141
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:42,639
Okay.

142
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,199
Qi!

143
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,920
Are you all right?

144
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,040
Jinzhao, I want to try Mindlink.

145
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,800
No, you've just been injured.

146
00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:33,499
Jinzhao, I want to protect everyone, too.

147
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:09,550
Qi, I can't hold on much longer.

148
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:13,331
I'll hold off the giant scorpion. You all quickly look for a chance to leave.

149
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
No way.

150
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,079
Whether it's to kill or escape, we do it together.

151
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,820
I won't leave you alone.

152
00:15:06,748 --> 00:15:09,588
   

153
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:21,008
   

154
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:33,500
You are so impressive.

155
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,280
Thank you, Senior, for lending a hand.

156
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,099
Thanks.

157
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,160
Done.

158
00:15:58,239 --> 00:16:00,279
It still hurts a lot.

159
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:03,719
It will be better in a while. This medicine is very good.

160
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,517
This medicine is very precious. I don't give it to just anyone.

161
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,459
Jinzhao, does this mean you have made amends with Zhaoyan?

162
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:30,359
You're so smart.

163
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,040
Thank you, Brother Yue.

164
00:16:36,648 --> 00:16:38,239
May I have your names?

165
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:41,140
- I am... 
 - He is the handsome and dashing,

166
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:45,500
unbeatable and generous Brother Luo Luo, with exceptional martial strength.

167
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,496
I'm Luo Zhaoyan.

168
00:16:47,496 --> 00:16:49,640
 This aura... 

169
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:53,341
 It can't be wrong. 

170
00:16:54,359 --> 00:17:00,360
This is the renowned head of the Righteous Martial Alliance's Mechanic Skill Hall, Ju Shifang, Hero Ju.

171
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,879
My name is Yue Qi. And I love eating egg noodles the most.

172
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:08,936
That's all.

173
00:17:08,936 --> 00:17:11,176
Qi.

174
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,040
This is Yue Jinzhao, and that one is Yue Qi.

175
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,239
I'm Ming Xiu.

176
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:23,319
A name is but an external fleetness.

177
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:26,720
Just like Xiao Xiu, you can call me Xian Qing.

178
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:29,559
Xiao Shifang.

179
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,540
Xiao Zhaoyan.

180
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,439
Xiao Jinzhao.

181
00:17:34,439 --> 00:17:35,879
Xiao Qi.

182
00:17:35,879 --> 00:17:38,959
Please don't call me Xiao Qi. It sounds like the word "petty."

183
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:41,879
Just call me Xiao Yue.

184
00:17:41,879 --> 00:17:43,679
Xiao Yue.

185
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,759
This place is in a remote location.

186
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:50,600
Senior Xian Qing. Miss Ming. Why have you come here?

187
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,600
Xiao Xiu is a disciple of Mount Yuqing.

188
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,640
I am entrusted by her master to accompany her on a journey.

189
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,280
We passed by this place.

190
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:04,079
I have heard storytellers mention that Mount Yuqing is the most secretive sect in the world.

191
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:07,240
And it's rare to see disciples of Mount Yuqing in the world.

192
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,600
Xiao Yue, you are really well-informed.

193
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,759
Indeed, Mount Yuqing has a sparse number of people.

194
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:14,999
Yes.

195
00:18:14,999 --> 00:18:19,079
We only have two people and one dog.

196
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:23,760
Between those two people, that dog is quite superfluous.

197
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,979
By the way, why are you all here?

198
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,420
He is the reason we came.

199
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:45,759
How is it? Does the wound still hurt?

200
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:48,160
It stopped hurting a while ago.

201
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,176
It's just that...

202
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:56,639
Jinzhao, in the past, I only wanted to protect you.

203
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:00,379
But just now, when I saw Zhaoyan and the others in danger,

204
00:19:00,379 --> 00:19:02,800
I wanted to protect them, too.

205
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:07,560
It's your first time protecting others and fighting alongside them.

206
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,200
What does it feel like?

207
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:15,560
It feels warm here.

208
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,759
Let's go.

209
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:22,080
Let's see how Miss Ming helped that person.

210
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,960
Sir.

211
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:51,519
You startled me.

212
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:53,100
Let's hurry on our way.

213
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,840
To where?

214
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,479
I'd very much like to send you on your way to death.

215
00:19:58,479 --> 00:20:02,999
It was not easy to bring a human sacrifice back. And it's gone again.

216
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:07,979
Director Gao, haven't we already had the rest of the human sacrifices delivered to Luori Village?

217
00:20:07,979 --> 00:20:10,080
So what if one is lost?

218
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,040
It's all your fault. You are such a lazy bones and completely useless.

219
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,680
Then...

220
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,119
Let's counter-attack now.

221
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,879
Counter-attack, my foot.

222
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:21,399
How do we counter-attack?

223
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:23,680
You can try it yourself.

224
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,800
It doesn't matter.

225
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,440
After all, Lord Shengxuan said he would take care of the Luori Village matter.

226
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,200
Let's leave here for now and recuperate.

227
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,940
Life is like a play. We can always start over if need be.

228
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,379
Well said. Come on.

229
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:39,119
Come on.

230
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,419
Are you sure he was a human sacrifice abducted by the Qiyuan Sect?

231
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:51,700
That's right.

232
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,980
We've come here specially to investigate this.

233
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,480
Luori Village must be a Qiyuan Sect stronghold.

234
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,639
I see.

235
00:20:59,639 --> 00:21:05,094
Then Xiao Xiu and I will deal with the Qiyuan Sect threat here before we leave.

236
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,779
Thank you for your help.

237
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:10,419
Then Qi and I will go ahead to scout the situation.

238
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:13,519
Please take good care of that person.

239
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,664
I've heard that there is a traveling physician named Bian Luohuan in Luori Village

240
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:30,599
whose medical skills are excellent.

241
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:32,060
I've treated him a bit.

242
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,124
But you still need to get him there as soon as possible.

243
00:21:35,124 --> 00:21:39,560
So, instead of worrying about being defeated one by one by the enemy,

244
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,040
we'd better wait for the opportunity.

245
00:21:52,051 --> 00:21:54,025
   

246
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:15,600
Sir, may I ask where Physician Bian is?

247
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,880
Physician Bian? He's treating patients in the thatched cottage.

248
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,519
Over there.

249
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:24,559
Qi!

250
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,399
Where is Senior Xian Qing?

251
00:22:26,399 --> 00:22:29,559
Him? He ate too much and has gone for a walk to digest.

252
00:23:27,692 --> 00:23:30,640
   

253
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,000
 This person looks so familiar. 

254
00:23:37,512 --> 00:23:39,919
♫  Forgetting its name  ♫

255
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,679
Are you Physician Bian they talk about?

256
00:23:44,488 --> 00:23:49,416
♫  Behind the mask are deep feelings  ♫

257
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:53,256
♫  Only visible through the eyes  ♫

258
00:23:53,256 --> 00:23:58,378
♫  Who can see them clearly?  ♫

259
00:23:58,378 --> 00:24:06,296
♫  I'm destined to brave all the dangers for you  ♫

260
00:24:06,296 --> 00:24:14,562
♫  Even if fate cannot be escaped in the end  ♫

261
00:24:14,562 --> 00:24:22,504
♫  Staking everything just to feel the resonance of our souls  ♫

262
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:28,100
♫  Leaving love with an unspoken explanation  ♫

263
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,339
I am Bian Luohuan.

264
00:24:30,339 --> 00:24:32,479
My name is Yue Qi.

265
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,444
Qi? Qi?

266
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:40,600
Jinzhao, aren't you too slow?

267
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,919
You're too fast.

268
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:52,360
This is the Physician Bian we've been looking for.

269
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,200
Physician Bian, this patient has been infected by demonic poison.

270
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,620
Please save him.

271
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,679
It's a simple effort for me.

272
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,639
Put the patient on the couch.

273
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:24,639
The external whip wounds are easy to treat.

274
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:28,919
But the inner poison will take some effort.

275
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:30,579
You've handled it properly.

276
00:25:30,579 --> 00:25:32,859
After I apply the acupuncture to expel the poison, he will be fine.

277
00:25:32,859 --> 00:25:36,159
However, he has lost too much blood. He needs to sleep a bit more.

278
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,000
Thank you, Physician Bian.

279
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,679
No matter how you thank me, I won't charge you less.

280
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:42,179
How did he get injured?

281
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:45,780
We were traveling here and found this man being escorted by the Qiyuan Sect.

282
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,240
So, we intervened to save him.

283
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,799
Yet he was poisoned and fell into a coma.

284
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,480
We had no choice but to come here to seek your treatment.

285
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,300
I see.

286
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,760
Jinzhao, is there a water jug here? I'm really thirsty.

287
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,159
Hold on a little longer. I'll take you to find water in a while.

288
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:02,720
It was inconsiderate of me.

289
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,840
I'll prepare tea for all of you right away.

290
00:26:17,256 --> 00:26:19,440
How amazing!

291
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,891
Why is Xiao Yue's cup different from ours?

292
00:26:24,891 --> 00:26:28,212
Physician Bian, we are quite thirsty as well.

293
00:26:42,202 --> 00:26:44,361
This water is really sweet.

294
00:26:47,611 --> 00:26:51,332
Physician Bian, we need to go to the village to find a place to stay for the night.

295
00:26:51,332 --> 00:26:54,551
Please take care of this person for now.

296
00:26:54,551 --> 00:26:56,271
I am truly sorry, Physician Bian.

297
00:26:56,271 --> 00:27:00,192
I've also been injured. I may need to rest here for a bit.

298
00:27:00,192 --> 00:27:02,092
Please feel free.

299
00:27:16,891 --> 00:27:18,452
Let's go.

300
00:27:29,932 --> 00:27:33,172
Physician Bian, have we met before?

301
00:27:33,172 --> 00:27:34,831
Perhaps.

302
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:39,651
I have an ugly appearance.

303
00:27:39,651 --> 00:27:41,971
It's inconvenient to show my real face.

304
00:27:42,812 --> 00:27:46,651
Qi, it's impolite to do so. Let's go.

305
00:28:05,412 --> 00:28:08,172
What's going on with you and Physician Bian?

306
00:28:08,172 --> 00:28:10,251
What do you mean, "What's going on?"'?

307
00:28:10,251 --> 00:28:11,651
Have you seen him before?

308
00:28:11,651 --> 00:28:13,232
If you've seen him, I have.

309
00:28:13,232 --> 00:28:16,491
If you haven't seen him, I haven't seen him either.

310
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,332
All right, then. Let's go spread the message.

311
00:28:23,332 --> 00:28:26,151
I'll stay here with Zhaoyan.

312
00:28:26,151 --> 00:28:28,932
Are you staying for him, or...

313
00:28:30,771 --> 00:28:32,952
 Why am I even getting angry? 

314
00:28:32,952 --> 00:28:34,172
 Never mind. 

315
00:28:34,172 --> 00:28:36,252
Then, take care.

316
00:29:03,052 --> 00:29:06,532
Senior Uncle, I didn't expect that you, who are usually lazy by nature,

317
00:29:06,532 --> 00:29:09,132
would be willing to be close to humans.

318
00:29:11,052 --> 00:29:16,092
Xiao Xiu, Luo Zhaoyan has half of my demonic power.

319
00:29:16,092 --> 00:29:18,292
You've given away so much of your cultivation.

320
00:29:18,292 --> 00:29:20,891
Is it strange for him to have half of your demonic power?

321
00:29:20,891 --> 00:29:23,011
Xiao Xiu, you understand me so well.

322
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,891
I'm very gratified.

323
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:30,060
Could it be that he is the child from 20 years ago?

324
00:29:30,791 --> 00:29:32,491
 Help! 

325
00:29:33,092 --> 00:29:36,032
 Help! Help! 

326
00:29:38,178 --> 00:29:41,097
 Help! Help! 

327
00:30:15,511 --> 00:30:18,932
 Human, this is a land of demons. 

328
00:30:18,932 --> 00:30:21,251
 You shouldn't be here. 

329
00:30:24,212 --> 00:30:26,152
 You are a demon as well. 

330
00:30:27,971 --> 00:30:30,131
 Then you also possess demonic power. 

331
00:30:32,011 --> 00:30:34,212
 I beg you. 

332
00:30:34,212 --> 00:30:38,671
 Lend me your demonic orb to save my daughter. 

333
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:43,072
 I'm begging you. I'm begging you. Please. 

334
00:30:43,072 --> 00:30:47,712
But back then, he clearly said it was to save his daughter's life.

335
00:30:54,692 --> 00:30:56,131
Shifang.

336
00:30:57,891 --> 00:30:59,011
Where is Xiao Yue?

337
00:30:59,011 --> 00:31:01,491
She went to see Brother Luo and the injured person.

338
00:31:03,491 --> 00:31:05,731
Madam, we're passing through here.

339
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:08,891
Are there any vacant thatched cottages in the village?

340
00:31:14,812 --> 00:31:20,151
Brother Yue, won't this alert the enemy by asking like this?

341
00:31:20,932 --> 00:31:23,911
The moment we brought people into the village, we already alerted the enemy.

342
00:31:23,911 --> 00:31:26,592
Only when Luori Village is rife with rumors can we be at ease.

343
00:31:26,592 --> 00:31:30,912
If there isn't a single piece of news, we must be prepared.

344
00:31:33,172 --> 00:31:36,232
Brother Yue, you are really experienced.

345
00:31:36,232 --> 00:31:40,692
But, Brother Yue, we don't know if Physician Bian is good or bad.

346
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:44,271
And Brother Luo is injured. Xiao Yue wouldn't be in danger. Right?

347
00:31:44,271 --> 00:31:45,432
Rest assured.

348
00:31:45,432 --> 00:31:47,771
Ten of you can't beat one wounded Luo Zhaoyan.

349
00:31:47,771 --> 00:31:52,372
And ten wounded Luo Zhaoyans can't beat one well-fed Qi.

350
00:31:53,692 --> 00:31:56,151
- I also want someone like Xiao Yue... 
 - What did you say?

351
00:31:56,151 --> 00:31:58,412
I didn't hear clearly.

352
00:31:58,412 --> 00:32:01,851
I said I also wanted a sister like Xiao Yue.

353
00:32:02,692 --> 00:32:04,411
Plain noodles! Egg noodles!

354
00:32:04,411 --> 00:32:05,992
Sir, a bowl of egg noodles. 
    

355
00:32:05,992 --> 00:32:08,172
All right, coming right up.

356
00:32:15,771 --> 00:32:19,412
Sir, can I pay with credit here?

357
00:32:20,751 --> 00:32:22,771
You have no money?

358
00:32:22,771 --> 00:32:25,631
If you're not eating, then hurry along. Don't hinder my business.

359
00:32:25,631 --> 00:32:27,591
- Two bowls. 
 - Physician Bian.

360
00:32:27,591 --> 00:32:29,491
Here.

361
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:31,511
All right, coming right up.

362
00:32:31,511 --> 00:32:34,251
Physician Bian, why are you here?

363
00:32:34,251 --> 00:32:35,991
I'm just passing through.

364
00:32:40,151 --> 00:32:43,912
The jade pendant you have is quite unique.

365
00:32:45,031 --> 00:32:47,652
Jinzhao gave it to me.

366
00:32:51,432 --> 00:32:55,092
You seem to really like fish.

367
00:32:55,092 --> 00:32:56,232
Yes, I do.

368
00:32:56,232 --> 00:32:59,932
I like them so much that I can't bear to eat them.

369
00:32:59,932 --> 00:33:04,751
By the way, I also have a hair tie with a little fish that I really like.

370
00:33:04,751 --> 00:33:07,731
I've worn it for three years already.

371
00:33:10,808 --> 00:33:12,692
Look.

372
00:33:33,031 --> 00:33:34,692
I like fish a lot, too.

373
00:33:34,692 --> 00:33:38,292
I used to have a little fish at home.

374
00:33:38,292 --> 00:33:40,252
We grew up together.

375
00:33:42,432 --> 00:33:44,631
And then?

376
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:46,392
And then...

377
00:33:47,472 --> 00:33:48,671
it got lost.

378
00:33:48,671 --> 00:33:50,491
Got lost?

379
00:33:51,332 --> 00:33:53,452
Did you find it then?

380
00:33:54,192 --> 00:33:56,252
I couldn't find it again.

381
00:33:57,971 --> 00:34:00,771
You must have been very sad.

382
00:34:10,712 --> 00:34:13,131
Enjoy your noodles.

383
00:34:14,131 --> 00:34:15,671
Here.

384
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:31,572
Here's an egg for you to eat.

385
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:35,491
Thank you, Physician Bian. You're really kind.

386
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:38,952
If it were Jinzhao, he'd definitely have snatched my egg.

387
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:41,052
That's right.

388
00:34:42,131 --> 00:34:43,891
Jinzhao, give it back to me.

389
00:34:43,891 --> 00:34:45,932
No.

390
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:49,204
I still have patients to treat.

391
00:34:49,204 --> 00:34:51,628
Thank you, Physician Bian.

392
00:34:51,628 --> 00:34:53,891
Take care, Physician Bian.

393
00:34:56,771 --> 00:34:58,851
Why was he here, too?

394
00:34:59,611 --> 00:35:02,572
I don't know. Maybe he was hungry, too.

395
00:35:03,731 --> 00:35:05,871
This is really tasty.

396
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:08,232
Slow down.

397
00:35:08,232 --> 00:35:10,591
You've got hair in your mouth.

398
00:35:11,812 --> 00:35:14,328
Then I'll meet up with Shifang.

399
00:35:14,328 --> 00:35:15,608
I won't go with you.

400
00:35:15,608 --> 00:35:19,251
Physician Bian gave me a lot of money, enough for me to eat many bowls.

401
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,932
All right, then get back soon after you finish eating.

402
00:35:22,932 --> 00:35:25,092
Brother Luo and that person are still hurt.

403
00:35:25,092 --> 00:35:27,532
Rest assured. I will certainly take good care of them.

404
00:35:27,532 --> 00:35:30,052
Okay. Enjoy your meal.

405
00:35:34,292 --> 00:35:36,651
Sir, another bowl, please.

406
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:40,971
I wonder what there could be in this village.

407
00:35:45,592 --> 00:35:47,112
Miss Shuo Xuan?

408
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:50,832
Shifang, how has the rumor been spreading?

409
00:35:50,832 --> 00:35:52,332
It's just that area left.

410
00:35:52,332 --> 00:35:54,031
Let's go.

411
00:35:57,611 --> 00:35:59,611
You said the Qiyuan Sect attacked and hurt people. 
    

412
00:35:59,611 --> 00:36:00,692
Yes.

413
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:01,832
But fortunately, thanks to Physician Bian,

414
00:36:01,832 --> 00:36:05,052
the injured person has already been treated.

415
00:36:05,891 --> 00:36:07,131
We have pursued the traces all the way here.

416
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:09,211
Maybe it's related to Luori Village.

417
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:13,132
Sir, has there been anything unusual in the village lately?

418
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:15,491
Then I'll have to go back and ask.

419
00:36:15,491 --> 00:36:18,071
But there are only a few households in our village.

420
00:36:18,071 --> 00:36:20,071
And everybody knows each other well.

421
00:36:20,071 --> 00:36:22,232
It's unlikely there are bad people here.

422
00:36:22,232 --> 00:36:24,612
Rest assured, sir. With us here, there's no need to be afraid.

423
00:36:24,612 --> 00:36:27,931
It's just that we need to rest here for two days and wait for the patient to get better.

424
00:36:27,931 --> 00:36:29,911
Are there any vacant thatched cottages in the village?

425
00:36:29,911 --> 00:36:31,111
Yes, there are.

426
00:36:31,111 --> 00:36:33,552
There are a few empty thatched cottages on the northwest side of the village.

427
00:36:33,552 --> 00:36:35,772
I'll take you there.

428
00:36:40,971 --> 00:36:42,931
The village head has returned.

429
00:36:43,432 --> 00:36:45,631
Father, were those two young men earlier

430
00:36:45,631 --> 00:36:47,691
talking about the Qiyuan Sect attacking and harming people?

431
00:36:47,691 --> 00:36:49,052
Yes, A'Zhuo.

432
00:36:49,052 --> 00:36:52,232
That's right. You all must be extra careful.

433
00:36:52,232 --> 00:36:54,311
Our village is the only one nearby.

434
00:36:54,311 --> 00:36:57,092
Could it be that there are Qiyuan Sect members here?

435
00:36:57,092 --> 00:36:58,512
Impossible.

436
00:36:58,512 --> 00:37:01,032
How could there possibly be Qiyuan Sect members in our village?

437
00:37:01,032 --> 00:37:02,092
Exactly.

438
00:37:02,092 --> 00:37:07,052
They said the person attacked by the Qiyuan Sect is recuperating at Physician Bian's place.

439
00:37:07,052 --> 00:37:09,552
When he wakes up, we can just ask him.

440
00:37:09,552 --> 00:37:13,211
- Yes, we can. 
 - We must ask him once he's awake.

441
00:37:16,451 --> 00:37:20,771
Drink slowly. Here. Have something to eat.

442
00:37:22,052 --> 00:37:24,572
Are all these for me?

443
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:31,552
Physician Bian, you are so kind.

444
00:37:31,552 --> 00:37:33,832
 Is Physician Bian here? 

445
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:51,071
Miss Yue, we must be cautious and prudent in everything we do.

446
00:37:51,071 --> 00:37:54,911
- Especially when we are away from home... 
 - We should help each other even more

447
00:37:54,911 --> 00:37:57,271
and share with each other.

448
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:00,852
Thank you.

449
00:38:00,852 --> 00:38:04,132
Miss Yue, thank you for helping me out today.

450
00:38:04,132 --> 00:38:07,292
No need to thank me. That's what friends are for.

451
00:38:09,171 --> 00:38:12,532
Miss Yue, I'm sorry.

452
00:38:12,532 --> 00:38:14,812
Why do you say that?

453
00:38:15,572 --> 00:38:18,691
I've been suspecting all along that you were Lord Ming.

454
00:38:18,691 --> 00:38:20,831
Even though Maiming said you might not be,

455
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:23,971
my suspicions were never truly cleared away.

456
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:26,351
I am not Lord Ming.

457
00:38:26,351 --> 00:38:28,032
Miss Yue, you are innocent and adorable.

458
00:38:28,032 --> 00:38:30,971
You're also brave enough to lend a hand in times of danger.

459
00:38:30,971 --> 00:38:33,812
I think we've become friends.

460
00:38:34,652 --> 00:38:38,351
Physician Bian, is what those outsiders said true?

461
00:38:38,351 --> 00:38:40,332
Just give us a straight answer.

462
00:38:40,332 --> 00:38:42,111
We're all scared to death.

463
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,792
Yes, Physician Bian. Just tell us.

464
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:46,971
I still have a patient waiting for treatment.

465
00:38:46,971 --> 00:38:49,111
It's not a solution for you to wait outside.

466
00:38:49,111 --> 00:38:50,411
It would be better for you to go home.

467
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,852
Once the patient wakes up,

468
00:38:51,852 --> 00:38:53,712
your questions will be answered.

469
00:38:53,712 --> 00:38:55,332
Village Head...

470
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:56,952
- That's true. 
 - All right then, Physician Bian.

471
00:38:56,952 --> 00:38:58,892
We'll just wait for the patient to wake up.

472
00:38:58,892 --> 00:39:00,351
Then let's go first.

473
00:39:00,351 --> 00:39:01,532
Let's go.

474
00:39:01,532 --> 00:39:03,771
We're leaving, Physician Bian.

475
00:39:03,771 --> 00:39:09,052
Since we're friends now, I want to tell you something.

476
00:39:09,731 --> 00:39:12,292
Okay, feel free to speak.

477
00:39:14,332 --> 00:39:21,312
Since I first saw Physician Bian, I felt like he was familiar.

478
00:39:21,312 --> 00:39:23,831
 He feels like Jinzhao. 

479
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:38,100


480
00:39:44,184 --> 00:39:48,184
♫  Looking back upon the past  ♫

481
00:39:48,184 --> 00:39:52,056
♫  Searching for that moment from the past  ♫

482
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:56,280
♫  Sincerely, I begin to write, our hearts connected  ♫

483
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,992
♫  It is destined to be  ♫

484
00:39:59,992 --> 00:40:04,212
♫  My heart flutters silently  ♫

485
00:40:04,212 --> 00:40:08,024
♫  The years leave no trace behind  ♫

486
00:40:08,024 --> 00:40:10,100
♫  Beginning with the moonlight  ♫

487
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,280
♫  I fill the page with my memories   ♫

488
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,968
♫  All about you  ♫

489
00:40:14,968 --> 00:40:18,968
♫  All my laughter and joy is because of you  ♫

490
00:40:18,968 --> 00:40:22,936
♫  All my life's unforgettable moments are because of you  ♫

491
00:40:22,936 --> 00:40:24,492
♫  The past glides by scene by scene  ♫

492
00:40:24,492 --> 00:40:27,032
♫  How many smiles and tears  ♫

493
00:40:27,032 --> 00:40:32,280
♫  fell because of happiness  ♫

494
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,280
♫  I bitterly search thousands of rivers and mountains  ♫

495
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,216
♫  Alone in the empty valley I hear my echo  ♫

496
00:40:40,216 --> 00:40:42,232
♫  In the tranquility of this world   ♫

497
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:44,216
♫  I'm searching for your presence   ♫

498
00:40:44,216 --> 00:40:48,412
♫  I'll spend the rest of my life with you   ♫

499
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:52,088
♫  Never forgetting this, I keep bitterly searching  ♫

500
00:40:52,088 --> 00:40:57,080
♫  I hope to share the rest of my life's joy and sorrow with you  ♫

501
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,584
♫  Among the vast sea of people  ♫

502
00:40:58,584 --> 00:41:00,792
♫  I engrave your name  ♫

503
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:08,128
♫  Never doubt, the steadfastness of my heart  ♫

504
00:41:22,264 --> 00:41:26,198
♫  Wait until the wind rises and the rain ceases  ♫

505
00:41:26,198 --> 00:41:30,264
♫  Wait for the long lost silence  ♫

506
00:41:30,264 --> 00:41:34,136
♫  Wait until we are close   ♫

507
00:41:34,136 --> 00:41:37,980
♫  And watch the North Star  ♫

508
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:42,264
♫  My heart flutters silently  ♫

509
00:41:42,264 --> 00:41:46,040
♫  The stories leave no trace behind  ♫

510
