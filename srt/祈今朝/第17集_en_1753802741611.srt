Sorry, Zhuyu.

9
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I want to enter your world.

10
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
There is something I must make clear.

18
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Zhuyu.

19
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
How did you get in?

20
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Zhuyu.

21
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I learned meditation in the book.

22
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Sorry.

23
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I broke into your world without permission.

24
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Meditation?

25
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What do you want to do?

26
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I want to know if there is a way to solve the problem of lifeguarding.

27
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Lifeguarding?

28
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Is it for that ridiculous human?

29
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This move is not ridiculous.

30
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You can't say that.

31
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Selfish, hypocritical, greedy and angry.

32
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Humans fight for their own lives.

33
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Struggle for their own lives.

34
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What else can't humans do?

35
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Zhuyu.

36
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
How can you say that?

37
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Why can't I say that?

38
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
In the world of human,

39
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
the only thing that can be destroyed

40
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
is the only animal that is shameless.

41
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You entered my world for the sake of humans.

42
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You are really hateful.

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You are not Zhuyu.

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I want to leave here.

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Don't.

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Don't leave when you come in.

47
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Why don't you stay with me?

48
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm afraid.

49
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
There is no solution to lifeguarding anyway.

50
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Why should I stay with humans?

51
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What did you say?

52
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
There is no way to live.

53
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
There is no way to live?

54
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Let me out.

55
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Qi.

56
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's Qi.

57
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What's wrong, captain?

58
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm fine.

59
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You go first.

60
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Are you sure?

61
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Qi.

62
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's you.

63
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What's wrong?

64
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm fine.

65
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What's wrong?

66
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Qin Fei.

67
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Boss.

68
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The scout reported that

69
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Qi Zuo Ri was killed by Zhuyu.

70
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Killed?

71
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You must remind him

72
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
to keep our promise.

73
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Let Qi leave Tian Jing.

74
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Got it.

75
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Your Majesty.

76
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You've been guarding the young lord for a night.

77
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You'd better go to rest.

78
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The young lord will come back.

79
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'd rather go into the sea

80
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
for Yue Jinzhao's sake.

81
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Your Majesty.

82
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The people from Hengdao are here.

83
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The Martial Soul of the Nine Sages

84
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
is the most mysterious place in the world.

85
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The Martial Soul has the power of time.

86
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It can slow down time

87
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
and forget the memories of the past.

88
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Go back to the past?

89
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Go back to the past.

90
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I heard Qi was hurt.

91
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Don't worry.

92
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
He's being treated by the Demon Realm.

93
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He'll be back to life soon.

94
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Why is he so badly hurt?

95
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The power of Martial Soul

96
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
is connected to Qi.

97
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's like a magic.

98
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The power is connected to Qi.

99
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Master.

100
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Master.

101
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Master.

102
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Take me to the human realm.

103
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Please.

104
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Please.

105
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Master.

106
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Old Seven

107
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm the best person in this world.

108
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Is it the power of Martial Soul

109
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
that brings Qi's memory back to three years ago?

110
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You think I don't know you

111
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
because you wear a mask?

112
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
This mask is so ugly.

113
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
If this is the grace given by God,

114
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
let me be more pitiful.

115
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Qi, do you still remember Yue Jinzhao?

116
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Who is Yue Jinzhao?

117
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I really didn't guess wrong.

118
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Don't think about it.

119
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Let's go to the mortal world.

120
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Don't think about it.

121
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Let's go to the mortal world

122
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
and see what's interesting.

123
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What's wrong?

124
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
We might be discovered.

125
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I know.

126
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
We sneaked out from the prophecy book.

127
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So we have to be careful.

128
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
This time,

129
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm here to remind you

130
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
that you didn't forget

131
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
our promise, right?

132
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's the Fallen Soul that broke the mask

133
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
that made Yue Jinzhao and others

134
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
discover the Sea of Heavenly Love.

135
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Yin Xunwei, what right do you have

136
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
to question us?

137
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The reason why the Third Master was hit by the mask

138
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
was to save Qi.

139
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I believe you will understand.

140
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Sixteen years ago,

141
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
in order to save the Fish Clan,

142
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
you used your own power

143
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
to save the Fish Clan

144
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
and your own blood to restore the Fallen Soul.

145
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
But my brother,

146
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
as the guardian of the Fallen Soul,

147
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
in order to ensure the stability of the Nine Spring,

148
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
he broke the promise with His Majesty.

149
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You probably didn't forget these, right?

150
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Of course.

151
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Heng Daozhong supported the Qiyuan Sect

152
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
to provide the Qiyuan Bead to His Majesty.

153
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
His Majesty had to teach the Young Master

154
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
as a hostage to Heng Daozhong.

155
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
For many years,

156
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
His Majesty had never seen the Young Master.

157
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Isn't this still

158
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
an agreement between you two?

159
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Then now,

160
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
His Majesty left Qi in the Sea of Heavenly Love

161
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
in order to break our promise?

162
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I also want to ask you boldly

163
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
why Qi was injured.

164
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Isn't it because His Majesty hurt him?

165
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Look at this.

166
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Look at this.

167
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Look at this.

168
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Look at this.

169
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Qi, wait for me here.

170
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Take a look.

171
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
How much are these two?

172
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Did Xiao Ge come from outside?

173
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
We, the Sea of Heavenly Love,

174
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
buy things,

175
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and never charge for them.

176
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We exchange them for nothing.

177
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Then, can I exchange this?

178
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Sure.

179
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Thank you.

180
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Take care.

181
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Try it.

182
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
This is nice.

183
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Let me help you.

184
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Look.

185
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's really nice.

186
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Look over there.

187
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Take a look.

188
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
This is extraordinary.

189
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It can record any sound.

190
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
This is all made of magic.

191
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Your master and I are two stars.

192
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
There's nothing to draw.

193
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Can you draw this?

194
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Can I have this?

195
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
No.

196
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Master, you're so poor.

197
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Miss,

198
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
you can exchange this.

199
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I can't exchange this.

200
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Can you exchange this?

201
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You can exchange this.

202
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
This...

203
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Why can't I exchange this?

204
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
When did I get this?

205
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I can't exchange this.

206
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I can't exchange this.

207
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I can't exchange this.

208
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I can't exchange this.

209
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I can't exchange this.

210
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I can't exchange this.

211
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I can't exchange this.

212
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I can't exchange this.

213
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I can't exchange this.

214
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I can't exchange this.

215
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I can't exchange this.

216
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000

I can't exchange this.

218
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I can't exchange this.

219
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I can't exchange this.

220
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I can't exchange this.

221
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I can't exchange this.

222
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I can't exchange this.

223
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I can't exchange this.

224
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I can't exchange this.

225
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I can't exchange this.

226
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I can't exchange this.

227
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I can't exchange this.

228
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I can't exchange this.

229
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I can't exchange this.

230
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I can't exchange this.

231
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I can't exchange this.

232
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I can't exchange this.

233
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I can't exchange this.

234
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I can't exchange this.

235
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I can't exchange this.

236
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I can't exchange this.

237
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I can't exchange this.

238
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I can't exchange this.

239
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I can't exchange this.

240
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I can't exchange this.

241
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I can't exchange this.

242
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I can't exchange this.

243
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I can't exchange this.

244
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I can't exchange this.

245
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I can't exchange this.

246
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,980
You're

247
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
to eat all the delicious food in the world

248
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,040
and play all the fun in the world.

249
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,440
I want to make many good friends

250
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,360
like in the picture

251
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,160
and do justice to everyone.

252
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,640
You will.

253
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,960
I also want to listen to people talking about books and watching dramas

254
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,560
and watching flowers blooming in the sky.

255
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,600
You will.

256
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,320
I also want to

257
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,720
I will.

258
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,000
The power of the Martial Soul is disappearing.

259
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,520
You should wake up soon.

260
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,000
Master,

261
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,000
don't you have anything to tell me?

262
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,720
It's destined that I'll fight for you.

263
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:38,360
Even though the ending is hard to escape

264
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,040
Just sleep.

265
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,040
When you wake up,

266
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,360
you'll forget all about it.

267
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,620
Save the

268
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,140
question

269
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,340
let's

270
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,340
go

271
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,520
to keep our promise to the Taoism Seeker.

272
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,120
I'll consider it.

273
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,760
Don't worry.

274
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,040
Qi is asleep.

275
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,480
Your Majesty,

276
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,560
as long as you keep your promise,

277
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,800
we'll send Qi Yuan Zhu

278
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,600
on time.

279
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
If you want to hear her words,

280
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,520
let her tell you outside.

281
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,360
Let me go quickly.

282
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,400
Have you forgotten her?

283
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,640
You...

284
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,720
Argh.

285
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,760
It looks so spatula.

286
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,080
Let her holding it.

287
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,760
No need to be so serious.

288
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,400
Let Qi Yuan Zhu talk to the Taoist.

289
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,080
Your Highness.

290
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,440
What if Qi Yuan Zhu

291
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,120
diseases up to the limit?

292
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,560
Then my father's condition

293
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,560
I'll keep this pearl for further research.

294
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,560
If we can create something similar to this,

295
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,560
it'll be a blessing for the people of Shenzhou.

296
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,360
Chief, Gao Xia has already visited the headquarters in advance.

297
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,160
He only left Meng City as a scapegoat.

298
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,360
But we're investigating the specific clues of the headquarters.

299
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,560
The truth is,

300
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,560
the people of Shenzhou are very suspicious.

301
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,560
They're not the only ones who are suspicious.

302
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,360
They're also the people of Shenzhou.

303
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,160
They're also the people of Shenzhou.

304
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,560
They're also the people of Shenzhou.

305
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,560
We're investigating the specific clues of the headquarters.

306
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,560
Okay.

307
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,160
We'll leave the city the day after we get the details.

308
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,760
Thank you for your hard work today.

309
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,360
You're both strong-minded

310
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,160
and talented.

311
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,560
I wonder if you're willing to join the Zhenwu Alliance.

312
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,960
Shi Fang.

313
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,160
Your return of glory

314
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,760
is still the leader of the Jichao Hall.

315
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,760
Thank you, Chief.

316
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,760
I'll take the position of leader from now on.

317
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,160
Miss Ming has joined the Zhenwu Alliance.

318
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,360
Why don't you join us?

319
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,160
I'm glad to be able to work with the Zhenwu Alliance.

320
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,560
But I'm the leader of the Luo family.

321
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,560
It's not convenient for me to join the alliance.

322
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,560
Please forgive me, Chief.

323
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,560
It's not impossible to join the Zhenwu Alliance.

324
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,560
But it's not a good place for the Yao family.

325
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,760
Chief.

326
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,560
I'm used to traveling.

327
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,360
I'm not used to traveling.

328
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,560
I'm afraid I'll have to think about it again.

329
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,560
It's okay.

330
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,960
The Zhenwu Alliance is always open to you.

331
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,160
Thank you, Chief.

332
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,960
Can I speak to you?

333
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,160
Are you cold?

334
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,160
hostess

335
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,560
It's very cold.

336
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,760
So you have no meat or hair?

337
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,760
I'm willing to do it.

338
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,760
Who doesn't want to do it?

339
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,280
I'm not married enough.

340
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,760
You're awake.

341
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,760
How do you feel?

342
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,760
Sour.

343
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,760
It's like being hit by someone in a dream.

344
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,760
I'm not sure.

345
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,760
I'm not sure.

346
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,760
I'm not sure.

347
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,760
I'm not sure.

348
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,760
I'm not sure.

349
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,760
I'm not sure.

350
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,760
I'm not sure.

351
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,760
What happened yesterday?

352
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,760
I remember

353
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,760
I used the meditation technique

354
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,760
to enter your stone sea.

355
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,760
And then you...

356
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,760
Zhou Yu.

357
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,760
There's no protection technique at all.

358
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,760
You know.

359
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,760
You lied to me.

360
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,760
I have my empty boat.

361
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,760
What happened to you in the stone sea?

362
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,760
Qi.

363
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,760
Don't ask anymore.

364
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,760
I don't want to lie to you.

365
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,760
Zhou Yu.

366
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,760
You scared me.

367
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,760
I'm scared.

368
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,760
Rest well.

369
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,760
Zhao Yan was as pure as a mist.

370
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,760
The mountain and the sea.

371
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,760
Jingzhao, Shifang.

372
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,760
I was wrong.

373
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,760
I was wrong.

374
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,760
I was wrong.

375
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,760
I was wrong.

376
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,760
I was wrong.

377
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,760
I was wrong.

378
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,760
I was wrong.

379
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,760
What happened?

380
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,760
Xingzhao, Shi Feng.

381
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,760
I heard you calling my name. What happened?

382
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,760
Well, Zhao Yan, I'm sorry.

383
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,760
We've opened the letter.

384
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,760
But I promise I only see the first line.

385
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,760
Zhao Yan,

386
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,760
I feel so happy.

387
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,760
I wonder if you and Jinzhao are doing well.

388
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,760
You're like a cloud in the sky.

389
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,760
I feel so happy.

390
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,760
I hope you're doing well.

391
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,760
I'm sure you're doing well.

392
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,760
Today is Xiu's birthday.

393
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,760
I'll go with Han Jiang.

394
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,760
We'll meet soon.

395
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,760
I'll see you.

396
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,760
It's okay.

397
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,760
Mr. Xianqing said it's Miss Mingxiu's birthday.

398
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,760
Mr. Gu is back.

399
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,760
So it's Miss Mingxiu's birthday.

400
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,760
Birthday?

401
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,760
Then we should prepare a birthday gift.

402
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,760
Excuse me, what's this?

403
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,760
Today is the last day of the previous queen of the fish clan, Lin Ye.

404
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,760
The ceremony ceremony is going on ahead.

405
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,760
Lin Ye?

406
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,760
Lin Ye?

407
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,760
Why is the name of the fish clan called Lin Ye?

408
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,760
Lin Ye?

409
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,760
Lin Ye?

410
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,760
Lin Ye?

411
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,760
Lin Ye?

412
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,760
Lin Ye?

413
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,760
Lin Ye?

414
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,760
Lin Ye?

415
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,760
Lin Ye?

416
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,760
Lin Ye?

417
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,760
Lin Ye?

418
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,760
Lin Ye?

419
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
Lin Ye?

420
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
Lin Ye?

421
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,760
Lin Ye?

422
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,760
Lin Ye?

423
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,760
Lin Ye?

424
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,760
Lin Ye?

425
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,760
Lin Ye?

426
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,760
Lin Ye?

427
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,760
Lin Ye?

428
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,760
Lin Ye?

429
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
Lin Ye?

430
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,760
Lin Ye?

431
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,760
Lin Ye?

432
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,760
Lin Ye?

433
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,760
Lin Ye?

434
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,760
Lin Ye?

435
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,760
Lin Ye?

436
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,760
Lin Ye?

437
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,760
Lin Ye?

438
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,760
You're leaving?

439
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,760
I haven't thought it through yet.

440
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,760
But I must tell Jinzhao that the protection is fake.

441
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,760
You can't leave.

442
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,760
It's my business whether I leave or not.

443
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,760
It has nothing to do with you.

444
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,760
You...

445
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,760
You can come and go as you want.

446
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,760
What do you think Tian Qing and Zha Hai are?

447
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,760
But you're all lying to me.

448
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,760
What if you leave and you're in a bad shape?

449
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,760
Don't you see how much he loves you?

450
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,760
Don't you see how much he loves you?

451
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,760
But he shouldn't lie to me.

452
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:04,760
And his other appearance is covered with the smell of darkness.

453
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,760
It makes me feel strange and scary.

454
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,760
You saw it?

455
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,760
You know it too.

456
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,760
You know it too.

457
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,760
His Majesty won't hurt us.

458
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,760
You must have hurt His Majesty again.

459
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,760
Go back and apologize to His Majesty.

460
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,760
Ruoxuan.

461
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,760
Since the first time I met you in Jincui,

462
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,760
you've been like this to me.

463
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,760
Did I owe you money?

464
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,760
Or did I do anything to you?

465
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,760
You took my mother away.

466
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,760
You're also Zhu Yu's daughter?

467
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,760
My mother is the former queen of the Winged Clan, Ling Yue.

468
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,760
Now Zhu Yu uses this body.

469
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,760
It's my mother's body.

YoYo English Channel YouTube

472
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,760
The beauty behind the mask

473
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,760
Only through my eyes

474
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,760
Who can see

475
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:15,760
It's destined to be me for you

476
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:23,760
Even if the ending is hard to escape

477
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:32,760
I can't help but exchange a little bit of the light of dawn

478
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:39,760
Leave a silent description for love

479
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,760
It looks like a random path

480
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,760
The traces of burning

481
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,760
Hiding the secrets

482
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,760
The plot of the word

483
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,760
It's all my little heart

484
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,760
The arrangement

485
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:32,760
It's destined to be me for you

486
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:40,760
Even if the ending is hard to escape

487
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:47,760
I can't help but exchange a little bit of the light of dawn

488
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:54,760
Leave a silent description for love

489
00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:01,760
It's destined to be me for you

490
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,760
Even if the ending is hard to escape

491
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:14,760
Even if the ending is hard to escape

492
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:22,760
I don't want to leave you for a lifetime

493
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:32,760
Leave a silent description for love
