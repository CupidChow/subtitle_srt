1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
1. Christmas

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:26,000
2. twist the story

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I tear up the past memories

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I don't want to leave regrets behind

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I want to exchange the whole life for a second

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If I decide to put down my guard

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who will I give my heart to?

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm not afraid of being destroyed if I dare to give it to you

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I don't want to be in deep sleep

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I hope that there will be no regrets in winter

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I don't want to leave regrets behind

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Because you are the secret of the unknown

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So I pray for a miracle

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I will give my heart to you even if I'm burned by time

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And I only wish to go to the stars for you

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Searching for a miracle that will last forever

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I will never give up on my journey

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Love is the most beautiful meaning of life

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Episode 16

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Is there any other way?

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I guessed it was the result

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
If there is, then I will give up on it

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You will never make this choice

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I know the result

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But I can't help asking again

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I hope that in these three years

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I can find evidence

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Prove that what happened that year can change you

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:03:11,960
I even intentionally didn't let her go to the

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I will definitely take the responsibility of being with her

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
For so many years

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Xiaohuan and I have been afraid of losing you

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Today, I will let you taste this

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You are really afraid of what?

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Afraid of losing your family

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This is a very normal thing

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
For so many years

39
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Xiaohuan and I have been afraid of losing you

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I will definitely take the responsibility of being with you

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Brother, sister

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Where are you going?

43
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
He can't tell me

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You three are going to a very far place

45
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I will definitely take the responsibility of being with you

46
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Brother, sister

47
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Where are you going?

48
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I will definitely take the responsibility of being with you

49
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Brother, sister

50
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Where are you going?

51
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I will definitely take the responsibility of being with you

52
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Brother, sister

53
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Where are you going?

54
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I will definitely take the responsibility of being with you

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Brother

56
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Third

57
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's getting late

58
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
They won't come

59
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's not time yet

60
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Is there something wrong with Xinzhao and Xiaoyuan?

61
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Come

62
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Commander Ying is really ruthless

63
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What?

64
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You want to catch us and throw us down?

65
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Please stay

66
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Then we have to see if you have the ability

67
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What?

68
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Ying Xuwei

69
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You don't believe us?

70
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Xinzhao, Xiaoyuan

71
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You shouldn't come back

72
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We will never abandon friends

73
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You are right

74
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Of course, I won't look at the wrong person

75
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm ready

76
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Let's go

77
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Let's go

78
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Go

79
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Let's go

80
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Second sister, Xiaoyuan

81
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Take care

82
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Second sister

83
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Second sister

84
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Why can't I go to see Brother San?

85
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I want him to bring me a gift

86
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Have you finished copying the scriptures?

87
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You only know to go out and play

88
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I just want to see Brother San off

89
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'll go back and play

90
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Brother San is here anyway

91
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Wei Lenghuan

92
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
He's really smiling

93
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He's not smiling

94
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Does he want me to cry?

95
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yes

96
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If I'm the one who's going to die

97
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm fine

98
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You still treated me as a dead enemy a few days ago

99
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But today

100
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You talk to me so calmly

101
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It feels really strange

102
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's a little strange

103
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm just

104
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Pitying myself

105
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Do you think we're the same?

106
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I thought about it at first

107
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Are we the same person?

108
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But then I slowly found out

109
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You and I are so different

110
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
How to say

111
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You are stingy, love to take advantage of small things

112
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You are a talker

113
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Okay, okay, okay

114
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I knew you wouldn't say anything good

115
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But gradually

116
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm used to you

117
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Until

118
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm in love with you

119
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Forget it

120
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Actually

121
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I can be me today

122
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I also have your credit

123
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's what you've been through

124
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You've achieved what you are now

125
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's right

126
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I am me

127
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Anyway, we

128
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Completely two people

129
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yes

130
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I can't believe

131
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yue Jinzhao's name

132
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I used to get it for myself

133
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What does this name mean?

134
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Beyond the past

135
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Everything

136
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
From today

137
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's a good name

138
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Why did they suddenly get along?

139
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Xiaoyue

140
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You were treated as a cold weapon in the jade world before

141
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The days must be hard

142
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Actually

143
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I've been in jade world for more than ten years

144
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I didn't live as hard as you think

145
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Why?

146
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Bian Luohuan is very good to me

147
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
He grew up with me

148
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Teach me how to write and practice sword

149
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Whatever I need

150
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
He will try to satisfy me

151
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
This

152
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What should I say at this time?

153
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But the birds in the cage

154
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Always live in the illusion

155
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
No freedom

156
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
But it's different from being with Jinzhao

157
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
He took me to travel the world for these three years

158
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Although there are hardships and tears

159
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
But I think it's real

160
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
The resonance between me and Jinzhao

161
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Never control

162
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But the combination between us

163
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Thanks

164
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Commander Ying

165
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
His Majesty has ordered

166
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You can only enter the hall alone

167
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Xuwei

168
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
We are waiting for you here

169
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Miss Shaoxuan

170
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You are here

171
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm here

172
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm here

173
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm here

174
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm here

175
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm here

176
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm here

177
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm here

178
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Miss Shaoxuan

179
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Do you know

180
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What is the use of the Qi Yuan Pearl?

181
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The tribute to His Majesty by the Taoism Seeker

182
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
To exchange for their poor safety

183
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Every pearl is a life

184
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
They don't think it's wrong

185
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Why should I feel wrong?

186
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Besides

187
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
If there is no Qi Yuan Pearl

188
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
How can His Majesty treat my people?

189
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
No

190
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So

191
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That's what you think

192
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Are you worried

193
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
If we meet with Shouxuan

194
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Which side should you help?

195
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
No

196
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm worried about Jinzhao and Xiaoyue

197
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,120
Miss Shuang Xuan and I

198
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,840
want to protect

199
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,000
something different.

200
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,800
Miss Shuang Xuan,

201
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,120
goodbye.

202
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,960
You need to get into the five souls.

203
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,280
You are poison.

204
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,720
If I don't give you permission

205
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,200
The past

206
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,040
is a secret

207
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,680
across Royal Palace.

208
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,680
It's the ending.

209
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,640
If there are anyone

210
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:19,800
wissen

211
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:20,560
if

212
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,040
If someone changes the history of time

213
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,760
and disrupts the flow of time,

214
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,040
it will cause the whole time to be in chaos.

215
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,480
Yan Luo Huan changed Yue Jin Zhao from Martial Soul.

216
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,760
Yue Jin Zhao and Qi's union

217
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,600
has been established in history.

218
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,240
Today,

219
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,000
if His Majesty

220
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,200
insists on stopping us from entering Martial Soul,

221
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,960
it will make Xiao Huan

222
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,480
to change Yue Jin Zhao

223
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,840
from Martial Soul

224
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,400
so that she can't meet Yue Jin Zhao

225
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,200
and change the history.

226
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,440
Then the whole time will be destroyed.

227
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,200
And the Winged Clan will be gone.

228
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,760
Even if I don't allow you to enter Martial Soul,

229
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,560
there will be different causes

230
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,760
that will make history complete.

231
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,680
Master Yan.

232
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,400
companion,

233
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,400
I can let you September Fool's參 stew Sing.

234
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,360
However,

235
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,160
I want Mrs. shirt as a exchange.

236
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,840
When they enter Martial Soul,

237
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,760
If you don't believe me,

238
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,760
I will use the jade skill.

239
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,840
Here we are.

240
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,840
I don't know why His Majesty

241
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,840
let you in.

242
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,840
Boss,

243
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,840
open your Martial Soul.

244
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,840
Kill all evils

245
00:16:51,840 --> 00:17:03,020
Seize the moment pls

246
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,100
Time is short

247
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,240
But we can only take a little step

248
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,400
Hurry

249
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,700
Let's go inside

250
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,840
Come.

251
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,840
Third.

252
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,840
Boss, what can I do for you?

253
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,840
Go.

254
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,840
Take care.

255
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,800
The

256
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,840
There seems to be a feeling of being out of reality.

257
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,840
Compared to other springs we have been to,

258
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,840
it seems to be more empty here.

259
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,840
It seems that time is no longer there.

260
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,840
The blood of the Shuhu and the play of time

261
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,840
are not in the six realms.

262
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,840
It really doesn't belong to reality.

263
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,840
When we get here,

264
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,840
we are lucky.

265
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,840
Then how do we determine

266
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,840
when we should return to the past?

267
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,840
Time will tell us.

268
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,840
You don't understand.

269
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,840
Wait for us outside.

270
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,840
Let's meet outside.

271
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,840
Okay.

272
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,840
Let's go.

273
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,840
Go.

274
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,840
Go.

275
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,840
This is the secret room of Luo Ru Village.

276
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,840
But we are going back to the pre-historic book.

277
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,840
How can we get back here?

278
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,840
The flow of time leads us here.

279
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,840
There must be a reason.

280
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,840
But what about these people?

281
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,840
Don't worry.

282
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,840
We used to save them.

283
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,840
This is the box we used to collect the Seven-Pillar Bead.

284
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,840
Officer Xiao Tian.

285
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,840
Please.

286
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,840
I'm sorry.

287
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,840
I'm sorry.

288
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,840
No.

289
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,840
This is the mechanism you set up.

290
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,840
I thought you had forgotten everything.

291
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,840
But you still saved me.

292
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,840
After all, you are my

293
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,840
master.

294
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,840
Shifeng.

295
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,840
Give me the dragon mirror.

296
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,840
Okay.

297
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,840
Because of this dragon mirror,

298
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,840
we couldn't go to Wuye Village.

299
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,840
So we met the Lin Yuan Tree.

300
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,840
And we got the body of the Seven-Pillar Bead.

301
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,840
Now,

302
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,840
we have to lead the people in the future

303
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,840
to do the same thing.

304
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,840
We are here.

305
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,840
Let's go.

306
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,840
How is it?

307
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,840
It seems that

308
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,840
as long as we do what we should do,

309
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,840
we will be sent back to the game of time.

310
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,840
This way,

311
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,840
we won't have any trouble.

312
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,840
Let's go.

313
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,840
It's time to reveal

314
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,840
the me from three years ago.

315
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,840
Everyone.

316
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,840
This is our business.

317
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,840
Let's face it.

318
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,840
Let's go.

319
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,840
Okay.

320
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,840
We will meet here later.

321
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,840
Please.

322
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,840
Let's go.

323
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,840
Master.

324
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,840
Master.

325
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,840
Master.

326
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,840
Take me to the mortal world.

327
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,840
You are a greedy ghost.

328
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,840
You don't practice archery every day.

329
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,840
You just want to go to the mortal world.

330
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,840
Master.

331
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,840
When I was still a spider,

332
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,840
I lied in the sea of clouds for ten years.

333
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,840
After I became human,

334
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,840
I stayed in the jade tree for a few years.

335
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,840
It has been more than ten years since I got home.

336
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,840
I have already known

337
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,840
every ant here.

338
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,840
Master.

339
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,840
Please.

340
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,840
Please take me to the mortal world.

341
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,840
Okay?

342
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,840
I also beg you.

343
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,840
You are nagging every day.

344
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,840
Your ears are all up.

345
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,840
Look.

346
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,840
The thick scissors over there.

347
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,840
None of them.

348
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,840
Please take me out to play.

349
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,840
I really want to go out and play.

350
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,840
Master.

351
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,840
You are the best.

352
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,840
Take me there.

353
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,840
Okay.

354
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840
You go to the mortal world first.

355
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,840
I will go to the boss to find Qiu Xiaoqing.

356
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,840
See if I can take you there.

357
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,840
Okay?

358
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,840
Do you want to talk?

359
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,840
Of course.

360
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,840
When have I never talked?

361
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,840
Okay.

362
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,840
I have been in the jade tree for three years.

363
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,840
But I feel like I am in the other world.

364
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,840
Let's go.

365
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,840
We should get the air from three years ago.

366
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,840
Wait.

367
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,840
I will go.

368
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,840
Don't let me

369
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,840
be alone with Qi.

370
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,840
I want to get back with her

371
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,840
from three years ago.

372
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,840
I want to get back with her from three years ago.

373
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,840
I want to get back with her from three years ago.

374
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,840
I want to get back with her from three years ago.

375
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,840
I want to get back with her from three years ago.

376
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,840
I want to get back with her from three years ago.

377
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,840
I want to get back with her from three years ago.

378
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,840
I want to get back with her from three years ago.

379
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,840
I want to get back with her from three years ago.

380
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,840
I want to get back with her from three years ago.

381
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,840
I want to get back with her from three years ago.

382
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,840
I want to get back with her from three years ago.

383
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,840
I want to get back with her from three years ago.

384
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,840
I want to get back with her from three years ago.

385
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,840
I want to get back with her from three years ago.

386
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,840
I want to get back with her from three years ago.

387
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:01,840
It's destined that I'll fight for you

388
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:09,840
Even if the ending is hard to escape

389
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:17,840
I'm unwilling to exchange a little bit of my life for love

390
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:25,840
I'm unwilling to exchange a little bit of my life for love

391
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:31,840
It's destined that I'll fight for you

392
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:41,840
Even if the ending is hard to escape

393
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:48,840
I'm unwilling to exchange a little bit of my life for love

394
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,840
I'm unwilling to exchange a little bit of my life for love

395
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,840
Is it destined that I'll fight for you?

396
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,840
But I don't want to kill anyone.

397
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,840
Master, what do you want to do?

398
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,840
Master

399
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,840
Master, what are you going to do?

400
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,840
Master

401
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,840
This time

402
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,840
I really want to take you to the human world.

403
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,840
I really want to take you to the human world.

404
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:39,840
Look at the flowers in the sun

405
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,840
I've always wanted to send it to you.

406
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,840
The sun is setting

407
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,840
Can the sun and the moon fall?

408
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:55,840
Can you answer?

409
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,840
The old tree is big

410
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,840
This is the soul of the soul

411
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:14,840
The moon is like a flower

412
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,840
The moon is like a flower

413
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,840
I want you to be with me for a lifetime.

414
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:31,840
I want you to be with me for a lifetime.

415
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,840
I want you to be with me for a lifetime.

416
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,840
I want you to be with me for a lifetime.

417
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,840
I want you to be with me for a lifetime.

418
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,840
I want you to be with me for a lifetime.

419
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,840
I want you to be with me for a lifetime.

420
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,840
I want you to be with me for a lifetime.

421
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,840
I want you to be with me for a lifetime.

422
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,840
I want you to be with me for a lifetime.

423
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,840
It turns out

424
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,840
This is when you first met

425
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,840
My appearance

426
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,840
I want to send you to the human world.

427
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,840
The star is the most beautiful

428
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,840
I can hear the sound

429
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:55,840
I want you to be with me for a lifetime.

430
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:01,840
I want you to be with me for a lifetime.

431
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,840
I want you to be with me for a lifetime.

432
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,840
Don't be afraid

433
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,840
Don't be afraid

434
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:19,840
It's the most serious thing in your life.

435
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:25,840
I don't want to leave you.

436
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:32,840
I want you to be with me for a lifetime.

437
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,840
stop

438
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,840
Take her away

439
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,840
The star in the Goodże

440
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,840
Happy and happy

441
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,840
San

442
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,840
According to what told by Ying Xuwei

443
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,120
Let's go.

444
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,480
Another person?

445
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,120
What about you?

446
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,720
I...

447
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,280
I'm going to Longtan

448
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,760
to exchange this person.

449
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,720
Her name is

450
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,000
Yue Jinzhao.

451
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,880
Yue Jinzhao.

452
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,320
Do you remember

453
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,120
that I once

454
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,440
named myself Yue Jinzhao?

455
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,720
Back then,

456
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,360
my father passed away.

457
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,000
My mother worked hard to earn money.

458
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,360
She beat me,

459
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,440
scolded me,

460
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,120
and even abandoned me.

461
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,800
The scar on my face

462
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,840
was left from that time.

463
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,440
It was you

464
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,560
who found me wandering on the street.

465
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,560
So,

466
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,160
you asked me to bring back my jade book.

467
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,320
You asked me what my name was.

468
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:18,800
I said

469
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,640
I'm Yue Jinzhao.

470
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,000
One.

471
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,480
Beyond the past.

472
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,160
Everything starts anew.

473
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,320
Do you remember

474
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,080
what you said

475
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,480
to me back then?

476
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,920
Mao Xiaobai

477
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,080
used to tell you

478
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,040
that you'd better be aware

479
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,040
of the past all the time.

480
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,560
You knew before

481
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,520
and could tell this.

482
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,640
I was still here.

483
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,360
Never in your life

484
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,800
did you regret

485
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,040
לא самогоhel v Cannon

486
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,560
và phải t uncommon

487
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,200
Standard words

488
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,520
We won't annoy you anymore.

489
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:22,900
Bye.

490
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,880
Huan.

491
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,180
Chief.

492
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:34,240
Mr. Hu.

493
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,160
Head.

494
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,000
For the last time,

495
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,960
it was really a friend- mammals bike.

496
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,340
Nice

497
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,560
Come here

498
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,120
Here

499
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,460
Here

500
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,000
I was very worried that you would change your mind.

501
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,420
And also

502
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,600
I hope thatmy she'd also tag along with you.

503
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,000
Como,

504
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,400
est 201...

505
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,240
on your 7th Martial Ring.

506
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:04,800
No.

507
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,440
Third Brother.

508
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,000
Two little Yue.

509
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,120
It feels so strange.

510
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,480
It's so unreal.

511
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,200
The Yue girl

512
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,280
doesn't know us yet.

513
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,000
Yes.

514
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,200
She doesn't look like

515
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,520
a random person.

516
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,720
The one who fell asleep

517
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,320
looks more obedient.

518
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,600
Yue girl.

519
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,000
Zhaoyan, it's okay.

520
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,000
I know

521
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,720
you all want to make me happy.

522
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,560
Don't worry.

523
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,840
I know what to do.

524
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,160
Okay.

525
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,760
You still have three more years.

526
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,160
Channel your wealth in this happiness.

527
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,080
I told her

528
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,640
everything.

529
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,160
Now,

530
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,240
it's time for our next decision.

531
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:23,500
The

532
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,500
The depth behind the mask

533
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,500
Only through my eyes

534
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,500
Who can see

535
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:43,500
It's destined to be me for you

536
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:52,500
Even if the ending is hard to tell

537
00:38:53,500 --> 00:39:01,500
I just want to exchange a little bit of my life for love

538
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:08,500
Leave a silent description for love

539
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:29,500
It looks like a random path

540
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,500
The traces of burning

541
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,500
Hiding the secrets

542
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,500
The plot of the sudden encounter

543
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,500
It's all my little heart

544
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,500
Arrangement

545
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:00,500
It's destined to be me for you

546
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:09,500
Even if the ending is hard to tell

547
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:18,500
I just want to exchange a little bit of my life for love

548
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:25,500
Leave a silent description for love

549
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:32,500
It's destined to be me for you

550
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:39,500
Even if the ending is hard to tell

551
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:50,500
I just want to exchange a little bit of my life for love

552
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:59,500
Leave a silent description for love
