1
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:25,100


2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,700
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

4
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:39,800
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

5
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,800
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

6
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,000
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,500
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

8
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,800
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

9
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,900
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

10
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,900
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

11
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,400
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,500
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

13
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,500
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

14
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,800
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

15
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,100
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

16
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:30,400
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

17
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:38,100
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

18
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:56,500
   

19
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,900
   

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The people from the Hengdao Sect seem to bear no ill will towards Young Yue.

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,800
We'll find her.

22
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,100
Is Third Brother settled in?

23
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,800
Xiaoyuan, you've made a mistake again.

24
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,500
I haven't!

25
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,600
You only care about justice for the "people". Us siblings mean nothing to you!

26
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,500
Xiaoyuan!

27
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,000
Go confine yourself. For at least three days, you're not allowed to come out!

28
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,900
Eldest Brother, Xiaoyuan is still young. She doesn't understand.

29
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,000
How is Third Brother's injury?

30
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,600
The power of Qi's Thought Sword is strong.

31
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,800
Young Huan is severely injured.

32
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,000
I got it.

33
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,800
Tomorrow is the day of the transaction with Luo Maiming.

34
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,400
This matter is the most important.

35
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,800
Once the transaction is complete, bring Yue Jinzhao back.

36
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,600
Got it.

37
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,710
Qingfei.

38
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,680
Qingfei? What's wrong?

39
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,500
It's all my fault.

40
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,100
If I had stopped Young Huan at the time, he wouldn't have...

41
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,700
This has nothing to do with you. It was his fate.

42
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,400
I'll go check on him.

43
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,900
Third Brother, I didn't protect you well.

44
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,600
You've been hurt so badly.

45
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,100
Come here.

46
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,000
Why is our little leader crying?

47
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,300
Don't worry. I'll be fine after some rest.

48
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,900
Really? You're not lying to me?

49
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,300
Of course not. I'm a physician, after all.

50
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,400
Could I not know my own condition?

51
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,700
You must rest well then.

52
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,000
Didn't Eldest Brother confine you as punishment?

53
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,600
Aren't you afraid he'll punish you more heavily for sneaking out?

54
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,400
I just wanted to come and see you.

55
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,900
Ying Xuwei is very bad.

56
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,900
- Third Brother, I'll come see you again. 
 - Run.

57
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,900
Eldest Brother.

58
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,100
Eldest Brother, this confinement is basically a joke.

59
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:49,200
Unexpectedly, Qi's already powerful enough

60
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,400
to break my Resonance Spell.

61
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:59,700
That's good. I can use this time to improve my medical skills.

62
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,000
Third Brother,

63
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,200
do you regret it?

64
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,500
What's there to regret, Eldest Brother?

65
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,500
Didn't we know all this would happen?

66
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:35,000
Things might have taken a different turn, but isn't it still pretty much what we expected?

67
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,600
Third Brother,

68
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,600
I'm sorry.

69
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,600
Eldest Brother, you've done nothing wrong.

70
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,400
If there's any wrong, it's only to yourself.

71
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,340
Some missions...

72
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,600
you shouldn't have to shoulder alone.

73
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,200
Eldest Brother.

74
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:37,300
♫  The meteor streaks through the sky  ♫

75
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,300
♫  Burning what once was  ♫

76
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,400
♫  Forgetting its name  ♫

77
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:53,200
♫  Behind the mask are deep feelings  ♫

78
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,100
♫  Only visible through the eyes  ♫

79
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,200
♫  Who can see them clearly?  ♫

80
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:10,100
♫  I'm destined to brave all the dangers for you  ♫

81
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:18,300
♫  Even if fate cannot be escaped in the end  ♫

82
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:26,200
♫  Staking everything just to feel the resonance of our souls  ♫

83
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:34,000
♫  Leaving love with an unspoken explanation  ♫

84
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,900
Qi... to deal with Zhu Yu,

85
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,700
I need your blood.

86
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,900
Have a good rest.

87
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,000
Jinzhao.

88
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:18,600
♫  I'm destined to brave all the dangers for you  ♫

89
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,400
Jinzhao.

90
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:28,400
♫  Even if fate cannot be escaped in the end  ♫

91
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:36,400
♫  Staking everything just to feel the resonance of our souls  ♫

92
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,600
 The jade pendant on you is quite unique. 

93
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,000
 Jinzhao gave it to me. 

94
00:12:52,400 --> 00:13:00,400
♫  Even if all my efforts go up in smoke  ♫

95
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:08,400
♫  Regardless of everything, I will love you deeply forever  ♫

96
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:17,700
♫  Leave behind evidence that my love existed  ♫

97
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,500
 Come take a look. 

98
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,880
   
   

99
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,500
 Come take a look! 

100
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,000
 - Wait for me.  
 - Uncle Wang.

101
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,400
   

102
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,700
What a peaceful scene.

103
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,700
Such a pity that it'll cease to exist in a moment.

104
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,400
Thanks to you.

105
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,400
You seem reluctant.

106
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,600
- Do you care? 
 - Of course not.

107
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,200
The weather is going to change.

108
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,900
A storm is approaching.

109
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:58,000
Why hasn't my father returned yet? I'll go pick him up.

110
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,100
Why does she look so much like Zhaoyan?

111
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,600
What relative is she?

112
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:24,400
Back then, they sacrificed me here to secure Rehai.

113
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,100
I even walked onto the sacrificial altar with a smile.

114
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:34,000
They exchanged my life for peace for the many.

115
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,200
How grand it was.

116
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,680
 But it was only after my death that I discovered 

117
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,900
 my soul was bound with Rehai to the Luo family. 

118
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:51,600
 Decades later, the Luo family had a pair of twins. 

119
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,200
 My soul then possessed one of them, 

120
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,000
 and the other's life force continuously flowed into me. 

121
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,200
 But we were destined to die young. 

122
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,400
 Since then, I have been reborn time and again as a twin. 

123
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,300
 My immortality and the premature death of generations of Luo twins 

124
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,700
 are the curse for defying heaven. 

125
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,000
As the guardian of Rehai, I've been using it to benefit myself.

126
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,300
Now, I'm resolved to right my wrongs by releasing Rehai.

127
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,900
Master?

128
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,700
Zhaoyan?

129
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,500
Why didn't Ying Xuwei stop her?

130
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,900
Cang Feng, prepare to welcome the Master.

131
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,600
Ensure the Master's safety at all costs.

132
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,100
Yes.

133
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,300
Zhaoyan, you still returned after all.

134
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:16,800
Did you tell the Hengdao Sect about our trip to Mangwan Village?

135
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,800
Why did you do that, Maiming?

136
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,200
Do you still trust me?

137
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,300
Yes.

138
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,100
It's a long story.

139
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,100
I'm not interested in why you cooperate with Bian Luohuan.

140
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,200
You're Zhaoyan's brother. I don't want to give you a hard time.

141
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,600
I just want to understand a few things.

142
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,800
Tell me everything you know.

143
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,400
Young Master Luo.

144
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,200
It seems to be a labyrinth spell.

145
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,900
Maiming, what are you going to do?

146
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,200
I'm going to fulfill my long-cherished wish.

147
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,500
Long-cherished wish? You're going to undo the Bloodbinding of Rehai?

148
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,500
Have you found a way?

149
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,800
Could it be... this is why you've been deceiving me?

150
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,500
I've been trapped here for over 200 years.

151
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,400
I've finally found a way out. How can I let it go by?

152
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,900
 Zhaoyan. 

153
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,800
Maiming!

154
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,000
Maiming!

155
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,100
Is there a way to break this barrier?

156
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,500
Every barrier has its own flaws.

157
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,000
Flaws. Let's find the flaws.

158
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:10,400
Our Luo family is renowned in the Western Regions.

159
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,800
- Even in the Central Plains, we're a prestigious family. 
 - Yes.

160
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,900
This, is all thanks to Master Luo.

161
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,700
He's a good master.

162
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,800
He eradicates bandits, purges evil cults, and guards the peace for the people.

163
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,800
Our family has thus earned its far-reaching reputation. Right?

164
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,600
That's right. Drink up! Come on!

165
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,300
Come on.

166
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,800
Who's that on the tower?

167
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,500
 The weather is really nice today. 

168
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
You just married a local. You might not know.

169
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,400
Only the master has the key to the Octagonal Tower.

170
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,200
And this person is Master Luo Zhaoyan.

171
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,800
If the master has ascended the tower, the ceremony must be starting soon.

172
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,200
Let's go to the bottom of the tower.

173
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,700
- Okay. 
 - Okay, let's go together.

174
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,400
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

175
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,800
 What is this? 

176
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,100
 What's going on? 

177
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,200
 Is the master over there? 

178
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,000
 - Look. 
 - What is it? 

179
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,500
   

180
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,900
Father!

181
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,900
What took you so long? The grand ceremony is about to start.

182
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:32,400
The master has entrusted the business to me. We mustn't let him down.

183
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,000
The past two days, Yinghui Fort hasn't been safe.

184
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,500
After taking care of business affairs I was delayed a bit.

185
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,800
Then, let's go. I'll take it.

186
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,200
Murder!

187
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,500
They're dead! Run!

188
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:48,792
What's going on? What happened?

189
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,000
Luo Zhaoyan used evil magic to kill a lot of people in the village!

190
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,200
You should run, too!

191
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,400
Zh-Zhaoyan?

192
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,600
Father, he wouldn't.

193
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,600
- I'll go and see. 
 - I'll go, too.

194
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,800
No, you stay here. Be good!

195
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,100
Strange.

196
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,500
The power sustaining the barrier is weakening.

197
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,000
Zhaoyan.

198
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,100
Something's wrong.

199
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,600
- What's wrong? 
 - Something's wrong.

200
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,700
This painting...

201
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,000
 I think it's far inferior to that one. 

202
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:52,200
This painting... I gave this to Maiming.

203
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,700
He wouldn't hang it in his room.

204
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,400
There's something wrong with it.

205
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,100
- I'll do it. 
 - Wait.

206
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
The barrier has been broken.

207
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,200
- Are you all right? 
 - I'm fine. Let's look for Maiming.

208
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,200
Just a little longer. Just a little longer.

209
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,600
Maiming...

210
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,900
Maiming.

211
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,800
- How can it be snowing at this time of year? 
 - Maiming!

212
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,500
Maiming!

213
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,600
Be careful. Zhaoyan?

214
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,300
Xian Qing, you stay with Zhaoyan. I'll go look for Luo Maiming.

215
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,900
Master!

216
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,800
Don't come closer!

217
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,700
Zhaoyan?

218
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,200
Are you okay?

219
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,800
That spell is absorbing Zhaoyan's Vitality Energy.

220
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,100
Master.

221
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,400
Zhaoyan... how is she?

222
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Master Luo is still alive.

223
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,000
It's been over 200 years...

224
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,600
200 years.

225
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,300
Here.

226
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,600
The spell... is slowly fading.

227
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,889
Xian Qing.

228
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:02,700
Zhaoyan.

229
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:08,684
Come.

230
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,740
Madman.

231
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,200
Zhaoyan.

232
00:29:58,691 --> 00:30:00,404
Stop!

233
00:30:05,949 --> 00:30:07,199
Move aside.

234
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:11,799
Only the master can go upstairs.

235
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:14,550
Don't you know your master has already gone mad?

236
00:30:15,171 --> 00:30:17,290
I'll go upstairs alone.

237
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:20,856
Let her go.

238
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:16,191
Zhaoyan, I'm finally free,

239
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:21,650
and I've finally destroyed the Luo family.

240
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,290
Yes.

241
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,270
You've done it.

242
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:43,718
You want to kill me?

243
00:31:45,298 --> 00:31:47,737
You killed so many innocent people.

244
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:49,935
You must pay for it.

245
00:31:49,935 --> 00:31:52,160
Innocent?

246
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,130
I was merely taking back everything the Luo family owed me.

247
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:59,570
They were just ordinary people who knew nothing.

248
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,510
So many lives.

249
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:05,170
You must pay for them.

250
00:32:18,131 --> 00:32:20,791
Can you really do it?

251
00:32:21,868 --> 00:32:27,868
♫  One branch, two lifetimes of flowers  ♫

252
00:32:27,868 --> 00:32:33,724
♫  After autumn comes spring, in the end everything falls  ♫

253
00:32:33,724 --> 00:32:38,808
♫  The sun rises, the moon sets  ♫

254
00:32:38,808 --> 00:32:43,692
♫  Can they give you a tender answer?  ♫

255
00:32:43,692 --> 00:32:45,410
Zhaoyan,

256
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,810
compared to you,

257
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:52,050
their lives were nothing.

258
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:56,191
Compared to me?

259
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:02,250
♫  Like silk threads, weaving into mist in the painting  ♫

260
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:06,690
You sacrificed the entire clan for me?

261
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:10,451
I never thought of harming you.

262
00:33:10,451 --> 00:33:14,932
♫  Wishing you a lifetime of annoyance and foolishness  ♫

263
00:33:14,932 --> 00:33:21,204
♫  Exchanging your entire past to bury it in the chaos  ♫

264
00:33:21,204 --> 00:33:27,480
♫  Accompanying you through the ups and downs, 
 following you blindly, enduring it silently  ♫

265
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:33,492
♫  Don't be afraid, don't be afraid  ♫

266
00:33:33,492 --> 00:33:39,608
♫  Writing down each trace, each detail, each word, 
 each line about your struggles  ♫

267
00:33:39,608 --> 00:33:45,912
♫  For you, I'm irrational and foolish  ♫

268
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:52,230
The moment I learned the method to break the binding,

269
00:33:53,871 --> 00:33:57,330
the Luo family was doomed to this end.

270
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,558
You shouldn't have hurt her like this.

271
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:06,498
I shouldn't have.

272
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:13,986
Now that the Bloodbinding is undone, please come with us, Young Master Luo.

273
00:34:13,986 --> 00:34:15,828
Are you coming or not?

274
00:34:15,828 --> 00:34:21,964
♫  Boundless mist and clouds, weaving a scene of falling flowers  ♫

275
00:34:21,964 --> 00:34:27,480
♫  Sending you my promise on my behalf  ♫

276
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:32,892
♫  Letting my worries melt into the color of blood  ♫

277
00:34:32,892 --> 00:34:37,960
♫  Can you hear the hoarse whispers?  ♫

278
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:44,016
♫  Writing down each trace, each detail, each word, 
 each line about your struggles  ♫

279
00:34:44,016 --> 00:34:50,488
♫  For you, I'm irrational and foolish  ♫

280
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,683
I'll chase after them.

281
00:34:57,044 --> 00:35:03,460
♫  Without an answer, without giving up  ♫

282
00:35:05,211 --> 00:35:09,251
Undoing the Bloodbinding requires the blood of your family.

283
00:35:09,251 --> 00:35:13,154
The closer the kinship, the more effective the blood.

284
00:35:13,154 --> 00:35:15,691
If one is unwilling to use the blood of close kin,

285
00:35:15,691 --> 00:35:18,991
they could try with the blood of the entire clan.

286
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:24,170
Sacrificing the clan just for one person.

287
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:29,251
What ruthless affection.

288
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:35,630
Do you know if you forcibly break the spell,

289
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:41,471
you can only live a maximum of three days and will never reincarnate?

290
00:35:47,331 --> 00:35:52,348
It doesn't matter. I've already got what I wanted most.

291
00:35:54,091 --> 00:35:55,960
Madman.

292
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:23,030
