1
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:25,040


2
00:00:27,072 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,756
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

4
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:40,664
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

5
00:00:40,664 --> 00:00:44,732
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

6
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:49,980
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

7
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,524
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

8
00:00:54,524 --> 00:00:56,832
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

9
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,872
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

10
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:01,952
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

11
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:06,428
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:11,396
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

13
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:15,484
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

14
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:16,992
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

15
00:01:16,992 --> 00:01:19,008
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

16
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:21,856
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

17
00:01:21,856 --> 00:01:25,120
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

18
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,428
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

19
00:01:30,428 --> 00:01:38,828
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

20
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,540
   

21
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,992
   

22
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:06,652
Qi.

23
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,552
I hope you'll always be by my side and stay with me forever.

24
00:02:21,372 --> 00:02:25,196
Jinzhao, I will always be with you.

25
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,799
Eldest Brother, am I foolish for not giving up despite knowing

26
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:45,988
how it might end?

27
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,280
Earlier, you were going to interrupt the Resonance Spell between me and Qi,

28
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,280
but you didn't.

29
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:04,839
Thank you for letting me indulge once more.

30
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:09,880
No need to thank me. I just wanted you to see clearly.

31
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,659
Yue Jinzhao is more skilled in the Resonance Spell than you.

32
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,640
Yeah, thirteen years' effort can't compare to three years' effort.

33
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,300
He is extraordinarily gifted.

34
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,419
I should be happy for him, shouldn't I?

35
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:41,068
Eldest Brother, you can't drink alcohol with your condition.

36
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:46,580
Eldest Brother. Here.

37
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,080
Eldest Brother, I will do my best to keep you in a stable condition.

38
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,599
Organ decay is incurable.

39
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,599
How much longer can I last?

40
00:05:10,968 --> 00:05:15,424
No more than a year.

41
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,360
A year is enough.

42
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,980
The Qiyuan Sect has been annihilated.

43
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:28,521
Next, the Sea of Clear Skies must be dealt with within a year.

44
00:05:52,581 --> 00:05:56,061
Miss Yue, you seem to have an exceptionally good appetite today.

45
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,000
I don't know why, but I've been unable to get full lately.

46
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,721
You've never been full before either.

47
00:06:03,721 --> 00:06:06,640
Could it be that you expended too much effort yesterday?

48
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,536
That makes sense.

49
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:14,141
But why did so many soul fish suddenly appear yesterday at their headquarters?

50
00:06:15,821 --> 00:06:18,101
It must be related to Bian Luohuan.

51
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:22,680
You really had a hard time, Young Yue. Come on, eat a lot.

52
00:06:23,704 --> 00:06:25,180
Here.

53
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,981
Thanks. You guys are so kind to me.

54
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,781
Why do they want Miss Yue to absorb so many Qiyuan Orbs?

55
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:38,261
Once at the Fujin Hall, and then again at their headquarters.

56
00:06:38,261 --> 00:06:41,501
Doesn't that mean they already set you up twice?

57
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,561
That's too much.

58
00:06:43,561 --> 00:06:47,920
But every time after I absorbed some Qiyuan Orbs,

59
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,461
I found my strength increased, and...

60
00:06:56,024 --> 00:06:58,112
I can eat even more.

61
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,520
Can't you spit it out at once?

62
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:12,504
Alliance Leader Zuo.

63
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,256
Alliance Leader.

64
00:07:15,821 --> 00:07:20,020
I must apologize to you for what happened today.

65
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,976
It's all right.

66
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,628
I wonder what brings you here.

67
00:07:24,628 --> 00:07:26,661
I have come because of the Hengdao Sect.

68
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:31,400
One of their disciples has confessed they distributed many Qiyuan Orbs to their believers.

69
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,140
The calamity of the Qiyuan Orbs is far from over.

70
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,381
The people can never have peace unless the Hengdao Sect is dealt with.

71
00:07:38,381 --> 00:07:42,640
Yes, the urgent matter now is to locate their whereabouts.

72
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,620
I have come this time to bury the hatchet

73
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,261
and join hands with you against them.

74
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:54,140
Alliance Leader Zuo, don't worry. We are still in pursuit.

75
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,221
If we come across any leads in the future,

76
00:07:56,221 --> 00:07:58,520
we will definitely share them with you.

77
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,560
Thank you very much. I'll take my leave.

78
00:08:05,921 --> 00:08:07,968
I will see Alliance Leader Zuo out.

79
00:08:09,528 --> 00:08:11,081
   

80
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:12,952
Alliance Leader Zuo.

81
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,041
Young Hero Yue.

82
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:20,600
Please select someone else to inherit the Silver Shadow.

83
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:29,100
Do you still remember the extraordinary sight when I gave you the sword?

84
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,900
Actually, it was the sword that chose you.

85
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:56,380
Having lived for decades, I have never misjudged a person.

86
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,096
Jinzhao.

87
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,728
Alliance Leader Zuo is still letting you keep the sword.

88
00:09:12,728 --> 00:09:14,552
Yes.

89
00:09:16,601 --> 00:09:19,032
Since it's been given to you, you must perform well.

90
00:09:19,032 --> 00:09:23,140
Pull yourself together and do not let us down.

91
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,600
Yes, Boss Qi.

92
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:30,720
Qi, there is something I have to tell you.

93
00:09:33,341 --> 00:09:35,401
I witnessed it with my own eyes at their headquarters.

94
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:38,061
Bian Luohuan could cast Mindlink on you.

95
00:09:46,221 --> 00:09:49,900
 Bian Luohuan. He can resonate with Qi. 

96
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,661
And even the runes were the same.

97
00:09:57,941 --> 00:10:01,881
Considering this, if the Hengdao Sect has close ties with us,

98
00:10:01,881 --> 00:10:05,800
I bet they have connections with the Sea of Clear Skies, too.

99
00:10:07,061 --> 00:10:09,236
Jinzhao, once Uncle Gu recovers,

100
00:10:09,236 --> 00:10:12,321
we'll go to the Sea of Clear Skies to make it clear.

101
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,928
All right.

102
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,301
Don't you want to spend your last moments with Young Xiu?

103
00:10:32,241 --> 00:10:38,260
Do you think she doesn't know that I extended your life for half a day?

104
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,861
I've been protecting countless lives,

105
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:43,580
but I'm only afraid of her death.

106
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,940
She is so stubborn.

107
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,360
I'm afraid she might do something stupid.

108
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:53,752
I will take care of her.

109
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,961
I care about her, too.

110
00:10:56,961 --> 00:11:01,800
From now on, I entrust her to you.

111
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:15,300
Xian Qing, you've helped me a lot these years.

112
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,481
Thank you. Take good care of yourself.

113
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:22,781
The world is large.

114
00:11:22,781 --> 00:11:27,060
It's rare to meet someone you like. Don't let her slip by.

115
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,864
You're nagging.

116
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,440
Let's go find Xiu'er.

117
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,820
She didn't come with you.

118
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,380
She must be hiding somewhere again, feeling sad alone.

119
00:11:54,301 --> 00:11:56,248
Follow me.

120
00:12:05,781 --> 00:12:08,721
 Little girl, don't cry. 

121
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:12,700
 I'm not crying. 

122
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,260
 Little girl, where is your home? 

123
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,701
 Why are you here alone? 

124
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:21,700
 I am from the village at the foot of the mountain. 

125
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,580
 The village chief sent me here. 

126
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,820
 He sent me to be the bride of the Mountain God. 

127
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,120
 The Mountain God's bride? 

128
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,101
 The Mountain God is the most powerful in the world. 

129
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:43,020
 It wants a lot of things to eat and many brides. 

130
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,260
 Without food and a bride, 

131
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:50,421
 it will go down the mountain to eat people. 

132
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:58,041
 Offering children to a demon in exchange for peace in the village? 

133
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,621
 How pathetic. 

134
00:13:01,621 --> 00:13:04,761
 I don't want to be the Mountain God's bride. 

135
00:13:04,761 --> 00:13:07,580
 Neither does my mother want this. 

136
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,480
 Little girl, let me take you home. Okay? 

137
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,372
Come.

138
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,721
I finally found you, Xiu'er.

139
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:06,160
I haven't had a good talk with you for a long time.

140
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:13,521
When I adopted you,

141
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:16,020
you would often hide away and cry.

142
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,700
I always had to look for you.

143
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,181
Don't do this anymore.

144
00:14:21,181 --> 00:14:24,321
When you are unhappy, talk to your friends.

145
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:27,441
At least, Xian Qing will be around.

146
00:14:33,441 --> 00:14:35,900
I don't need anyone else.

147
00:14:37,641 --> 00:14:42,221
Master, I only want you.

148
00:14:42,221 --> 00:14:44,516
I don't want anyone else.

149
00:14:49,812 --> 00:14:54,640
Silly, I will definitely die before you.

150
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,761
Do you think your master is an old demon like Xian Qing?

151
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:02,644
No.

152
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,541
In the cycle of life and death, death gives way to life.

153
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:17,881
Without death, how can life be precious?

154
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:33,181
The key rings only recognize one owner.

155
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:36,900
Unless their owners willingly hand them over or pass away,

156
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,341
they will not swap owners.

157
00:15:40,781 --> 00:15:45,580
From now on, I entrust Xian Qing with the role of guardian.

158
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,960
Master, let me succeed you.

159
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,181
Xiu'er.

160
00:15:58,181 --> 00:16:01,641
It is your key ring. I won't give it to anyone else.

161
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,501
Xiu'er, the guardian position is no child's play.

162
00:16:12,421 --> 00:16:15,040
I only hate seeing the future and being unable to change it.

163
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,580
It's not that I think your guardianship is meaningless.

164
00:16:21,221 --> 00:16:26,560
Xiu'er, you once asked me why I came to Jing'an.

165
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:34,140
In Pureness, I saw that the Righteous Martial Alliance would suffer heavy casualties.

166
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:40,360
But this time, they won a great victory.

167
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:48,380
Didn't I always tell you that the future is not unchangeable?

168
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,301
With the chance to foresee the future,

169
00:17:18,301 --> 00:17:22,081
guide it toward the path you hope for

170
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:24,580
to protect those you want to protect.

171
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:31,841
I believe that being the guardian of Pureness is a fortunate thing.

172
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:38,380
Sacrificing one's own happiness for that of others.

173
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,380
How is that fortunate?

174
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,741
Silly, you'll understand in the future.

175
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:05,280
But at this moment, I somewhat hope

176
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,201
that you'll never have to understand.

177
00:18:13,641 --> 00:18:17,081
Do you still remember the day we first met?

178
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,861
You were crying so sadly.

179
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,341
It made my heart ache.

180
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,390
I hoped...

181
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,820
that I wouldn't let you feel that sad again.

182
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,980
Xiu'er,

183
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,300
I'm sorry.

184
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:57,280
I've...

185
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,840
made you sad again.

186
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,792
♫  A preface to the sorrowful wind  ♫

187
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:29,552
♫  Snow falls, parting us  ♫

188
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:35,416
♫  Unable to bear to see your tears flowing  ♫

189
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,016
♫  Piercing deep into my heart, it tears at me  ♫

190
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,536
Master.

191
00:19:46,388 --> 00:19:52,044
♫  The mirror reflects the shadows but remains invisible  ♫

192
00:19:52,044 --> 00:19:58,840
♫  Like those hidden emotions, icy and piercing  ♫

193
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,824
♫  Using the lightest words  ♫

194
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,256
♫  To make the harshest decisions  ♫

195
00:20:03,256 --> 00:20:10,856
♫  No different from a death sentence  ♫

196
00:20:12,328 --> 00:20:18,160
♫  If you truly can bear to leave with the wind  ♫

197
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:23,760
♫  How come tears suddenly shimmer in your eyes?  ♫

198
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,048
♫  What was thought to be evergreen withers between my fingers  ♫

199
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:34,896
♫  Even the embraces feel forced  ♫

200
00:20:34,896 --> 00:20:40,512
♫  If the flowing water and fallen flowers are all fate  ♫

201
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,400
♫  Don't talk about who failed love  ♫

202
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,780
 Master, this time, 

203
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,781
 you won't push me away anymore. 

204
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:58,364
♫  Humming that tune of lovesickness  ♫

205
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:05,696
♫  In the dream,  ♫

206
00:21:06,844 --> 00:21:12,236
♫  Humming that tune of lovesickness  ♫

207
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,780
It's my fault.

208
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,520
It's all my fault.

209
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,480
So it turns out Senior Gu was revived temporarily...

210
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:34,521
through Xian Qing's demonic orb.

211
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,281
It's my fault.

212
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:43,560
It's my fault.

213
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,720
It's all my fault.

214
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,664
Xian Qing.

215
00:22:15,441 --> 00:22:17,436
I'm going out for a walk.

216
00:22:40,321 --> 00:22:42,236
Sister Ming Xiu.

217
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,940
 Each of the Nine Springs has its own power. 

218
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,880
 Maybe there's a way to bring the dead back to life. 

219
00:23:42,241 --> 00:23:46,680
The person is gone. Do not grieve too much.

220
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,421
The person is gone.

221
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,030
No one will invite me...

222
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,500
to play chess together anymore.

223
00:24:16,841 --> 00:24:18,440
Zhaoyan,

224
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,780
did you know?

225
00:24:23,321 --> 00:24:25,400
Over these thousands of years,

226
00:24:26,981 --> 00:24:29,560
I have been watching the joy and sorrow of others...

227
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,861
from afar.

228
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,281
After keeping to myself for so long,

229
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:44,801
even making a few good friends...

230
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,381
feels like a stroke of good fortune.

231
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:11,600
If you want to cry, then cry it out.

232
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,981
Are you saying I want to cry?

233
00:25:27,221 --> 00:25:29,821
Over the years, I have...

234
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,620
It's not good to be stubborn.

235
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,741
That's what you told me.

236
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,641
If the past me saw me now,

237
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,540
I'd probably laugh at myself.

238
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,440
Not at all.

239
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,080
Your tears just now are not ridiculous.

240
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,020
They are very precious.

241
00:26:27,621 --> 00:26:31,741
Sir, what is needed when a family member passes away?

242
00:26:31,741 --> 00:26:33,981
A pair of white candles to light the way ahead.

243
00:26:33,981 --> 00:26:35,960
A set of new clothes to brave the cold.

244
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,220
A stack of paper money to live a good life.

245
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,408
We'll take them all.

246
00:26:40,408 --> 00:26:42,196
All right.

247
00:26:42,981 --> 00:26:45,901
Sir, do these things really work?

248
00:26:45,901 --> 00:26:49,700
Miss, these are the thoughts of the living.

249
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,540
Thoughts?

250
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,420
We get married, raise children, and make friends.

251
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:58,720
Isn't it all to have someone think of us after we die?

252
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,000
Here.

253
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:04,380
Six coins in total.

254
00:27:04,381 --> 00:27:06,260
All right.

255
00:27:09,141 --> 00:27:11,041
Okay, thank you.

256
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:22,160
Jinzhao, so this is how it feels when someone passes away.

257
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,060
It's like a cut in the heart.

258
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:30,420
We cared about Senior Gu, so we feel the pain.

259
00:27:32,341 --> 00:27:36,161
This is the "thoughts" that the stall owner was talking about?

260
00:27:36,161 --> 00:27:38,381
Yes.

261
00:27:38,381 --> 00:27:41,901
Senior Gu saved my life and taught me.

262
00:27:41,901 --> 00:27:45,421
To me, he was like a teacher and a father.

263
00:27:45,421 --> 00:27:47,761
Before he died, he specifically told me

264
00:27:47,761 --> 00:27:50,141
our origins were still not clear,

265
00:27:50,141 --> 00:27:52,720
so we should never let the guilt weigh us down.

266
00:27:53,592 --> 00:27:58,981
Jinzhao, we must not let him down.

267
00:28:01,381 --> 00:28:05,780
Qi, after we're done with his funeral affairs,

268
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,981
let's head to the Sea of Clear Skies.

269
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,376
Let's go.

270
00:28:19,101 --> 00:28:21,016
Sister Ming Xiu.

271
00:28:22,072 --> 00:28:24,728
Sister Ming Xiu? Sister Ming Xiu?

272
00:28:24,728 --> 00:28:25,741
What's the matter?

273
00:28:25,741 --> 00:28:28,641
Sister Ming Xiu and Senior Gu's body have both disappeared.

274
00:28:33,321 --> 00:28:35,480
She must've gone to Mount Yuqing.

275
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,361
Then let's hurry and find her.

276
00:28:37,361 --> 00:28:40,921
Without the Yunlai Stone, getting there would take at least a dozen days.

277
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,801
Shifang, do you have a way?

278
00:28:47,201 --> 00:28:49,520
Our alliance seized a flying ship from the Qiyuan Sect.

279
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,721
I will go get it.

280
00:28:50,721 --> 00:28:54,008
Okay. Qi, notify Xian Qing and Zhaoyan. Let's go.

281
00:28:54,008 --> 00:28:55,664
Let's go.

282
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,008
   

283
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:36,300
Master, the Righteous Martial Alliance wiped out the Qiyuan Sect.

284
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:40,141
And there seems to be a sect behind the Qiyuan Sect called Hengdao.

285
00:29:40,141 --> 00:29:42,680
No one knows where it is.

286
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,320
Zhaoyan has accomplished another great feat.

287
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,121
    
 But she hasn't contacted me yet.

288
00:29:55,321 --> 00:29:58,521
Gu Hanjiang was gravely injured and may not live longer.

289
00:29:59,601 --> 00:30:01,460
Zhaoyan...

290
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,280
must be heartbroken for someone else again.

291
00:30:05,981 --> 00:30:08,060
Bian Luohuan is probably from the Hengdao Sect,

292
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,861
but the sect's location is unknown.

293
00:30:09,861 --> 00:30:11,800
What should we do next?

294
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,641
We must push that person.

295
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,820
Notify the businesses in the Yinghui Fort

296
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:24,420
to auction gemstones from Rehai and create a bidding frenzy.

297
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,128
Yes.

298
00:30:31,381 --> 00:30:34,621
When Rehai emerges,

299
00:30:34,621 --> 00:30:41,560
the interested will act upon hearing the news.

300
00:30:55,961 --> 00:30:57,410
Your Lordship,

301
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,660
Ying Xuwei annihilated the Qiyuan Sect with his own hand.

302
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,961
They've been annihilated?

303
00:31:03,961 --> 00:31:06,660
Then wouldn't there be no supply of the Qiyuan Orbs?

304
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,521
Are there any more clues about Rehai?

305
00:31:11,141 --> 00:31:12,560
Not yet.

306
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,712
I have already dispatched more people,

307
00:31:14,712 --> 00:31:18,440
but there really isn't enough time.

308
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,141
Ying Xuwei annihilated the Qiyuan Sect.

309
00:31:22,141 --> 00:31:25,420
That means he won't supply us with the Qiyuan Orbs.

310
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,352
If that's the case,

311
00:31:28,121 --> 00:31:31,180
Rehai is our only hope.

312
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:41,321
Dispatch more people and search with all effort.

313
00:31:41,321 --> 00:31:43,092
Yes.

314
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,740
Your Lordship, if...

315
00:31:55,141 --> 00:31:56,601
If we can't find Rehai...

316
00:31:56,601 --> 00:31:59,040
We will definitely find it.

317
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,576
We must find it.

318
00:32:21,101 --> 00:32:22,861
Miss Ming is not here.

319
00:32:22,861 --> 00:32:25,121
But Uncle Gu is here.

320
00:32:25,981 --> 00:32:28,200
Since she isn't by his side...

321
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,080
She wouldn't do anything stupid, would she?

322
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,920
These are all records about the Nine Springs.

323
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,401
Is Miss Ming looking for something?

324
00:32:49,752 --> 00:32:51,896
   

325
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,780
I have already succeeded as the guardian.

326
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,421
Why can't I enter the Dragon Pool?

327
00:33:04,241 --> 00:33:06,200
I will do it anyway.

328
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,420
The Nine Springs gather the world's energy.

329
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,540
In Pureness, one can foresee the future.

330
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:48,200
    
 Cold Marrow, Rehai and Chunzi are unknown. And the Dragon Pool...

331
00:33:48,761 --> 00:33:50,900
The Dragon Pool is located in Guixu.

332
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,621
Legend has it that it can bring back the dead.

333
00:33:53,621 --> 00:33:58,261
    
 Does Ming Xiu want to bring Uncle Gu back?

334
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,661
The Nine Springs are interconnected.

335
00:34:02,661 --> 00:34:05,341
Young Xiu has just taken over as the guardian of Pureness.

336
00:34:05,341 --> 00:34:07,381
The Yunlai Stone is back.

337
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,944
Sister Ming Xiu has returned.

338
00:34:22,981 --> 00:34:24,920
You went to Pureness?

339
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,861
Miss Ming, why put yourself through that?

340
00:34:34,861 --> 00:34:38,341
Miss Ming, it's no easy feat to bring the dead back to life.

341
00:34:38,341 --> 00:34:42,600
It seems you can't enter the Dragon Pool from Pureness.

342
00:34:45,141 --> 00:34:47,390
As long as there's a glimmer of chance,

343
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,170
I will try it.

344
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,200
Ming Xiu, you can't even enter Pureness now.

345
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,660
How can you enter the Dragon Pool then?

346
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,381
You just took over as guardian.

347
00:34:58,381 --> 00:34:59,780
You don't know much about what's inside.

348
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:04,100
There's no need to say these words of persuasion anymore.

349
00:35:04,901 --> 00:35:06,040
Young Xiu.

350
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,060
Sister Ming Xiu, we will join you.

351
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,160
Together, we will surely find a way.

352
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,960
Yes.

353
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,021
Perhaps Maiming knows about it.

354
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,821
Rehai is right at our family's place,

355
00:35:30,101 --> 00:35:32,580
and Maiming is its guardian.

356
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:36,080
Sorry for keeping it from you all this time.

357
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,460
But I think Maiming has been a guardian for a longer time.

358
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,741
Perhaps he understands the Nine Springs better than we do.

359
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:45,021
We can go to him for help.

360
00:35:45,021 --> 00:35:49,360
It's late, and Young Xiu has suffered internal injuries.

361
00:35:50,001 --> 00:35:52,420
Let's sleep and set off tomorrow.

362
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,261
Yes, Sister Ming Xiu, have a good rest tonight.

363
00:35:55,261 --> 00:35:58,241
Tomorrow we will accompany you to the Luo residence.

364
00:36:23,761 --> 00:36:26,861
It's late. Why aren't you sleeping yet?

365
00:36:26,861 --> 00:36:29,421
I dreamed of the past.

366
00:36:33,861 --> 00:36:36,160
Do you still remember

367
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,341
the hibiscus tree that was here three years ago?

368
00:36:42,381 --> 00:36:47,861
Yes, that was a well-grown hibiscus tree.

369
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:54,241
I still remember how you loved hibiscus most.

370
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,461
 Three years ago, there was a disturbance in the Spring Vein. 

371
00:37:00,461 --> 00:37:02,601
 Master took me to investigate. 

372
00:37:02,601 --> 00:37:06,300
 At that time, I had reached the age for training, 

373
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,861
 so he asked me to practice on the demon beasts in the den there. 

374
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:15,220
 Master, I will go defeat the demons in that den. 

375
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:18,260
 When I come out, 

376
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:22,840
 could you pin a hibiscus flower in my hair for me? 

377
00:37:27,561 --> 00:37:30,081
 I don't care if you disagree, it's a deal. 

378
00:37:36,341 --> 00:37:39,160
 But when I came out from the den... 

379
00:37:41,901 --> 00:37:43,681
 Master. 

380
00:37:43,681 --> 00:37:48,521
 Master, I have dealt with all the demons inside. 

381
00:37:55,141 --> 00:37:59,680
 Master, the flower I asked for... 

382
00:38:01,701 --> 00:38:05,020
 The flowers here bloom very well, 

383
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,900
 so I couldn't bear to pluck them. 

384
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,400
 I understand, 

385
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,020
 Master. 

386
00:38:26,441 --> 00:38:28,601
After returning from the Spring Vein,

387
00:38:29,901 --> 00:38:33,420
Master sat under the hibiscus tree all night.

388
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,120
When I woke up the next day,

389
00:38:37,861 --> 00:38:40,861
I found he had chopped down the hibiscus tree.

390
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,180
In its place,

391
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,720
there was this cloud pear tree.

392
00:38:49,621 --> 00:38:52,500
The pear signifies parting.

393
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,661
Did something happen when Brother Hanjiang was alone

394
00:38:55,661 --> 00:38:57,941
outside the den?

395
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,680
I don't know.

396
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:07,421
But it was from that day on,

397
00:39:08,421 --> 00:39:14,041
many things seemed to have changed imperceptibly.

398
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,601
Our honored guests have arrived.

399
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:07,990


400
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,976
♫  Looking back upon the past  ♫

401
00:40:18,976 --> 00:40:23,068
♫  Searching for that moment from the past  ♫

402
00:40:23,068 --> 00:40:26,972
♫  Sincerely, I begin to write, our hearts connected  ♫
