 "Miracle" - JS

00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,000
   

21
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,690
   

22
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,100
 Where am I? 

23
00:02:26,234 --> 00:02:28,088
 Where is everyone? 

24
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,700
 After coming back from the Time Rift, I haven't been able to rest well. 

25
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,500
Jinzhao! You finally woke up.

26
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,000
Wait for me. Stay here, don't move.

27
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,300
Jinzhao, I made noodles with eggs for you.

28
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,200
Have some.

29
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,700
 Only when I grow up can I become stronger 

30
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,500
 and protect those I want to protect. 

31
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,400
 Jinzhao, I want to protect you in the future too. 

32
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
How is it?

33
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,400
It's all right.

34
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,400
Just all right?

35
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,900
Actually, you've grasped some essence of the noodles.

36
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,500
I've decided to give our noodles a name!

37
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,300
Let's call it Yue's Egg Noodles!

38
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,000
Sound good?

39
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,200
Jinzhao,

40
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,500
you're terrible at picking names,

41
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,200
just like the noodles you make.

42
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,200
It's been three years already.

43
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,000
In your noodles, there are always just two greens and one egg.

44
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,900
What, what, what?

45
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,200
Have a problem with it?

46
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,800
Yes, I'm telling the absolute truth.

47
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,000
You can't tell the absolute truth, only the partial truth.

48
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,500
Third Brother! Third Brother!

49
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Why are you here?

50
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,300
Third Brother, didn't you promise to make me a grass dragonfly?

51
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,500
When will you do it?

52
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,400
 Why does it feel odd? 

53
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,200
 It feels like I'm living someone else's life. 

54
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,200
 But Qi feels so familiar. 

55
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,800
Third Brother?

56
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,000
Come. I'll make you one.

57
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,200
Why do you always cling to my third brother?

58
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,500
Children should have manners. Call me "sister".

59
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,200
No, I already have a sister.

60
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,500
Really? If you call me sister, I can make noodles for you.

61
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,800
You're so annoying.

62
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,500
Third Brother, have you finished?

63
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,100
Almost.

64
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,500
Done.

65
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,700
Third Brother, is this a dragonfly?

66
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,600
You used to do it so well.

67
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,600
Why is it so ugly now?

68
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,100
That's right.

69
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,500
Your brother has never been good at drawing or braiding straw.

70
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,400
 That's not true. 

71
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,800
I mean, I can draw. But I don't braid things that well.

72
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,300
I made one though, didn't I?

73
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,000
You doubt it? I'll get the ones he made before.

74
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,800
You're good at drawing?

75
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,700
Of course.

76
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,700
Let's go for a walk.

77
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,300
Okay.

78
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Why didn't he wait for me like he used to?

79
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,400
Everyone says that Yujie Hub is my home,

80
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,400
but this place seems so strange to me.

81
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,800
The only familiar thing is you.

82
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,950
Shifang, Xian Qing, Zhaoyan, and Ming Xiu.

83
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,000
These few friends.

84
00:08:23,434 --> 00:08:25,034
Me too.

85
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,500
I don't know why.

86
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,200
After returning from Guixu,

87
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:35,200
I seem to have a new understanding about myself being a weapon.

88
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,900
Everyone has things beyond their control.

89
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,500
I'm not the only one suffering.

90
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,200
If Zhu Yu loses control, the entire realm will be plunged into misery.

91
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,000
I think I'm doing the right thing by stopping her.

92
00:09:31,814 --> 00:09:33,455
Sit.

93
00:09:41,861 --> 00:09:44,301
Let's clear things up first.

94
00:09:44,302 --> 00:09:47,301
First, in the past three years,

95
00:09:47,301 --> 00:09:50,002
Hengdao Sect has been an enemy to me.

96
00:09:50,002 --> 00:09:54,182
If you want me to do something, please clarify it first.

97
00:09:54,182 --> 00:09:57,882
If I agree, I can do it for you.

98
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:16,402
I know you all have deep connections with the Righteous Martial Alliance.

99
00:10:16,402 --> 00:10:19,541
I want you to represent the Hengdao Sect

100
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:23,202
and propose a collaboration with Zuo Guanren.

101
00:10:23,202 --> 00:10:25,581
Together, we can fight against Zhu Yu.

102
00:10:27,702 --> 00:10:29,441
Zhu Yu is in the sky.

103
00:10:29,441 --> 00:10:31,902
What can Zuo Guanren do?

104
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:39,401
I've already given her the fake Rehai key ring.

105
00:10:39,401 --> 00:10:42,162
Zhu Yu has long coveted the power of Rehai.

106
00:10:42,162 --> 00:10:45,062
She will surely bring the Yu Clan to Earth.

107
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:47,302
At that time, the Righteous Martial Alliance will restrain the Yu Clan,

108
00:10:47,302 --> 00:10:49,861
while we unbind Mist Soul and Zhu Yu.

109
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:52,182
Will Zhu Yu buy it?

110
00:10:53,621 --> 00:10:56,021
She doesn't know the key ring is fake.

111
00:10:56,021 --> 00:10:58,082
When she tries to open Rehai,

112
00:10:58,082 --> 00:11:03,962
as long as Luo Zhaoyan can secretly use the real key ring to help her,

113
00:11:03,962 --> 00:11:08,302
she'll absorb the power of Rehai

114
00:11:08,302 --> 00:11:13,541
and provoke Mist Soul to initiate the spell for unbinding.

115
00:11:14,582 --> 00:11:16,781
After Zhu Yu loses the power of Mist Soul,

116
00:11:16,781 --> 00:11:19,702
her transformation will continue and put her in agony.

117
00:11:19,702 --> 00:11:24,202
She'll naturally return to Mist Soul to suppress her transformation.

118
00:11:24,202 --> 00:11:26,901
That's when she'll be at her weakest,

119
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:30,361
and the best time for you two to kill her.

120
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:35,701
At that time, we'll bombard her in Yujie Hub

121
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:39,862
to try to injure her and buy you time.

122
00:11:42,621 --> 00:11:45,661
I mean no disrespect.

123
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:50,082
But your attacks wouldn't leave a scratch on her.

124
00:11:50,082 --> 00:11:52,302
Not necessarily.

125
00:11:52,302 --> 00:11:58,041
If we hit the weakest spot on her scale, it could produce miracles.

126
00:12:02,641 --> 00:12:05,322
So you've planned out everything.

127
00:12:05,322 --> 00:12:10,021
If I can't persuade the Righteous Martial Alliance, none of this matters then.

128
00:12:11,741 --> 00:12:16,882
There have been occurrences of petrification all over the land.

129
00:12:16,882 --> 00:12:19,562
According to Zhu Yu's route,

130
00:12:19,562 --> 00:12:24,840
I speculate that her next destination is Jing'an.

131
00:12:28,621 --> 00:12:30,362
Why didn't you say so sooner?

132
00:12:35,702 --> 00:12:37,781
I understand now.

133
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:39,582
You're only saying it now

134
00:12:39,582 --> 00:12:42,661
because you want the Righteous Martial Alliance to get a taste of Zhu Yu's power

135
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:45,281
and force them to cooperate with you.

136
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:49,042
Is it really that hard to tell people to leave the city and seek refuge?

137
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:51,282
Would it cost you your lives?

138
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,642
How strange.

139
00:13:08,642 --> 00:13:15,282
I always feel that we should be close to him.

140
00:13:15,282 --> 00:13:17,582
Is it an illusion?

141
00:13:24,141 --> 00:13:25,910
It must be.

142
00:13:26,582 --> 00:13:29,582
Qi. Qi?

143
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:32,182
Hey, Jinzhao, what is it?

144
00:13:32,182 --> 00:13:35,022
We're setting off for Jing'an soon. I'll explain it later.

145
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,962
Hurry and call Xian Qing and the others. Quick.

146
00:13:45,261 --> 00:13:49,201
For the Hengdao Sect, life is something that can be measured.

147
00:13:49,201 --> 00:13:50,781
The lives of millions of people

148
00:13:50,781 --> 00:13:54,062
are insignificant compared to the lives of all in the Six Realms.

149
00:13:54,062 --> 00:13:57,641
Let alone it's just the lives of the civilians in Jing'an City.

150
00:13:57,641 --> 00:14:00,202
Hengdao Sect is watching the world from above.

151
00:14:00,202 --> 00:14:02,490
They must feel like gods.

152
00:14:03,201 --> 00:14:06,882
The Hengdao Sect doesn't take people seriously at all.

153
00:14:06,882 --> 00:14:11,801
Not just the Hengdao Sect, Zhu Yu doesn't either.

154
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:14,401
Exactly.

155
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,002
No one should be given up.

156
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:21,102
Every life deserves respect.

157
00:14:21,102 --> 00:14:22,381
Qi is right.

158
00:14:22,381 --> 00:14:27,202
Even the smallest life is unique and has the right to live.

159
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:29,861
Once we arrive in Jing'an,

160
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:32,141
we must ask the Righteous Martial Alliance to convince the residents

161
00:14:32,141 --> 00:14:34,181
to flee as far away as possible.

162
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:41,522
Miss Ming, why don't you and Qi see how far Jing'an is from here?

163
00:14:55,781 --> 00:14:57,661
You deliberately sent them away.

164
00:14:57,661 --> 00:15:00,482
Is there something you wanted to discuss with me?

165
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:06,182
I suspect that Ying Xuwei kept the method to undo the bindings from me.

166
00:15:06,182 --> 00:15:08,202
Why would he?

167
00:15:08,202 --> 00:15:11,261
They say opening Rehai would free Mist Soul.

168
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:16,742
But on that day, Zhu Yu will lead the Yu clan to Earth,

169
00:15:16,742 --> 00:15:19,021
far away from Mist Soul.

170
00:15:19,021 --> 00:15:23,982
How can we be sure Mist Soul will be freed just by absorbing the power of Rehai?

171
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:31,001
Perhaps he kept it from you because he thought you couldn't accept it.

172
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:33,282
So he avoided talking about it.

173
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:38,423
There's only one thing I can't accept.

174
00:15:38,423 --> 00:15:40,462
That is harm to those I care about.

175
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:44,642
Quick, look! There's dark clouds over there!

176
00:15:49,362 --> 00:15:51,322
It's Zhu Yu.

177
00:15:54,822 --> 00:15:58,082
There's no time. We must hurry down there.

178
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,100
   

179
00:16:27,381 --> 00:16:29,062
Careful.

180
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:30,302
Are you okay?

181
00:16:30,302 --> 00:16:31,881
Over here.

182
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,081
Miss Ming!

183
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,501
- What's wrong? 
 - His leg.

184
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,921
Let me do it.

185
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,901
It's fine.

186
00:16:47,942 --> 00:16:49,741
Try to endure it.

187
00:17:24,982 --> 00:17:26,742
- Here. 
 - Here. Have some water.

188
00:17:26,742 --> 00:17:28,562
Have some water.

189
00:17:32,862 --> 00:17:34,582
Thank you.

190
00:17:38,261 --> 00:17:41,721
You haven't rested in a long time. Go rest.

191
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:43,781
I'm fine.

192
00:17:45,061 --> 00:17:49,722
Brother Yue and Miss Yue are having it harder in Jing'an.

193
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:10,602
Jinzhao, I can absorb the Qiyuan Orb.

194
00:18:10,602 --> 00:18:12,522
I want to save them.

195
00:18:14,222 --> 00:18:17,901
I'll help you. Together.

196
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:33,659
♫  I've never dreamed of what the world would look like  ♫

197
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:36,500
♫  The youth grows up, free and unrestrained  ♫

198
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,212
♫  The sky is dressed today, waiting to toast the moon  ♫

199
00:18:39,212 --> 00:18:41,774
♫  Not understanding sorrow and pain  ♫

200
00:18:41,774 --> 00:18:44,508
♫  A long sword cuts through the moonlight  ♫

201
00:18:44,508 --> 00:18:47,712
♫  A pot of wine to become intoxicated  ♫

202
00:18:47,712 --> 00:18:52,402
♫  The righteous vicissitudes of mortal life  ♫

203
00:18:52,402 --> 00:18:55,897
♫  I want to protect the world's light  ♫

204
00:18:55,897 --> 00:18:58,373
♫  You illuminate me and my yearning becomes real  ♫

205
00:18:58,373 --> 00:19:00,944
♫  You illuminate me and my yearning becomes real  ♫

206
00:19:00,944 --> 00:19:03,125
♫  The vicissitudes of life  ♫

207

♫  The world is in turmoil, but it doesn't matter  ♫

00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:30,282

00:19:30,282 --> 00:19:36,227

215
00:19:38,382 --> 00:19:40,182
Your medicine.

216
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,401
Did Jinzhao and Young Yue succeed?

217
00:20:15,501 --> 00:20:17,982
Let's take the people back to Jing'an first,

218
00:20:17,982 --> 00:20:21,061
and then find Young Master Yue and Miss Yue.

219
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,180
   

220
00:20:41,182 --> 00:20:45,062
- Qi. 
 - Young Yue, are you okay?

221
00:20:47,021 --> 00:20:50,222
Jinzhao, I'll stay here to assess the situation.

222
00:20:50,222 --> 00:20:52,624
You all go to the Righteous Martial Alliance.

223
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,081
Okay.

224
00:20:58,301 --> 00:21:01,681
Miss Yue, let's go together.

225
00:21:03,422 --> 00:21:08,018
   

226
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,322
Leader.

227
00:21:15,322 --> 00:21:16,541
What is it?

228
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:21,222
Quite a few members of the alliance are also wearing Qiyuan Orbs.

229
00:21:34,261 --> 00:21:35,702
Lingyun!

230
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,622
- Leader. 
 - Leader Zuo.

231
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:43,242
Leader Zuo.

232
00:21:44,821 --> 00:21:48,601
Hero Yue, Jing'an City has suffered a great calamity.

233
00:21:48,601 --> 00:21:51,401
I must deal with it first.

234
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:53,382
You all can do as you wish.

235
00:21:53,382 --> 00:21:55,062
Come.

236
00:21:57,341 --> 00:21:59,240
Let's go to Mechanic Skill Hall.

237
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,880
Okay.

238
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:06,602
Why are there victims of the Qiyuan Orbs in the alliance?

239
00:22:06,602 --> 00:22:08,901
- Find out. 
 - Yes.

240
00:22:11,821 --> 00:22:13,382
In more than two hundred years,

241
00:22:13,382 --> 00:22:15,842
Rehai, which should've moved in a defined trajectory,

242
00:22:15,842 --> 00:22:18,061
was bound to my family by Maiming.

243
00:22:18,061 --> 00:22:20,001
Now, the Bloodbinding has been lifted.

244
00:22:20,001 --> 00:22:22,621
Naturally, it has returned to its course.

245
00:22:27,021 --> 00:22:30,042
This is a map of the Luo family. Look.

246
00:22:32,982 --> 00:22:36,641
If we connect these places...

247
00:22:37,501 --> 00:22:40,142
This is the moving trajectory of Rehai.

248
00:22:41,101 --> 00:22:43,142
Rehai is the force of life.

249
00:22:43,142 --> 00:22:47,541
Wherever it's been, an oasis will form over a long period.

250
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:49,702
Even today, in places like Buried Wind Plains,

251
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,681
one can still see traces of its former lushness.

252
00:22:53,662 --> 00:22:55,581
The Yu Clan lived underwater.

253
00:22:55,581 --> 00:22:57,781
They aren't suited to move well in arid places.

254
00:22:57,781 --> 00:23:01,562
Zhu Yu certainly won't try to absorb Rehai in the desert.

255
00:23:01,562 --> 00:23:05,222
A few days ago, Rehai began to move from my family's domain.

256
00:23:05,222 --> 00:23:08,101
A few days ago, Zhu Yu obtained the Rehai key ring.

257
00:23:08,101 --> 00:23:09,682
Then...

258
00:23:13,862 --> 00:23:17,101
If Zhu Yu is to absorb the power of Rehai,

259
00:23:17,101 --> 00:23:20,842
the next suitable location would be the Buried Wind Plains.

260
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:26,781
The premise is they already know the trajectory of Rehai.

261
00:23:28,581 --> 00:23:31,581
Perhaps Maiming had already informed Zhu Yu.

262
00:23:31,581 --> 00:23:33,702
When Maiming lifted the Bloodbinding of Rehai,

263
00:23:33,702 --> 00:23:35,942
both General Ge and Miss Shuo Xuan were present.

264
00:23:35,942 --> 00:23:38,142
So they've been in touch for a while.

265
00:23:38,142 --> 00:23:41,182
And Ying Xuwei not only knew I had the real key ring,

266
00:23:41,182 --> 00:23:43,422
he also prepared a fake one in advance.

267
00:23:44,061 --> 00:23:48,382
Could the Hengdao Sect have already joined hands with Maiming to scheme against Zhu Yu?

268
00:23:50,982 --> 00:23:52,702
Exactly.

269
00:23:52,702 --> 00:23:54,142
If that's the case, a lot of things can be explained.

270
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:56,622
If that's the case, a lot of things can be explained.

271
00:23:56,622 --> 00:23:59,942
They handed the fake key ring to Zhu Yu

272
00:23:59,942 --> 00:24:03,101
to trick her and for the Yu Clan to come down to earth.

273
00:24:03,101 --> 00:24:06,082
They will then use the Righteous Martial Alliance to stall the Yu Clan

274
00:24:06,082 --> 00:24:10,042
while unbinding Mist Soul to weaken Zhu Yu.

275
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:15,102
After that, the Hengdao Sect will confront the remaining Yu Clan.

276
00:24:15,102 --> 00:24:19,282
Then use Young Jinzhao or Young Yue to deliver the final blow.

277
00:24:21,261 --> 00:24:23,622
Now the biggest issue is

278
00:24:23,622 --> 00:24:27,901
how to deliver the unbinding to the Mist Soul inside Kun.

279
00:24:28,982 --> 00:24:32,522
Young Jinzhao and I have already discussed this matter.

280
00:24:32,522 --> 00:24:36,362
The Hengdao Sect may achieve their goal by sacrificing us.

281
00:24:36,362 --> 00:24:39,881
So, Zhaoyan, no matter what, you must be careful.

282
00:24:39,881 --> 00:24:41,261
Okay.

283
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:07,020
   

284
00:25:23,602 --> 00:25:28,322
 Because of Zhu Yu, Jing'an became like this. 

285
00:25:35,122 --> 00:25:37,222
Wake up.

286
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,860
   

287
00:25:45,301 --> 00:25:47,061
Honey.

288
00:25:48,061 --> 00:25:49,782
Father!

289
00:25:50,381 --> 00:25:52,201
Father.

290
00:25:53,581 --> 00:25:55,361
Father.

291
00:25:59,781 --> 00:26:02,422
Wake up, honey.

292
00:26:05,942 --> 00:26:07,741
Madam Ji.

293
00:26:07,741 --> 00:26:09,941
Uncle Ji.

294
00:26:14,662 --> 00:26:16,801
Madam Ji.

295
00:26:16,801 --> 00:26:18,821
Miss.

296
00:26:21,882 --> 00:26:23,782
I never thought...

297
00:26:24,715 --> 00:26:29,460
that the last words I said to him was to scold him...

298
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:33,781
for buying such expensive things for the child.

299
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:42,262
Calm down, Madam.

300
00:26:42,262 --> 00:26:45,141
Your child is very unstable now.

301
00:26:52,781 --> 00:26:55,522
They're all such good people.

302
00:26:55,522 --> 00:26:57,401
It's all my fault.

303
00:26:57,401 --> 00:27:00,182
If I had come earlier, Uncle Ji wouldn't have...

304
00:27:00,182 --> 00:27:02,022
This isn't your fault.

305
00:27:03,101 --> 00:27:07,181
Moreover, you've already done your best.

306
00:27:08,942 --> 00:27:12,322
Madam, are you better now?

307
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:16,262
Thank you both.

308
00:27:17,222 --> 00:27:19,382
If it weren't for you two,

309
00:27:19,382 --> 00:27:20,902
I fear this child...

310
00:27:20,902 --> 00:27:22,882
Don't say that, Madam Ji.

311
00:27:22,882 --> 00:27:27,142
The child will grow up safe and sound, and live a long life.

312
00:27:29,101 --> 00:27:31,481
Madam Ji, why don't you come with us?

313
00:27:31,481 --> 00:27:33,522
We'll take care of you.

314
00:27:37,101 --> 00:27:39,662
We must keep the family business going.

315
00:27:40,622 --> 00:27:43,741
Even if the heavens don't want us to live,

316
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:49,481
the child and I will fight to survive no matter what.

317
00:27:50,982 --> 00:27:56,121
And carry on his father's legacy.

318
00:28:10,781 --> 00:28:13,862
 Zhu Yu, do you see this? 

319
00:28:13,862 --> 00:28:17,422
 You see them as insignificant, 

320
00:28:17,422 --> 00:28:21,182
 but even when their homes are destroyed and loved ones gone, 

321
00:28:21,182 --> 00:28:23,902
 they still strive to live. 

322
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:43,961
Grandpa!

323
00:28:44,741 --> 00:28:46,422
Sister Ming Xiu.

324
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:49,382
She's so sad.

325
00:28:50,902 --> 00:28:52,142
It's only after crying,

326
00:28:52,142 --> 00:28:54,462
does one have the strength to carry on.

327
00:28:54,462 --> 00:28:57,621
Sister Ming Xiu, let's help them.

328
00:28:58,781 --> 00:29:01,101
So many are suffering this time.

329
00:29:01,842 --> 00:29:03,541
How do we help them all?

330
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:06,041
Grandpa!

331
00:29:07,042 --> 00:29:11,162
Some mountains are hard to climb

332
00:29:11,162 --> 00:29:15,162
because the person you value is your mountain.

333
00:29:15,162 --> 00:29:17,561
But for that person,

334
00:29:17,561 --> 00:29:20,601
even if we get injured all over,

335
00:29:20,601 --> 00:29:24,822
we must still climb over that mountain.

336
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:30,842
Sister Ming Xiu, I understand.

337
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:38,201
Let's return to the Righteous Marital Alliance, then.

338
00:29:38,201 --> 00:29:40,722
I have many things to do still.

339
00:29:41,802 --> 00:29:43,441
Okay.

340
00:29:52,861 --> 00:29:56,882
 The Cold Marrow Sentry once prophesied, among the six of you, 

341
00:29:56,882 --> 00:30:00,201
 two will soon pass away. 

342
00:30:01,581 --> 00:30:03,421
 I remember. 

343
00:30:03,421 --> 00:30:05,842
 In the near future, 

344
00:30:05,842 --> 00:30:09,941
 your life will come to an end. 

345
00:30:12,942 --> 00:30:15,101
Even without me around,

346
00:30:16,222 --> 00:30:18,262
Qi will be okay. Right?

347
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:39,482
I never imagined that the people of Jing'an City would suffer such heavy casualties.

348
00:30:39,482 --> 00:30:41,741
Such a massive beast.

349
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:43,781
In her eyes,

350
00:30:43,781 --> 00:30:48,401
those who lost their lives must be no different than ants.

351
00:30:48,401 --> 00:30:49,541
Leader.

352
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:50,961
No matter what she is

353
00:30:50,961 --> 00:30:52,603
or how she sees us,

354
00:30:52,603 --> 00:30:54,562
she has harmed my kin.

355
00:30:55,462 --> 00:30:57,921
We can't just sit by and await death.

356
00:31:01,341 --> 00:31:03,021
Shifang,

357
00:31:03,021 --> 00:31:05,101
according to what you just said,

358
00:31:05,101 --> 00:31:10,402
the Hengdao Sect manipulated the Qiyuan Sect in order to restrain the Kun?

359
00:31:12,942 --> 00:31:16,382
Regardless of whether the Hengdao Sect is evil or not,

360
00:31:16,382 --> 00:31:21,101
they hardly stand a chance against the Kun.

361
00:31:21,101 --> 00:31:22,681
Leader.

362
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,447
Leader.

363
00:31:29,447 --> 00:31:31,261
Chen Qianjun.

364
00:31:31,261 --> 00:31:36,082
Members of the alliance said it was you who spread the Qiyuan Orbs.

365
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:38,401
Yes.

366
00:31:39,422 --> 00:31:42,301
Why did you harm your own brothers?

367
00:31:42,301 --> 00:31:44,341
Are you from the Qiyuan Sect, too?!

368
00:31:44,341 --> 00:31:46,161
I'm not!

369
00:31:47,142 --> 00:31:48,921
Earlier...

370
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:52,861
Old Xu and I lost in a contest to Yue Jinzhao and Ju Shifang.

371
00:31:52,861 --> 00:31:56,741
I couldn't accept it and wanted to regain face.

372
00:31:56,741 --> 00:32:00,341
Later, when attacking Langyin Pavilion, I took some orbs.

373
00:32:00,341 --> 00:32:04,682
When wearing the orb, I felt that my training progressed faster.

374
00:32:04,682 --> 00:32:08,422
So... I shared the orbs with the brothers.

375
00:32:08,422 --> 00:32:10,521
You fool!

376
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,482
Jinzhao, are you waiting for us?

377
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:24,102
I thought you would be back soon.

378
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,420
I'll head back first.

379
00:32:34,282 --> 00:32:35,860
What's wrong, Qi?

380
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,941
Jinzhao, Uncle Ji died.

381
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,020
The common folk are all innocent.

382
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,760
We must think of something.

383
00:32:54,061 --> 00:32:55,801
We will.

384
00:33:03,242 --> 00:33:07,440
Only when we attacked the Qiyuan Sect, did I realize that they were bad.

385
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,323
I wanted to take it off, but it had grown into the flesh.

386
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,254
I also asked doctors before.

387
00:33:13,254 --> 00:33:17,980
But the doctors all said that it was now connected to the heart and couldn't be removed.

388
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:26,500
Did you two also wear the Qiyuan Orbs?

389
00:33:27,382 --> 00:33:29,581
Fools!

390
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:31,781
Fine.

391
00:33:31,781 --> 00:33:33,182
Fine!

392
00:33:33,182 --> 00:33:34,422
Leader.

393
00:33:34,422 --> 00:33:37,682
Just now, they weren't in Jing'an and avoided this calamity.

394
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:42,401
Besides them, some people wearing the orbs were also out on missions.

395
00:33:42,401 --> 00:33:44,182
Chen Qianjun is guilty.

396
00:33:44,182 --> 00:33:47,902
But first, we must find a way to remove the orbs and save them.

397
00:33:48,501 --> 00:33:50,382
Let me try.

398
00:33:54,541 --> 00:33:56,061
Miss Yue?

399
00:33:56,061 --> 00:33:57,301
Leader,

400
00:33:57,301 --> 00:34:01,182
when attacking Qiyuan Sect's headquarters, Young Yue also saved their disciples.

401
00:34:01,182 --> 00:34:02,781
Just now, she saved many of the people as well.

402
00:34:02,781 --> 00:34:04,862
Let her try.

403
00:34:50,441 --> 00:34:52,661
Miss Yue.

404
00:34:52,661 --> 00:34:55,481
If the orb has been fused with the body for a long time,

405
00:34:55,481 --> 00:34:58,882
forcibly removing it will cost one's life.

406
00:35:06,882 --> 00:35:11,282
Regardless, thank you for saving my two brothers

407
00:35:11,282 --> 00:35:13,582
and lessening my sins.

408
00:35:13,582 --> 00:35:15,102
Sorry for my offense earlier.

409
00:35:15,102 --> 00:35:16,762
I apologize.

410
00:35:16,762 --> 00:35:18,501
It's all right.

411
00:35:20,782 --> 00:35:22,742
Leader Zuo.

412
00:35:22,742 --> 00:35:25,282
I represent the Hengdao Sect and have come to negotiate with you,

413
00:35:25,282 --> 00:35:28,101
in hopes that we can join forces against Zhu Yu.

414
00:35:29,701 --> 00:35:31,862
You represent the Hengdao Sect?

415
00:35:31,862 --> 00:35:34,501
What is your relationship with them?

416
00:35:36,661 --> 00:35:38,442
I am...

417
00:35:39,501 --> 00:35:42,142
one of the leaders of the Hengdao Sect.

418
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:56,010


419
00:36:04,938 --> 00:36:06,236
♫  Twinkling stars, dotting the surface of the lake  ♫

420
00:36:06,236 --> 00:36:09,130
♫  Twinkling stars, dotting the surface of the lake  ♫

421
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,436
♫  The bright moonlight illuminates your tender eyes  ♫

422

423
00:36:13,134 --> 00:36:15,642
♫  Hearing the gentle heartbeat by my ear  ♫

424
00:36:15,642 --> 00:36:20,247
♫  I make a promise deep in my heart  ♫

425
00:36:21,335 --> 00:36:22,583

♫  The wind kisses us, wrapping around us continuously  ♫

482
00:39:01,999 --> 00:39:06,271
♫  And you embrace me in your dreams  ♫

483
00:39:06,271 --> 00:39:09,075
♫  How I wish to be with you  ♫

484
00:39:09,075 --> 00:39:11,275
♫  Inviting a spring breeze to become an eternal vow  ♫

485
00:39:11,275 --> 00:39:13,175
♫  Inviting a spring breeze to become an eternal vow  ♫

486
00:39:13,175 --> 00:39:16,183
♫  I really wish the wind could hear our loyalty, desire and love for each other  ♫

487
00:39:16,183 --> 00:39:19,191
♫  I really wish the wind could hear our loyalty, desire and love for each other  ♫

488
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:20,791
♫  It's the wish, the only wish for this lifetime  ♫

489
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:26,023
♫  It's the wish, the only wish for this lifetime  ♫
