00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:23,000

00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Miracle - JS 

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,300
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past 

4
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,800
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

5
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:40,800
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,800
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,000
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,600
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

9
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,800
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,000
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,400
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,400
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

14
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,500
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

15
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,800
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

16
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,200
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,500
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

18
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:38,500
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,400
   

20
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,000
   

21
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,100
I thought there were precious items inside.

22
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,500
It turned out to be just some ordinary valuables.

23
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,200
Those people from the Qiyuan Sect have looted so many valuables.

24
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,300
There must be a lot of victims.

25
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,100
What is this stone for?

26
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,600
 Master Luo. Heroes. 

27
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,900
Heroes? Is that referring to us?

28
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,600
What is it, everyone?

29
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,400
Heroes, we'll never forget that you saved us.

30
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,000
If there's anything I can help with, I'll spare no effort.

31
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,600
It's okay, please get up.

32
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,700
It is our duty.

33
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,300
 So this is what it feels like to be a hero. 

34
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,300
Everyone, are you leaving now?

35
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,300
We've been missing for days. Our families must be extremely worried.

36
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,300
Since we were saved by you, luckily,

37
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,400
it's time for us to go home.

38
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,500
But you all were kidnapped and brought here.

39
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,400
You should have no money left.

40
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,300
We will figure it out on the way.

41
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,100
Even if we have to drink from rivers and eat wild vegetables,

42
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,100
we will still make it home.

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,359
Whatever you say, Young Zhaoyan.

44
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,400
Everyone, we found some of the Qiyuan Sect's loot.

45
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,000
Take some as travel expenses. I'll make up for it later.

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,200
Thank you.

47
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,700
- Thank you, hero. 
  - Thank you so much, hero. 

48
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,400
Let's go.

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,300
This pearl is beautiful.

50
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,700
Yu Xiang will definitely like it.

51
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,800
 - Thank you, heroes. 
 - Thank you. 

52
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,500
Many thanks.

53
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,400
You truly exemplify traits of the Master of the Luo Family, Young Zhaoyan.

54
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,400
You flatter me, Senior.

55
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,000
It's the first time I've heard Senior Uncle praise people.

56
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,300
Interesting.

57
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,900
Yue Qi is suspected to be Lord Ming.

58
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,300
And before it's resolved, we suspect Bian Luohuan to be Shengxuan.

59
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,600
Maiming, do you think he is the mastermind of the Qiyuan Sect?

60
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Just invite them as guests of the Luo family.

61
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,500
We'll investigate it further then.

62
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,100
 Okay. 

63
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,200
Cang Feng.

64
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,400
I have a premonition.

65
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,000
Physician Bian will surprise me.

66
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,740
You had a tough time. Right?

67
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,599
Next time, don't do such foolish things.

68
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,680
Whether it's for me...

69
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,600
or for him.

70
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,599
Qi.

71
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,160
I once swore not to use this spell.

72
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:06,032
But you're severely poisoned. I have to use it.

73
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,300
♫  Behind the mask are deep feelings  ♫

74
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,200
♫  Only visible through the eyes  ♫

75
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,500
♫  Who can see them clearly?  ♫

76
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:33,200
♫  I'm destined to brave all the dangers for you  ♫

77
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:41,400
♫  Even if fate cannot be escaped in the end  ♫

78
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:49,400
♫  Staking everything just to feel the resonance of our souls  ♫

79
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:57,400
♫  Leaving love with an unspoken explanation  ♫

80
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:05,300
♫  I'm destined to brave all the dangers for you  ♫

81
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,440
Qi.

82
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:21,800
♫  Staking everything just to feel the resonance of our souls  ♫

83
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,880
 It's all right now. 

84
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,800
 I may not be able to protect you for a lifetime, 

85
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,199
 but as long as I am here, 

86
00:08:33,199 --> 00:08:35,479
 I will keep you safe. 

87
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,000
 Even if I receive the chastisement by the Chastisement Stone, 

88
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,300
 I will not hesitate. 

89
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:53,400
♫  Regardless of everything, I will love you deeply forever  ♫

90
00:08:53,400 --> 00:09:02,800
♫  Leave behind evidence that my love existed  ♫

91
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,800
 I wonder what the Mortal Realm is like. 

92
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,800
 Is the sky there also blue? 

93
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,800
 Are the clouds there also white? 

94
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,000
 How do butterflies there fly? 

95
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,600
 Master. 

96
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:34,644
 How is it? 

97
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,600
 Take a look at the bottom. 

98
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,800
 Butterflies. 

99
00:09:56,548 --> 00:10:00,244
   

100
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,800
Why is the Chastisement Stone lit up?

101
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:11,000
    
 Did Young Huan use the Resonance Spell on Qi?

102
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,000
 Young Huan, the Chastisement Stone is lit. 

103
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,800
 Are you okay? 

104
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,400
Second Sister, I'm fine.

105
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,200
Your voice is hoarse, how can you be fine?

106
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,600
Why did you use the Resonance Spell on Qi?

107
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Qi was poisoned.

108
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,000
 I had to use it to save her. 

109
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,900
Young Huan, have you lost your mind?

110
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:07,900
 Three years ago, to get permission to monitor Qi and Yue Jinzhao, you swore an oath. 

111
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,290
If you violate it, you will be chastised.

112
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,800
Of course, I remember it. But I am her master.

113
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,700
Even if she doesn't remember me,

114
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,100
 I can't just watch her suffer. 

115
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,900
When you used the Resonance Spell, did anyone see you?

116
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:32,300
No. Rest assured, I won't expose myself.

117
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,300
Young Huan, the matter regarding Qi and Yue Jinzhao must not be mishandled.

118
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,000
Second Sister,

119
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,900
I know my mission and duty.

120
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,600
 I won't affect our plan. 

121
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,250
 I have a plan... 

122
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,300
to enter the Luo family

123
00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:00,100
and investigate the relationship between the Luo family and Rehai.

124
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,300
You found Rehai?

125
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,900
 Yes. 

126
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,200
   

127
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,000
- Second Sister. 
 - Xiaoyuan.

128
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,600
Second Sister, when will Third Brother come back?

129
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,700
Be good, Xiaoyuan.

130
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,600
As long as you behave, he will return soon.

131
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,700
When he comes back,

132
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,100
I'll have him make me another hundred straw butterflies. 
    

133
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,100
I have something to discuss with our eldest brother.

134
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,600
Go play by yourself.

135
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,200
You're leaving me alone again.

136
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,500
Eldest Brother.

137
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,100
Young Huan has learned of Rehai's whereabouts by chance.

138
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,100
He plans to go to the Luo family in the Western Region.

139
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,500
Good. Keep in touch.

140
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,600
Understood.

141
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,788
Anything else?

142
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,700
Take care.

143
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,100
   

144
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,800
Judging from her pulse, the signs of poisoning are gone.

145
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,900
Young Jinzhao,

146
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,700
did anything happen just now in Young Yue's room?

147
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,300
I suddenly felt sleepy and dozed off.

148
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,400
It seems Young Jinzhao has also been affected.

149
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,600
If that's the case, it's not strange

150
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,700
that Bian Luohuan has an antidote that could save Miss Yue.

151
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,200
What's strange is...

152
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,400
Why do the people from Qiyuan Sect

153
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,600
take the risk of exposure to save Young Yue?

154
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:45,200
Could it be that Physician Bian knows Young Yue?

155
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,500
Did I say something wrong?

156
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,300
You're not wrong.

157
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,200
The people from Qiyuan Sect referred to Qi as Lord Ming.

158
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,800
Bian Luohuan is suspected to be the sect leader or Shengxuan.

159
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,000
Bian Luohuan took the risk to save Qi.

160
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,300
The two of them...

161
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,900
Lord Ming?

162
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,500
It seems that a lot has happened before we met.

163
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,900
Yes.

164
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:19,359
Someone deliberately led us to the Qiyuan Sect's stronghold at Fujin Hall.

165
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:21,999
Qi absorbed the Qiyuan Orb

166
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,900
and was seen as Lord Ming by the Qiyuan Sect.

167
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,400
We are also baffled by that.

168
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,800
Everyone, Qi and I have unclear backgrounds

169
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,200
and strange things keep happening.

170
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,700
Over the last three years, we've been looking for our roots.

171
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,600
If you have any clue, please be sure to tell us.

172
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,200
Even if it does relate to the Qiyuan Sect.

173
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,800
Of course. We are all friends.

174
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,000
Everyone has their secrets.

175
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,700
As long as we have no malice, we are friends.

176
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,500
Jinzhao, we trust you.

177
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,800
Why not bring Physician Bian to the Luo family

178
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,400
and see if Maiming can get anything from him?

179
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,200
That's right.

180
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,900
Bian Luohuan is very likely to be working for the Qiyuan Sect.

181
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,400
Let's set a trap for him.

182
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,200
I'll go and invite him.

183
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,600
Let's rest here tomorrow and set off the day after.

184
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,100
Okay.

185
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,679
Physician Bian.

186
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,100
 May I come in? 

187
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,000
Come in.

188
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,400
Physician Bian.

189
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,700
Thanks to you, Miss Yue is recovering.

190
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,200
We plan to set off the day after tomorrow.

191
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
We brought you a lot of trouble lately,

192
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,800
so I specially come to invite you to visit our Luo family.

193
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,800
It's no trouble. I haven't been of much help.

194
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,600
I've only done my duty.

195
00:17:18,239 --> 00:17:22,400
It's just a visit. Please don't decline, Physician Bian.

196
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,840
Then I shall humbly comply.

197
00:17:31,479 --> 00:17:33,439
I'll take my leave now.

198
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,400
Qi, you're awake.

199
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,100
How are you feeling?

200
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,280
I want water.

201
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,200
Okay, here.

202
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,640
So? Do you feel uncomfortable?

203
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,000
Silly girl.

204
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,300
In the secret chamber, you could've just dodged that arrow yourself.

205
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,700
Why did you protect Bian Luohuan?

206
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,300
I don't know.

207
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:44,700
I just felt that he's someone important like you.

208
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,100
And I can't let him get hurt.

209
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,700
He's nothing like me. I am the only one.

210
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,000
You can't compare him to me. Do you hear me?

211
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,200
Look. Just look at yourself.

212
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,600
He's fine. But you have to suffer.

213
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,000
If I hadn't saved Physician Bian, he would've died. Right?

214
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,300
I don't understand why humans fear death,

215
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:17,500
but you said life is very precious. A man has only one life.

216
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,800
Just like Zhaoyan said today,

217
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,000
even the life of an enemy should not be taken lightly.

218
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,679
You wouldn't have said this before.

219
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,448
You are right.

220
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,919
But Zhaoyan is always right.

221
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,480
Yes, Zhaoyan is right.

222
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,519
So you won't listen to me anymore. Right?

223
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,700
Jinzhao,

224
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,800
I just dreamed about you.

225
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,400
Me?

226
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:06,000
I dreamed that you gave me beautiful butterflies.

227
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,100
I gave you butterflies?

228
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,700
Yes, in my dream.

229
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,900
I only saw half of your face, but I still recognized you.

230
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,400
 Take a look at the bottom. 

231
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:28,000
You gave me glowing butterflies that could fly.

232
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 You put them at the bottom of the food box 

233
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 and waited for me to open it. 

234
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,500
How do you make a butterfly?

235
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,200
This is no work for a man.

236
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,300
Jinzhao, I finally found you.

237
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,100
Look. This is my latest invention.

238
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,000
This elbow can even move.

239
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
- Look, it can move when turned. 
 - Shifang, I'm not free today.

240
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,300
I'm thinking. Show it to me tomorrow.

241
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
What are you thinking about?

242
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,500
Tell me. I might be able to give you some advice.

243
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,000
Here is the thing.

244
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,100
Well,

245
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:55,600
I have a friend who may perhaps possibly

246
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,100
have a girl in his heart.

247
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,900
Do you understand?

248
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,400
I... do.

249
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,200
You're talking about Zhaoyan. Right?

250
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,900
What?

251
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,200
Zhaoyan.

252
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,300
A friend who has a girl in his heart.

253
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,400
- That's Zhaoyan, isn't it? 
 - What?

254
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,300
Look. Your friend must be one of us.

255
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:28,600
Who said I only have you guys as friends?

256
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,800
Then I can also say you have Shuo Xuan in your heart.

257
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,700
I...

258
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,200
- Jinzhao, don't talk nonsense. 
 - Right.

259
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,500
- Then it's... 
 - Jinzhao, Shifang.

260
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,060
Brother Luo.

261
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,600
Here you are.

262
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,800
Brother Luo, you came at the right time. We were just talking about you.

263
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,200
What talking about?

264
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,000
We are talking about a girl.

265
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,630
She told my friend that she dreamed of me...

266
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,600
my friend giving her butterflies.

267
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,100
Really?

268
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,000
Were we talking about this?

269
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,040
What do you think that means?

270
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,500
I know now.

271
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:20,300
It means your friend is a butterfly.

272
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,300
Nonsense.

273
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,700
I think she might be hinting at you...

274
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:32,200
your friend about her expectations.

275
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,675
Expectations?

276
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,400
That's right. Expectations.

277
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,800
You are truly the master of the Luo family.

278
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,000
Not only knowledgeable, but also knows girls well.

279
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,300
Brilliant.

280
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:55,000
Shifang, I remember you have a box that can be opened through a mechanism.

281
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,700
Is it still there?

282
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,400
You mean the box that can be remotely controlled to open.

283
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,400
Right! Can I borrow it?

284
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
You want to use my gadget?

285
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,700
- Can I? 
 - Of course, you can.

286
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,100
Jinzhao, I've been dreaming that one day you'll use my gadget.

287
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,800
- Jinzhao, wait here. I'll go get it. 
 - Okay.

288
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,200
Wait here for me.

289
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,100
I'll wait.

290
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,000
Expectations of me.

291
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,100
You want to borrow Shifang's gadget to give Miss Yue a surprise?

292
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,900
How do you know?

293
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,800
Jinzhao, where are you taking me?

294
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,400
Here we are.

295
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,000
Okay! Three, two, one.

296
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,300
It's so beautiful!

297
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,500
Jinzhao, how did you find this place?

298
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,000
How did you find it?

299
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,300
I just found it just by looking for it.

300
00:25:42,156 --> 00:25:44,716
Why is there no fragrance?

301
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,100
Butterflies!

302
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,800
Butterflies!

303
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,900
So many butterflies!

304
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,100
Jinzhao, look. A butterfly.

305
00:26:43,915 --> 00:26:47,315
You are so bad. You blew away my butterfly!

306
00:27:21,675 --> 00:27:23,116
Jinzhao.

307
00:27:23,116 --> 00:27:28,195
Isn't that the North Star you talked about that can be used for navigation?

308
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,600
It's that one. You can't even find the right star.

309
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,700
What if you get lost one day?

310
00:27:39,435 --> 00:27:42,915
I have you with me. You wouldn't abandon me, would you?

311
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,600
 Young Master Yue, is she really your sister? 

312
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,900
 You're not acting like a normal older brother. 

313
00:28:00,996 --> 00:28:02,716
What are you doing?

314
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,000
Now you can't abandon me.

315
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,400
Qi, who am I to you?

316
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,400
Qi, who am I to you?

317
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,000
You're Jinzhao.

318
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,500
No, I mean,

319
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,000
do you see me as a brother or someone else?

320
00:28:31,955 --> 00:28:34,064
You're Jinzhao.

321
00:28:42,996 --> 00:28:45,800
- What's wrong? 
 - Nothing.

322
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,500
I shouldn't be expecting anything.

323
00:28:52,996 --> 00:28:56,516
But it's good you don't take me as your brother.

324
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,400
It's a bit cold. Let's go back.

325
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,000
Okay.

326
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,300
♫  Looking back upon the past  ♫

327
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:35,200
♫  Searching for that moment from the past  ♫

328
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,400
♫  Sincerely, I begin to write, our hearts connected  ♫

329
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,200
♫  It is destined to be  ♫

Jinzhao, it'll take ages if we walk like this.

334
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,800
We'll get there eventually.

335
00:30:03,036 --> 00:30:05,104
I can't walk anymore.

336
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,700
♫  The past glides by scene by scene  ♫

337
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,000
♫  How many smiles and tears  ♫

338
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,100
Is that the truth?

339
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,700
All right. You stay here. I'm going.

340

I'm coming.

361
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,000
Young Yue, you have recovered well.

362
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,300
Physician Bian is great indeed.

363
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,000
Physician Bian saved me?

364
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,600
Yes.

365
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,500
Young Jinzhao, what's wrong with your leg?

366
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,300
- I... 
 - He's fine.

367
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:51,200
He just carried me for a while last night. He must be faking.

368
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,000
Last night?

369
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,200
That's very grateful of you.

370
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,500
Of course. I'm not heavy.

371
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,700
You just carried me for a little while.

372
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,000
How can you be sore? You're definitely faking.

373
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
That's not the case.

374
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,000
Sister Ming Xiu, save me.

375
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,300
Physician Bian, what brings you here?

376
00:32:19,195 --> 00:32:21,996
Are you coming with us?

377
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,600
Physician Bian, thank you for saving me last night.

378
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,900
You woke up because of your abundant spiritual power.

379
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,900
Moreover, you saved me yesterday.

380
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,900
Now that everyone's here, let's get going.

381
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,752
   

382
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,100
This stone is magical. It's like an island.

383
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,900
This is the Yunlai Stone, a divine stone from ancient times.

384
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:19,000
It can take you anywhere you wish to go.

385
00:33:23,756 --> 00:33:26,236
Sister Ming Xiu, what is this?

386
00:33:32,335 --> 00:33:35,356
It's used to confirm the destination.

387
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,400
Qi, slow down.

388
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,700
Thank you, Physician Bian.

389
00:34:04,435 --> 00:34:07,036
Thank you for saving my Qi, Physician Bian.

390
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:11,876
A jealous one.

391
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,100
I wonder if you two have any plans.

392
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:36,200
If you don't mind, please stay for a few more days.

393
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,900
We'd be delighted.

394
00:34:39,636 --> 00:34:40,876
No need.

395
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:44,000
Since Senior Uncle wants to stay, I will take my leave first.

396
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,900
Thank you, Master Luo.

397
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Before we set off, Brother Hanjiang had specified that you should make more friends.

398
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
There's no rush to send the invitations to the Righteous Martial Alliance.

399
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,900
If you leave so abruptly, he will be sad.

400
00:35:01,356 --> 00:35:04,156
I will never befriend those who harbor demons.

401
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,200
Sister Ming Xiu is leaving?

402
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,500
That's her nature.

403
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,400
Please don't mind her.

404
00:35:27,276 --> 00:35:29,595
Let's go, everyone.

405
00:35:35,195 --> 00:35:38,636
Physician Bian, after you.

406
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,000
 This time at the Luo Mansion, 

407
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,600
 I wonder if I'll see Luo Wangping who took away my cultivation. 

408
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,800
- Surround Bian Luohuan. 
  - Yes! 

409
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:11,100
You brought me here to trap me in an urn, and couldn't hold it in any longer.

410
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:16,000
What's going on? Isn't Physician Bian here as a guest?

411
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,100
Young Yue, Physician Bian is very likely to be related to the Qiyuan Sect.

412
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,900
Physician Bian, is that true?

413
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,200
Do you believe in them or me?

414
00:36:33,115 --> 00:36:35,455
I believe in Jinzhao.

415
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,000
Then. Why do you bother asking?

416
00:36:45,516 --> 00:36:47,075
Let's go.

417
00:36:51,955 --> 00:36:53,756
Qi, stop watching.

418
00:36:53,756 --> 00:36:57,316
If it's really related to our origins, this is the best way.

419
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,800
 It's the first time Qi has cared so much about someone. 

420
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,000
 Who is he really? 

421
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:21,030
