1
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:25,010


2
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,100
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

3
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,756
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

4
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:40,636
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

5
00:00:40,636 --> 00:00:44,732
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

6
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:49,980
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

7
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,524
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

8
00:00:54,524 --> 00:00:56,832
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

9
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,872
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

10
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:01,952
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

11
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:06,428
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:11,396
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

13
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:15,484
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

14
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:21,792
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

15
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:25,120
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

16
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,528
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

17
00:01:30,528 --> 00:01:38,528
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

18
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,472
   

19
00:01:56,472 --> 00:01:59,388
   

20
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:13,180
Brother Luo, the forest is dense ahead, there's no more road.

21
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,140
Where should we go?

22
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:20,323
Look, everyone. Doesn't he look nice?

23
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,540
Qi, come over here.

24
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,980
Come closer to me.

25
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,760
All you do is goof around.

26
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,360
The Luo family of the Western Regions are truly amazing.

27
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,219
This way please.

28
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,939
Master.

29
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,159
It's been over 200 years.

30
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,680
Rehai has never been so unusual.

31
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,800
Today, it actually...

32
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,380
Interesting.

33
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:40,000
No, I should say it's extremely interesting.

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,579
Zhaoyan actually brought me important guests?

35
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,560
Bring them to see me.

36
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,018
Yes, sir.

37
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:02,899
To find such a treasured place amid the desert is really a blessing!

38
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,759
But we don't know the price someone paid for such a blessing.

39
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,419
Brother Luo, what did you say?

40
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,640
Nothing.

41
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:26,199
 Perhaps there's a hidden secret behind this desert oasis. 

42
00:04:31,996 --> 00:04:34,820
   

43
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,700
 Greetings, Master. 

44
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,360
The master of the Luo family is quite imposing.

45
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,439
Please follow me.

46
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:50,299
Greetings, Master.

47
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:53,193
 - Again. 
 - Come on. 

48
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:57,614
Zhaoyan is nice, rich, and also respected.

49
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,519
Do you have a crush on him?

50
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:07,000
What I meant was, you should learn more from him.

51
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,839
Yue Qi, how am I not as good as him?

52
00:05:11,859 --> 00:05:14,759
Jinzhao, you do have one thing that's better than him.

53
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,820
You're more confident.

54
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,060
 Everyone, please take a seat and have some snacks. 

55
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,439
What a noble family.

56
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,000
Impressive.

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,759
Most of the Luo disciples are from the Luo clan.

58
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:38,319
Most of the people you see are outside disciples.

59
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:40,279
Even the outside disciples are so graceful,

60
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:43,339
I bet the clansmen must be more imposing.

61
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,480
Zhaoyan!

62
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,480
Luo Ning.

63
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,560
This is Luo Ning.

64
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,839
Please greet the guests.

65
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,779
Greetings.

66
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,560
Miss Maiming would like to invite all the guests to meet her.

67
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,460
Maiming wants to see them?

68
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,560
Brother Luo, who's Maiming?

69
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,879
My younger sister.

70
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,759
You have a younger sister?

71
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:11,519
I've only heard that your parents passed away a long time ago.

72
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,300
I didn't expect...

73
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,179
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it.

74
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:21,700
It's okay, it's all in the past.

75
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,439
My younger sister is weak, so she rarely meets guests.

76
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:28,219
After a long day of walking, I should let you have an early rest.

77
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:32,760
But for now, would you please go to the reception hall and spend some time there?

78
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,439
Since Miss Luo would like to meet us, we should go and see her.

79
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,720
Then I'll take everyone there.

80
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,179
Wait.

81
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,839
This is what your father asked me to bring you.

82
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:45,419
It should be something you like.

83
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:46,879
You're already so busy,

84
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:49,120
yet my father asks you to bring stuff for him.

85
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,079
I'm sorry about that.

86
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:54,339
Then how about I turn him down next time?

87
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,959
Master, since when did you learn to make jokes?

88
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,979
You may take your leave. I'll take them there.

89
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:02,600
Okay.

90
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,079
Then please wait here, everyone.

91
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,040
I'll take you there later.

92
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,599
Okay.

93
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,639
Did you see that?

94
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,739
- What? 
 - What?

95
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,240
She likes him.

96
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,219
- Who likes who? 
 - Who likes who?

97
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,179
Luo Ning likes Brother Luo.

98
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,199
But she didn't blush at all.

99
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,319
How can you tell?

100
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:33,559
When someone likes another, you can tell from their eyes!

101
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:39,500
Jinzhao, was it this gaze that you saw?

102
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,060
Why are you learning this from her?

103
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:47,460
Like this?

104
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,870
What? I can't see anything. What?

105
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,480
Jinzhao, why are you covering my eyes?

106
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,000
I just want to.

107
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,639
Just look over there.

108
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,720
- Cang Feng. 
 - Master.

109
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,319
Every time you come back, you always greet Cang Feng first.

110
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:19,500
Aren't you afraid I'll get angry?

111
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,319
 This voice sounds so weird. 

112
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,160
This is my younger sister.

113
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,839
Young Master Yue, Miss Yue, Hall Leader Ju.

114
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:34,720
While investigating the matter of Qiyuan Sect in Yinghui Fort,

115
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,279
you took care of my elder brother.

116
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,039
Thank you so much.

117
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,400
Miss Luo, no need to be so polite.

118
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,899
Little Yue, why is Brother Luo's younger sister talking from behind a screen?

119
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:49,559
That's what all noble ladies do.

120
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,459
They rarely show their faces.

121
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:53,160
I see.

122
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,340
But in the storybooks,

123
00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:02,540
the descriptions of the noble ladies' voices are sweet and melodious.

124
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,659
My younger sister had a serious illness when she was a child,

125
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:09,500
and thus her voice was damaged.

126
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,618
Please understand.

127
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:13,677
It's okay, it's okay.

128
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:31,220
So beautiful!

129
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,140
Who's more beautiful, her or Miss Shuo Xuan?

130
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,760
Both...

131
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,519
Brother Zhaoyan is cool and dashing, and your younger sister is so beautiful.

132
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,039
The Luo Mansion is truly a treasured place.

133
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,720
Miss Yue, you really are adorable.

134
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,559
Zhaoyan and I are twins.

135
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:53,660
We were born just a quarter of an hour apart.

136
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,960
Twins?

137
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,459
I've heard, due to punishment from the heavens, the Luo family's twins die young.

138
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:01,919
Then aren't you two...

139
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,000
How about being my little sister?

140
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,800
There's a lot of delicious food here.

141
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,600
Really? Can I have as much as I want?

142
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
As much as you want.

143
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,700
I didn't expect Brother Luo to be a courteous person,

144
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,800
while Miss Luo likes to get close to others.

145
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,100
Miss Yue is so adorable.

146
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,700
Brother Yue, I didn't expect you to be so protective of your younger sister.

147
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,000
I was too abrupt.

148
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,800
It's natural. I hope you can understand.

149
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,100
Once we arrived at the Luo Mansion,

150
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:55,600
Miss Luo immediately sent someone to invite us and even recognized us well.

151
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,400
That's really impressive.

152
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,700
The Luo family has been based in the Western Regions for a hundred years.

153
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,000
Of course, we know a lot.

154
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,900
Then I assume you already known why Brother Luo brought us here.

155
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,600
Exactly.

156
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,000
I've sent someone to look into it.

157
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Miss Yue set out from Wuyan Village three years ago,

158
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,600
and has been upholding justice along the way with you.

159
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,300
And has never been in contact with the Qiyuan Sect.

160
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,700
I don't think Little Yue is Lord Ming either.

161
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,600
My elder brother told me about what he saw in Fujin Hall.

162
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Ordinary people will have their life force sucked out when they touch the Qiyuan Orb.

163
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,900
Yet Miss Yue could absorb the life force of the Qiyuan Orb.

164
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,400
It really is suspicious.

165
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,100
Qi can absorb the Qiyuan Orb,

166
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,900
it can mean her origins might be related to the Qiyuan Sect,

167
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,400
but you can't assume she's Lord Ming.

168
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,500
Exactly, once we find the real Lord Ming, my name will be cleared.

169
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:56,020
You have a point.

170
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:01,200
Looks like you two are determined to pursue this lead.

171
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,400
Of course.

172
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,200
Zhaoyan, I read the ledgers you sent me.

173
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,600
It not only has records of the daily goods transaction of the Qiyuan Sect,

174
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,700
but the records of those who got kidnapped too. 
    

175
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,500
On the fifth day of February: Nine sacrificial humans,

176
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,700
three escorts, sixty jins of provisions.

177
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,900
Sacrificial humans?

178
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,300
Those demons are comparing people to sacrificial humans?

179
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,000
Oh my!

180
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,700
In this ledger alone, nearly a hundred people suffered.

181
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,200
The Qiyuan Sect really is wicked.

182
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,100
Maiming, did you find any clues?

183
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,300
In this ledger, for every person,

184
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,500
five jins of provisions were prepared.

185
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,600
And that's what one person needs for five days.

186
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,900
So, this place must be another Qiyuan Sect stronghold.

187
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,200
But there are so many places that can be reached within five days of Yinghui Fort.

188
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,600
Do we have to check them one by one?

189
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,600
The ledger records that a hundred jins of smoked horse meat was received.

190
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,800
I know about this. Smoked horse meat is a specialty of Luori Village.

191
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,100
It is quite delicious.

192
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,400
All you know is delicious food.

193
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,700
Luori Village is indeed within five days' journey of Yinghui Fort.

194
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,300
That should be it.

195
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,000
Should we set out as soon as possible?

196
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,800
You just came from Yinghui Fort.

197
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:33,000
Why don't you rest at Luo Mansion for now and set out for Luori Village tomorrow?

198
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:36,519
All right, thank you.

199
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,100
Are you sure you want to try again?

200
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,900
For the first time in 200 years, Rehai has shown an unusual reaction.

201
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,000
The Nine Springs move with the law of nature,

202
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,500
it is the source of nourishment for all things.

203
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,300
In the Nine Springs, Rehai provides endless life force.

204
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,000
To retain water for the desert,

205
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,600
the ancestors of the Luo family sacrificed my blood to restrain Rehai for their own use.

206
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,900
So the territory of the Luo family could have a constant supply of water.

207
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,600
In this life, I cannot leave the Luo mansion anymore.

208
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,690
It was only after my death did I realize

209
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:55,000
that my soul was bound with Rehai.

210
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,800
Perhaps this is an opportunity given by the heavens.

211
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,400
How could I pass it by?

212
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,000
Maiming!

213
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,600
Maiming. Maiming.

214
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,100
Maiming. Maiming.

215
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,200
Cang Feng, take him to the chamber and change his clothes. I'll come treat him.

216
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,800
Yes.

217
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,400
- I feel like something's wrong. 
 - What's wrong?

218
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,200
This Luo family seems so weird.

219
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,800
For example, Brother Luo seems to listen to his younger sister.

220
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,400
Although Brother Luo is the master of the Luo family, his younger sister seems more like it.

221
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:34,600
Also, why is Luo Maiming being so nice to you?

222
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:47,200
I've figured it out!

223
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:53,500
I think it's not Sister Luo who's being nice to me, but Brother Zhaoyan.

224
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,900
Maybe he really has a crush on me.

225
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,000
You're absolutely right,

226
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,300
but don't say it anymore.

227
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,200
Why aren't you competing with me for the food today?

228
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,704
I know you must want to compete with me for them.

229
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Thinking about it more, it's still off.

230
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,800
Why is Luo Maiming suddenly being so nice to you?

231
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Maybe... you might have something to do with the Luo family.

232
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,600
No. You just stay right here,

233
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
I'll go ask around.

234
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,900
Maiming, how are you?

235
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,200
Zhaoyan, I failed again.

236
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,640
I still can't lift the Luo family's curse.

237
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,800
Why? Why did you decide to try today?

238
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,400
Because we have important guests today.

239
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,800
So, you specifically came to meet Miss Yue?

240
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,400
Besides being Lord Ming, does she have any other identities?

241
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,300
When the girl named Yue Qi entered the barrier,

242
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,600
both Rehai and the key ring had an unusual reaction.

243
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,200
Are you saying Miss Yue resonated with Rehai?

244
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,200
I've been involved with Rehai for years, so I can't be wrong.

245
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,000
I thought...

246
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,500
You thought that she was the key to lifting the Rehai curse. Right?

247
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,800
But she's clearly not.

248
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,400
No.

249
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,100
She's still the key to lifting the Rehai curse.

250
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,700
She knows a lot of things.

251
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,600
I have to test her.

252
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,400
What?

253
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,580
Are you feeling reluctant now?

254
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,200
Of course not.

255
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:39,799
Even if it has nothing to do with Rehai,

256
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:42,400
if she truly is the deceitful Lord Ming,

257
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,799
I won't allow her to bring chaos to the world.

258
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:51,759
You're indeed our Zhaoyan, you can always make such noble speeches.

259
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:57,344
After all, I don't have much time left.

260
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,459
Maiming, I brought you a gift.

261
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:16,759
This is the Clear Misty Mountain painting from Yinfeng Pavilion.

262
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:21,040
I found it quite artistic, so I bought it.

263
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,839
Is that so?

264
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:26,319
It's still not as good as that one.

265
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:28,119
That one?

266
00:20:37,371 --> 00:20:39,231
That one...

267
00:20:40,153 --> 00:20:43,700
I drew that one a few days ago at Yinghui Fort,

268
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:48,879
when the sun shone after the rain and two rainbows appeared.

269
00:20:48,879 --> 00:20:54,980
Your painting isn't very skillful, but it's the thought that counts.

270
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:58,000
All right! If you like it,

271
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,400
whenever I see unique scenery, I'll paint it for you.

272
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,519
Naturally, that would be great.

273
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:11,200
Maiming,

274
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,399
when there's a surefire way to lift the curse,

275
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,160
we'll take action. Okay?

276
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,119
I'm worried about you.

277
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,739
Okay.

278
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:28,620
I'll find a solution later.

279
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,800
Then... get some rest first.

280
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:54,599
Clear Misty Mountain painting.

281
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:57,079
I can never leave the Luo Mansion,

282
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:00,880
what does this beautiful scenery have to do with me?

283
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,299
It only breeds more resentment.

284
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,060
If you like it,

285
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:13,345
whenever I see unique scenery, I'll paint it for you.

286
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,440
Zhaoyan,

287
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:24,720
I really hate your naivety.

288
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,759
 I made a pact with that wolf-demon already. 

289
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:36,200
 It used half its cultivation to save my daughter. 

290
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,330
 Three months later, I'll go back and let it eat me. 

291
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:44,740
 If this medicine can keep Zhaoyan alive,  
    

292
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,640
 my death will be worth it. 

293
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,259
 The demonic power in this elixir won't work on me. 

294
00:22:51,259 --> 00:22:54,400
 It seems that as long as the divine punishment exists, 

295
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,613
 I can't get my life force from anywhere else. 

296
00:22:58,613 --> 00:23:00,600
 Zhaoyan. 

297
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:04,269
 What a good child. 

298
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,240
 If I tell Zhaoyan, 

299
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:12,580
 that she's destined to die young as one of the twins 

300
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:16,119
 because I stole half her lifespan, 

301
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:19,520
 would she still be so kind to me? 
   

302
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,140
 Maiming. 

303
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,640
 From now on, we'll be the closest of kin. 

304
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,920
 I'll work hard to protect you. 

305
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,920
 We'll live and die together. 

306
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,780
 Okay? 

307
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:37,979
 Live and die together. 

308
00:23:37,979 --> 00:23:39,979
 Zhaoyan, 

309
00:23:39,979 --> 00:23:44,468
 have you regretted the promise you made 20 years ago? 

310
00:23:44,468 --> 00:23:50,712
♫  Writing down each trace, each detail, each word, each line about your struggles  ♫

311
00:23:50,712 --> 00:23:56,792
♫  For you, I'm irrational and foolish  ♫

312
00:23:56,792 --> 00:24:03,504
♫  Betting your entire life, your thoughts, your heart, your hope, that one moment  ♫

313
00:24:03,504 --> 00:24:10,240
♫  Without an answer, without giving up  ♫

314
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,511
 I need to find a way to get inside. 

315
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,060
Why has Jinzhao come back so soon?

316
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:23,459
Jinzhao.

317
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,599
Sister Maiming.

318
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:29,880
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

319
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,599
A little bit. I was going to take a nap.

320
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:34,920
I'll come another day then.

321
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,880
No need. Since you're already here, come in please.

322
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,720
No need. Since you're already here, let's talk inside.

323
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,140
Okay.

324
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:50,319
I heard from Zhaoyan that you don't remember your past.

325
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:54,240
Neither does Jinzhao.

326
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,559
Then, do you want to know what happened in the past?

327
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,119
Yeah. So does Jinzhao.

328
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:05,270
We've been looking for our origins for three years already.

329
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:09,400
Actually, I could do that for you and Brother Yue.

330
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,258
Really? How?

331
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:30,179
 Recall those memories forgotten in the depths of the sea of consciousness. 

332
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,056
Do you know about Rehai?

333
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,440
 Qi, take a look. 

334
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,440
 These are the Nine Springs of Shennong. 
   

335
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,960
 Rehai, Pureness, Dragon Pool. 

336
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,319
 Rehai contains an endless life force, 

337
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:57,463
 which can turn a desert into an oasis. 

338
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:04,815
   

339
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:08,480
Shennong Nine Springs?

340
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,519
Brother Luo, it's just a misunderstanding.

341
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:16,359
A misunderstanding.

342
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:20,499
Distracting the guards and breaking into our forbidden land, is it just a misunderstanding?

343
00:26:20,499 --> 00:26:22,920
You don't think much of me, do you?

344
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,975
Then will you or won't you let me go?

345
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:27,680
What do you think?

346
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:33,920
Who are you?

347
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:38,680
I'm Yue Qi.

348
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,839
Only Yue Qi?

349
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:44,783
Yes, Qi.

350
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,960
Once you're in danger, you only know to summon Miss Yue.

351
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,860
Those who didn't know would think she was your weapon.

352
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:58,449
What happened three years ago?

353
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,559
 Qi. 

354
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,019
 From now on, you're my disciple. 

355
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:09,240
 Thank you, Master. 

356
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,580
 Master. 

357
00:27:19,907 --> 00:27:21,247
Oh no.

358
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,400
Master, the incense is burning out.

359
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,200
What did you see?

360
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,759
I saw...

361
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:43,200
What did you see?

362
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,661
I saw...

363
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,801
Master...

364
00:27:47,801 --> 00:27:51,226
Master? Who is your master?

365
00:27:51,226 --> 00:27:52,348
Yue Jinzhao is back.

366
00:27:52,348 --> 00:27:54,853
My master is...

367
00:27:54,853 --> 00:27:56,566
is...

368
00:27:56,566 --> 00:27:58,000
Say it.

369
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,840
My master is...

370
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,480
Jinzhao, you're back.

371
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,680
Yes, what are you two talking about?

372
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,411
Count me in.

373
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,720
Young Master Yue is back.

374
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,039
I won't bother you anymore.

375
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,960
I'll take my leave.

376
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,960
Miss Yue really is adorable.

377
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,599
I really want to make friends with her.

378
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,000
How's it going? Did you get bullied?

379
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,200
Of course not.

380
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,293
Sister Maiming wants to be friends with me.

381
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,920
Don't make friends so casually.

382
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,559
You don't even know her, yet you're making friends with her.

383
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:56,039
Do I have to know the other party to make friends?

384
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,925
We don't know who we are either.

385
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,400
Where have you been?

386
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,519
I broke into the Luo family's Octagonal Tower.

387
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:07,480
And I saw...

388
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,400
I saw a pretty amazing mural.

389
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,359
What was it of?

390
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:16,099
A god and nine springs with different shapes.

391
00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:18,960
Nine springs?

392
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,400
Nine Springs of Shennong?

393
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:23,939
Do you know it?

394
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,500
I just dreamed that Master showed me the painting of the Nine Springs of Shennong.

395
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,039
Dream?

396
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,880
What did Luo Maiming do to you?

397
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,359
She didn't do anything,

398
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:40,719
she just lit some incense, to help us recall our origins.

399
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,279
So what have you recalled? Tell me.

400
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,400
Maiming, Yue Jinzhao just broke into the Octagonal Tower.

401
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,240
Why did you let him go?

402
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,559
Is the Octagonal Tower a place where they can get in, just because they want to?

403
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,240
You let him in on purpose.

404
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:04,119
I just used the enchanting incense to help Yue Qi recall her memories.

405
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:08,039
It can prove that she's definitely not Lord Ming.

406
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,319
But she is familiar with the Nine Springs.

407
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:14,119
And Rehai's reaction is real, too.

408
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:23,519
So you're trying to figure out the relationship between Miss Yue and Rehai.

409
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:25,559
If Miss Yue could take Rehai away...

410
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:28,680
Then we would be free.

411
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:34,126
Maiming, if Rehai is taken away,

412
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:37,680
then the people in this area will be deprived of water and be displaced.

413
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,859
If the world knew about it, what would they think of our Luo family?

414
00:30:41,859 --> 00:30:43,980
So what?

415
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,920
Rehai should move with the natural law of things.

416
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:53,440
If I didn't restrain Rehai to the Luo Mansion to provide an endless life force,

417
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,200
how could a desert like this...

418
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,340
get water?

419
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,839
They lead a comfortable life.

420
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:06,680
But who cares about our curse?

421
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,799
I've been trapped in the Luo Mansion for hundreds of years

422
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:12,720
and have never stepped outside of it.

423
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:18,719
And you can only pretend to be a man to take on the role of master of the family.

424
00:31:18,719 --> 00:31:21,920
Don't you resent this curse?

425
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,519
The twins of the Luo family die young.

426
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:28,619
Even you... will die soon.

427
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:32,240
But I'm the master of the Luo family.

428
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,705
So what?

429
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,200
Are you a god...

430
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,240
or a fairy?

431
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,279
You want to take responsibility for the lives of so many people.

432
00:31:46,006 --> 00:31:49,270
You can feed and clothe them,

433
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:52,799
help them to cultivate Tao.

434
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,440
You even want to take care of their reincarnation?

435
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,960
Maiming.

436
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,960
You won't change your mind.

437
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,160
Neither will I.

438
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,400
All right.

439
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,640
Let's not talk about this.

440
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,720
You'll continue to accompany Yue Qi and Young Master Yue

441
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,079
to investigate the Qiyuan Sect.

442
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:28,720
I have to find out more about Yue Qi.

443
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:34,000
As for Yue Jinzhao, he's very perceptive.

444
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,880
You have to be careful against him.

445
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,720
I understand.

446
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,880
Regarding the relationship between Miss Yue and Rehai,

447
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,440
I'll find another time to ask her.

448
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,359
Then you get some rest, I'll take my leave.

449
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:02,780
So what I saw in the Octagonal Tower is the mural of the Nine Springs of Shennong.

450
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,839
Luo Maiming tested you,

451
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:08,440
because she suspects you have a connection with the Nine Springs.

452
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,839
Jinzhao, we've seen the Nine Springs of Shennong.

453
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:13,960
The Nine Springs of Shennong must be real.

454
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,680
My master must also be real.

455
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,480
Master. Master. All you know is your master.

456
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,079
You didn't believe it before.

457
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,680
But in my dream,

458
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,640
no matter how hard I try,

459
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,400
I still couldn't see his face clearly.

460
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,720
All right. We'll find him one day.

461
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,160
Jinzhao, I'm so sleepy.

462
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:50,319
You fell asleep so quickly.

463
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:54,839
Are you a pig?

464
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:17,440
 Enchanting incense. 

465
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,900
Brother Yue.

466
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,679
You and your sister are colluding.

467
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:29,039
What enchantment did you cast on Qi?

468
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:33,199
It's Memory Exploration.

469
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,159
Brother Yue, you don't need to worry.

470
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,760
I was sickly as a child,

471
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,519
Maiming has done it to me many times,

472
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:40,400
to remind me of the happy memories from my childhood

473
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,979
and take away the pain.

474
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:46,160
Qi has fainted and you're telling me not to worry?

475
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,159
Rest assured. Miss Yue will wake up soon.

476
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:53,180
Maiming did this to help her recall those memories from three years ago.

477
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:56,640
Even if you suspect us, there's no need to be so despicable.

478
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,559
It's disappointing.

479
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,639
Brother Yue, if you are that worried,

480
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:04,092
- I will— 
 - Stop being so pretentious.

481
00:35:24,191 --> 00:35:26,470
Aren't you afraid that these two...

482
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:28,853
will reveal the secret of Rehai?

483
00:35:28,853 --> 00:35:33,464
I wish everyone in the world knew about the secret of Rehai.

484
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,678
The Luo Mansion is about to get lively.

485
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,501
I'm really looking forward to this.

486
00:35:51,920 --> 00:36:01,900


487
00:36:24,376 --> 00:36:29,396
♫  The meteor streaks through the sky  ♫

488
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:33,364
♫  Burning what once was  ♫

489
00:36:33,364 --> 00:36:37,508
♫  Forgetting its name  ♫

490
00:36:40,308 --> 00:36:45,332
♫  Behind the mask are deep feelings  ♫

491
00:36:45,332 --> 00:36:49,076
♫  Only visible through the eyes  ♫

492
00:36:49,076 --> 00:36:53,250
♫  Who can see them clearly?  ♫

493
00:36:54,324 --> 00:37:02,132
♫  I'm destined to brave all the dangers for you  ♫

494
00:37:02,132 --> 00:37:10,320
♫  Even if fate cannot be escaped in the end  ♫

495
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:18,256
♫  Staking everything just to feel the resonance of our souls  ♫

496
00:37:18,256 --> 00:37:26,432
♫  Leaving love with an unspoken explanation  ♫

497
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:47,316
♫  Seemingly random paths  ♫

498
00:37:47,316 --> 00:37:51,316
♫  Traces of what's been burned  ♫

499
00:37:51,316 --> 00:37:56,600
♫  Concealing all the secrets  ♫

500
00:37:58,396 --> 00:38:03,348
♫  A story full of unexpected encounters  ♫

501
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:11,484
♫  All carefully arranged by fate  ♫

502
00:38:12,408 --> 00:38:20,240
♫  I'm destined to brave all the dangers for you  ♫

503
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:28,248
♫  Even if fate cannot be escaped in the end  ♫

504
00:38:28,248 --> 00:38:36,348
♫  Staking everything just to feel the resonance of our souls  ♫

505
00:38:36,348 --> 00:38:44,272
♫  Leaving love with an unspoken explanation  ♫

506
00:38:44,272 --> 00:38:52,272
♫  I'm destined to give my all for you  ♫

507
00:38:52,272 --> 00:39:00,336
♫  Even if all my efforts go up in smoke  ♫

508
00:39:00,336 --> 00:39:08,400
♫  Regardless of everything, I will love you deeply forever  ♫

509
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:17,900
♫  Leave behind evidence that my love existed  ♫
