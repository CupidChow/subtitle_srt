19
00:01:56,508 --> 00:01:59,932
   

20
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,080
Ying Xuwei, they've entered the Mist Soul. Where is the key ring?

21
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,779
Sorry for keeping you waiting, Miss Shuo Xuan.

22
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:06,679
General Lin Yuan, Zhu Yu tried to take the Rehai key ring by force.

23
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:08,360
I wonder, in your opinion,

24
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,980
how the contractual relationship between us should proceed.

25
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:18,139
When we meet again another day after our parting today,

26
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:20,280
we will rely on our own abilities.

27
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,204
Guixu...

28
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:44,320
is the final resting place of all memories in the world.

29
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,999
Even the most thrilling and poignant memories...

30
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,608
will be like...

31
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,539
the most ordinary flowing water in Guixu.

32
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:17,000
What do you see?

33
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:23,219
I see a lot of things that I have already forgotten.

34
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:36,419
Upon reflection, my life hasn't been wasted.

35
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:50,600
When I returned last time, this dragon horn was missing a piece.

36
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,939
Now it's complete.

37
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:55,019
It seems that during these three years,

38
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:58,420
not only us but others have also come to the Dragon Pool.

39
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,559
It was taken by Eldest Brother.

40
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,580
Why do you need this dragon horn?

41
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,400
To forge a fake Rehai key ring.

42
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,760
The real one is in your possession, isn't it?

43
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:17,980
The Rehai key ring was originally crafted from dragon bones.

44
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,939
The divine power lingering on the bones can confound Zhu Yu,

45
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:25,899
making her believe that the key ring we surrendered is real.

46
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:28,520
Why would you do that?

47
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:35,400
It's a long story. You should ask Eldest Brother after you get out.

48
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,240
Second Sister!

49
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:50,039
Second Sister, you're finally back.

50
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:53,240
Where did you go without taking me along?

51
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,320
I want to know when Third Brother will be back.

52
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,160
Second Sister, why won't any of you tell me where Third Brother has actually gone?

53
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,360
Is it because that place is very far away

54
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,700
and he has to go for a long time?

55
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:15,200
What if Third Brother never comes back?

56
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,140
Is Third Brother going to a very dangerous place?

57
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,960
He's been injured.

58
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,544
Second Sister, quickly tell me where Third Brother is, so I can go protect him.

59
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,499
Silly child,

60
00:06:28,499 --> 00:06:32,480
do you think Eldest Brother and I don't care about Third Brother's safety?

61
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:38,180
Rest assured. He... He's just gone to heal.

62
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:43,480
When he returns, he'll certainly be lively and safe again.

63
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,740
Really?

64
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,580
Really.

65
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,840
You had me worried for nothing.

66
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,520
When he comes back, I'll make him make 100 grass dragonflies for me personally,

67
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,439
and each one has to be different.

68
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:03,140
Are you trying to torture him?

69
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,096
Yes, that's right.

70
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,239
Second Sister, what's wrong? Are your eyes bothering you?

71
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:20,539
Yes, a big grain of sand got in my eye.

72
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:40,219
In this long stream of memories,

73
00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:42,760
why can't I find your memories?

74
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,900
We come from three years later.

75
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,696
Three years later?

76
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,900
I need to seek information in your memory.

77
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,099
I'm already aware of your identities and your intentions.

78
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,700
I cannot create, but only exchange.

79
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,519
Your existence will totally disappear as a price.

80
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:32,499
From now on, no one in this world will remember you.

81
00:08:32,499 --> 00:08:34,760
Even I will not be an exception.

82
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,200
Are you ready?

83
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,600
To be honest, no.

84
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:51,679
I have been forgotten before.

85
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,260
That kind of fear and despair still

86
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:01,159
feels suffocating upon recollection, even after many years.

87
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,360
And now,

88
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,260
Eldest Brother, Second Sister,

89
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,270
Xiaoyuan,

90
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,660
and all the other people I cherish will forget me.

91
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,759
No matter how much more time I am given to prepare,

92
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,828
I simply cannot accept it.

93
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:41,979
But only I can make the exchange for Yue Jinzhao, right?

94
00:09:44,219 --> 00:09:47,900
The mark of Qi is engraved on your soul.

95
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,800
This isn't something owned by life itself.

96
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,279
I also cannot create it.

97
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,059
Since you have a wish in your heart, come forward then.

98
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,620
Willing to sacrifice his life for someone completely unrelated...

99
00:10:09,619 --> 00:10:11,624
These humans...

100
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,821
I actually view the Hengdao Sect with renewed respect.

101
00:10:16,821 --> 00:10:21,140
If it were me, I would make the exchange too.

102
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,656
I would.

103
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,952
Thank you.

104
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,519
It is I who should thank you.

105
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,220
There are many things I can't do, but you can.

106
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,704
Yue Jinzhao,

107
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,879
I also have a gift for the reborn you.

108
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:54,440
What is it?

109
00:10:55,419 --> 00:10:58,720
I've been secretly watching you for a long time.

110
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,259
I have witnessed most of what you have experienced.

111
00:11:10,979 --> 00:11:15,519
I will seal some of my memories into your left eye.

112
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:22,919
Consider it my final compensation to you.

113
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,760
So every time, the images my left eye sees...

114
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,144
are those you have seen.

115
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:41,439
Bian Luohuan, take care.

116
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,780
Farewell, Yue Jinzhao.

117
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,777
Bian Luohuan,

118
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,840
I don't resent you anymore.

119
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,050
Qi,

120
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,390
farewell.

121

00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,939
the Dragon Pool will reclaim all memories of the exchangers.

161
00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:33,639
From then on, there will be no Bian Luohuan in the world.

162
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:39,540
 My left eye should never be able to see his memories again. 

163
00:16:14,979 --> 00:16:18,279
Young Huan, goodbye.

164
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:59,124
Jinzhao, please take care of me in the next three years.

165
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,379
We will all be waiting for you three years from now.

166
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:05,100
You must bring Young Yue to visit us. Okay?

167
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,940
Everything that happens in this world is destined.

168
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,719
I didn't expect we would have such a strong connection.

169
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:17,080
It's rare that you are so moved.

170
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:22,260
All right, it's time to go. We have to take them to Wuyan Village.

171
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,020
It's time to leave.

172
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,299
I will send you back.

173
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:49,519
Yue Jinzhao, do you believe in fate?

174
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,919
Someone once told me that fate is just a possibility that can be changed.

175
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:00,936
It makes a lot of sense.

176
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,179
The previous Guardian of Pureness said that. Right?

177
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:10,819
But do you still remember when the Cold Marrow Sentry prophesied

178
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:16,099
that two out of the six of you would soon pass away?

179
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:18,299
Yes, I do.

180
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:24,719
In the near future, your life will come to an end.

181
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,100
I have my sword and my companions.

182
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,959
I will let fate take the path it should.

183
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:09,599
Later on, the people from Hengdao Sect will come looking for us.

184
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:19,699
The Yunlai Stone is glowing.

185
00:19:29,219 --> 00:19:31,432
The Yunlai Stone is approaching.

186
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:37,399
Master once came to check because of the anomaly of Pureness.

187
00:19:38,699 --> 00:19:44,720
Sister Ming Xiu, if you want to find Senior Gu, just go.

188
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,770
Go on.

189
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,840
See him once more.

190
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,859
Master, I will go defeat the demons in that den.

191
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:54,219
When I come out,

192
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:58,339
could you pin a hibiscus flower in my hair for me?

193
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,800
I don't care if you disagree, it's a deal.

194
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,944
Who is there?

195
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,920
Master.

196
00:21:52,459 --> 00:21:54,340
Xiu'er.

197
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:15,540
Xiu'er, are you from the future?

198
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,519
Has something happened in the future?

199
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,180
Have you suffered a lot?

200
00:22:35,499 --> 00:22:40,360
All right, my foolish Xiu'er, you still have me here.

201
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,979
When did you inherit the position of Guardian of Pureness?

202
00:23:12,339 --> 00:23:14,248
Three years later.

203
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,940
Three years...

204
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:35,999
So, I can only be with you for three more years.

205
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:28,840
Master,

206
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:35,199
can you pin a hibiscus flower in my hair for me?

207
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:17,608
Indeed, this hibiscus is a worthy match for you.

208
00:25:17,608 --> 00:25:19,620
♫  Snow falls, parting us  ♫

209
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:25,636
♫  Unable to bear to see your tears flowing  ♫

210
00:25:26,472 --> 00:25:30,792
♫  Piercing deep into my heart, it tears at me  ♫

211
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:36,572
♫  Instead why not take my doomed fate away  ♫

212
00:25:36,572 --> 00:25:40,550
♫  The mirror reflects the shadows but remains invisible  ♫

213
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,230
Xiu'er,

214
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:46,360
take care.

215
00:25:49,064 --> 00:25:51,040
♫  Using the lightest words  ♫

216
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,344
♫  To make the harshest decisions  ♫

217
00:25:53,344 --> 00:26:01,192
♫  No different from a death sentence  ♫

218
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:08,320
♫  If you truly can bear to leave with the wind  ♫

219
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,704
♫  How come tears suddenly shimmer in your eyes?  ♫

220
00:26:13,704 --> 00:26:19,176
♫  What was thought to be evergreen withers between my fingers  ♫

221
00:26:19,176 --> 00:26:25,160
♫  Even the embraces feel forced  ♫

222
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:30,824
♫  If the flowing water and fallen flowers are all fate  ♫

223
00:26:30,824 --> 00:26:36,168
♫  Don't talk about who failed love  ♫

224
00:26:36,168 --> 00:26:38,948
♫  If our next meeting is uncertain, don't eavesdrop on me in my dreams  ♫

225
00:26:38,948 --> 00:26:42,948
♫  If our next meeting is uncertain, don't eavesdrop on me in my dreams  ♫

226
00:26:42,948 --> 00:26:47,752
♫  Humming that tune of lovesickness  ♫

227
00:26:47,752 --> 00:26:53,832
♫  If you truly can bear to leave with the wind  ♫

228
00:26:53,832 --> 00:26:59,176
♫  How come tears suddenly shimmer in your eyes?  ♫

229
00:26:59,176 --> 00:27:04,604
♫  What was thought to be evergreen withers between my fingers  ♫

230
00:27:04,604 --> 00:27:10,792
♫  Even the embraces feel forced  ♫

231
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,696
Master, I have dealt with all the demons inside.

232
00:27:16,696 --> 00:27:21,868
♫  Don't talk about who failed love  ♫

233
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,440
Master, the flower I asked for...

234
00:27:30,739 --> 00:27:33,820
The flowers here bloom very well,

235
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,668
so I couldn't bear to pluck them.

236
00:27:35,668 --> 00:27:41,008
♫  In the dream...  ♫

237
00:27:42,336 --> 00:27:44,279
♫  humming that tune of lovesickness  ♫

238
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:47,759
I understand, Master.

239
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:55,219
 Master, this time, it's truly goodbye. 

240
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,759
Have you said farewell to Brother Hanjiang?

241
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:23,479
I've always wanted to know what exactly happened on the 14th day of the seventh month, three years ago.

242
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:29,900
But I never expected it to be me.

243
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,160
Do you regret seeing him?

244
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:41,920
Perhaps. But I saw him one last time...

245
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:45,500
and let him personally...

246
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:50,050
adorn me with this hibiscus.

247
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:57,519
And Master ultimately granted my wish.

248
00:28:58,739 --> 00:29:01,540
Although Master was gentle as a person,

249
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,759
he truly was more stringent than others as a master.

250
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:13,820
This time, I went to see him at the risk of disturbing the stream of time.

251
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:19,479
Under normal circumstances, he might have expelled me.

252
00:29:20,979 --> 00:29:23,499
You are Xiu'er, whom he has raised since childhood.

253
00:29:23,499 --> 00:29:25,516
How could he bear to do that?

254
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,728
Let's go.

255
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:38,239
 The departed have long been gone. The living will harbor peace forever. 

256
00:29:45,499 --> 00:29:48,920
Miss Ming, is Senior Gu doing well?

257
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,360
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

258
00:29:55,859 --> 00:29:58,420
Being able to see the one cherished in one's heart again

259
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,579
is truly a fortunate thing.

260
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:36,219
Qi, are you afraid that after we go in,

261
00:30:36,219 --> 00:30:38,619
we will no longer remember Bian Luohuan?

262
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,380
Once we return to the future,

263
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:45,120
the path of heaven will erase everything about him.

264
00:30:45,865 --> 00:30:49,025
It will be as if he never existed.

265
00:30:50,699 --> 00:30:53,679
But can the trace of one's existence...

266
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:59,040
really be quietly erased completely?

267
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,119
As long as his faith and mission are in our hearts,

268
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,499
even if we no longer remember him,

269
00:31:10,979 --> 00:31:12,879
he is still alive.

270
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:30,344
 I like you. 

271
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,728
 I like you. 

272
00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:49,080
 This voice seems familiar. 

273
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,759
 Why can't I remember? 

274
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:15,099
 I like you. 

275
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:36,050


276
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:46,792
♫  Looking back upon the past  ♫

277
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:50,784

♫  I bitterly search thousands of rivers and mountains  ♫

316
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:16,780
♫  Alone in the empty valley I hear my echo  ♫

317
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,920
♫  In the tranquility of this world   ♫

318
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,904
♫  I'm searching for your presence   ♫

319
00:36:20,904 --> 00:36:25,036
♫  I'll spend the rest of my life with you   ♫

320
00:36:25,036 --> 00:36:28,872
♫  Never forgetting this, I keep bitterly searching  ♫

321
00:36:28,872 --> 00:36:33,096
♫  I hope to share the rest of my life's joy and sorrow with you  ♫

322
00:36:33,096 --> 00:36:35,212
♫  Among the vast sea of people  ♫

323
00:36:35,212 --> 00:36:37,380
♫  I engrave your name  ♫

324
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:44,992
♫  Never doubt, the steadfastness of my heart  ♫
