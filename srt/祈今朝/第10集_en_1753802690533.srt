00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm finally home.

8
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Hey, what are you doing?

9
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Do you know why you're being punished?

10
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Why don't you just copy the book?

11
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Who told him to bully Sanggou?

12
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Just because you're angry, you almost killed him?

13
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No, I'm not.

14
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
If I had known that the cliff was unstable,

15
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I wouldn't have put down such a heavy book.

16
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
If I had known,

17
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
there wouldn't have been so many things I would have known.

18
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
There are things

19
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
that I would have known

20
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
better not to know.

21
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I don't understand.

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You guys always hide something from me.

23
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So, second sister,

24
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
what is the relationship between Yujin Zhao and Sanggou?

25
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Why are they the same?

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
How many books did you copy?

27
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The first one.

28
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Then hurry up and copy it.

29
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You can't eat if you can't finish it.

30
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Why?

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What do you mean why?

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's not me who said it.

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's boss who said it.

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Boss, I'm back.

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
How are Qi and Yujin Zhao?

36
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Boss,

37
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I haven't been back for a long time.

38
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You came up and kicked Yujin Zhao.

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You don't care about me.

40
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Sit tight.

41
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Looking at you in such a dazed state,

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I know

43
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
they're fine.

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes, they have escaped danger.

45
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The people from Yujin Mountain took them away?

46
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
To be honest,

47
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
in the past three years,

48
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Qi and Yujin Zhao's relationship

49
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
has been growing slowly.

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But this time,

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
suddenly their strength increased.

52
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
They could kill Zhen Yao.

53
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's because of the Qi Yuan Pearl.

54
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
In Fu Jin Tang,

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Qi's thing is a large amount of Qi Yuan Pearl.

56
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Qi Yuan Pearl contains the power of human life.

57
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So,

58
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
it may be the key to Qi's ability to acquire this time.

59
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And,

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Qi also grew a piece of the soul.

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
His power of the divine beast has awakened.

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes.

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Boss,

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
have you taken the medicine I gave you?

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Your analysis

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
makes sense.

67
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But,

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
the human life in Qi Yuan Pearl

69
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
is full of dark emotions

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
before it dies.

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
How is Qi's mood

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
after he ate the Qi Yuan Pearl?

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Nothing has changed.

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
He can eat and drink.

75
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
He's as happy as before.

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Qi has absorbed the Qi Yuan Pearl's strength.

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And it doesn't affect his mind.

78
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's meaningful for us.

79
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
By the way,

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Luo Man Ming

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
asked us to contact him

82
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
to get the hot water.

83
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What did Luo Man Ming say?

84
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He did persuade the hot water.

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But,

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
he also intended to break the trap.

87
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Don't worry.

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
After we solve the matter of Qi Yuan Pearl,

89
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'll go meet this ally in person.

90
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay.

91
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'll go to see Yuan.

92
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Okay.

93
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Wait.

94
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He's writing a book.

95
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You can't help him with it.

96
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I didn't.

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He's getting more and more willful.

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's all your third brother's doing.

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He's not my second brother.

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Get lost.

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Get lost.

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Boss.

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You really need to take care of yourself.

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Otherwise,

105
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
we'll be in a big trouble.

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
We'll be in a big trouble.

107
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
word of occupation

108
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Jinzhao.

109
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I don't want to lose,

110
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I don't want to lose,

111
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
What don't you want to lose?

112
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Jinzhao.

113
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,840
Kill him.

114
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,180
I really want to die.

115
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,140
It hurts.

116
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,600
Let me have a look.

117
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,480
Xiao Jiao.

118
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,700
I'm leaving now.

119
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,500
Qingyan, do you remember the

120
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,500
yin and yang on your body when you saved me?

121
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,500
Yin and yang?

122
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,900
What yin and yang?

123
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
I was wrong.

124
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,500
Where is this?

125
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,100
It's the Yuching Mountain.

126
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,100
It's where Sister Mingxiu and Gu Shu are.

127
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,100
It's the place where the yin and yang are.

128
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,100
It's the place where the yin and yang are.

129
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,100
It's the place where the yin and yang are.

130
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,100
Sister Mingxiu and Gu Shu

131
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,100
brought us here from the lower reaches of the cliff.

132
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,100
Senior Xianqing, Gu Shu.

133
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,100
Senior Gu, thank you for saving us.

134
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,100
The first thing you need to do

135
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,100
is to support us.

136
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,100
Jinzhao!

137
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,100
Jinzhao!

138
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,100
Jinzhao, you're awake!

139
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,100
Brother Yue looks much better now.

140
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,100
Master's medicine is actually useful.

141
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,100
It's not that my medicine is useful.

142
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,100
Brother Yue,

143
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,100
when we were looking for you and Miss Yue,

144
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,100
Miss Yue had recovered.

145
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,100
And your wound was obviously treated.

146
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,100
And the demon aura on your body

147
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,100
is like the demon aura on Miss Shuxuan

148
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,100
when we were in the sunset village.

149
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,100
Shuxuan?

150
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,100
Then why did she save us?

151
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,100
Could it be that she has something to do with the Demon Realm?

152
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,100
Jinzhao, don't worry.

153
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,100
With my strength,

154
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,100
I'll catch her and ask her clearly next time.

155
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,100
No, it's not me.

156
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,100
Sorry, it's me. I'm hungry.

157
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,100
Jinzhao, I'll cook for you.

158
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,100
Wait for me.

159
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,100
Jinzhao,

160
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,100
I'll be back soon.

161
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,100
Okay.

162
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,100
Senior Gu.

163
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,100
to help me solve the problem.

164
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,380
You don't want to say goodbye to others?

165
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,500
This matter is urgent.

166
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,140
If so,

167
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,980
I'll go first.

168
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,340
Thank you.

169
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,020
Jing'an is a long way from here.

170
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,060
Let Xiu send you there.

171
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,540
Thank you, Miss Ming.

172
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:19,940
Goodbye.

173
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,180
I think

174
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,860
he's hiding from me.

175
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,180
There are so many interesting things today.

176
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,260
Luckily,

177
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,860
I got another chance.

178
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:49,460
Are you

179
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,100
I want to go out and play snow.

180
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,100
I don't want to write.

181
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,100
Don't you want to play snow?

182
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,100
Go ahead.

183
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,100
But my brother hasn't finished my words yet.

184
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,100
It's not easy.

185
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,100
Old rules.

186
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,100
Brother 3 will help you sing.

187
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,100
Second sister, I'm going to play snow.

188
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,100
Second sister,

189
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,100
it's better to go home.

190
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,100
I can't drink the wine that second sister made.

191
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,100
Did boss blame you?

192
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,100
No.

193
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,100
But

194
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,100
Second sister,

195
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,100
boss has a fever again today.

196
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,100
But

197
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,100
don't worry too much.

198
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,100
He has a heavy mind.

199
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,100
And he has a big emotional fluctuation.

200
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,100
Did you make him angry again?

201
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,100
How could it be?

202
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,100
I'm a little different from Xiao Yuan.

203
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,100
Then why is he so excited?

204
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,100
Because our little fish's magical power

205
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,100
finally woke up.

206
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,100
Boss is so happy.

207
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,100
You dare to be so bold

208
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,100
in front of boss.

209
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,100
I think

210
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,100
boss is too tired.

211
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,100
I hope he can be

212
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,100
more relaxed and happy.

213
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,100
Although Qi is the power of Qi Yuan Zhu,

214
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,100
it must hurt a lot.

215
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,100
He never cried before.

216
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,100
But he cried in the nearby hall.

217
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,100
Sister,

218
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,100
I'm going out for a walk.

219
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,100
Just go.

220
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,100
You're really stubborn.

221
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,100
Do you need me to help you calculate

222
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,100
your future with Luo family?

223
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,100
No need.

224
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,100
If I can calculate the future,

225
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,100
what's the point?

226
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,100
Miss,

227
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,100
I got this for you.

228
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,100
Thank you.

229
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,100
Xian Qing,

230
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,100
about the future,

231
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,100
do you have any expectations of the future?

232
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,100
The demon lives a long life.

233
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,100
Why do you learn to be trapped by human's love?

234
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,100
Do you need me to remind you of something?

235
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,100
They are all new people in front of love.

236
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,100
Some people even dare not accept their own disciple.

237
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,100
What kind of tricks are they playing?

238
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,100
Someone has regained half of his power,

239
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,100
but he can't even keep the person he cares about.

240
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,100
Why are you talking about me?

241
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,100
You are playing again.

242
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,100
I am playing.

243
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,100
You are a coward,

244
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,100
but you are so shy.

245
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,100
You are so confused.

246
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,100
You are playing again.

247
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,100
Three years ago,

248
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,100
the memories he had when he left the jade world

249
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,100
became the new things on the white paper.

250
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,100
I thought

251
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,100
you wouldn't open them.

252
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,100
That's different.

253
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,100
Erniang, look.

254
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,100
He is so cute.

255
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,100
I still remember that day

256
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,100
when he was just born.

257
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,100
You and I were so happy.

258
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,100
I didn't expect that

259
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,100
you would bring him back from the ocean of love.

260
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,100
Master.

261
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,100
I found out

262
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,100
that you are different from usual.

263
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,100
What happened?

264
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,100
I followed them for three years.

265
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,100
I thought

266
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,100
I had accepted everything.

267
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,100
But

268
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,100
when the Wushu Pillar was lost in Fujin Hall,

269
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,100
I still believed it.

270
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,100
When the next master of the Sun Village protected me,

271
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,100
I still believed

272
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,100
that he would protect me.

273
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,100
When I saw him protecting Yue Jingzhao

274
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,100
in the Silver River,

275
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,100
I even felt jealous.

276
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,100
I still can't let go of the Wushu Pillar.

277
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,100
Xiao He,

278
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,100
you swore to the Heaven to punish me.

279
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,100
You swore that you wouldn't use the name of Gu Mingshui

280
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,100
to punish Qi.

281
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,100
You can't expose your identity.

282
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,100
Otherwise,

283
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,100
he wouldn't let you

284
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,100
watch over Qi and Yue Jingzhao.

285
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,100
You can't.

286
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,100
Qing'er, I'm just kidding.

287
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,100
Don't be nervous.

288
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,100
I'll do my best to save you.

289
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,100
You're kidding.

290
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,100
Don't make jokes like this with me.

291
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,100
Don't worry.

292
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,100
I know my mission.

293
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,100
I'm still Qi's master.

294
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,100
I will

295
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,100
win over Qi and Yue Jingzhao

296
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,100
and become the best of the best.

297
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,100
Your identity

298
00:18:54,100 --> 00:19:02,100
is the evidence of love.

299
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,100
Qi,

300
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,100
are you done?

301
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,100
Jingzhao,

302
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,100
wait a little longer.

303
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,100
I'll be done soon.

304
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,100
Qi.

305
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,100
Jingzhao.

306
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,100
Jingzhao.

307
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,100
What's wrong?

308
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,100
I really want to make you a bowl of noodles.

309
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,100
How's your noodles?

310
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,100
It's very soft.

311
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,100
It looks

312
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,100
good.

313
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,100
Of course.

314
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,100
The soup base is the herbal soup base I made.

315
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,100
It's very good for your health.

316
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,100
Try it.

317
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,100
How's it? Is it good?

318
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,100
It's good.

319
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,100
I've eaten this before.

320
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,100
It's the best noodles.

321
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,100
Really?

322
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,100
I'll try it too.

323
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,100
You're lying.

324
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,100
I'm not.

325
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,100
Everyone has a different taste.

326
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,100
It's really good.

327
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,100
I'm not lying.

328
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,100
I'm not.

329
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,100
I'm not.

330
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,100
I'm not.

331
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,100
Why

332
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,100
did you suddenly think of cooking noodles for me?

333
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,100
Didn't I cook it for you before?

334
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,100
I also want to do something.

335
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,100
Why did you suddenly say that?

336
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,100
When you were in a coma,

337
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,100
Uncle Gu told me

338
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,100
that people always have to grow up.

339
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,100
You have to think more about

340
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,100
what you want to do

341
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,100
and what you can do.

342
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,100
You don't have to listen to others.

343
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,100
You want to grow up so much?

344
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,100
Yes.

345
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,100
Only when you grow up,

346
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,100
you can become stronger.

347
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,100
Only then can you protect the people you want to protect.

348
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,100
You used to protect me.

349
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,100
From now on,

350
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,100
I want to protect you too.

351
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,100
It seems that our Jia Qi has really grown up.

352
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,100
Okay.

353
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,100
You protect me.

354
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,100
Don't eat it.

355
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,100
This time it's a mistake.

356
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,100
I'll make you a delicious meal.

357
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,100
You learned how to make egg noodles.

358
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,100
You can make it yourself in the future.

359
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,100
You don't need me.

360
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,100
Miss Yue can be connected to the demon ring.

361
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,100
It seems that her background

362
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,100
is not related to Jiu Quan.

363
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,100
I think

364
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,100
her background is not related to Jiu Quan.

365
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,100
Senior.

366
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,100
Do you know how to calculate?

367
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,100
Do you believe in the method of life-saving?

368
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,100
Then can you

369
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,100
help me calculate it?

370
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,100
I want to calculate

371
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,100
our two identities.

372
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,100
Okay.

373
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,100
Yue Xiao Ge,

374
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,100
tell me the birthday of Miss Yue.

375
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,100
Birthday?

376
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,100
But Senior,

377
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,100
the thing between Qi and me three years ago

378
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,100
I don't remember at all.

379
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,100
I don't know my birthday.

380
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,100
Then

381
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,100
do you have any full birthday anniversary?

382
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,100
Maybe you can try.

383
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,100
July 14.

384
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,100
July 14.

385
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,100
What's wrong?

386
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,100
Three years ago,

387
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,100
I met a knight in a place.

388
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,100
I think it may be related to you and Miss Yue.

389
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,100
That's why I care.

390
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,100
What knight?

391
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,100
Where?

392
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,100
This place

393
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,100
may be related to your birthday.

394
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,100
Would you like to go with me?

395
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,100
Yes.

396
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,100
Of course.

397
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,100
Thank you.

398
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,100
Thank you.

399
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,100
Xiu'er is back.

400
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,100
Master,

401
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,100
you're taking Mr. Yue and his people to the Quan Mai?

402
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,100
How can they enter

403
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,100
such an important place so easily?

404
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,100
It seems that

405
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,100
Xiu'er has some awareness

406
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,100
of protecting Quan Yan.

407
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,100
Xiu'er is just talking about the world.

408
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,100
I'm afraid that Yue Xiaoge and Miss Yue

409
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,100
have a very close relationship with Jiuquan.

410
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,100
I made up a little yesterday.

411
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,100
There may be some changes in Quan Mai recently.

412
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,100
It's good to be prepared.

413
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,100
It's just a self-reflection.

414
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,100
You know the future but you can't change it.

415
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,100
Isn't it more sad?

416
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,100
Isn't it more sad?

417
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,100
Quan Yan Wu Gou can foresee the future.

418
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,100
Only those who have Wu Gou's medicine ring

419
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,100
may see the future in their eyes.

420
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,100
Is that why you are not willing to

421
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,100
inherit Wu Gou's protection?

422
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,100
The future is not necessarily.

423
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,100
Master, you are too optimistic.

424
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,100
Even if it's not happening,

425
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,100
how can it be destined?

426
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,100
You should go with me.

427
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,100
Forget it.

428
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,100
Since Xiu'er is not willing to go,

429
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,100
then I won't force you.

430
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,100
Master.

431
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,100
Master, we have arrived at Wu Gou.

432
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,100
What is this?

433
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,100
This is the entrance of Wu Gou.

434
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,100
This is Wu Gou, one of the Nine Power of God.

435
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,100
Yue Xiaoge actually knows about the Nine Power?

436
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,100
I...

437
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,100
I have seen a painting.

438
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,100
It's a painting of the Nine Power of God.

439
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,100
It's a painting of the Nine Power of God.

440
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,100
I have seen a painting.

441
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,100
The Nine Power of God?

442
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,100
What are you talking about?

443
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,100
You will know when you go in.

444
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,100
When Wu Gou can foresee the future,

445
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,100
I will be the guardian of Wu Gou.

446
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,100
The bracelet in my hand

447
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,100
is the medicine ring that will open Wu Gou.

448
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,100
Uncle Gu,

449
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,100
are you going to be the guardian too?

450
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,100
The Nine Power of God is not passed down for generations.

451
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,100
It will be passed down to the previous guardian,

452
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,100
the successor chosen by him.

453
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,100
If the guardian dies without giving the medicine ring,

454
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,100
the medicine ring will become like a normal bracelet,

455
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,100
until he meets the next person he is destined to meet.

456
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,100
Uncle Gu,

457
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,100
the knight you mentioned three years ago,

458
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,100
is it related to this?

459
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,100
Exactly.

460
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,100
The Nine Power of God

461
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,100
So this is the scene of the Nine Power of God.

462
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,100
Although I have seen it before,

463
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,100
it's the first time I've seen it.

464
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,100
The nine forms are different.

465
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,100
The whole face is different.

466
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,100
Everyone,

467
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,100
follow me to see it.

468
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,100
Where is this?

469
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,100
It's so quiet that I feel a little nervous.

470
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,100
It's really quiet near the Ming Realm.

471
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,100
Ming... Ming... Ming Realm?

472
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,100
It's just near.

473
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,100
This place is called Wangchen Ring.

474
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,100
At the end of this road,

475
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,100
it's the whole face.

476
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,100
Isn't the name of the whole face called Wu Gou?

477
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,100
The whole face is connected.

478
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,100
Since we have the medicine ring of Wu Gou,

479
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,100
we can use the medicine ring to enter the whole face.

480
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,100
Then we can go to the other whole face.

481
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,100
But the whole face has its own number of stomachs.

482
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,100
If we don't have the corresponding medicine ring close to the whole face,

483
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,320
maybe we will be attacked by the

484
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,100
Wei Shu.

485
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,100
You have to be careful.

486
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,100
What do you mean?

487
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,100
After you pass through this dark place

488
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,100
and reach the cold water,

489
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,100
I will tell you about what happened three years ago.

490
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,100
Is this a test of you?

491
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,100
Okay.

492
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,100
It's a deal.

493
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,100
Let's go.

494
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,100
Uncle Gu, you don't want to go with us?

495
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,100
court

496
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,100
case

497
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,100
You are not with the guard at all.

498
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,100
Hurry back!

499
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,100
We are here to guard with you.

500
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,100
Guarding does not exist without matter.

501
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,100
This is the punishment for not knowing the art of water.

502
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,300
Is it really the punishment for not knowing the art of water?

503
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,500
I forgot to tell you.

504
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,900
You really are hard-working.

505
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,500
Among you,

506
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,500
there will be two deaths in a day.

507
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,900
What?

508
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,300
Don't scare us.

509
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,100
This is the punishment for not knowing the art of water.

510
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,500
You are not allowed to return to the country for ten days.

511
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,500
Please explain it clearly.

512
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,500
Who knows if he deliberately bewitched people

513
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,700
and wanted to scare us away?

514
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,700
Don't talk nonsense.

515
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,900
We won't be afraid.

516
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,100
You can't return to the country for ten days.

517
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,300
Being angry at being questioned,

518
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,300
the power of the eye is not enough.

519
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,700
Do you really think you will die?

520
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,100
Jingzhao,

521
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,300
let's listen to him first.

522
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,100
Let's go first.

523
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:17,700
No.

524
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,100
You must move forward.

525
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,100
I'll go with you.

526
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,700
Interesting.

527
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,500
I want to know what's ahead.

528
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,700
Master.

529
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,500
Little Zhao Yan.

530
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,700
Qi...

531
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,700
Qi...

532
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,100
Qi...

533
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,100
Jingzhao.

534
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,900
Jingzhao, I'm here.

535
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,900
Jingzhao, what's wrong?

536
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,100
Jingzhao.

537
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,900
Senior.

538
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,700
Mingxiu.

539
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,700
Master.

540
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,900
What's wrong with them?

541
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,300
Why am I the only one who is fine?

542
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,100
What did you do to them?

543
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,900
Qi.

544
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,700
It's a ring.

545
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,700
It's a ring.

546
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,900
Stop.

547
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:31,900
Qi.

548
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,700
Master, take me away.

549
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,700
Qi.

550
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:36,900
Qi.

551
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,100
Let me go.

552
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,300
Qi.

553
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,700
I've been tired of this new spiritual cultivation.

554
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,300
Qi.

555
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,100
Jingzhao.

556
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,300
Jingzhao, I'm here.

557
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,300
There's a spiritual cultivation.

558
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,700
Jingzhao, wake up.

559
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,700
Jingzhao, wake up.

560
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,900
Jingzhao.

561
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,300
Jingzhao.

562
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,700
Wake up.

563
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,700
You can't go with him.

564
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,300
You can't go with him.

565
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,100
I won't go.

566
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,700
Jingzhao, everyone seems to be trapped by the spell.

567
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,100
Let's save them.

568
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,300
Miss Shaoxuan.

569
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,700
Miss Shaoxuan.

570
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,100
Miss Shaoxuan, I'm sorry.

571
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,900
I saw you taking a bath that time.

572
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,100
I didn't mean it.

573
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,700
Since...

574
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,700
Since we came to the village,

575
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,500
I've been...

576
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,700
I've been thinking...

577
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,700
I want to see you again.

578
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,100
You coward.

579
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,500
Miss Shaoxuan, I'm not a coward.

580
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,700
I told you, if you come to me again,

581
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,500
I'll break your bones.

582
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,500
Miss Shaoxuan. Miss Shaoxuan.

583
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,500
Let me go.

584
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,500
Master, no.

585
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,700
Don't look at the talisman.

586
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,900
Where are your eyes?

587
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,300
Young Master.

588
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,900
Young Master.

589
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,100
Why are you like this?

590
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,500
The cultivation is over.

591
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,700
From now on,

592
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,500
we'll never see each other again.

593
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,300
Let go.

594
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,500
Let go.

595
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,300
Master.

596
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,500
Master, Miss Lin.

597
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,100
Let go.

598
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:23,700
Miss Lin.

599
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,700
Wake up.

600
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,300
Let go.

601
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,300
Miss Shaoxuan.

602
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,700
Let me go.

603
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,500
Master.

604
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,300
Let me go.

605
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,500
Qi, Shuqing.

606
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,700
We have to find a way to save them.

607
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,900
I've tried.

608
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,300
Let go.

609
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,700
There's still a spirit.

610
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,100
Let me go.

611
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,900
Let me go.

612
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,700
Let me go.

613
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,700
Senior.

614
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,900
Senior.

615
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,700
Miss Lin.

616
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,900
Miss Lin.

617
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,900
Is this

618
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,900
another new illusion?

619
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,300
Congratulations on breaking the new devil.

620
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,300
What I'm going to tell you

621
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,900
is related to Han Sui.

622
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,900
In the Nine Spring,

623
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,300
Wu Gou will meet the future.

624
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,300
But Han Sui

625
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,300
can't kill the world.

626
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,100
Kill the world?

627
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,900
Why does it sound

628
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,100
like the story of the living and dying in the Ming Dynasty?

629
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,500
Isn't that Han Sui's

630
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,700
picture in the Ming Dynasty?

631
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,900
Three years ago, I used a medicine ring

632
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,100
to sense that someone entered from Wu Gou.

633
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,100
I sensed the whole thing under suspicion.

634
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,500
But I found a chaos in Lin Mai.

635
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,700
I followed the chaos

636
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,900
and followed Han Sui.

637
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,300
This lotus tree

638
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,300
is the whole Han Sui.

639
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,500
Above Han Sui,

640
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,900
every kind of lotus has a life.

641
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,100
Without a moment,

642
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,300
the flowers bloom and wither.

643
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,100
It's like a life birth

644
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,700
and disappears.

645
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,900
Every kind of lotus

646
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,900
has a life and death.

647
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,300
This is the heaven.

648
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,700
Not a mortal can't see it.

649
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,300
You're indeed the people.

650
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,900
Three years ago, I came here.

651
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,700
This sick lotus

652
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,100
has a lot of medicinal ingredients.

653
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,500
It appeared in front of me.

654
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,700
It's a flower.

655
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,100
Your fates are inseparable.

656
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,300
Ordinary lotus

657
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,100
should be bloomed

658
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,300
by the blooming of the flowers.

659
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,300
Like a mortal's life.

660
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,500
But this sick lotus

661
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,300
appears in the sky.

662
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,100
It's like a life birth.

663
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,700
The smaller the lotus, the more mysterious it is.

664
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,900
I'm afraid you two have a connection

665
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,900
with Jiuquan.

666
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,900
Why does Uncle Gu say that?

667
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,700
Miss Yue,

668
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,500
here's your order.

669
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,100
The pill is emitting light.

670
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,700
I know that the drug

671
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,100
has a connection with Miss Yue.

672
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,500
It means that Miss Yue and Lin Mai

673
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,900
have a close relationship.

674
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,100
And Miss Yue

675
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,100
and Yue Xiaohe's fates

676
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,500
are closely related.

677
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,300
Lin Mai has been unstable for years.

678
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,300
Maybe there will be a conflict.

679
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,700
She will involve you two.

680
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,300
Yue Xiaohe, Miss Yue,

681
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,900
no matter what happens in the future,

682
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,100
I hope you two

683
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,100
will never give up.

684
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,100
Never give up?

685
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,300
What do you want to know?

686
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,900
You just said

687
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,100
that you can see the future

688
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,300
with your eyes closed.

689
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,500
Do you know something?

690
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,900
Will we encounter disaster in the future?

691
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,500
And,

692
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,900
you just said

693
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,500
that two of us

694
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,900
will die soon.

695
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,900
You're lying to us, right?

696
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,100
The water of Han River will be the water of the lotus.

697
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,300
Then,

698
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,300
who will it be?

699
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,500
It's the one who will die.

700
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,300
God!

701
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,100
I think

702
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,100
it's only a few decades.

703
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,500
The number of black eyes

704
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,700
has been there for thousands of years.

705
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,500
What she said is not true.

706
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,700
I don't know how many years later it will be.

707
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,700
That's right.

708
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,300
That's right.

709
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,500
Okay.

710
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,500
Let's go back first.

711
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,100
Let's go.

712
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,500
I'm sorry.

713
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,500
I'm sorry.

714
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,500
I'm sorry.

715
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,500
I'm sorry.

716
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,500
I'm sorry.

717
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,500
I'm sorry.

718
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,500
I'm sorry.

719
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,500
I'm sorry.

720
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,500
I'm sorry.

721
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,500
I'm sorry.

722
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,500
I'm sorry.

723
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,500
I'm sorry.

724
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,500
I'm sorry.

725
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,500
I'm sorry.

726
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,500
I'm sorry.

727
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,500
I'm sorry.

728
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,500
I'm sorry.

729
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,500
I'm sorry.

730
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,500
I'm sorry.

731
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,500
I'm sorry.

732
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,500
I'm sorry.

733
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,500
I'm sorry.

734
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,500
I'm sorry.

735
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,500
I'm sorry.

736
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,500
I'm sorry.

737
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,500
I'm sorry.

738
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,500
I'm sorry.

739
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,500
I'm sorry.

740
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,500
I'm sorry.

741
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,500
I'm sorry.

742
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,500
I'm sorry.

743
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,500
I'm sorry.

744
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,500
I'm sorry.

745
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,500
I'm sorry.

746
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,500
I'm sorry.

747
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,500
I'm sorry.

748
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,500
I'm sorry.

749
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,500
I'm sorry.

750
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,500
I'm sorry.

751
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,500
I'm sorry.

752
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,500
I'm sorry.

753
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,500
I'm sorry.

754
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,500
I'm sorry.

755
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,500
I'm sorry I got carried away.

756
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,500
So sorry.

757
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,500
Sorry I got carried away.

758
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,500
Sorry, I'm here for you.

759
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,500
And so sorry.

760
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,500
So sorry.

761
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,500
I'm sorry.

762
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,500
I'm sorry.

763
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,500
I'm so sorry.

764
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,500
Sorry.

765
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,500
Sorry I made you think so.

766
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,500
And I'm sorry I made you mistake.

767
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,500
Sorry.

768
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,500
So sorry.

769
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,660
I'm searching for you in the mountains before the night water

770
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:42,740
I'm lonely in the mountain and I'm looking for you

771
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:46,740
I'm in the city and I'm looking for you

772
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:50,740
I'll never leave you

773
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:54,740
I'm searching for you in this year

774
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:58,740
I'll be with you forever

775
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:03,460
I'm slowly getting used to your new name

776
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:09,460
Don't doubt that my heart is as good as before
