1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,840
Afterим

2
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,000
Besides, fathers have photososis,

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,020
brother, brother Le yapa is telling me

4
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,540
that Niu Xia다가's sister Shi- directions really matter

5
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,080
do you want to come back?

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:27,760
Okay

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,900
Niu Steling

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,900
I will go

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:32,560
Brother

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,580
Niu Steling

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,540
All my sister's photos are begun

12
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,840
like pictures

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,500
So, here is the second part

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,260
Niu Stelling

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,260
I'm not afraid of being broken

16
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,260
I'm not afraid of being broken

17
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,260
I'm not afraid of being broken

18
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,260
I'm not afraid of being broken

19
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,260
I'm not afraid of being broken

20
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,260
I'm not afraid of being broken

21
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,260
I'm not afraid of being broken

22
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,260
I'm not afraid of being broken

23
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,260
I'm not afraid of being broken

24
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,260
I'm not afraid of being broken

25
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,260
I'm not afraid of being broken

26
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,260
I'm not afraid of being broken

27
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,260
I'm not afraid of being broken

28
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,260
I'm not afraid of being broken

29
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,260
So I pray for a miracle

30
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,260
To be all right

31
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,260
Even if I'm burned by time

32
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,260
I only wish to wake up for you

33
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,260
Search for a miracle that will never end

34
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,260
I will never leave you

35
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:37,260
Love is the most beautiful meaning in life

36
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,260
Love is the most beautiful meaning in life

37
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:49,260
Love is the most beautiful meaning in life

38
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,260
Love is the most beautiful meaning in life

39
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,260
Love is the most beautiful meaning in life

40
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,260
Miss Shuo Xuan

41
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,260
Now the blood is gone

42
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,260
The sea of ​​heat has returned to the heaven

43
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,260
I don't know if the king has a case

44
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,260
When needed

45
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,260
How to know where the sea of ​​heat is

46
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,260
Don't talk about it

47
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,260
What do you want to say

48
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,260
That day I and the king together

49
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,260
Forced Ying Xuwei to hand over the method of removing the blood

50
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,260
He has long been wary of me

51
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,260
Just forced me to have the sea of ​​heat in my body

52
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,260
So there is nothing to do

53
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,260
The scroll of the sea of ​​heat is recorded

54
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,260
The scroll of the sea of ​​heat is recorded

55
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,260
I heard that the fish tribe has a long history

56
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,260
If the king and Miss Shuo Xuan are willing to keep me safe

57
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,260
I should report to the head and hand over the scroll

58
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,260
What are you talking about

59
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,260
I'm just curious

60
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,260
What is the use of the sea of ​​heat with the fish tribe

61
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,260
This seems to have nothing to do with Mr. Luo

62
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,260
I feel the breath of the chess

63
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,260
I'm afraid he's in these battles

64
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,260
What damage

65
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,260
So bring him back

66
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,260
Check carefully

67
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,260
It's best as you said

68
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,260
I'm sorry

69
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,260
Brother, Mr. Luo's matter has been settled

70
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,260
Then take out the sea of ​​heat

71
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,260
The king can verify himself

72
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,260
The king

73
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,260
The king

74
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,260
We made a promise before

75
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,260
The sea of ​​heat is kept by us

76
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,260
The sea of ​​heat is kept by us

77
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,260
Do you want to break the promise

78
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,260
I'm sorry

79
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,260
I'm sorry

80
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,260
I'm sorry

81
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,260
I'm sorry

82
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,260
Qin Fei

83
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,260
Send me

84
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,260
it is good

85
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,260
The jade scroll is above the peak

86
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,260
I really need someone to send me down the mountain

87
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,260
But the flying mechanism of the Hengdao is already

88
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,260
I don't know if the king is willing to send me down the mountain

89
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,260
King

90
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,260
Anyway, we have to go down the mountain

91
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,260
How about letting Mr. Luo

92
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,260
Come with us

93
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,260
Thank you, your Majesty

94
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,260
father

95
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,260
father

96
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,260
father

97
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,260
father

98
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,260
father

99
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,260
This is not a drug

100
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,260
But a demon

101
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,260
Use your own cultivation to make a pill

102
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,260
Which demon is so stupid

103
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,260
I really want to give you cultivation

104
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,260
I have an appointment with that wolf demon

105
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,260
He used half of his cultivation to save my daughter

106
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,260
After three months

107
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,260
I will go back and let him eat me

108
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,260
A-Ming

109
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,260
If this medicine can succeed in saving Zhao Yan

110
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,260
I'm worth it

111
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,260
You have to break the promise

112
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,260
What do you mean

113
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,260
The power of the demon in this pill can't be used by me

114
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,260
It seems that as long as the sky is still clear

115
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,260
I can't replenish my life from him

116
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:37,260
But you can let Zhao Yan try

117
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,260
I'm afraid I only know his life

118
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:44,260
These demons are just scattered

119
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,260
This damn Qianqian

120
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,260
Zhao Yan

121
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,260
How good is Zhao Yan

122
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,260
Luo Ping

123
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,260
If I tell Zhao Yan

124
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,260
He is one of the twins of the Luo family

125
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,260
destined to die early

126
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,260
Because I stole half of the harvest

127
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,260
Will he treat me this way?

128
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,260
He

129
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,260
But you are the most important brother

130
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:29,260
Don't you have any feelings in your heart?

131
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,260
My family?

132
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,260
After I took the life for the first time

133
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,260
I told the elders of the tribe

134
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,260
Blood father hot sea is against the heaven

135
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,260
The Luo family and I will suffer from heaven

136
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,260
You guess

137
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,260
What reaction do they have

138
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,260
To prevent me from removing the blood father

139
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,260
Made the Luo family lose hot sea water source

140
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,260
The owner of the family

141
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,260
My first brother

142
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,260
The brother of the Luo family

143
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,260
Cut off the power

144
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,260
Kill me

145
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,260
Luo Wangping

146
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,260
You are a smart person

147
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,260
But I can't leave the Luo family

148
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,260
Do a lot of things

149
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,260
So far

150
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,260
You are a good friend

151
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,260
You leave first

152
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,260
I have new ideas and tell you

153
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,260
Hope we

154
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,260
Will be together

155
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,260
Zhao Yan

156
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,260
Zhao Yan

157
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,260
Stop hiding

158
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,260
I know you are here

159
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,260
Not here

160
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,260
I am not here

161
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,260
Not here

162
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,260
Not here

163
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,260
Not here

164
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,260
Zhao Yan

165
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,260
Not here

166
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,260
Zhao Yan

167
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,260
How is Zhao Yan

168
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,260
I gave him the安神术

169
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,260
Let him rest well

170
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,260
Any news of Xiaoyu

171
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,260
Any news of Xiaoyu

172
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,260
From the current situation

173
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,260
They should not be hurt

174
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,260
The problem is

175
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,260
No one knows where the jade knot is

176
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,260
I can't feel the position of the sea

177
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,260
The best choice

178
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,260
Is to wait for them to come to me

179
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,260
Do not worry

180
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,260
You accompany Zhao Yan

181
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,260
I'll go find it again

182
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,260
See if there is any other way

183
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,260
Zhao Yan

184
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,260
Zhao Yan

185
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,260
Zhao Yan

186
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,260
Master asked you to see

187
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,260
You still dare to come back

188
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,260
I came back

189
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,260
Because Zhao has my only family

190
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,260
Since you let go of the jade knot

191
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,260
I will not let go

192
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,260
I will not let go

193
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,260
I will not let go

194
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,260
If you do not want

195
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,260
You should not destroy what he cares about

196
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,260
What

197
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,260
Do you want to kill me

198
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,260
Two hundred years

199
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,260
I can't live or die

200
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,260
Now dead in your hands

201
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,260
It's also a relief

202
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,260
Because of your current power

203
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,260
It's just a handful of jade on my feet

204
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,260
how

205
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,260
I have to thank you for your kindness

206
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,260
You drove Zhao Yan out of the Luo family

207
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,260
Transfer him to Meng Wan Zai

208
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,260
You tried your best

209
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,260
I would rather kill the whole family than save him alone

210
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,260
Wang Bai Ming

211
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,260
Should I say you are pitiful

212
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,260
Or hateful

213
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,260
Say it

214
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,260
You came to me

215
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,260
What is it for

216
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,260
I came

217
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,260
To confirm his choice

218
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,260
Is it correct

219
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,260
Or

220
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,260
Will not be content

221
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,260
You are in the Luo family today

222
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,260
Don't you have a word of repentance

223
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,260
Repentance

224
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,260
You and I are in the same place

225
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,260
I don't know who wants to threaten me more

226
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,260
This is

227
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,260
Master

228
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,260
Who can see

229
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,260
It's destined to be me for you

230
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,260
Stand up

231
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,260
Even if the ending is hard to escape

232
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,260
Slippery

233
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,260
Unwilling to exchange a little

234
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,260
The light of the wedding

235
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:28,920
Completely

236
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,260
In the Night

237
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:31,840
Leave the

238
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:34,940
Obesity

239
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,260
Khuw yeah

240
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,260
Look Skinny

241
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,260
what you are looking at's all about.

242
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:07,860
This is

243
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,420
my room.

244
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:05,020
I'll do my best for you

245
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:12,900
Even if I have to try, I may fail

246
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:21,380
I'll give up everything to be with you for the rest of my life

247
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:28,100
The evidence of love

248
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,540
I can only speak with my heart

249
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:35,140
But do you know the origin of your name?

250
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,180
At that time, you were just born

251
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,180
I went to the sea of ​​the sky with my boss

252
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,180
Ready to take you back to the jade world

253
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,180
He is so cute

254
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,180
I love you

255
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,180
We will take him back to the jade world and teach him well

256
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:38,180
His name is Qi

257
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,180
Qi is the meaning of prayer

258
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,180
Hope you will be happy and safe

259
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,180
Happy and safe

260
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,180
I'll take you to a place, okay?

261
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,180
What are you doing here?

262
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,180
You left something here

263
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,180
These are

264
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

265
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

266
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

267
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

268
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

269
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

270
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

271
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

272
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

273
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

274
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

275
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

276
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

277
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

278
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

279
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

280
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

281
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

282
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

283
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

284
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

285
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

286
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

287
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

288
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

289
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

290
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

291
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

292
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,180
I'm going to the sea of ​​the sky

293
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,180
Every star here

294
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,920
Each of these stars

295
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,400
All a memory you have in the past

296
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:50,360
給你,給我sireねh secret gift everevereverevereverevereverever system

297
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,940
獲,獲給你。

298
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:01,680
這是一次。

299
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:08,120
前前後後最多的東西是什麼呢?

300
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,380
現在大哥只想能把你的信給你。

301
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,380
I...

302
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,380
Am I one of your pawns?

303
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,380
Yes.

304
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,380
What do you want?

305
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,020
This isn't your word.

306
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,380
Now go find them by yourself!

307
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,380
You don't want to tell anyone?

308
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,620
I'll get it myself!

309
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:47,620
Morning before the PM才

310
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:54,820
Can I respond to you

311
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:03,900
No pain no gain

312
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:11,020
This time here to win just

313
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,300
Don't treat Xiaohuan like that.

314
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,220
Commander Ge

315
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,700
has learned to listen to people's advice.

316
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,260
You only saw

317
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,300
the strictness of Xiaohuan to you.

318
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,300
In fact,

319
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,060
she has done a lot for you.

320
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,220
You just don't know.

321
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,820
I don't want to know.

322
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,940
She once stood against the Heavenly Punishment Stone.

323
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,020
She will never

324
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,420
ask for your help.

325
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:36,900
Otherwise,

326
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,140
she will suffer the pain of the Heavenly Punishment.

327
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,300
But for you,

328
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,660
Xiaohuan has broken her promise twice.

329
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:48,780
The first time

330
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,620
was in the Sunset Village.

331
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,540
You were poisoned and unconscious at that time.

332
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,620
You were unable to control your heart.

333
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,460
She didn't hesitate to use the Holy-divine Skill

334
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,940
to help you relieve your pain.

335
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,100
Qi Yue.

336
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,620
I have never done this before.

337
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,780
But you were too poisoned.

338
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,980
I had to do this.

339
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,820
Dr. Bian,

340
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,420
thank you for saving me last night.

341
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,420
You woke up

342
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,260
because you were full of energy.

343
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,380
And the second time...

344
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,380
The second time...

345
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,300
was in the Sunset Village.

346
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,420
Is she also afraid that I will lose my Holy-divine Skill?

347
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,860
Jin Zhao sent a letter

348
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,180
to wait for us at the Shadow World.

349
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:30,980
I'm afraid that

350
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,380
she will be afraid of me.

351
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,380
I'm afraid that

352
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,380
she will be afraid of me.

353
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,380
I'm afraid that

354
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,380
she will be afraid of me.

355
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,380
I'm afraid that

356
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,380
she will be afraid of me.

357
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,380
I'm afraid that

358
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,580
she will be afraid of me.

359
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,700
We will meet Xiao Jin Zhang

360
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,180
at trade trade.

361
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,380
Alright.

362
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,220
Who are you?

363
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,900
Are you from the Luozhangрим?

364
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,540
Tell us where Luozhangprom is.

365
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,140
Yes.

366
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:01,740
Tell us.

367
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,460
Say something.

368
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,180
Quickly.

369
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,180
I'm here to avenge Luo Zhaoyan.

370
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,900
I went back to my hometown with my wife

371
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,260
to attend the war with the Luo family.

372
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,940
But my wife

373
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,860
was hurt by a magic.

374
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:13,900
She was badly injured.

375
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,140
Everyone who ran out said

376
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,140
that everyone who was poisoned by the magic was dead.

377
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,180
How did she live?

378
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,180
I heard that Luo Zhaoyan had a sister

379
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,460
named Luo Manming.

380
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,660
Let's see her face.

381
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,460
Yes.

382
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,340
Let her turn her face around

383
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,460
and let us see her face.

384
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,100
Yes.

385
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:29,820
Let's go.

386
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,540
Let's go.

387
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,340
Let's go.

388
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,140
Let's go.

389
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,100
Let's go.

390
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:33,900
Let's go.

391
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,980
Or we'll kill her ourselves.

392
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:36,780
Yes.

393
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,340
Turn around.

394
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:37,900
Turn around.

395
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,460
Turn around.

396
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:38,940
Turn around.

397
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:39,820
Turn around.

398
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:41,740
Xingqin.

399
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,300
Don't be silly.

400
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,540
You didn't kill her.

401
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,620
Someone must

402
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,820
give them an explanation.

403
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,460
What's going on?

404
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,580
She's looking for the truth.

405
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,620
She must be

406
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,060
Luo Manming, Luo Zhaoyan's sister.

407
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:08,940
Tell me.

408
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,140
Where is Peng?

409
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,660
I'm Luo Zhaoyan.

410
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,300
I pretended to be a man

411
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,660
and did something wrong.

412
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,660
I didn't find out in time

413
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,620
and stopped it.

414
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,140
I deserve to die.

415
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,780
If my death

416
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,780
can appease everyone's hatred,

417
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,860
there'll be no Torment God.

418
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,860
Da Boyan.

419
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,660
I'm willing to give up.

420
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,620
Kill her.

421
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,820
Kill her.

422
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,540
Kill her.

423
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,580
Kill her.

424
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,500
Kill her.

425
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,840
Kill her.

426
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,500
Kill her.

427
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,380
Kill her.

428
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,020
Kill her.

429
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:57,820
Kill her.

430
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,020
Kill her.

431
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,140
Kill her.

432
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,140
Xingqing.

433
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,540
Xingqing.

434
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,140
Here.

435
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,540
Zhao Ning.

436
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,140
I've fulfilled your pride and willfulness.

437
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,540
Now it's my turn to be willful.

438
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,140
Xingqing.

439
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,140
It's so lively.

440
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,140
Luo Maiming.

441
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,540
How dare you show up?

442
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,140
Luo Maiming.

443
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,140
He is Luo Maiming.

444
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,140
How can he be Luo Maiming?

445
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,140
That's him.

446
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,140
The clothes of Long Shuang

447
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,140
is really similar to him.

448
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,140
Why do you care so much?

449
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,140
Kill them both.

450
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,140
They are brothers and sisters.

451
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,140
This case

452
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,140
must have something to do with them.

453
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,140
If you are not divided by good and evil,

454
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,140
and the black and white are not clear,

455
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,140
then I will be the one to decide.

456
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,140
Did you kill the family of the Luo family?

457
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,140
You did it alone.

458
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,140
Of course.

459
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,140
He did it.

460
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,140
He did it.

461
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,140
The ten miles of the square

462
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,140
are all due to the loss of the family of the Luo family.

463
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,140
The water source is still there.

464
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,140
Do you know where the water source comes from?

465
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,140
It's the ancestors of the Luo family.

466
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,140
The family of the Luo family

467
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,140
must have been at the cost of the water source.

468
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,140
Is it true?

469
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,140
You are sitting on the bones

470
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,140
of the family of the Luo family.

471
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,140
The blood of the family of the Luo family is left.

472
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,140
The family of the Luo family is eaten.

473
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,140
I dare to ask you.

474
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,140
Do you think

475
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,140
the family of the Luo family

476
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,140
will owe you anything?

477
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,140
Lai Ning.

478
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,140
Stop talking.

479
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,140
You pity them.

480
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,140
You are willing to sacrifice your life for them.

481
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,140
I am not.

482
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,140
Even if you suffer,

483
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,140
even if you bring the water source,

484
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,140
can you kill people?

485
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,140
Yes.

486
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,140
I don't care about your reasons.

487
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,140
I only admit that blood is at stake.

488
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,140
I, Lai Ning,

489
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,140
you killed the whole family of the Luo family.

490
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,140
You should be sentenced to death.

491
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,140
Yes.

492
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,140
Blood is at stake.

493
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,140
Blood is at stake.

494
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,140
Blood is at stake.

495
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,140
Good.

496
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,140
Blood is at stake.

497
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,140
Good.

498
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,140
Blood is at stake.

499
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,140
The blood loss we paid yesterday

500
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,140
is not enough.

501
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,140
Stop killing.

502
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,140
Lai Ning.

503
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,140
Lai Ning.

504
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:57,140
Looking for a piece of the past

505
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:02,140
The past is lost and the heart is going to be reborn

506
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,140
It's destined

507
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:09,140
Heartbeats are deep

508
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,140
Time is endless

509
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,140
A month's worth of homework

510
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,140
Writing a diary

511
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,140
It's all about you

512
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,140
All the reincarnations are like the rain

513
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,140
I miss you

514
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,140
Everything is unforgettable

515
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,140
I can't forget you

516
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,140
The past is a scene

517
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,140
How many smiles and tears

518
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:36,140
Will all be gone

519
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,140
I'm looking for the past

520
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,140
In the mountains and rivers

521
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,140
The wind blows alone

522
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,140
I am lonely

523
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,140
The city is quiet

524
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,140
I'm lost in your shadow

525
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:54,140
I can't leave you

526
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:58,140
I'm crying all year

527
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:02,140
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

528
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:06,140
The rain slowly pours into your heart

529
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,140
Don't doubt

530
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:12,140
My heart is always like this

531
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,140
The wind blows alone

532
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,140
I am lonely

533
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,140
The city is quiet

534
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,140
I'm crying all year

535
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:30,140
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

536
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,140
The rain slowly pours into your heart

537
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,140
Don't doubt

538
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,140
My heart is always like this

539
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:40,140
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

540
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,140
The rain slowly pours into your heart

541
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,140
Don't doubt

542
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,140
My heart is always like this

543
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,140
The rain slowly pours into your heart

544
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,140
Don't doubt

545
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,140
My heart is always like this

546
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,140
The rain slowly pours into your heart

547
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,140
Don't doubt

548
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,140
My heart is always like this

549
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,140
The rain slowly pours into your heart

550
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,140
Don't doubt

551
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,140
My heart is always like this

552
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,140
The rain slowly pours into your heart

553
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,140
Don't doubt

554
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,140
My heart is always like this

555
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,140
The rain slowly pours into your heart

556
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,140
Don't doubt

557
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,140
I'm waiting in tears

558
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,140
I'm looking for you

559
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,140
In the night sky

560
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,140
Loneliness and my memories

561
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,140
I had it all

562
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,140
The city is quiet

563
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,140
I'm looking for you

564
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,140
I'm looking for you

565
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,140
The rain never stops

566
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,140
I'm looking for you

567
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,140
The rain doesn't stop

568
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,140
The city never stops

569
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,140
The rain doesn't stop

570
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,140
The city doesn't stop

571
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:47,900
crowds a good wage
