00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:24,960


2
00:00:27,072 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,756
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

4
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:40,664
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

5
00:00:40,664 --> 00:00:44,732
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

6
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:49,980
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

7
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,524
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

8
00:00:54,524 --> 00:00:56,832
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

9
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,872
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

10
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:01,952
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

11
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:06,428
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:11,396
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

13
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:15,484
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

14
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:21,792
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

15
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:25,120
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

16
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,528
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

17
00:01:30,528 --> 00:01:38,628
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

18
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,540
   

19
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,968
   

20
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,268
Xian Qing.

21
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,619
Xian Qing, come here.

22
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:11,960
Be careful.

23
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,679
Xian Qing, you rest here.

24
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:16,960
I'll go look for some herbs.

25
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,776
Zhaoyan.

26
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,740
As long as you're here, I don't need any medicine.

27
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:34,480
I'm sorry, Xian Qing. It's my fault you ended up like this.

28
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,280
You are so gravely injured. I'm sorry.

29
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,239
It's okay. It's okay.

30
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,800
Why did it become like this?

31
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,956
Do you hate him?

32
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,499
He and I are the closest,

33
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,719
yet we are the ones who hurt each other the most.

34
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,284
Don't worry.

35
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:16,060
I will always be with you.

36
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,599
When Maiming imprisoned me today,

37
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,559
he said he found a way to break the binding.

38
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:31,160
A way to break the binding?

39
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,519
Our family has been blood-bound to Rehai.

40
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,239
We endure the heavenly punishment.

41
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,640
Maiming and I, because of the twin's curse,

42
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,419
have also been enduring the same pain.

43
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,999
But Maiming, after all, has endured more than 200 years of torment

44
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:53,940
and has never been able to step out of the family.

45
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,000
He must have held some resentment.

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,240
I owe him.

47
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,800
Why do you think that?

48
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,859
I'm willing to free him from the binding,

49
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:11,700
but he doesn't want it. He doesn't even want me.

50
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,319
He had been my entire life.

51
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,399
After I met you all, he only has himself left.

52
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,119
He can't escape the prison of the family,

53
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:25,700
so he wants to trap me here too.

54
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,840
It's what I owe him.

55
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,104
No.

56
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,719
It's your family. Your family owes him.

57
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,960
You are the family head, but you...

58
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,640
Xian Qing.

59
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,400
You are Luo Zhaoyan.

60
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,812
I am Luo Zhaoyan.

61
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,119
I am Luo Zhaoyan.

62
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:05,559
From now on, I'll live only for myself.

63
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,919
 Maiming, our father has passed away. 

64
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,979
 From now on, we only have each other. 

65
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:22,919
 I will protect you. 

66
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:27,620
 Let's live and die together. All right? 

67
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,119
 Maiming, as long as you want, 

68
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,500
 I'll be how I used to be. 

69
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,840
 I will protect you like I used to, Maiming. 

70
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,059
But I hate you.

71
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:54,021
 - Xiu'er. 
 - Master. 

72
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,299
 Do you like it? 

73
00:05:55,299 --> 00:05:57,559
 Yes. 

74
00:05:57,559 --> 00:06:00,779
 Xiu'er, what would you like for lunch? 

75
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:03,000
 Stir-fried greens? 

76
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,360
 I don't want to eat burned greens. 

77
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,479
 The families I found for you before were well-off and also treated you well. 

78
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:13,440
 But you refused to be adopted by them. 

79
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,839
 You can only get burned greens to eat when living with me. 

80
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:19,440
 I hate demons and also humans. 

81
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,759
 I only want you. 

82
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,920
 Silly child, in the Six Realms, there are both good and bad beings. 

83
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,252
 You can't generalize them to all. 

84
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:35,600
 I have a friend named Xian Qing 

85
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,440
 who often comes to freeload but has good cooking skills. 

86
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,520
 Next time he comes, let's have him cook for us. 

87
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:45,820
 Play a game with me. 

88
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:57,320
This isn't right, the cloud pear tree wasn't there at that time.

89
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,360
 I'm still in an illusion. 

90
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,559
 My oversight. You realized it. 

91
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:07,419
 Guardian of Pureness, I underestimated you. 

92
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,900
    
 So he's just someone who uses illusions to pry into others' hearts.

93
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,920
Commonly known as a freak.

94
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,341
   
 I just mirror your thoughts. Next time... 

95
00:07:23,341 --> 00:07:25,641
You won't have another chance.

96
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:29,561
 Is that so? Then let's wait and see. 

97
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:37,700
What's wrong, Qi?

98
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,441
I'm just feeling a bit off. It's nothing.

99
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:51,098
 You've arrived. 

100
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,661
Another one of the sentries.

101
00:07:56,661 --> 00:07:58,900
I am not one of them.

102
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,460
Then what are you?

103
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,460
    
 I'm Su He, the Dragon Pool.

104
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,140
Dragon Pool?

105
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,580
I've heard each spring has its form,

106
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,101
but I never thought you could take a human form.

107
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:15,701
I am already aware of your intentions from the stream of memories.

108
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:20,120
Can you truly revive the departed?

109
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,060
I cannot revive someone without a trade-off.

110
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,160
At the cost of the existence of the wisher,

111
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,320
I can bring back the person they want.

112
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,292
The existence of the wisher? What does that mean?

113
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:45,840
The number of lives in the world is fixed and cannot be changed.

114
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,160
To resurrect the desired life, the wisher must sacrifice

115
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,241
their own life

116
00:08:59,241 --> 00:09:03,120
and all the memories associated with them.

117
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,720
Isn't this just trading one life for another?

118
00:09:10,521 --> 00:09:16,521
And after that, it will be as if the wisher never existed.

119
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:18,376
That is impossible.

120
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,961
The impact of what the wisher has done will also vanish.

121
00:09:23,961 --> 00:09:25,681
Wouldn't reality get all mixed up?

122
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:28,640
The mixed up parts will be corrected by the path of heaven.

123
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,060
The traces of the wisher's existence will naturally be overlaid by others.

124
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,801
So you mean

125
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:40,361
what that one did will be remembered as done by someone else

126
00:09:40,361 --> 00:09:43,961
and that no one will feel anything wrong.

127
00:09:43,961 --> 00:09:45,800
Exactly.

128
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,010
Jinzhao, if one day, something happens to me,

129
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,609
you must not exchange yourself for me.

130
00:09:51,609 --> 00:09:54,250
Because I don't want to forget you at all.

131
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,250
Don't talk nonsense.

132
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,890
Miss Ming, you mustn't do it.

133
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,929
If you exchange yourself for Senior Gu,

134
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:04,010
then there will be no Ming Xiu in this world.

135
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:09,750
Sister Ming Xiu, even the traces of your existence will be gone.

136
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:20,170
 The best comfort for the departed is to live well. 

137
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,170
 As long as the living inherit the wishes and beliefs of the deceased, 

138
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,650
 the deceased are in a sense resurrected, 

139
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,230
 having their lives continued. 

140
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,096
I...

141
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:38,589
will live on as the continuation of my master's life.

142
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,610
And then one day...

143
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:48,510
 we'll meet again. 

144
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:03,062
Sister Ming Xiu, being able to make such a decision,

145
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,708
you are truly remarkable.

146
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:10,528
♫  Unable to bear to see your tears flowing  ♫

147
00:11:11,656 --> 00:11:16,032
♫  Piercing deep into my heart, it tears at me  ♫

148
00:11:16,032 --> 00:11:21,708
♫  Instead why not take my doomed fate away  ♫

149
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,448
Miss Ming, I am sorry.

150
00:11:27,448 --> 00:11:33,249
♫  Like those hidden emotions, icy and piercing  ♫

151
00:11:33,249 --> 00:11:35,380
No need to apologize.

152
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,900
You need not apologize.

153
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,449
Saving everyone was my master's own decision.

154
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,749
He never resented you,

155
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,330
so I won't resent you either.

156
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:58,912
♫  How come tears suddenly shimmer in your eyes?  ♫

157
00:11:58,912 --> 00:12:04,510
♫  What was thought to be evergreen withers between my fingers  ♫

158
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:08,849
Miss Ming, thank you.

159
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,216
Why are you crying?

160
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:20,240
♫  Don't talk about who failed love  ♫

161
00:12:20,249 --> 00:12:23,989
Thank you for not resenting me.

162
00:12:23,989 --> 00:12:27,950
♫  Don't eavesdrop on me in my dreams  ♫

163
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,530
I will send you out.

164
00:12:35,072 --> 00:12:42,072
♫  In the dream, humming that tune of lovesickness  ♫

165
00:12:42,072 --> 00:12:45,730
♫  In the dream, humming that tune of lovesickness  ♫

166
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,560
This is Mount Yuqing.

167
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,129
Where are Jinzhao and Young Yue?

168
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:52,889
Didn't Su He send them back, too?

169
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,291
Where did you send them?

170
00:13:00,369 --> 00:13:03,149
I know you're here for another reason.

171
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,170
Yes,

172
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,770
I am.

173
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:15,249
There's something I want to ask you.

174
00:13:15,249 --> 00:13:19,109
You said this is where all memories of the world reside.

175
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,929
There must be memories of Qi and me. Right?

176
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:29,530
I want to know what our past was actually like.

177
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,090
You can go to the Ruins of Memory on your own.

178
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:40,170
But you will also bear the pain from your past.

179
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,530
Have you thought it through?

180
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,730
I'm not afraid.

181
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,729
Qi, are you ready?

182
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,808
   

183
00:14:05,849 --> 00:14:07,590
Do we need to make a wish to the divine tree?

184
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,450
Like the tree outside the Matchmaker's temple?

185
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,536
Let's give it a try.

186
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:28,330
Divine tree, please reveal all of my memories from three years ago.

187
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:33,350
Also, please let me retrieve my memories.

188
00:15:04,849 --> 00:15:06,712
Qi.

189
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,336
Jinzhao.

190
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:13,110
Jinzhao, look, it is working.

191
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:25,589
All these seem to be your memories.

192
00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:31,969
Is this me?

193
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,210
So this is what you looked like as a child.

194
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:40,809
You look quite cute.

195
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:49,056
Who is this person?

196
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:53,089
Probably a friend of mine from before.

197
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:06,489
You'd been together all this time.

198
00:16:07,668 --> 00:16:13,268
Yes, I really want to see what he looks like as a grown-up.

199
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:18,470
Look, that's it.

200
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:29,689
Jinzhao, this person looks like you.

201
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:46,410
This is me?

202
00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:54,710
The one who grew up with you is me?

203
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,549
Jinzhao, so these are our memories.

204
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,844
Bian Luohuan.

205
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:18,568
Bian Luohuan?

206
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,848
How could it be him?

207
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:34,956
It's all him.

208
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:40,849
Qi, what's wrong?

209
00:17:53,249 --> 00:17:55,080
Qi.

210
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:18,296
♫  One branch, two lifetimes of flowers  ♫

211
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:24,244
♫  After autumn comes spring, in the end everything falls  ♫

212
00:18:24,244 --> 00:18:29,650
♫  The sun rises, the moon sets, can they give you a tender answer?  ♫

213
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,676
Who do you see?

214
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:36,390
 Qi, who do you want to see? 

215
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,330
♫  Under the Chinese parasol tree, the raindrops pitter patter  ♫

216
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,868
Jinzhao, it seems all my memories have returned.

217
00:18:43,868 --> 00:18:48,664
♫  The branches break in exchange for memories  ♫

218
00:18:50,969 --> 00:18:53,492
What about me?

219
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:57,246
Where am I then?

220
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:05,464
♫  Wishing you a lifetime of annoyance and foolishness  ♫

221
00:19:05,464 --> 00:19:11,700
♫  Exchanging your entire past to bury it in the chaos  ♫

222
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:17,976
♫  Accompanying you through the ups and downs, following you blindly, enduring it silently  ♫

223
00:19:17,976 --> 00:19:24,056
♫  Don't be afraid, don't be afraid  ♫

224
00:19:24,056 --> 00:19:30,148
♫  Writing down each trace, each detail, each word, each line about your struggles  ♫

225
00:19:30,148 --> 00:19:36,368
♫  For you, I'm irrational and foolish  ♫

226
00:19:36,368 --> 00:19:42,952
♫  Betting your entire life, your thoughts, your heart, your hope, that one moment  ♫

227
00:19:42,952 --> 00:19:49,260
♫  Without an answer, without giving up  ♫

228
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:12,536
♫  Boundless mist and clouds, weaving a scene of falling flowers  ♫

229
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,188
She remembered after all.

230
00:20:18,188 --> 00:20:23,448
♫  Letting my worries melt into the color of blood  ♫

231
00:20:23,448 --> 00:20:28,428
♫  Can you hear the hoarse whispers?  ♫

232
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:34,772
♫  Wishing you a lifetime of annoyance and foolishness  ♫

233
00:20:34,772 --> 00:20:41,089
♫  Exchanging your entire past to bury it in the chaos  ♫

234
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:45,590
 What about me? Where are my memories? 

235
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:54,010
♫  Don't be afraid, don't be afraid  ♫

236
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:56,150
 Who exactly am I? 

237

♫  For you, I'm irrational and foolish  ♫

238

♫  Betting your entire life, your thoughts, your heart, your hope, that one moment  ♫

♫  Without an answer, without giving up  ♫

240
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:21,089
Zhaoyan. Xian Qing. Are your injuries better?

241
00:21:21,089 --> 00:21:25,070
I've taken the medicine left by Brother Hanjiang. I'm much better now. Don't worry.

242
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:29,410
Jinzhao. Young Yue. You finally came back.

243
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,224
I'm going back.

244
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:38,949
Miss Yue, are you all right?

245
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:44,270
Something happened. What about you?

246
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,810
Something happened to us too at Luo Mansion.

247
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:49,269
I'll tell you about it later.

248
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,280
How is Young Xiu?

249
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,329
She is waiting for us.

250
00:21:55,329 --> 00:21:59,429
Miss Ming gave up on exchanging herself for Senior Gu.

251
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:04,030
Young Xiu would never do anything to disappoint Brother Hanjiang.

252
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:08,610
Let's go and see Brother Hanjiang off together.

253
00:22:36,969 --> 00:22:41,569
 Master, all of a sudden, 

254
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:44,850
 I realize I'm not alone. 

255
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,189
 These guys who have been with me 

256
00:22:49,189 --> 00:22:52,590
 must be the friends you told me about before. 

257
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:58,329
 But I was slow to understand it. 
   

258
00:22:58,329 --> 00:23:00,710
 You won't blame me, will you? 

259
00:23:09,569 --> 00:23:11,416
 Master, 

260
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:16,509
 I'll live my life to the fullest, just like you would've wanted, 

261
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:19,909
 and guard Pureness forever. 

262
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:28,369
   
 Senior Gu, I will not let you down. 

263
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:31,489
 I'll forge a path of my own. 

264
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,910
Young Xiu,

265
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,760
let Brother Hanjiang rest in peace.

266
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:53,389
Master, may you rest in peace.

267
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:01,969
 Senior Gu, farewell. 

268
00:24:22,969 --> 00:24:24,824
Young Jinzhao.

269
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:35,429
If you don't respond, I'm coming in.

270
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:08,510
I heard you didn't find your memories in the Ruins of Memory.

271
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,270
You can't accept that?

272
00:25:14,329 --> 00:25:16,252
Can you?

273
00:25:18,609 --> 00:25:23,250
Past memories don't matter to me.

274
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:26,729
What does it matter if they exist or not?

275
00:25:26,729 --> 00:25:29,309
It's easier to talk.

276
00:25:34,089 --> 00:25:36,849
Alas, poor Brother Hanjiang.

277
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:40,729
He borrowed my demonic orb to extend his life for half a day,

278
00:25:40,729 --> 00:25:43,429
and all of it was used on you.

279
00:25:44,369 --> 00:25:47,270
I have let Senior Gu down.

280
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,220
Now,

281
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:55,660
I can't even call myself Yue Jinzhao rightfully.

282
00:25:56,569 --> 00:25:59,449
Nor can I rewrite my destiny as he said.

283
00:26:04,969 --> 00:26:07,789
Brother Hanjiang spoke of struggling against fate.

284
00:26:08,449 --> 00:26:12,609
Is it nonsense to you?

285
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:17,210
I don't know where I came from or why I exist at all.

286
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:21,770
Senior Gu needed to know one's birthdate

287
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:24,230
to tell someone's destiny.

288
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:29,310
Without even my birthdate, how can I talk about changing my destiny?

289
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,250
Let alone surpassing it.

290
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,656
Come with me.

291
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:53,508
Say what you just said in front of him again.

292
00:26:53,508 --> 00:26:56,410
   

293
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:59,489
He once used his life to caution you

294
00:26:59,489 --> 00:27:01,650
that no matter what setbacks you encounter,

295
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:05,269
you must continue to move forward and not fall down.

296
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:22,152
   

297
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,684
Senior  Gu,

298
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:39,389
who exactly am I?

299
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:45,509
In this world,

300
00:27:47,689 --> 00:27:50,789
does Yue Jinzhao really exist?

301
00:27:58,292 --> 00:28:01,700
   

302
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:11,470
Who exactly am I?

303
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,508
   

304
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,840
What?

305
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,570
Even you look down on me?

306
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:57,509
 The future can be changed. 

307
00:28:57,509 --> 00:28:59,468
 Even if the future is a mess, 

308
00:28:59,468 --> 00:29:03,090
 you have Miss Yue by your side. What is there to fear? 

309
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:07,609
 Take this coin as a token. Don't forget what I said today. 

310
00:29:11,351 --> 00:29:13,438
I understand now.

311
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:16,744
    
 No matter the past,

312
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,550
the future...

313
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,990
is always in my hands.

314
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,848
Okay.

315
00:29:28,584 --> 00:29:33,990
Since Heaven is unjust, I will defy it and change my fate.

316
00:29:36,936 --> 00:29:39,632
   

317
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:32,936
Blasted fate.

318
00:30:34,449 --> 00:30:39,490
From now on, I will never believe in you again.

319
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:48,990
I, Yue Jinzhao, will walk my own way!

320
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:02,630
Come on! Do you think I'd be scared of you?

321
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:11,310
Come on!

322
00:31:33,169 --> 00:31:35,116
I'm not afraid of you.

323
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:42,090
I'm not afraid of you. I'm not afraid of you!

♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

328
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:39,404
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

329
00:32:39,404 --> 00:32:43,880
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

330

♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

335

I will no longer be lost. Nor will I hesitate anymore.

I'll try hard to solve all the mysteries.

337

I will try hard to become stronger

338
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:20,030
so I can always protect you.

Uncle, why do you keep staring at me?

343
00:34:05,529 --> 00:34:07,929
I'm just surprised you would come here.

344
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:10,990
I thought you would stay with Brother Hanjiang in Mount Yuqing.

345
00:34:13,049 --> 00:34:16,649
Miss Yue and Young Master Yue ran around everywhere to help me before.

346
00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:19,030
I should accompany them here.

347
00:34:20,569 --> 00:34:22,630
You have really grown up.

348
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,869
You understand to cherish your friends.

349
00:34:27,049 --> 00:34:29,036
This is called courtesy.

350
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:33,616
Soul fish!

351
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:44,050
- I want to see Zhu Yu. 
 - Her Lordship is unavailable now.

352
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:47,950
I am the young lord of Sea of Clear Skies. You dare to stop me?

353
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,016
Zhu Yu.
