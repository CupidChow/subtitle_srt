1
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:25,100


2
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,116
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

3
00:00:31,116 --> 00:00:33,656
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

4
00:00:33,656 --> 00:00:40,564
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

5
00:00:40,564 --> 00:00:44,732
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

6
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:49,920
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,432
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

8
00:00:54,432 --> 00:00:56,732
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

9
00:00:56,732 --> 00:00:59,872
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

10
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:01,952
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

11
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:06,328
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12
00:01:06,328 --> 00:01:11,496
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

13
00:01:11,496 --> 00:01:15,384
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

14
00:01:15,384 --> 00:01:21,792
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

15
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:25,220
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

16
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:30,424
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

17
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:38,276
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

18
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,408
   

19
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:59,932
   

20
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,059
Time to eat.

21
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,780
Okay, just a second.

22
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,940
Come on.

23
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,212
Shifang, what do you want to eat?

24
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,080
Shifang, which one do you want?

25
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,099
Or this one?

26
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,220
Sir, what would you like to eat?

27
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,878
- I'll wait for the others. 
 - All right.

28
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,600
Young Zhaoyan.

29
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,120
Come sit.

30
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,360
What are you doing?

31
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,208
Enjoying the flowers.

32
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,919
Jinzhao, come eat.

33
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:39,159
Shopkeeper, we're ready to order.

34
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,848
Coming.

35
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,559
Would you like meat or vegetables?

36
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,119
Meat. He'll pay.

37
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,540
No need. Just bring us all of your best specialties.

38
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,528
Okay.

39
00:03:53,528 --> 00:03:55,680
Wait. Two shares of each.

40
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,360
Okay.

41
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:01,599
Shopkeeper, there are mosquitoes here.

42
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,439
Light some mugwort.

43
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:06,720
Yes, right away.

44
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,440
Young Yue.

45
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,739
You wanted Dou Bao to shoot flames.

46
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:20,219
I worked on the design all night yesterday. Look.

47
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,519
You are in a good mood for a prisoner, Physician Bian.

48
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,384
This flower is called Yexiang.

49
00:04:27,384 --> 00:04:31,779
When the flowers bloom, their branches and leaves have a calming effect.

50
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:35,440
Would you like to try, Brother Xian Qing?

51
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,779
No, thank you.

52
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,332
Look.

53
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,809
Here, and here. 
    

54
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:58,039
Excuse me. Are you all staying for the night?

55
00:04:59,301 --> 00:05:01,640
No, we are just eat–

56
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,559
Young Zhaoyan?

57
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:09,978
Zhaoyan, are you okay?

58
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,756
How are you?

59
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:19,039
It's nothing. I just need to rest a bit.

60
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,692
It's not good to be stubborn.

61
00:05:21,692 --> 00:05:23,319
We should stay and rest.

62
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:27,139
We have only three rooms left. You'll have to share.

63
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,859
Young Zhaoyan is not feeling well.

64
00:05:32,859 --> 00:05:34,919
I'll take care of him. We share one room.

65
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,161
- Senior. 
 - Come.

66
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:37,859
Senior...

67
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,440
Please follow me.

68
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,360
It has nothing to do with me.

69
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,240
Your saying so doesn't count.

70
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,280
Shifang, follow him.

71
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,880
Okay, let's go.

72
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,160
Zhaoyan suffers from an illness, yet he was so strong on the journey.

73
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,480
He's worthy to be the master of the Luo family.

74
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,319
He was fine before, but fell ill twice today.

75
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,399
Is it because he got too tired?

76
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,684
I can give you other flowers, but not this one.

77
00:06:58,487 --> 00:07:00,119
Senior.

78
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,408
I have something to discuss with you. Let's talk outside.

79
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:21,420
Stay put here. Don't try any tricks.

80
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:30,920
Brother Ju, care for some tea?

81
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:35,079
I will not accept an enemy's kindness.

82
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,679
Aren't you tired of staring at me all the time?

83
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:51,449
Jinzhao gave me this task. I cannot fail him.

84
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,672
Maiming.

85
00:08:18,672 --> 00:08:20,396
 Zhaoyan. 

86
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:24,190
 The curse acted up today. 

87
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,220
You had to suffer with me.

88
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:29,804
It's all right.

89
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:33,760
Your days are numbered.

90
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,299
Why aren't you looking to lift the curse?

91
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:47,250
You won't change your mind, and neither will I.

92
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,792
 Young Zhaoyan. 

93
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:52,992
Let's talk later.

94
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,600
 Young Zhaoyan? 

95
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:06,400
Young Zhaoyan?

96
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,100
You do call her quite affectionately.

97
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,336
Young Zhaoyan?

98
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,839
Senior, I am fine now.

99
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:22,339
I just need to rest for a bit.

100
00:09:26,134 --> 00:09:29,573
Young Xiu is here, let her have a look.

101
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:39,655
Jinzhao, why can't we talk in the room and have to come here?

102
00:09:39,655 --> 00:09:41,559
There could be someone listening.

103
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,559
Bian Luohuan left this last night.

104
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,380
The same pattern as my hair tie.

105
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,020
I suspect he has something to do with your background.

106
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:05,540
No wonder I feel that he somewhat resembles the master in my dreams.

107
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,100
Qi.

108
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,550
How about we test him tonight?

109
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:53,027
You are physically weak and just need to rest well.

110
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,108
Thank you, Miss Ming.

111
00:10:55,108 --> 00:10:57,800
Get some rest then, Young Zhaoyan.

112
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,640
Thank you, Senior.

113
00:11:21,957 --> 00:11:23,620
Young Xiu.

114
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,670
It seemed you had more to say.

115
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:32,519
Luo Zhaoyan's vitality is continuously diminishing,

116
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,959
like it's being devoured by something.

117
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:41,195
Rather than a chronic disease, it's more like a curse.

118
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:47,820
Is the early demise of the Luo family's twins related to a curse?

119
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:54,247
Also, when I cast the spell on her, I noticed you transferred your cultivation to her again.

120
00:11:54,247 --> 00:12:00,010
Senior Uncle, do not forget that you almost died for her 20 years ago.

121
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,499
I spent my centennial energy on her and her brother.

122
00:12:03,499 --> 00:12:09,120
I don't want to let her just die.

123
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,107
Is that all?

124
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,590
A thousand-year-old wolf demon who claims to be without desires,

125
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:20,309
why do you care so much about Luo Zhaoyan?

126
00:12:21,172 --> 00:12:25,551
A thousand years of having no desires is exactly why one seeks fun.

127
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:29,459
This is your affair, not mine.

128
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,544
I'm just reminding you.

129
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:35,643
Don't get injured and make my master worry.

130
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:41,718
You grew up with Brother Hanjiang.

131
00:12:41,718 --> 00:12:45,566
Why do you only talk about the master?

132
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:49,345
Miss Ming, you are here.

133
00:12:49,345 --> 00:12:51,585
Senior Xian Qing, is Zhaoyan all right?

134
00:12:51,585 --> 00:12:54,265
Nothing serious, he just needs to rest well.

135
00:12:54,265 --> 00:12:56,060
The thing you asked for.

136
00:12:56,654 --> 00:12:58,565
- Thank you. 
 - What is this?

137
00:12:58,565 --> 00:13:01,996
Secret. Let's go. We can switch shifts now.

138
00:13:01,996 --> 00:13:03,830
We are leaving.

139
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,140
Hey, don't forget what I told you.

140
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,945
If anything happens, remember to use...

141
00:13:12,945 --> 00:13:15,265
Mindlink.

142
00:13:15,265 --> 00:13:18,060
Are you hungry? Want some egg noodles?

143
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,074
Go.

144
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,598
   

145
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,306
Miss Yue, would you like to play?

146
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,006
Sure.

147
00:14:04,626 --> 00:14:08,605
Your style of play is indeed unique.

148
00:14:28,426 --> 00:14:30,280
Physician Bian,

149
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:35,240
did you leave this at Luo Mansion?

150
00:14:38,866 --> 00:14:40,662
It's not mine.

151
00:14:40,662 --> 00:14:42,285
You're lying.

152
00:14:42,285 --> 00:14:48,005
Jinzhao said he saw this straw-woven fish falling from you.

153
00:14:49,712 --> 00:14:53,013
Since you know, why did you ask?

154
00:14:54,206 --> 00:14:59,986
Because you resemble someone I know from my dreams.

155
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:04,646
There's someone in my dreams whose face I can't see.

156
00:15:04,646 --> 00:15:09,106
He wears the same style of clothing as yours.

157
00:15:09,106 --> 00:15:12,825
But in my dreams, he's very good to me.

158
00:15:12,825 --> 00:15:16,966
He teaches me swordsmanship and wisdom.

159
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,905
So I wonder if he could be my master.

160
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,385
Everyone has dreams.

161
00:15:35,385 --> 00:15:38,866
Like you, if everyone took their dreams as real,

162
00:15:38,866 --> 00:15:40,725
their lives would be in total disarray.

163
00:15:40,725 --> 00:15:44,485
No. I'm certain I have a master.

164
00:15:45,805 --> 00:15:47,315
This was given to me by my master.

165
00:15:47,315 --> 00:15:50,615
It's woven just like your straw-woven fish.

166
00:16:04,585 --> 00:16:09,286
Is your master important to you?

167
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:20,100
The master in my dream is very warm

168
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,090
and kind.

169
00:16:22,778 --> 00:16:25,486
He must be very important.

170
00:16:27,465 --> 00:16:31,825
And more importantly, as long as I find my master,

171
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:35,145
Jinzhao and I will be able to resolve...

172
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:39,340
Resolve...

173
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:43,130
♫  Behind the mask are deep feelings  ♫

174
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,626
 Have you thought about this? 

175
00:16:45,626 --> 00:16:49,945
If one day, your master really does come looking for you,

176
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,126
will you go with him?

177
00:16:53,126 --> 00:17:00,938
♫  I'm destined to brave all the dangers for you  ♫

178
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:09,054
♫  Even if fate cannot be escaped in the end  ♫

179
00:17:09,054 --> 00:17:17,406
♫  Staking everything just to feel the resonance of our souls  ♫

180
00:17:17,406 --> 00:17:21,306
I'm hungry. Why isn't Jinzhao here yet?

181
00:17:24,825 --> 00:17:28,426
It seems Brother Yue is really good to you.

182
00:17:28,426 --> 00:17:33,226
Good? Jinzhao is a real penny-pincher.

183
00:17:33,226 --> 00:17:35,835
 He always nags me for spending too much money. 

184
00:17:35,835 --> 00:17:39,636
And he always calls me a gluttonous fish.

185
00:17:39,636 --> 00:17:45,485
Every time I have egg noodles, he always snatches my eggs.

186
00:17:49,505 --> 00:17:54,525
Jinzhao, why are you standing here? Why don't you go in?

187
00:18:06,746 --> 00:18:10,665
Qi, let's go out to eat.

188
00:18:10,665 --> 00:18:12,025
I haven't finished yet.

189
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:16,808
Physician Bian, tell me. Where did you get this straw-woven fish?

190
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,546
Everyone in my hometown can make it.

191
00:18:22,546 --> 00:18:26,126
The pattern is all the same.

192
00:18:34,165 --> 00:18:37,505
Jinzhao. Jinzhao!

193
00:19:47,746 --> 00:19:51,026
Jinzhao, are you angry?

194
00:19:55,425 --> 00:19:59,605
I was just joking. There are a lot of "buts."

195
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:03,642
But what?

196
00:20:05,506 --> 00:20:08,046
But Jinzhao is very smart.

197
00:20:08,046 --> 00:20:11,966
He can solve all problems.

198
00:20:11,966 --> 00:20:18,056
Jinzhao is very brave. No matter what danger arises, he is always the first to protect me.

199
00:20:21,565 --> 00:20:24,883
Although Jinzhao is very stingy,

200
00:20:24,883 --> 00:20:27,906
as long as he has one copper coin,

201
00:20:27,906 --> 00:20:31,425
he buys me egg noodles and takes me to see the sea of flowers

202
00:20:31,425 --> 00:20:34,326
and the glowing butterflies.

203
00:20:40,065 --> 00:20:43,985
Jinzhao, don't be angry. Okay?

204
00:20:43,985 --> 00:20:46,726
I'm not angry. Why would I be angry?

205
00:20:46,726 --> 00:20:50,486
You're lying. You are angry.

206
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,845
Well, I am not angry now.

207
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,106
How did your questioning go?

208
00:21:03,106 --> 00:21:04,882
What?

209
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,346
Is Bian Luohuan your master or not?

210
00:21:10,725 --> 00:21:14,246
I think he isn't.

211
00:21:14,246 --> 00:21:16,266
You heard it, too.

212
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:21,585
That straw-woven fish is common in his hometown.

213
00:21:26,126 --> 00:21:28,705
I should have asked him myself.

214
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:31,306
The straw-woven fish doesn't prove anything.

215
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,110
Qi.

216
00:21:43,626 --> 00:21:48,086
Is it important to find the master in your dream?

217
00:21:48,086 --> 00:21:53,662
Of course, haven't we been searching for our origins?

218
00:21:53,662 --> 00:21:57,825
What will you do after you find your origins?

219
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,140
Jinzhao, you're acting weird.

220
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,800
What do you mean?

221
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,422
♫  When insomnia sets in, my cautiousness disappears  ♫

222
00:22:10,422 --> 00:22:13,782
♫  When insomnia sets in, my cautiousness disappears  ♫

223
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:18,185
If one day you find the master in your dreams,

224
00:22:20,065 --> 00:22:22,180
will you go with him?

225
00:22:23,526 --> 00:22:25,906
 Have you thought about this? 

226
00:22:25,906 --> 00:22:30,166
 If one day, your master really does come looking for you, 

227
00:22:31,646 --> 00:22:33,794
 will you go with him? 

228
00:22:35,514 --> 00:22:41,170
♫  We're like two ends of a story  ♫

229
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:44,246
♫  Separated by an ocean  ♫

230
00:22:44,246 --> 00:22:46,070
♫  The wind still blows  ♫

♫  If only time would stop for me, at the crossroads of parting  ♫

239
00:23:10,226 --> 00:23:12,766
How did I suddenly get a fever?

240
00:23:18,785 --> 00:23:20,534
Young Zhaoyan.

241
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,945
I asked the shopkeeper for ice.

242
00:23:26,945 --> 00:23:30,205
After applying it, it'll help lower your temperature.

243
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,834
Do it yourself.

244
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,690
Thank you, Senior.

245
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:01,806
I talked to Young Jinzhao and the others.

246
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:04,066
We'll set off later tomorrow.

247
00:24:04,066 --> 00:24:08,146
No need! I'm much better now. Don't let me slow you down.

248
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:11,776
I said it's not good to be stubborn.

249
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,922
You need rest.

250
00:24:15,006 --> 00:24:18,026
 Re-Rest... 

251
00:24:41,585 --> 00:24:43,825
I feel much better now.

252
00:24:43,825 --> 00:24:47,146
Senior, you take the bed. I'll sleep on the floor.

253
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,425
I just noticed the moonlight is beautiful tonight.

254
00:25:05,425 --> 00:25:07,153
I want to go out for a walk.

255
00:25:07,153 --> 00:25:11,013
Don't wait up for me. Go to sleep.

256
00:25:55,806 --> 00:25:57,386
Sister Ming Xiu.

257
00:25:57,386 --> 00:25:59,226
Are you hungry?

258
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:05,466
I don't think about food all the time.

259
00:26:09,106 --> 00:26:11,146
What happened?

260
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:16,620
Jinzhao just asked me...

261
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:22,482
if I'll go with the master in my dreams when I find him.

262
00:26:23,785 --> 00:26:25,925
How did you answer?

263
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:30,146
I don't know.

264
00:26:30,146 --> 00:26:34,766
I've never thought about that.

265
00:26:34,766 --> 00:26:38,426
Why would Jinzhao ask such a strange question?

266
00:26:39,845 --> 00:26:41,946
People become insecure...

267
00:26:43,266 --> 00:26:46,166
when it comes to someone important.

268
00:27:00,354 --> 00:27:03,153
Where did this dog come from?

269
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,300
Woof. Woof.

270
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,585
Bark.

271
00:27:09,585 --> 00:27:11,785
I'll give you a chicken leg.

272
00:27:11,785 --> 00:27:14,566
It likes spicy food.

273
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,274
Really?

274
00:27:17,026 --> 00:27:18,842
Yes.

275
00:27:18,842 --> 00:27:23,525
Bark and I'll give you the spiciest chicken leg.

276
00:27:26,926 --> 00:27:29,785
Why would a dog meow like a cat?

277
00:27:34,346 --> 00:27:37,346
- Mother. 
 - Mother.

278
00:27:37,346 --> 00:27:40,346
- Mother. 
 - Mother.

279
00:27:40,346 --> 00:27:42,926
You are cruel, Young Xiu.

280
00:27:42,926 --> 00:27:45,694
You know I hate spicy food.

281
00:27:45,694 --> 00:27:50,355
Human younglings are such nuisances.

282
00:27:50,355 --> 00:27:55,086
Right, humans can never be as interesting as your Young Zhaoyan.

283
00:27:55,086 --> 00:27:56,954
That's for sure.

284
00:29:57,242 --> 00:30:00,086
   

285
00:30:05,746 --> 00:30:08,647
- Good morning, everyone. 
 - Morning. 
 - Morning.

286
00:30:12,226 --> 00:30:16,226
Young Zhaoyan, did you rest well last night?

287
00:30:16,226 --> 00:30:17,665
He must have.

288
00:30:17,665 --> 00:30:22,665
There was a watchdog last night guarding Master Luo's door.

289
00:30:24,766 --> 00:30:28,585
Senior Xian Qing, where did you go last night? You didn't come back.

290
00:30:29,906 --> 00:30:31,834
Sorry, Senior.

291
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:36,393
You are always so courteous.

292
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:45,298
All right, let's go.

293
00:30:45,298 --> 00:30:48,420
   

294
00:30:59,626 --> 00:31:01,462
 Stop! 

295
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:06,446
 You think you can leave so easily? 

296
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,966
How dare you lot kidnap Lord Shengxuan?

297
00:31:16,966 --> 00:31:21,286
Release him now, and I'll spare you three dogs' lives.

298
00:31:21,286 --> 00:31:22,866
There are seven of them.

299
00:31:22,866 --> 00:31:24,406
You dogs' seven lives.

300
00:31:24,406 --> 00:31:26,646
My Lord, Lord Shengxuan is among them too.

301
00:31:26,646 --> 00:31:29,326
Lord Shengxuan as well.

302
00:31:29,326 --> 00:31:31,865
Shut up.

303
00:31:32,585 --> 00:31:34,766
We do have a dog here though.

304
00:31:34,766 --> 00:31:36,825
Don't be naughty, Young Xiu.

305
00:31:36,825 --> 00:31:39,725
Disappear, scram.

306
00:31:39,725 --> 00:31:43,506
Lord Shengxuan, we are here to rescue you.

307
00:31:46,346 --> 00:31:50,246
They call you Shengxuan. Do you still deny your ties with the Qiyuan Sect?

308
00:31:50,246 --> 00:31:53,785
You lied. You are a bad person from the Qiyuan Sect.

309
00:31:53,785 --> 00:31:58,825
Miss Yue, can one really tell the good from bad?

310
00:31:58,825 --> 00:32:03,245
You brat, that's dangerous. Put your sword down.

311
00:32:03,245 --> 00:32:05,965
If you release him, I might spare you.

312
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:09,445
Otherwise, I'll show you that you are playing with fire.

313
00:32:09,445 --> 00:32:12,426
- And asking for your death. 
 - And asking for your death!

314
00:32:12,426 --> 00:32:14,206
- I told you to disappear. 
 - Right.

315
00:32:14,206 --> 00:32:16,645
Your death, you mean!

316
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:19,215
Why have you captured so many people?

317
00:32:19,215 --> 00:32:24,115
Do you expect these disciples to save you?

318
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,870
Physician Bian, why are you silent?

319
00:32:29,565 --> 00:32:32,865
Is there something on your mind? Let me guess.

320
00:32:32,865 --> 00:32:38,810
Are you wondering why the poison on us hasn't acted yet?

321
00:32:40,065 --> 00:32:43,646
You sprinkled Mingxin Fragrance on the flowers' pistils, right?

322
00:32:44,485 --> 00:32:46,394
 Look at this flower. 

323
00:32:50,266 --> 00:32:53,466
 Bian Luohuan was holding this very flower. 

324
00:32:53,466 --> 00:32:55,745
 Is there something suspicious? 

325
00:32:55,745 --> 00:32:58,386
 I compared this flower's pistil with others. 

326
00:32:58,386 --> 00:33:01,165
 This one has clearly more pollen. 

327
00:33:04,406 --> 00:33:06,805
 Bian Luohuan is skilled in medicine. 

328
00:33:06,805 --> 00:33:09,685
 Could it be that he sprinkled pollen on them? 

329
00:33:09,685 --> 00:33:13,386
 I think so. Moreover, there are no mosquitoes in this inn, 

330
00:33:13,386 --> 00:33:16,666
 but he asked the manager to light up the mugwort. 

331
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:21,182
 I'll send a message to Young Xiu 

332
00:33:21,182 --> 00:33:25,705
 and have her find out what kind of poison is related to mugwort. 

333
00:33:25,705 --> 00:33:30,546
 I'll ask her to bring the antidote. We should notify the others, too. 

334
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,810
Mingxin Fragrance combined with mugwort...

335
00:33:37,465 --> 00:33:39,445
will affect a person within a day.

336
00:33:39,445 --> 00:33:43,706
When one tries to use power, it will temporarily sap their strength.

337
00:33:44,485 --> 00:33:47,626
It seems I have underestimated you.

338
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:50,845
All right, all right, brat! Have you said enough?

339
00:33:50,845 --> 00:33:54,146
Put your sword down.

340
00:33:54,146 --> 00:33:55,767
This is the last warning.

341
00:33:55,767 --> 00:34:00,085
If you don't release Lord Shengxuan now, you won't go back alive.

342
00:34:00,085 --> 00:34:01,674
Qi.

343
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,906
Retreat! Tactical retreat!

344
00:34:27,286 --> 00:34:29,360
A disorderly mob.

345
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:32,106
They overrated themselves.

346
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:40,030
Everyone.

347
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,490
Please leave our third brother.

348
00:34:53,705 --> 00:34:56,126
Second Sister. Xiaoyuan.

349
00:34:59,746 --> 00:35:01,386
So you were waiting for them?

350
00:35:01,386 --> 00:35:04,595
Brother Luo's sudden illness yesterday was also your doing.

351
00:35:04,595 --> 00:35:06,986
It was to buy time.

352
00:35:06,986 --> 00:35:12,526
Mingxin Fragrance mixed with Yexiang Flower can cause the sickly to fall ill.

353
00:35:12,526 --> 00:35:18,026
Thank you for the lesson. I'll remember this for Young Zhaoyan.

354
00:35:19,226 --> 00:35:21,505
Release my third brother!

355
00:35:33,545 --> 00:35:35,626
Xiaoyuan, don't forget your mission.

356
00:35:35,626 --> 00:35:37,266
Understood.

357
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:47,426
 How can she be so strong at such a young age? 

358
00:36:08,745 --> 00:36:10,386
Careful!

359
00:36:18,286 --> 00:36:22,106
Young Zhaoyan, are you protecting me?

360
00:36:22,106 --> 00:36:25,265
Senior, now is not the time for chatter.

361
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,866
We will live or die together.

362
00:36:36,006 --> 00:36:38,086
Showy tricks!

363
00:36:42,286 --> 00:36:45,146
Xiaohuan, let's go.

364
00:37:53,386 --> 00:37:54,822
Qi.

365
00:38:09,846 --> 00:38:11,885
So annoying!

366
00:38:22,946 --> 00:38:24,862
Senior.

367
00:38:24,862 --> 00:38:27,526
Don't be stubborn. You can't defeat her.

368
00:38:27,526 --> 00:38:29,745
I must fight her anyway.

369
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,130
Young Zhaoyan,

370
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,540
I am a demon.

371
00:39:29,032 --> 00:39:30,613
Qi!

372
00:39:32,985 --> 00:39:34,574
Go!

373
00:39:37,545 --> 00:39:39,786
Jinzhao!

374
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:55,030


375
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:05,386
♫  Looking back upon the past  ♫

376
00:40:05,386 --> 00:40:09,302
♫  Searching for that moment from the past  ♫
