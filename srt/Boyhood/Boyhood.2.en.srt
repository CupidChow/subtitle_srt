BOYHOOD

00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,120
"Jung Gyeong-tae"?

3
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,420
It's Jang Byeong-tae.

4
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,880
I'm saying the patient's name
is Jung Gyeong-tae.

5
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,430
ASAN BUKSAN HIGH SCHOOL
JUNG GYEONG-TAE

00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,350
Buyeo

7
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,890
is ours now, got it?

8
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,560
Let's whoop those bastards
from Technical and Commercial High!

9
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,610
This is our chance

10
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,320
to make this place ours!

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,950
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

12
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,280
Let's get it!

13
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,960
We got the White Tiger of Asan
on our side.

14
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,290
Buyeo is finally ours now.

15
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,330
Am I right?

16
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,800
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

17
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:42,270
EPISODE 2. MY DEAR,
DO NOT CROSS THAT RIVER

18
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,580
So how's school treating you?

19
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Well, it's just like how it always was...

20
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,970
That's what I thought,

21
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,340
but the kids are nice.

22
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,010
They are, right?

23
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,140
Life treats you how you treat it.

24
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,730
Ask your dad
to set up breakfast later, okay?

25
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,110
I made the food already.

26
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,610
YAKULT

27
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:25,900
Got it?

28
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,360
- Okay.
- I'm going.

29
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,960
I'm not the White Tiger of Asan.

30
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,380
I'm Jang Byeong-tae, the Loser of Onyang.

31
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,260
Write down what I say, okay?

32
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,840
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

33
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,050
Father.

34
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,470
Father.

35
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,940
Mother.

36
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,400
Mother.

37
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,280
Republic of Korea.

38
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,780
Republic of Korea.

39
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,660
There's only one reason

40
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,870
you get whooped.

41
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,950
Your arm's on my desk.

42
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,370
My bad, I didn't mean to.

43
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,380
That don't mean it's okay.

44
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,550
It's simply because they do so.

45
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,840
Then I found out there are various reasons

46
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,010
why someone would whoop you.

47
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,680
I didn't see anything.

48
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,180
No way.

49
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,940
Your eyes were wide open.

50
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,310
I got whooped because my eyes were open.

51
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,830
Why do you breathe so loudly?

52
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,660
I got whooped for breathing.

53
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,290
I spent my whole life getting whooped.

54
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,050
So what's happening to me right now?

55
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,390
Just wait a bit.

56
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,690
The fish is almost done.

57
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,230
Goodness, fish for breakfast?

58
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,070
This is why you gotta be
blessed by your ancestors.

59
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,410
Sang-gyo's grandfather worked for Japan
when they colonized us.

60
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,700
He'd take independence fighters,
lock them up, and torture them.

61
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,460
He just got mixed up with the wrong crowd.

62
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,590
You don't get mixed up
and become a traitor.

63
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,550
That don't make sense.

64
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,760
Listen, Byeong-tae.
His grandfather was quite something.

65
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,390
He was one of a kind.

66
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:02,180
He traveled all over the country
rounding up independence fighters,

67
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:06,560
pushing back Joseon's independence
by around 20 years.

68
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,980
We could've been free
after the March 1st Movement,

69
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,360
but this man's grandfather,

70
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,160
the great Nakamura Park,

71
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,160
rounded all our fighters up
and screwed our country over.

72
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,450
Shut it.

73
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,120
- Just eat, will you?
- I am.

74
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,040
Here.

75
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,050
Eat up.

76
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,800
Isn't it time you got a job, Hak-su?

77
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,930
It's a pity seeing Mi-yeong go to work
at the crack of dawn.

78
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,060
When are you gon' stop lounging around?

79
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,190
Let me think.

80
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,980
I can't remember
if Sun-deok's mom committed theft

81
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,610
or something else.

82
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,660
- Who are you talking about?
- What?

83
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,160
Sun-deok.

84
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,570
You know, Sun-deok's mom.

85
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,410
No. That's not it.

86
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,790
Damn it.

87
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,920
- I got a fishbone in my throat.
- What's wrong?

88
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,840
- Eat some rice.
- Wait.

89
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,390
Ji-yeong,

90
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,470
get me some water, will you?

91
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:23,720
Okay.

92
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,350
It's stuck good.

93
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,060
Byeong-tae, you should go too.

94
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,150
I'll be back.

95
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,490
- He was still eating.
- Shut your trap.

96
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,700
He's growing, and he's gotta eat.

97
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,950
You afraid you gon' run out?

98
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,660
You wanna see someone faint or something?

99
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,660
I got it.

100
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,870
You might shock Ji-yeong
and things could go bad.

101
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,330
What you gon' do if she
misses out on college because of it?

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,670
She has to go to college!

103
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,500
So watch your damn mouth!

104
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,170
YAKULT

105
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,680
LET'S BE FARMERS WHO SHINE THE COUNTRY
I told y'all this already,

106
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,350
but dairy cattle come in different types.

107
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,520
What do you call the most common one?

108
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,360
- Holstein.
- Holstein.

109
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,740
Holstein.

110
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,570
Now, the second most common one.

111
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,120
What's this brown one called?

112
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,780
Jersey.

113
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,750
- Jersey.
- Jersey.

114
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,750
- Jersey.
- Jersey.

115
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,670
What's different about Jersey cows...

116
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,750
The fact that these filthy guys

117
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,050
gave me a welcome party

118
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,970
is an honor I won't ever forget.

119
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,430
How great would it be
if I were the White Tiger of Asan

120
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,520
y'all are looking for?

121
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,850
I'm sorry, but I ain't it.

122
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,400
I'm just Bum-tae, the Loser of Onyang,

123
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,150
who always got beat up.

124
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,070
- I got it!
- Good!

125
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,490
Here, White Tiger!

126
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,120
Get it, White Tiger.

127
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,290
- Kick the ball forward.
- What?

128
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,660
Keep going.

129
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,670
- Aim for the goal!
- Go!

130
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,000
Out of the way, bastard!

131
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,720
Get a load of this!

132
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:38,690
Shoot!

133
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,500
Why'd you catch the ball?

134
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,350
What was that?

135
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,480
Byeong-tae,
you the fake White Tiger or something?

136
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,730
How'd you get wiped out
by a loser like Hoddeok?

137
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,440
Gosh, my face hurts.

138
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,900
This is hilarious.

139
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,910
Isn't this funny?

140
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,620
Look at him.

141
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,630
GRADE 11 CLASS 3
ANIMAL HUSBANDRY

142
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,170
What are you eating?

143
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,880
Do you have eggs?

144
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,550
Of course, I do!

145
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,220
You okay?

146
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,590
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,850
I get all riled up
when I see a soccer ball.

148
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:56,060
You a dog or something?

149
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,190
It's okay, I'm fine.

150
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,100
Okay.

151
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,650
By the way, do you remember me at all?

152
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,280
What do you mean?

153
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,450
I saw you at the arcade.

154
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,700
- Hey!
- Get him!

155
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,120
You fought with middle schoolers.

156
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,120
That's news to me.

157
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,880
I swear it was you.

158
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,130
I'm certain you got scared and ran--

159
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,920
Shut the hell up.

160
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,960
Your mouth's for eating, not talking.

161
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,260
Hey, Byeong-tae.

162
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,640
You know what this is?

163
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,100
It's all over the television.

164
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,430
These little things
are what they call Vienna sausages.

165
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,480
Try it.

166
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,640
Wait a minute.

167
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,940
Why are you giving me this?

168
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,940
You're the White Tiger of Asan!

169
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,490
This is drivin' me nuts.

170
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,240
Sausages ain't your thing?

171
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,160
It ain't like that.

172
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,000
I don't know what you like.

173
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,580
I said it ain't like that.

174
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,120
I like sausages.

175
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,170
- Here then.
- Stop it!

176
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,750
I'm seriously going nuts.

177
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,260
- Listen.
- Yeah?

178
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,720
I got something to say.

179
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,140
- I ain't...
- What?

180
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,890
I ain't...

181
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,390
I...

182
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:28,650
I ain't sure I should tell you
this now as it could lead

183
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,860
to all sorts of violence.

184
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,820
- Violence?
- Serious violence.

185
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,200
I don't know what it's about,

186
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,410
but we should talk about it
some other time.

187
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,500
I don't think I'll be able to eat.

188
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,790
I'll get Cheol-hong and the boys together,

189
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,550
so just tell us then.

190
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,890
Something's real fishy about him.

191
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,810
BUYEO AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOL
WRESTLING CLUB

192
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,350
I'm good.

193
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,710
It's freezing today.

194
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,420
You don't smoke, do you?

195
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,470
The thing is...

196
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,890
- I'm...
- What?

197
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,440
I'm...

198
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,780
- I'm not the White...
- Byeong-tae, what's going on?

199
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,450
What happened that got you
talking about violence and all?

200
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,370
Did we do something wrong?

201
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,370
You can tell us.

202
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,840
What on earth pissed you off?

203
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,470
Here's the thing.

204
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,890
The White Tiger of Asan

205
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:28,730
- ain't...
- Wait!

206
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,270
Damn it.

207
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,650
I know.

208
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,910
Say no more, Byeong-tae.

209
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,880
I already know how you must've felt.

210
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,510
It couldn't have been easy.

211
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,800
Exactly!

212
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,550
You got no idea.

213
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,930
Damn.

214
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,390
By the way...

215
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,480
how did you know?

216
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,230
Your eyes

217
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,190
told me all I needed to know.

218
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,450
Too bad.

219
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,240
You need a good beating.

220
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,580
Okay.

221
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,460
You damn bastard.

222
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,590
How dare you
doubt the White Tiger of Asan?

223
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,550
He ain't someone you should doubt!

224
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,680
You should know better

225
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,180
than to make a fool of yourself
without having to witness

226
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,310
what happened to Dong-je,
Sun-haeng, and Un-ho with your own eyes.

227
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,530
I'll apologize on his behalf.

228
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:06,450
You must've felt like crap,

229
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:10,000
but you still tried to
talk it out like a gentleman.

230
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,580
I gotta discipline my boys more.

231
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,920
I'm sorry, all right?

232
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,760
- Let's go.
- Okay.

233
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,730
I'm gon' lose my mind.

234
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,610
Jeez.

235
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,070
Those punks are nuts!

236
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,620
March!

237
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:51,750
Left foot.

238
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,460
Homeroom rep Lee Sang-hyo.

239
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,840
Attention. Bow.

240
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,550
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

241
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,720
- Bum-tae.
- Yeah?

242
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,980
So you're Bum-tae?

243
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,400
Didn't they call you that at Onyang?

244
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,400
How on earth do you know that?

245
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,690
You know,

246
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,700
I live right next to you.

247
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,490
Don't be ridiculous.

248
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,370
Now you listen to me good.

249
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,830
If Byeong-tae
wasn't so busy getting whooped,

250
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,620
he'd be able to go to college as well.

251
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,290
College ain't special.

252
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,210
- Not anyone can go.
- Jeez.

253
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,300
- My goodness.
- Why's he there?

254
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,550
Bum-tae.

255
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,720
Are you not gon' say goodbye to your dad?

256
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,140
- I did, but you didn't hear it.
- Is that so?

257
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,060
And stop calling me that.

258
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,100
How many times do I gotta tell you

259
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,560
that kids in Oyang called me that
to mock me?

260
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,190
I heard you talking to your dad.

261
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,360
I'm quite curious what would happen
if the truth came out.

262
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,540
Get on my good side,

263
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,760
and I'll consider taking this
with me to the grave.

264
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,380
Or maybe I won't.

265
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,350
Anyway, think about it.

266
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,150
Oh, no.

267
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,860
I'm sorry, it was an accident.

268
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,530
You fucker.

269
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,740
Saying sorry don't mean a damn thing.

270
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,290
I'm sorry.

271
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,120
Motherfucker.

272
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,290
You think I want an apology?

273
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,210
I told you

274
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,500
to be damn careful.

275
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,010
I told you to watch out

276
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,050
just in case
you piss me the hell off, you--

277
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,260
That's enough.

278
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,350
It was an accident.

279
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,230
I'm teaching these dorks a lesson.

280
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,070
Stay out of it, all right?

281
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,110
I said, that's enough.

282
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,450
I'm the White Tiger of Asan.

283
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,410
No.

284
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,210
I'm certain
you ain't the White Tiger of Asan.

285
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,420
Am I screwed?

286
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,640
I see he's nervous.

287
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,010
The White Tiger of Asan don't get nervous.

288
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,350
He ain't the White Tiger of Asan.

289
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,810
He's a fake.

290
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,730
Yeah, I'm screwed.

291
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,110
All right.

292
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:09,650
I might as well end my crappy life here.

293
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,280
I had a good run.

294
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,740
What the hell you doing?

295
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,700
You crazy?

296
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,750
What now? You want a piece of me?

297
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,370
I gotta clean today.

298
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,710
What?

299
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,460
So you wanna fight
after you're done or what?

300
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,050
Are you gonna wait?

301
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,220
I can't wait too long.

302
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,300
We'll fight when you're done, shithead.

303
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,720
All right, shithead.

304
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,060
- Just you and me.
- All right then.

305
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,640
Of course, no problem, you shithead.

306
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,270
You and me. Compost storage.

307
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,060
Shithead.

308
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,690
You nuts?

309
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,440
It's fine.

310
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,820
It don't matter how, we all die anyway.

311
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,990
The great Admiral Yi once said...

312
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,700
Basically, if you try to die, you'll live.

313
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,500
And if you try to live, you'll die.

314
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,920
If I kick the White Tiger's ass,
I'll be king of Buyeo.

315
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,630
Just wait and see.

316
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,130
Are you actually nuts?

317
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,840
I can see it in your eyes.

318
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:15,430
Suit yourself, man.

319
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,070
You bastard.

320
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,110
You can't smoke for crap.

321
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,990
Everything scares the lights out of you.

322
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,330
I saw everything.

323
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,790
Just spit it out.

324
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,460
You ain't the White Tiger, are you?

325
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,630
What the hell's going on?

326
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,420
They ain't doin' nothing but talking.

327
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,140
My plans are gon' be all messed up

328
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,890
if things play out that way.

329
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,890
Where the hell you come from?

330
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,390
Who said you could be here, you bastard?

331
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,980
If I beat the White Tiger of Asan...

332
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,780
I get to be the White Tiger of Buyeo.

333
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,320
You darn bastard.

334
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,290
Let's play Cham, Cham, Cham.

335
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,460
Cham, cham, cham.

336
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,180
I was right.

337
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,550
You ain't the White Tiger of Asan.

338
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,900
There was never such a thing
to begin with.

339
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,690
I'm right, ain't I?

340
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,860
You spread the rumor,

341
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,530
so you could take it easy as the new kid.

342
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,410
You bastard!

343
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,750
Get off me!

344
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,090
They're still at it.

345
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,720
They're still talking.

346
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,550
My god.

347
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,300
Stay right here.

348
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,300
Even if I kick your ass today,

349
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,020
don't tell nobody
you ain't the White Tiger.

350
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,350
You gon' remain the White Tiger.

351
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:30,770
And I'll be the great White Tiger of Buyeo

352
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,690
that whooped your ass!

353
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,240
Come on, stop it!

354
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,020
What the hell?

355
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,530
Our Byeong-tae won?

356
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,030
What?

357
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,030
How'd he get knocked out?

358
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:46,970
Screw it.

359
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,770
I ain't afraid to smoke.

360
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,560
That bastard

361
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,860
always says nothing tastes better
than a bloody cigarette.

362
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,990
Damn.

363
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:04,950
He's the White Tiger of Asan, all right.

364
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,580
Move aside.

365
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,430
Byeong-tae, are you still pissed...

366
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,600
All right.

367
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,140
Don't just stand there. We gotta move him.

368
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,100
Hey, Sledgehammer.

369
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,730
Wake up, you crazy bastard.

370
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,650
This ain't your bedtime.

371
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:42,070
You really gotta pick your fights.

372
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:48,780
How the hell did you knock him out?

373
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,160
You good?

374
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:56,120
You still mad?

375
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,370
Let's go eat ramyeon.

376
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,410
- All right.
- Let's go.

377
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:36,710
- Hey!
- I got it.

378
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,250
How'd you win the fight?

379
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,960
Did you hit his pressure point?

380
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:44,590
That's probably why--

381
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,720
You good?

382
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,350
What do you mean?

383
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,400
Never mind.

384
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,150
I'm sorry.

385
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,150
You're sorry?

386
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,620
Well...

387
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,590
This here's pork,
but it'll taste like beef!

388
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,310
Open up.

389
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,950
How's it taste?

390
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,090
White Tiger.

391
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,210
The thing is...

392
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,220
Come on, move it.

393
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,400
Byeong-tae, I'm sorry.

394
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,480
I shouldn't have doubted you.

395
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,420
Y'all can see...

396
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,840
that I ain't talking.

397
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:54,050
It ain't because I'm mad.

398
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:00,230
It's because I feel bad I hit Dae-jin.

399
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,650
Listen to me, Dae-jin.

400
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,150
The same goes for y'all.

401
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,900
Don't go around punching everyone.

402
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:17,080
Y'all might be it at school.

403
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:22,210
But out in the real world,
ya'll are bottom of the food chain.

404
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,600
Do y'all like burnt meat or something?

405
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,270
Sit down and eat.

406
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,440
- Sit down.
- Right.

407
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,020
- Burnt meat.
- Okay.

408
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,650
Do I gotta get you your chopsticks too?

409
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,480
I got it.

410
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,570
- Let me pour him a drink.
- Where's my drink?

411
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:55,780
You do it.

412
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:59,370
Do that thing y'all always do.

413
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:01,580
- Let's drink.
- Cheers!

414
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:05,620
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

415
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,630
We gon' drink like
there ain't no tomorrow!

416
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,760
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

417
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,340
Just like that,

418
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:20,760
I blew my last chance

419
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,850
to tell them the truth.

420
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,470
What grade you in?

421
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,430
- Academic high school?
- Let's see what you've got.

422
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,220
Let's go.

423
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,270
Wanna see something cool?

424
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,030
Watch.

425
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,790
What do you think?

426
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,210
How did you get knocked out?

427
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,510
I don't know.

428
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,260
Something whooshed by me,

429
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,140
but I don't remember.

430
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,930
What did y'all get?

431
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,650
In Brazil, when they find
really nice oranges,

432
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,020
they say this.

433
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:56,820
- Tá bom!
- Tá bom!

434
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,200
- Tá bom!
- Tá bom!

435
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,370
You know what?
Screw it, this night ain't over yet.

436
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:07,330
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

437
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,130
Slowly but surely,

438
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,050
we gon' take over from over there to here.

439
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:27,470
Buyeo Agricultural High's
gonna take over these streets!

440
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,060
- For sure!
- For sure!

441
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,310
Who's gonna make that happen?

442
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:37,530
Jang Byeong-tae, the White Tiger of Asan.

443
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:41,070
Y'all gotta stop gassin' me up.

444
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,820
- You're embarrassing me.
- Is this all I am to you?

445
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:47,160
I guess I gotta try to
meet y'all's expectations.

446
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,700
Ain't this Seon-hwa's voice?

447
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,460
- Who?
- Wait.

448
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,500
Hey, it's Seon-hwa.

449
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,750
- What are you talking about?
- Crouch down.

450
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,590
My friends told me this was fake.

451
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,880
You know how embarrassed I was?

452
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:06,850
Why ain't there a mark on it?

453
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,680
They swore it was real.

454
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,650
I'm sorry.

455
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:14,940
It's over.

456
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,740
Do you really wanna
see me kill myself right now?

457
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:25,820
What's a fine, young couple doin'
being out so late at night?

458
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,830
That bastard.

459
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,290
Seon-hwa, why do you
keep seeing this loser?

460
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,090
It breaks my heart.

461
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:43,760
Are y'all Agricultural High kids?

462
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,510
Shouldn't you be plowing a field?

463
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,310
Mind your own business.

464
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,020
I've been keepin' my nose clean lately.

465
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,610
I guess you missed my pliers, huh?

466
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,570
Yeah.

467
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,740
I brought my friends over to watch.

468
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:07,240
All of y'all
got a death wish or something?

469
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,160
Did you know?

470
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:17,250
Some scary bastard transferred
to our school not too long ago.

471
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,880
He's called

472
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,800
the White Tiger...

473
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,840
of Asan.

474
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:29,430
Chew him out.

475
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,810
Let's just go...

476
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:47,530
You...

477
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,700
You don't get what's wrong.

478
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,950
- For sure.
- He doesn't.

479
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,210
You understand me?

480
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,080
You don't...

481
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,420
understand Seon-hwa.

482
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,420
- He doesn't!
- That's right!

483
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,840
He really doesn't.

484
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:11,220
It don't matter if it's real or fake.

485
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:15,640
Your problem is you don't get
how embarrassed she was

486
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:18,230
when it turned out to be fake.

487
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:20,650
- That's right!
- Exactly!

488
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:24,730
You can bet Seon-hwa
went around braggin' to her friends.

489
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,690
So how she gonna face them now?

490
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:29,610
- She can't.
- It's a damn shame.

491
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,620
What you did

492
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,290
was take a sweet
18-year-old girl's heart...

493
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,330
and crush it.

494
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,670
- You ain't a man.
- You're just a punk.

495
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,720
This is between me and Seon-hwa.

496
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:50,840
Y'all stay out of it!

497
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:52,550
How we supposed to walk by

498
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,430
and let you embarrass a fine girl

499
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,350
like Seon-hwa?

500
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,560
- What's with you?
- What the...

501
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,230
You punk.

502
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:10,660
Seon-hwa

503
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:12,740
is mine.

504
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:22,540
What makes you so sure she belongs to you?

505
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,040
I love her...

506
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,460
with my life.

507
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,930
All right.

508
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,800
Then are you gon'
risk your life and fight us?

509
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,690
Why do I gotta do that?

510
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,270
Now,

511
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,480
who here's a fan
of this punk's love for her?

512
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,660
There ain't no one.

513
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,960
- You wanna die?
- Come on.

514
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,130
- What you gonna do?
- Bring it on.

515
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,090
I didn't lose.

516
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:15,140
You gon' go see your mommy?

517
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,970
You better run, you punk!

518
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,650
I know darn well how you feel.

519
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:37,990
You start to wonder
if you're fake as well.

520
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,540
Goodness.

521
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:49,170
What kind of bread do you like?

522
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,670
Me?

523
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,720
Custard cream puffs.

524
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,840
I just think...

525
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:00,180
puff is such a pretty name.

526
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,850
It sounds so soft.

527
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:05,560
Then you take this
whole custard cream puff

528
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:07,020
and make it go poof.

529
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,860
How are you so kind?

530
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,780
A guy can't be anything but kind
to a girl as pretty as you.

531
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,910
Come on, let's eat.

532
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,120
From now on,

533
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:29,840
if you ever run into any trouble,
just let me know, okay?

534
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:33,630
I'm gonna be your bodyguard.

535
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,970
My bodyguard?

536
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,130
That's right.

537
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,640
You're so cool.

538
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,400
- Come here.
- What?

539
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:18,300
MIMI BAKERY

540
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:22,260
Thanks for today, Byeong-tae.

541
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,390
- I'll go now.
- All right.

542
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:29,150
Just tell me if that punk
gives you trouble again.

543
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,900
The White Tiger of Asan
and his buddies got your back.

544
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,610
You're a stand-up guy.

545
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,360
- Thanks.
- Sure.

546
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,780
- Bye.
- Bye.

547
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,620
Just a second.

548
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:45,790
Bye, sweet puff.

549
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,550
- Puff!
- Puff!

550
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,420
Y'all had a good time?

551
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,880
Why didn't y'all go home yet?

552
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,260
Your bag's with me.

553
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:06,430
Since we embarrassed
the Pliers of Yeomchang-ri,

554
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:10,520
- them Technical High boys won't sit back.
- He's right.

555
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,730
The way this all's going down,

556
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,270
we might as well take over.

557
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,820
- Let's do it.
- What do you say?

558
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,490
So he's called Pliers?

559
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,990
Yeah, Pliers.

560
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,740
The tool used to fix machines and whatnot.

561
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,450
Have you never used pliers before?

562
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,500
I've been hit by one.

563
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:31,830
What?

564
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,920
Well, I only use my fists.

565
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,800
- That's right.
- That's right.

566
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,470
You're a tough one.

567
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,100
A man's gotta fight with his fists.

568
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,100
- For sure.
- For sure.

569
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,850
He got fists of steel.

570
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,560
- Does he now?
- He does.

571
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,360
- Let's go now.
- Aight.

572
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:01,530
I never imagined I'd be friends
with the sweet puff, White Tiger.

573
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,490
- You gotta stop that.
- All right, all right.

574
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:04,950
- What's goin' on over there?
- Stop throwin' a fit.

575
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,830
Stop acting like you're busy.
It's pissing me off.

576
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:09,250
What?

577
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:12,000
Y'all really got nothin' better to do
than to gang up on me?

578
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,500
- There she is.
- Quit your act.

579
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,670
She's the Black Widow.

580
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,710
Black Widow? What's that?

581
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:19,300
She's the best fighter
from Sabi Girls' High School.

582
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,760
I think her name's Park Ji-yeong.

583
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,470
She tries to keep it a secret,

584
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,930
but everybody knows.

585
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:26,930
Only her parents don't know.

586
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:29,770
I don't like how you look one bit.

587
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:33,310
I ain't sure you got the right
to talk about someone else's looks.

588
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,730
Have you looked at yourself in the mirror?

589
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,980
Girls' fights ain't our territory.

590
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,150
It's an unspoken agreement

591
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,490
that we don't cross
each other's territories.

592
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,450
I knew it.

593
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:47,240
Old habits die hard.

594
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,330
I know her.

595
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:50,490
You know the Black Widow?

596
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,290
There ain't nobody
the White Tiger of Asan doesn't...

597
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:55,000
Damn it.

598
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,170
I'm screwed.

599
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,460
I gotta get goin' because of my curfew.

600
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,420
I'll see you tomorrow.

601
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,630
All right.

602
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:07,470
What I'm sayin' is,
just hand this area over to us.

603
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,350
Buyeo ain't yours.

604
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,850
You paid for that hair?

605
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,180
It's pretty, huh?

606
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,020
I got it done by the head hairdresser
at New York Hair.

607
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,690
It wasn't cheap either.

608
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:23,070
It ain't a style those who pretend
to be good girls can rock.

609
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,030
You jealous?

610
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:30,620
I'd look like
a dandelion puff with that hair,

611
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,160
considering my small face.

612
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:33,910
The hell?

613
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,830
You callin' yourself pretty?

614
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,130
Have you never seen
a dandelion puff before?

615
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:43,550
You go ahead
and call your hairdresser afterward.

616
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,760
Ask them...

617
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,930
to do your hair again.

618
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,850
You bitch!

619
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,280
You crazy bitch!

620
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,160
Come here!

621
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,920
You a worm or what?

622
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:36,430
Damn dandelion puff!

623
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:43,860
Damn.

624
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:52,780
- Hey, wake up.
- You good?

625
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,420
If y'all

626
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,210
tell anyone about this,

627
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:08,090
you gon' have to wear wigs, got it?

628
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,470
Got it.

629
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,020
Wake up!

630
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:32,820
- Let's have a good 'ol time
- Hak-su!

631
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,790
Spin around and dance the night away

632
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:38,750
Let's have a good 'ol time

633
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:39,910
What?

634
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:47,170
Could we talk later?

635
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:49,630
You hitting on me?

636
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,590
I ain't never hit somebody.

637
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,220
Anyway, I gotta talk to you
about something serious.

638
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:58,560
- Something serious?
- Yeah.

639
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,060
Later on,

640
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:03,310
once The Tree Where Love Blossoms is over,

641
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:06,110
come see me in the storage.

642
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:09,440
Are you saying I'm full of dog crap?

643
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:11,700
That ain't a bad thing, ya know?

644
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:15,950
Come on and have a drink, Sun-deok's--

645
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,540
Watch what you say.

646
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:27,920
Let go!

647
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:31,050
Goodness.

648
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:36,350
What did you say?

649
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:37,510
Why did I say that?

650
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:43,060
Dad!

651
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,270
- Dad!
- I ought to just smack you!

652
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,980
- This kick
- Run away, Dad.

653
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:50,650
- is gon' sting you!
- Run away!

654
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:53,860
- Goodness, Dad!
- Come here!

655
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:03,160
What is it?

656
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,000
I gotta ask you something,

657
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:11,010
Black Widow.

658
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,550
Black Widow?

659
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:17,800
What the hell's that?

660
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:20,310
It's what they call you.

661
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:22,470
That ain't true.

662
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,310
I don't know what that is.

663
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:26,100
What the hell are you talking about?

664
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,900
Is it a black spider or something?

665
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:30,480
I don't got a clue what you sayin'.

666
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:33,360
I'm gon' head in now.

667
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,280
If you don't listen to me,

668
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:38,410
I'm gon' have to
tell your parents the truth.

669
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:44,620
Mrs. Cho!

670
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,050
God damn it.

671
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,220
Listen.

672
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:06,640
If you tell my parents
I'm the Black Widow,

673
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,230
you'll be dead on the spot.

674
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,400
Spit it out.

675
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,870
What's this favor of yours?

676
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,410
Doctor, Mr. Jung Gyeong-tae is awake!

677
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:37,870
