1
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:02,700
Wait for the cue.

2
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:03,860
Let’s go together.

3
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:05,860
Okay, come on.

4
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,380
Wow!

5
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:10,700
Hey!

6
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:11,740
So what?

7
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,140
My boss wants to sleep with you tonight.

8
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:15,820
Ran!

9
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:17,220
Peach!

10
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,020
Someone like me

11
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,260
always gets what I want.

12
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,340
You should show him some respect,
not act like this.

13
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,860
You’re lecturing me.

14
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,140
The Thai name of the series,
“Get a grip, Mr. Thee”, is what Peach says.
POND NARAVIT AS THEE / PHUWIN TANGSAKYUEN AS PEACH

15
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:37,580
POND NARAVIT AS THEE / PHUWIN TANGSAKYUEN AS PEACH

16
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,180
It’s a story told from Peach’s perspective
about how to make Mr. Thee get a grip.
POND NARAVIT AS THEE / PHUWIN TANGSAKYUEN AS PEACH

17
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:42,780
POND NARAVIT AS THEE / PHUWIN TANGSAKYUEN AS PEACH

18
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,820
About why Mr. Thee is so crazy.

19
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,539
-Yes.
-About why he’s so unhinged.

20
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,100
Yes.

21
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:50,100
It’s what my character
always says to remind him.

22
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,700
Get a grip, Mr. Thee!

23
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,460
That’s right.

24
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,140
It starts with Peach being a photographer

25
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,820
and Aran modeling for
Mr. Thee’s company, Arseni.

26
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,260
That’s right.

27
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,660
They meet, and Mr. Thee has
his eyes on Aran.

28
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,220
Yes.

29
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,860
Mr. Thee’s way of hitting on him
is pretty weird.

30
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,260
Normal people don’t really do that.

31
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,020
Some even see it as harassment.

32
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,180
Peach steps in to save
his little brother, which is—

33
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:17,900
Aran.

34
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,620
He saves Aran.
That’s how he meets Mr. Thee.

35
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,060
He doesn’t know Mr. Thee is a mafia boss,
so he scolds him.

36
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,220
Then Mr. Thee realizes that someone
dares to go against him.

37
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,780
He sees that this person can challenge

38
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,660
and surprise him,
so he becomes interested.

39
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,260
Yeah.

40
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:33,940
That’s pretty much it.

41
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,540
So that leads to—

42
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,740
That’s the beginning of everything.

43
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,660
Everything that’s crazy.

44
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,540
That’s right.

45
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:41,980
Teach me.

46
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,579
How do I make a move on that model?

47
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,740
Maybe you could start with a gift.

48
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:45,980
How about a car?

49
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,700
Are you crazy?

50
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,060
I’m Theerakit Kian Lee.

51
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,500
You don’t have to love me much,
but I want you to tune in to my story.

52
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,380
I play Mr. Thee.

53
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:03,340
I think Mr. Thee is a charming character.

54
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:09,460
He’s really into soap operas,
and he’s very extra.

55
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,300
But I also think
he’s a very caring person.

56
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,340
Let’s talk about Mr. Thee’s background.

57
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,340
Everyone knows he comes from
a mafia family.

58
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,140
His father is a full-on mafia.

59
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,740
He’s very strict and ruthless.

60
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,740
His mother is an actress
from back in the day.

61
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,380
Mr. Thee always watches
his mother’s soap operas

62
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,500
because he misses her.

63
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,220
(If you come a little closer,)

64
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,860
(you'll hear my heart beating your name.)

65
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,740
What’s this sound?

66
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,180
Every night, Mr. Thee watches
primetime soap operas.

67
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,060
He grew up with the ones
his mother starred in.

68
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:55,420
He has his secretary, Mok,
to keep him company.

69
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:59,700
Career-wise, Mr. Thee runs
a perfume company called Arseni.

70
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,100
His father told him to open
a perfume business,

71
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:06,340
so he launched one
that’s not 100% tied to his family.

72
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,060
This is Mr. Thee’s own perfume business

73
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,940
without much involvement in
the mafia side.

74
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:12,940
He’s actually a quirky guy.

75
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,460
He grew up with soap operas.

76
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,940
And since he’s the son of a mafia boss,

77
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,460
no one dares tell him
what he’s been taught is wrong.

78
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,900
I think Aran is more scared
than into him at the time
[SANTA PONGSAPAK AS ARAN]

79
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,460
because they gang up on him.

80
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,860
It’s the first time they meet.

81
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,580
He doesn’t even know Mr. Thee
when he suddenly violently approaches him.

82
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,060
He’s scared and not used to it.

83
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,780
He has a good heart,
[EST SUPHA AS MOK]

84
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,060
but being part of the Arseni family,

85
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,580
he has to look scary and intimidating
in the eyes of others.

86
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,460
Whenever he wants something,
he orders it and gets it right away,

87
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,940
making people around him tense.

88
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,420
The people in the company are also tense.

89
00:04:54,460 --> 00:05:00,340
But I know well that sometimes
he doesn’t want to do the things he says.

90
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,060
He just has to do them.

91
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,180
The real reason the whole company
is scared of Mr. Thee is that
[BONNIE PATTRAPHUS AS PLUB]

92
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,060
there’s a pretty dark rumor about him.

93
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,820
And that makes me scared too.

94
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,580
Theerakit Kian Lee.

95
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,780
Just being near him
sends shivers down their spine.

96
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,460
You’d better stay away from him.

97
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,700
No!

98
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:28,580
Someone asked me about the easy
and difficult parts of playing Mr. Thee.

99
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,060
Mr. Thee has a trauma
in his life, that is,

100
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,580
he doesn’t get much warmth from his family

101
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,620
because he’s sent to live in Bangkok alone.

102
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,020
He has to run his business by himself,
with no parents to give him warmth

103
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,860
or take special care of him.

104
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,100
The difficult part for me is portraying
Mr. Thee’s real feelings.

105
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,580
Sure, he says things like,
“I have a lot of money”,

106
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,540
“I’m rich”, or “I’m worried about you,”

107
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:01,220
but when he’s sad or worried,
he really feels it.

108
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,140
And even in those moments,
he still talks the same way.

109
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,140
When I’m filming serious
or emotional scenes,

110
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,260
I can’t just say the lines.
I have to actually feel the emotions

111
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,500
and still talk the way Mr. Thee talks.

112
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,620
That’s the hard part.

113
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,580
But I love it.

114
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:20,340
I think everyone knows
this character is similar to me.

115
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,620
It’s not very hard for me
to act over the top.

116
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,260
The challenge is memorizing the lines

117
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,780
because Mr. Thee doesn’t really talk
like normal people.

118
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,380
He says pretty dramatic things like,
“Why? I don’t understand.

119
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,260
Nothing goes the way I want. Strange.”

120
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,740
He doesn’t play Mr. Thee.
He plays himself.

121
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:42,020
That’s who he is.
Everyone just doesn’t know it.

122
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,780
He’s actually always been like this.

123
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,820
He’s so happy with this role because
he gets to unleash his true self.

124
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,740
I don’t want to say that Pond
plays Mr. Thee so convincingly.

125
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,020
I feel like he used method acting
to play himself so convincingly.

126
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,860
He’s always in character.

127
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,460
Even after the director says
“Cut,” he’s still Mr. Thee.

128
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,340
What a blabbermouth.
You’re rambling nonsense.

129
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,940
I think he’s very much like Mr. Thee.

130
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,020
We once went to buy snacks
at the supermarket,

131
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,540
and it showed when he asked
how much it cost.

132
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,020
It’s so embarrassing when we eat together.
[PERTH TANAPON AS TAWAN]

133
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,740
He’d sit there showing his jawline,
looking left and right.

134
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,860
I don’t know if he’s trying
to stay in character

135
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,420
or if he’s just being himself these days.

136
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,220
Pond can be 100% like Mr. Thee.

137
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,260
This role was made for him.

138
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,340
Maybe being extra runs in his blood.

139
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,860
It suits him so much.

140
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,700
(Just how hard can it be?)

141
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,020
-Just how hard can it really be?
-(Yeah.)

142
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,100
We’re similar in that I’ve loved watching
cartoons since I was a kid,

143
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:43,340
so I remember the inner feelings
of cartoon characters.

144
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,260
That can be applied to playing Mr. Thee.

145
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:54,980
(Cut.)

146
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,060
My breath

147
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,100
will ease the pain you’re going through.

148
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,460
He watches too many soap operas.

149
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,540
Mr. Thee is a perfectionist.

150
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,660
He’s always in full-on glam outfits.

151
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,660
He genuinely believes
it’s normal to dress like that.

152
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,980
Anything less, and he feels like
he’s naked.

153
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,580
That outfit is way too revealing.
Everyone can see it.

154
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,020
I should go. I have
a few dozen kilometers to drive.

155
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,860
My private jet can
arrive here in 30 minutes.

156
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,660
Who are you?

157
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,780
I play Peachayarat, nicknamed Peach,

158
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,100
a freelance photographer.

159
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:41,140
Peach is actually a reserved person
who’s just an ordinary worker.

160
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:44,179
He’s in the creative industry
as a photographer.

161
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,260
He loves being alone.

162
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,260
He’s a peace-loving homebody.

163
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:56,220
So after working with his colleagues
and being around people,

164
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,740
he goes home to live his life.

165
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,140
His life is pretty boring.

166
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,940
It’s simple and not much happens.

167
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,980
He lives with his younger sister, Plub.

168
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,460
They had quite a hard time growing up.

169
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,500
He’s had to earn money
to support his little sister,

170
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,060
and it’s always been just the two of them.

171
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,420
Peach is like my father.

172
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,740
He’s a big brother
who feels like a father.

173
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,500
I think Peach has great taste.

174
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,260
He has a sense of fashion
and loves matching colors,

175
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,340
but he’s a minimalist.

176
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,940
His house is pretty artsy.

177
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,310
In his free time, he does two things.

178
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,620
First, he goes out to take photos.

179
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,260
Second, he plays music at home.

180
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:42,140
Peach is quite unique. He plays a handpan.

181
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:53,140
It’s a large steel drum
that you place on your lap

182
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,660
and tap to make music.

183
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,940
I did some workshops
and was so nervous at first

184
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,460
because they said a handpan costs tens
or even hundreds of thousands.

185
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,500
It’s very expensive and
there are so many rules to follow.

186
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,460
They say not to tap too hard
or it’ll lose its shape.

187
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,540
Keep it away from heat
or it’ll lose its shape.

188
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,740
Don’t play it in the sun
or it’ll lose its shape.

189
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,900
There are so many restrictions.

190
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,660
And it’s expensive too.

191
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,460
I’d say it’s neither easy
nor hard to play.

192
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,100
I have a musical background,
so I was able to get the hang of it.

193
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,350
Wait for the cue.

194
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,500
Let’s go together.

195
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:35,460
In the series, Peach is one of the top
still photographers in the country.

196
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,100
He mostly shoots KV, ads,

197
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,220
billboard posters, and people.

198
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:48,460
Playing a photographer, I’m lucky that
GMMTV has a lot of camera operators,

199
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,860
so it’s been pretty easy to learn.

200
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,860
I have people who help check
if I’m doing it right.

201
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,300
And you?

202
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,460
What would make you happy?

203
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,060
Just a thank you is enough.

204
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:08,500
I think Peach is quite
a down-to-earth character.

205
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,860
He’s logical and has common sense.

206
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:15,180
He’s thoughtful and principled
in the way he talks.

207
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,700
He understands human nature pretty well.

208
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:23,060
When he meets Mr. Thee, whose personality
is so different from his, he listens.

209
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,820
And Mr. Thee listens to Mr. Peach, too.

210
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,380
That makes him more human.

211
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,740
I don’t think Peach has a sharp tongue.

212
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,060
He’s just a normal character who’s shocked
to come across this weird person,

213
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,100
thinking what he’s doing
is not reasonable or right.

214
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:46,060
I think the challenge of playing Peach
is finding the balance,

215
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,740
as in how to make this
ordinary person interesting

216
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,340
compared to a character that’s crazy,

217
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:00,540
weird, loud, charming,
and attractive to the viewers.

218
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,540
Matching that level is the hardest part
of playing Peachayarat.

219
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,780
Phuwin plays a reserved role,

220
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,460
which contrasts with
his real-life character.

221
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,060
People might think
he’s like his character,

222
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,900
but I’ve spent all this time with him,
so I can see the difference.

223
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,820
It’s funny to watch him play the role,
but it’s so much fun.

224
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,020
I’ve never worked with Phuwin before.

225
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,940
This is my first time.

226
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,740
I get to see Phuwin
from a new perspective.

227
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,620
It’s pretty funny.

228
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,590
I’m going out of my way
to offer myself to you.

229
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,940
If you reject me, you might regret it
for the rest of your life.

230
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,460
What soap opera did he get it from now?

231
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:39,220
I think there are a lot of quirks
and charms in Mr. Thee’s character.

232
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,520
Especially the relationship
between him and Peach,

233
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,540
how they fall for each other
and get together.

234
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,980
I think that’s really charming
and makes you want to root for them.

235
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:53,580
Their relationship is like
that of a CEO and a consultant.

236
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,540
A boss and an advisor.

237
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,060
Yes.

238
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,500
One wants to do this and that,
no matter what.

239
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,540
And the other stops him.

240
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,700
Then the other says,
“Hold on, I think you should 1, 2, 3, 4,”

241
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,520
Or “I don’t think you should do that,”
or “Go ahead and do that.” It’s like that.

242
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:11,940
Yeah.

243
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,100
Censored. Censored. Censored.

244
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:16,980
Censored.

245
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,820
I remember we had just wrapped We Are,

246
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,600
and they asked us what kind of series
we wanted to do next year.

247
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,180
Then P’X invited us for a discussion
and proposed two series.

248
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,220
At first, he was testing the waters.

249
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,010
He asked, “Hey, Phuwin…”

250
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:35,940
“Do you know how to take photos?”

251
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,700
Yeah, he asked if I liked taking photos
and if I knew how to do it,

252
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,140
and I said—

253
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,700
He asked so many times, I remember.

254
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,300
Yeah, he asked if I liked taking photos
and knew how to do it.

255
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,740
And he asked if Pond
had watched old soap operas.

256
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,820
Yeah, he asked me that.

257
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,940
He asked if I loved watching soap operas.

258
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,620
I remember the first time he asked us
that was at the We Are Fancon.

259
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,900
Yeah.

260
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,820
-We didn’t know what he was talking about.
-We didn’t know what he was talking about.

261
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,380
-Not until he asked us to go to his office.
-His office.

262
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,500
Then we talked.

263
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,860
Once I heard the story
and was offered the role,

264
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,710
I liked it and asked Phuwin
if he was okay with it.

265
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,700
The story is very interesting.

266
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,900
Many fans were interested in
the pilot trailer too.

267
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,330
We weren’t sure what the fans
would think of the pilot trailer.

268
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,380
But we’re happy that everyone loved it.

269
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:20,820
Yeah.

270
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,260
Peach and Thee are more mature characters.

271
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,100
And we’ve gotten older ourselves,

272
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,660
so it’s become easier to adjust
to each other in many ways.

273
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,390
This is probably
our fourth series together.

274
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:42,820
Yes.

275
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,660
We don’t have to adjust much anymore,

276
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,900
but we still did some workshops
to get into character.

277
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,060
It’s both easier and harder for me.

278
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,060
It’s much easier because
we’ve become more in sync,

279
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,580
and Pond’s acting has improved
leaps and bounds in this series.

280
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,660
Thank you so much.

281
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,140
Seriously, your acting has improved a lot.

282
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:06,420
So our interactions flowed better,
and many difficult scenes became easy.

283
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:15,420
But it’s also a bit hard because
Mr. Thee is a very dynamic character.

284
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,580
His way of speaking is very dynamic.

285
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,580
It’s very hard to talk like him
and feel his emotions.

286
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,900
The words he uses, like
“raging” or “gratifying”,

287
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,860
aren’t things ordinary people say.

288
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,220
You have to think about the words
before you speak.

289
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,220
That’s really hard.

290
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:29,820
It’s hard.

291
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,100
And when we’re filming a scene...

292
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,300
and having a conversation,
it makes it even more difficult.

293
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:35,620
Yeah.

294
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,260
You’re not dating anyone?

295
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,660
Not dating, just in a talking stage.

296
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,100
Just in a talking stage…
or non-talking stage.

297
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:45,620
It hurts.

298
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:51,220
This is a new dimension people
haven’t seen about Pond and Phuwin.

299
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,700
They’re partners who always
help each other out.

300
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,060
When I go shopping with P’Pond,
he’d be like,

301
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,620
“Oh, I should get this for Phuwin too.”

302
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,330
They always support each other.

303
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,980
That’s so adorable to see.

304
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,020
Such naturalness is hard to find.

305
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,500
I mean, their moments are rare.

306
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,980
Whenever I catch them having a moment
when they’re together

307
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,700
and I want to capture it,

308
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,660
I can’t grab my camera in time.

309
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:24,580
Or if I ask them to stand together
for photos, they won’t do it.

310
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,340
They’ll just stand apart.

311
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,820
The moments are found by me, not them.

312
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,300
They’re even sweeter off-camera.

313
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,260
They’re the perfect GMMTV couple.

314
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,140
They’re the top couple in the Asoke area.

315
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:46,220
When you see them walking together,
they look like perfect male leads.

316
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,420
The fans will love and scream for them.
We do too.

317
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,740
They have great chemistry.

318
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:56,620
When I see them filming together,
I’m secretly swooning.

319
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,860
Everyone should stay tuned.

320
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,980
Is there anything
Mr. Thee’s money can’t buy?

321
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,220
Probably family

322
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:05,540
and love.

323
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,099
I play Mok, Mr. Thee’s right-hand man.

324
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,599
Mok is actually quite mature.

325
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,220
He’s professional and composed.

326
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,619
He’s reserved and quiet.

327
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,339
He usually just responds to his boss.

328
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,980
And he tries to stay cool.

329
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:31,180
Mok is an orphan who came
to live with the Arseni family

330
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,900
and grew up with Mr. Thee.

331
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:40,020
The Master, who’s Mr. Thee’s father,
he raised Mok to protect Mr. Thee.

332
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,620
Since Mr. Thee is in a mafia family,

333
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,780
he’s surrounded by danger
and people who want to hurt him.

334
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:53,500
As kids, we see each other as friends
who grow up together.

335
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,900
But as we get older,
responsibilities fall on us,

336
00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:01,940
and Mok understands his role
and Mr. Thee’s position.

337
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,900
So our relationship has become
less like friends

338
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,300
and more like boss and subordinate.

339
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,700
Mok’s job is to protect him
and be willing to die for him.

340
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:16,100
He does everything for Mr. Thee
as his right-hand man and secretary.

341
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:19,100
Actually, the relationship
between Mr. Thee and Mok,

342
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,900
it’s not just boss and subordinate.

343
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:26,500
There’s more than that.
There’s also friendship.

344
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,260
We see Mok a lot,

345
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,100
but he doesn’t talk much
since he’s Mr. Thee’s bodyguard.

346
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:39,790
Still, he reacts to everything
Mr. Thee does.

347
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,020
Every sentence Est says
is very sharp, though.

348
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,980
He’s definitely there to steal the scenes.

349
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,820
His facial expressions change
with Mr. Thee’s words,

350
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,020
when he feels his boss is being extra.

351
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,280
But he can’t show it openly.
He can’t really look.

352
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,500
He can only react subtly.

353
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,220
That’s how a stern bodyguard is.
It’s pretty funny.

354
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,220
I wish you could stay by Mr. Thee’s side,
so he’d be happy.

355
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,900
That’d be amazing.

356
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,140
I really wanted to be part
of this series

357
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,060
because I wanted to work
with Pond and Phuwin.

358
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,420
Also, after reading the script,
I found it very fun,

359
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,020
funny, and well-balanced.

360
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,220
At first, I was worried about...

361
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:26,820
how to make this character
different from my previous roles.

362
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,580
But after playing Mok for a while,

363
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,080
I realized it’s not just my character
that’s different,

364
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:37,260
Mr. Thee’s universe is pretty different
from anything I’ve done before.

365
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:43,300
I think the viewers will feel
that completely different vibe.

366
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,620
Actually, I’ve played a bodyguard before,

367
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,020
but it’s been a while,

368
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:52,060
so I did workshops to bring back
the strength, composure,

369
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,260
and sharpness of a bodyguard.

370
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,420
I brought that part of me back.

371
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,320
I’m so happy.

372
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,820
This is my first series with Est,
and he’s a great actor.

373
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,060
I think he portrays Mok really well.

374
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,420
There are moments you’ll see in the series

375
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,440
where Mok reacts to
what Mr. Thee says to Peach.

376
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,340
He represents the shippers.

377
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,900
He sees everything and is like,

378
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,620
“Oh, Mr. Thee.”

379
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,780
I don’t have many dialogues
or get to talk much,

380
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:31,300
but I have to communicate through
my body and movements.

381
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,260
Actually, Mr. Thee loves memorizing lines
from the soap operas he watched as a kid.

382
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,130
He loves saying those lines,

383
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,420
but he doesn’t realize
normal people don’t talk like that.

384
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:45,220
Every time he delivers a soap opera line
to someone, I’m like this.

385
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,100
I can’t show much on my face,

386
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,900
but I’m sighing in my head.

387
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,020
Your photography skills
really live up to the hype.

388
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,500
Thank you.

389
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,940
Theerakit Kian Lee.

390
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,100
Just being near him
sends shivers down their spine.

391
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,580
You’d better stay away from him.

392
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,100
I play Plub, Peach’s younger sister.

393
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:18,360
Plub is a bright and bubbly character.

394
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,620
She’s quite extroverted.

395
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,900
She has her own gang.

396
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:28,020
She works at Mr. Thee’s company
on the graphic design team.

397
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,800
She’s a cheerful girl

398
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,140
who says what she thinks.

399
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,620
When she’s tired, she says it out loud.

400
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,350
She’s a bit dependent on
her older brother,

401
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,300
often asking Peach for help.

402
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,500
As Peach’s sister who works at
the company owned by Mr. Thee,

403
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,260
who’s with her brother,

404
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:52,660
she plays a role in their relationship
at work too.

405
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,180
Plub is a cheerful girl.

406
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,820
She’s always smiling,
and she’s a sweet sister.

407
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:03,740
I think she’s similar to Bonnie.

408
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:11,380
Bonnie is cheerful, sweet,
but also composed and mature.

409
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:17,020
That part is a bit different from Plub,
who’s affectionate and a bit childlike.

410
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:21,380
But Bonnie portrays Plub perfectly.

411
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,620
It turned out very well.

412
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:29,540
Playing siblings was a bit hard at first
because I didn’t know their relationship.

413
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:34,060
But after workshops and learning
their background together,

414
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,100
I realized they share a deep bond.

415
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,780
They’ve been through a lot together,

416
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,620
which is why they’re so close and
take very good care of each other.

417
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,380
Everyone, big surprise.

418
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,780
Everyone, big surprise.

419
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,220
The challenge? Honestly, from experience,

420
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,780
it’s holding back my laughter.

421
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,770
When I see Mr. Thee,
I have to be very scared of him.

422
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,540
I have to be scared,

423
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:08,460
but I’m close friends with Note,
played by JJ,

424
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,220
and Nuch, played by Mama Godji.

425
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:19,220
I’m easily amused, and these two
make me hold my laughter

426
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,580
because they’re so funny.

427
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,900
The challenge is I have to stay serious
when I see Mr. Thee.

428
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:29,360
But Mr. Thee is another person
I have to hold my laugh with.

429
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,580
Whenever I’m in a scene with these three,

430
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,660
I tense so much
that my hands start sweating.

431
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,100
That’s one of the challenges.

432
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,780
My hands are sweating.

433
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,500
Really?

434
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,550
I was trying to hold my laugh.

435
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,240
I was holding my laugh in my mouth.

436
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,500
I was like this.

437
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,370
She’s another sweet character.

438
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,980
She’s very charming and playful.

439
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,030
She’s a bit extra too.

440
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,820
After talking to Bonnie
and filming with her,

441
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:08,780
I feel like deep down,
she’s extra and funny.

442
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:13,900
She always says she wants to play
the female version of Mr. Thee

443
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,250
because she loves watching
cartoons like I do.

444
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,140
What do you do when you’re angry?

445
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,980
I’m going to crush you into pieces.

446
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:24,950
Okay, come on.

447
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,380
Wow!

448
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:29,740
Hey!

449
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:30,740
So what?

450
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,180
My boss wants to sleep with you tonight.

451
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:34,820
Ran!

452
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,340
Peach!

453
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,380
I play Aran.

454
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:44,580
Aran is a famous model
who became Arseni’s perfume presenter.

455
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:48,820
He’s kind and friendly to everyone.

456
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:53,380
Aran is a well-known model and actor.

457
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,820
That’s why Mr. Thee’s company
chose Aran to be Arseni’s presenter.

458
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,660
Peach is their photographer.

459
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:03,030
He’s a bright and bubbly person

460
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:08,140
who’s one of the country’s top actors,
models, and idols.

461
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,700
I’m lucky to work with him
and play his big brother.

462
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,060
Our characters are such close friends
that he calls me his brother.

463
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,660
I’m in a talking stage with him.

464
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:18,980
He’s the person I love.

465
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,980
My character’s story revolves around
being possessive and jealous

466
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,900
when Aran is with Mr. Thee and Mr. Peach.

467
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:34,100
Aran is the catalyst for
Mr. Thee and Mr. Peach’s relationship.

468
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,820
Without Aran, Mr. Thee and Mr. Peach
might not have met.

469
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,180
Teach me.

470
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,740
How do I make a move on that model?

471
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,580
Just a small bouquet would make Ran happy.

472
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,780
Actually, it’s not very hard to play Aran.

473
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,980
The role is quite relatable
to my real life.

474
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,420
They’re actually similar.
Both are adorable.

475
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:58,500
Little Ta and Young Master Aran
are pretty similar.

476
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,700
Everyone will probably see Ta in him.

477
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,980
Actually, I’m not so worried about
playing my character.

478
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:10,820
I’m mostly worried about
filming scenes with my friends.

479
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:11,900
I burst out laughing.

480
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:16,500
Your photography skills
really live up to the hype.

481
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,220
He added that. I feel bad for him.

482
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:23,340
Aran is a sweet and adorable character,

483
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:28,300
but Santa and I are friends who are like,
“Yo, what’s up, man?”

484
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,180
We mess around and tease each other.

485
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,900
It kinda surprised me

486
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,820
because we only really got to know
each other while working on this show,

487
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,900
but we act like
we’ve been close for 10 years.

488
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,660
Santa and I have always been very close.

489
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,820
We’ve been close
since before he joined GMMTV.

490
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,140
Being so close makes it difficult.

491
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,740
We burst out laughing quite a lot.

492
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,820
When we look at each other’s faces,
we lose it.

493
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,940
Sorry.

494
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:07,900
Santa and Pond always laugh at each other,
and when I see them, I laugh along.

495
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,460
It’s funny.

496
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:15,340
I’ve actually known Santa for a long time,
but this is our first series together

497
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,820
and our first time filming scenes together.

498
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,020
I’m glad we finally got to work together.

499
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,220
Hey!

500
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,020
Peach!

501
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,300
I play Tawan.

502
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,060
Tawan is a famous actor in the series.

503
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,300
We do the same kind of work.

504
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:36,620
He likes Aran. They’re in a talking stage.

505
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,820
Tawan is very hotheaded, self-centered,
jealous, and possessive.

506
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:45,460
He also has quite a big ego
because he’s a famous actor.

507
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,980
Tawan is pretty hotheaded
and short-tempered.

508
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:54,460
So Aran isn’t very sure about him
and hasn’t agreed to a relationship yet.

509
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,300
I’m so happy to work with these two again.

510
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,380
I’m very close with Pond.
He’s my best friend.

511
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,100
Phuwin is my dear brother, too.

512
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,260
We worked together on one of
my first series after I moved here,

513
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,900
Never Let Me Go.

514
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,220
From then until now,

515
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:20,140
P’Perth has been very nice
and so different from Tawan.

516
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,500
Tawan is always hotheaded,

517
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:29,620
but Perth is very chill in real life.
He’s calm and cool.

518
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,900
Anyone can do anything or say anything,
even try to pick a fight with him,

519
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,820
but he doesn’t really take it to heart.

520
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,020
He lets it go.

521
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,220
I’m actually close with both
Perth and Santa.

522
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,660
They’re always together,

523
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,540
and when I get to be
with many friends on set,

524
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,340
the day is fun and never lonely.

525
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,020
P’Perth and Santa
are always together on set.

526
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,660
They’re always together.

527
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,200
They eat together, sit together,
and talk with each other.

528
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,420
They’re always together.

529
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:05,500
It’s always easy working with P’Perth
because I trust him.

530
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,220
-Hi.
-Hi.

531
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,220
Feel free to hire us.

532
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,900
Our company provides end-to-end services.

533
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,220
P’Godji plays Nuch.

534
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:22,100
She’s Mr. Thee’s project manager at Arseni.

535
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,940
I’m a freelancer, not from Arseni.

536
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,860
I spend a lot of time with Nuch
because she’s the head of the project.

537
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:33,980
Nuch is an understanding boss.

538
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,340
She’s very close to her team.

539
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:41,620
She loves gossiping, and I can talk
to her about everything.

540
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,420
I really trust her.

541
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,060
Mama Godji is very sweet.

542
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,300
When we film scenes together,
she’s so funny.

543
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,620
I film a lot with Mama Godji and P’JJ.

544
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:56,100
We play a trio of besties.

545
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,940
I really have to hold
my laughter in each scene

546
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,300
because Mama Godji is such a great actor.

547
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:05,180
If you ask her to give 100,
she delivers a million.

548
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,220
I have to hold my laughter.

549
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,340
He moves his right hand and right foot
at the same time like this.

550
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,380
How does he walk?

551
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,340
Like that. Mr. Thee walks
exactly like that.

552
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,480
Is Mr. Thee normal?

553
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,420
No, he’s not normal.

554
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,670
JJ plays a junior on Nuch’s team.

555
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,820
I’d say he’s a prankster.

556
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,620
He’s the prankster
and joker of the series.

557
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,180
He makes it more fun for us.

558
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:34,100
P’JJ and Note are basically the same
because Note is pretty funny.

559
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,620
He is, all the time.

560
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:40,060
No matter how serious the others are,
he’s always delivering the details.

561
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,820
P’JJ is very detailed in his acting.
He never misses anything.

562
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,500
No matter how many words Mr. Thee says,

563
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:47,460
if he says three,
he reacts three times, to the dot.

564
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:52,820
I really have to focus. I tell myself,
“Get a grip, Bonnie,” when P’JJ is around.

565
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:56,620
He’s such a natural comedian.

566
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,380
If he knew what cracks me up,
he’d make me laugh to pieces.

567
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,100
I really have to hold it in.

568
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,580
Peach, please take care of me.

569
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,220
(If you come a little closer,)

570
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,900
(you'll hear my heart beating your name.)

571
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,660
I got to work with veteran actors,
P’Ex Piya and P’Kik Mayurin.

572
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,300
I was so excited.

573
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:22,500
For P’Kik Mayurin,
I was the first to find out

574
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,820
she’d be playing my mom.

575
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:28,220
I’d watched some of
her soap operas as a kid.

576
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:32,380
I think she’s perfect for the role
as she’s an amazing actress.

577
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,420
She’s also very kind.

578
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,380
I feel comfortable
filming scenes with her.

579
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:40,140
Since I’m still quite new,
I get pretty nervous,

580
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:46,460
but P’Kik would talk to me so nicely
and portray a mother perfectly.

581
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,780
I read the script. I play his mom, right?

582
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:54,700
But I’m swooning over my son’s script.

583
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,500
Really swooning.

584
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,100
As for P’Ex Piya,

585
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,530
I’ve seen a lot of his work too,
and honestly,

586
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:05,200
I was a bit scared before filming with him

587
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,540
because of the kind of father
he usually plays in other shows.

588
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,980
He’s the serious type,

589
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,860
which makes him perfect for
the role of a mafia boss

590
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,060
who’s really strict and stern.

591
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,020
So you’ve finally come
asking for my permission.

592
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,500
And if I say no,
will you break up with him?

593
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,180
No, I won’t.

594
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:26,820
Mr. Thee’s parents shaped him
into the guy he is.

595
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,020
Me and Thee is adapted from a novel.

596
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,300
Now that it’s become a series,
I have to say,

597
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,700
when it’s just text, you imagine it
a certain way, right?

598
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:48,090
But when it’s a series and in visual form,
each scene is so extra.

599
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,820
-Each scene is so extra.
-So extra.

600
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,810
Like really, really extra.

601
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,980
Mr. Thee’s mansion in Khao Yai
is the size of a football club.

602
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,140
It’s that big.

603
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,620
Whether it’s the front of the house,
the entrance, or the backyard.

604
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,980
-Yes.
-Or the foyer.

605
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,180
I mean, it’s—

606
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,180
It’s super fancy. He’s so rich.

607
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,540
The location is really beautiful

608
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,700
-and over the top.
-It’s beautiful.

609
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,540
Yeah.

610
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,300
-And then there’s Peach’s house.
-Peach’s house.

611
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,540
It’s one of the main locations,
along with many others.

612
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,860
Since Peach is a photographer—

613
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:20,820
And because he spends time with Mr. Thee,
all our filming locations are beautiful.

614
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,300
We went to Pattaya.

615
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,380
We went to Mr. Thee’s private island
in Pattaya.

616
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,180
We went to his island.

617
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:28,820
Mr. Thee has his own island,
so we got to film there.

618
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,580
Hope you enjoy this peaceful rest.

619
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,900
Arseni is a perfume company.

620
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,780
It’s a business in Mr. Thee’s family.

621
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,700
Mr. Thee comes from a mafia family,

622
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:44,410
but Arseni is in
the perfume business segment.

623
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,780
It really is a perfume company.

624
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:51,980
It’s what Mr. Thee wants to do
to step outside his family a bit.

625
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:55,370
To put it simply, Mr. Thee
is from a mafia family.

626
00:33:55,390 --> 00:34:00,660
He’s sent to live in Thailand alone,
so he wants to start this perfume company.

627
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,100
It’s something he wants to do by himself

628
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:07,380
and not connected to
his family’s mafia business.

629
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:14,699
(That’s when he was young.)

630
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:18,659
I think this is a chill set.

631
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:22,659
I don’t feel pressured or bad
about coming to set again and again.

632
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:29,260
It’s quite flexible, so work doesn’t feel
too pressured or stressful.

633
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:34,780
Plus, I’m close with the cast,
and the crew is kind.

634
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,699
I really feel comfortable
working on this set.

635
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:38,739
Very comfortable.

636
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,860
Very happy.

637
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,820
And very chill too.

638
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:44,100
The crew is friendly. It’s P’X’s team.

639
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:46,179
We see this team often.

640
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,460
My wound hurts.

641
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:52,300
You fall and get bitten all the time.

642
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,540
All the time.

643
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,980
A physical wound doesn’t hurt
as much as an emotional one.

644
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:00,860
It’s pretty fun.
We can talk about everything.

645
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,820
The food on set is delicious too.

646
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,180
-Oh, the food on this set is so delicious.
-The food on set is so delicious.

647
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,580
Really delicious.

648
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,140
Yeah.

649
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,180
Apart from that,
we get to work with our friends.

650
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:12,090
-Everyone is around the same age.
-Yeah.

651
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,980
Some we’ve worked with before,
some we haven’t,

652
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,380
but we got close very quickly.

653
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:16,980
Very quickly.

654
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,580
-And everyone’s “good.”
-They’re all good and funny.

655
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,180
They’re all familiar faces
like Perth and Santa.

656
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,660
-Est.
-Est. Bonnie.

657
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,220
Mama Godji. JJ.

658
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,100
It’s so much fun.

659
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:31,540
Yeah.

660
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,100
The vibe is fun.

661
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:38,300
I feel at home.
The cast and the crew are friendly.

662
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,260
I feel comfortable on this set.

663
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,860
P’X? It’s fun working with him.

664
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,700
P’X is kind.

665
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:54,900
He always guides me on what he’s
looking for in the character Plub.

666
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:59,620
He helps me understand how Plub feels
and the level I should act

667
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,980
to make the viewers understand.

668
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,660
Normally, P’X is a producer.

669
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,260
Yeah.

670
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:09,620
We’ve worked with him
on shows he produced.

671
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,580
For example, We Are.

672
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:15,580
He’d ask us how filming was
and if we enjoyed it.

673
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,710
But we’d never worked with him
as a director before.

674
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,780
Yeah, and how’s it?

675
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,060
I like it.

676
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,260
Mr. Thee is a pretty over-the-top character.

677
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:27,980
Nothing could’ve happened without
the director telling us what to do.

678
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,460
That means P’X is
pretty over the top himself.

679
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,780
Is that a compliment?

680
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,620
That’s a compliment.

681
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:38,020
He really knows how to portray
Mr. Thee’s feelings

682
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,120
and direct Mr. Thee’s movements.

683
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,620
P’X really nails that.

684
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:43,900
Cute.

685
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,540
Try it.

686
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,020
Cute.

687
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,780
Don’t be shy.

688
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,580
Another thing I like about P’X working
on this series is that

689
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,980
he’s done such a great job
designing the scenes

690
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:00,220
and the scenarios around Mr. Thee.

691
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,020
He’s done really well.

692
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,900
Yeah, sometimes I’m like,
“How did he even think of that?”

693
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:09,180
P’X would show us how to move.

694
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,580
It’s not just the movements.

695
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:15,860
It’s also the props he brought and
the scenarios he wrote and created.

696
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,540
He added things that weren’t
in the novel, right?

697
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,380
In some situations, he’s crazy.

698
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,380
He’s pretty crazy.

699
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,540
-We mean Mr. Thee. Not P’X.
-Yes, we mean Mr. Thee.

700
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,060
This is actually my first time working
on a series directed by P’X.

701
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:32,460
Like I said, his directing style is chill.

702
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,620
P’X is so kind.

703
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,900
He makes it fun.

704
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,900
Being on set doesn’t feel stressful.

705
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,780
It’s all fun and laughter.

706
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,140
I’m happy.

707
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:46,460
I worked with P’X a long time ago
on Vice Versa.

708
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,700
It’s fun getting to work with him again.

709
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,260
This series has attention to detail,

710
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,660
good cinematography, camera angles,
and storyline.

711
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,860
The scripts are good too. I really love it.

712
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,780
It’s my first time working with P’X.

713
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:02,220
At first, I was a bit nervous
and thought he’d be strict,

714
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,140
but he turned out to be
so nice to work with.

715
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:06,380
He’s very easy to work with too.

716
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,780
I’m happy on this set.

717
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,940
The series OST is great.

718
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,700
Yes, it’s another duet by us,
and this one’s faster-paced.

719
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,580
-Yes.
-Normally, our songs are…

720
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,800
Slow and emotional.

721
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,220
-But this time, I’m telling you.
-It’s more fun.

722
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:35,570
Since the first time I listened to it,
from the very first note,

723
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,740
it gave me soap opera vibes.

724
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,620
They added those
soap opera vibes on purpose.

725
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,180
Yeah.

726
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:45,300
Are there going to be any more OSTs
besides this one? Please stay tuned.

727
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,500
Stay tuned for more from both of us.

728
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:46,980
Yeah.

729
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,460
I want everyone to watch every scene.

730
00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:00,620
I really want you to see Mr. Thee
and the way he talks.

731
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:07,460
If you’ve been stressed or tired lately,
Mr. Thee’s words should help.

732
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,940
In my opinion, the best scene
in the beginning

733
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,260
is the rain scene.

734
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,260
Oh, yes.

735
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,620
Stay tuned to see what it’s like.

736
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,580
It was so tough to film.

737
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:20,420
The crew was exhausted. We were freezing.

738
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,180
-But it turned out very beautiful.
-It’s really beautiful.

739
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,860
We really want everyone to see the result.

740
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,350
The best scene for me is
Mr. Thee’s introduction scene,

741
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,580
where he walks over to Peach,
who’s behind the car,

742
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,740
and calls him out for meddling.

743
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,740
Mr. Thee seems like a fierce mafia boss,

744
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:37,980
but wait and see how he talks to Peach
throughout the whole scene.

745
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:41,660
Let me tell you, every word
he says to me really hurts.

746
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:42,980
Ugh.

747
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,080
What will the viewers get
from this series?

748
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,540
First of all, they’ll laugh.

749
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:58,250
The viewers will definitely laugh
at the context,

750
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,100
the dialogues, and Mr. Thee.

751
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:04,120
To me, it’s not just comedy. It’s romance.

752
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:09,500
There will be surprises
as the story progresses,

753
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,580
which I think the viewers will enjoy.

754
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,220
Definitely, the flamboyance.

755
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,080
The flamboyance of Mr. Thee.

756
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,380
Please stay tuned.

757
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:20,340
I guarantee this series
will be full of flavor.

758
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,540
I think this series is over the top.

759
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,420
You’d never see a male lead like this.

760
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,660
You have to stay tuned.

761
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:29,340
I love this role for my friend.

762
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,860
The viewers will smile and laugh
while watching this series.

763
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,820
No matter what happens, be careful.

764
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:42,380
Mr. Thee’s quirkiness is
too much for you to handle.

765
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:47,540
It’s deadpan humor,
which I think is refreshing.

766
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,340
I can’t wait to see
how the viewers will react,

767
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:54,620
but honestly, from watching the monitor,
it’s hilarious.

768
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,180
We’ll also get to see the friendships.

769
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:03,820
The story is actually about relationships,
whether it’s between siblings, friends,

770
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,940
or colleagues.

771
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:08,840
I think there are many things
the viewers can relate to

772
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:11,340
and really understand
about the characters.

773
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:14,900
This series doesn’t just show
the conflicts of the characters.

774
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:19,540
It also shows the mafia world
and how two people fall in love.

775
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:23,100
We also have other characters
who make the story even more fun.

776
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,220
I want everyone to watch it

777
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,580
because all the cast and crew
have worked so hard on it.

778
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:31,780
You’re so good at this.

779
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,020
You must do it for other people
all the time.

780
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,060
I got it from soap operas.

781
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,540
This one’s nothing like you’ve seen before.

782
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:37,980
Watch yourself.

783
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,180
I could totally crush you.

784
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,780
I want everyone to support
my character Mr. Thee.

785
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:49,140
I believe he’s another character
you’ll all fall in love with.

786
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:54,180
He’ll definitely make
Thai people laugh a lot.

787
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,580
Check it out.

788
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,620
Please support my character Peach.

789
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:02,710
It’s quite hard to find the balance
in portraying this character.

790
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,860
Stay tuned to see what he’s like.

791
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,620
Please support my character Plub.

792
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,940
Stay tuned to see
how she progresses the story

793
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,580
and what’s interesting about her.

794
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,380
Please support Mok, everyone.

795
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:19,650
Mok will take good care of
Mr. Thee and Mr. Peach.

796
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,980
I hope you’ll love Mok.

797
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:25,140
And please tune in to Me and Thee.

798
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:30,180
All the cast and crew
have given this series our all.

799
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:33,580
It’ll definitely turn out well.
Stay tuned.

800
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,850
Please support my character Aran.

801
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,340
And please watch this series.

802
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,380
I want you all to focus
and pay attention while watching

803
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,460
because it’s so fun and full of flavor.

804
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:49,380
Please stay tuned for
Tawan and Aran’s storyline.

805
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:52,980
The PondPhuwin storyline is also fun,
and I love it so much.

806
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,940
Every character in this series is
charming and adorable.

807
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,180
I want everyone to stay tuned.

808
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:02,790
Please check out the newest series from
us two and our friends, Me and Thee.

809
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:03,970
See you soon.

810
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,730
IN OVER HIS HEAD
(HEAD OVER HEELS IN LOVE)

811
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:14,900
Everything I own
has my name engraved on it.

812
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:22,250
Hey!

813
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:23,000
Peach!

814
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,000
You’re mine.

815
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:29,650
No one can hurt the person I call mine.

816
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:37,800
I bet someone’s made your heart
skip a beat recently.

817
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:39,980
No.

818
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:41,900
Not even a little?

819
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:44,400
Where would I find the time for anyone?

820
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,650
I’m only spending time
with you these days.

821
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:49,120
Get a grip, Mr. Thee!

822
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,310
We’re done, right?

823
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:51,450
Yes.

824
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,860
Wow, this is amazing.

825
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:58,150
I think every crew member did a great job,
as expected of Mr. Sataporn’s team.

826
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,320
I’d love to partner with him.
