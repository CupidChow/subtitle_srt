Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,840
Are you going to the wrap party tonight?

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:17,840
Hey!

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,280
My boss wants to sleep with you tonight.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:19,840
Peach!

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,720
What just happened?

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,040
They handed me a 10-million check out of nowhere.

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,920
10 million?

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:25,680
Peach!

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,960
So you didn't answer my calls because
you were with this photographer?

14
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,000
Have some sense, Tawan!
We're not even anything yet.

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,080
You stick your nose
where it doesn't belong.

16
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,040
You should show him some respect,
not act like this.

17
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,120
You're lecturing me.

18
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,480
You're angry that I hurt you.

19
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,520
What do I have to do for us
to go back to the way we were?

20
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,400
When you hurt someone, what do you do?

21
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,680
Please take all his pain away
and give it to me instead.

22
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,000
Get a grip, Mr. Thee!

23
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,830
Did I cause you so much resentment
that you can't forgive me?

24
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,870
What resentment?

25
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,150
Even on my knees, with my lips

26
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,910
that left a mark on your hand,

27
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,190
I still couldn't make things right
between us, Peachayarat?

28
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:10,670
Get a grip and listen to me.

29
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:17,266
First of all, people don't just grab someone's hand and do that without their consent.

30
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,733
But you're Peach, not just anyone.

31
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,920
Okay. We know each other.

32
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,080
But even people who know each other
wouldn't do that. It's weird!

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,480
Some would even think
you're harassing them.

34
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,160
Don't you ever think you're the weird one?

35
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,400
Normally, no one would dare to reject
someone like me.

36
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,160
Someone like you?

37
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,120
How is someone like you

38
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,160
any different from someone like me?

39
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,080
Care to explain?

40
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,760
If it's such a long story,
we can just sit down and talk here.

41
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,840
Are you sure
we can sit on these decrepit chairs?

42
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,640
Are you making fun of my house?

43
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,640
Don't say things like that
in someone else's home.

44
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,760
The owner might punch you.

45
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,240
Who would even dare?

46
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,840
Do you have to carry that everywhere?

47
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,040
Are we different now?

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,520
Huh?

49
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,000
You asked how someone like you
is different from someone like me.

50
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,200
Do you have to carry a gun
all the time like I do?

51
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,000
But I don't think
you'll have to use it here.

52
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,080
All my enemies say that.

53
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,560
Behind my back,
they hide their guns under the rug.

54
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,440
When the time comes,
they take them out and pull the trigger.

55
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,720
If I believed your words,
only my name would be left by now.

56
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,640
You see me as your enemy?

57
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,280
But earlier, you said
I wasn't just anyone.

58
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,280
Stop quibbling.

59
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
What is it that you want?

60
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,400
What do you mean?

61
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,880
How can I make you stop being angry?

62
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,320
Do you want a consolation payment,
a personal doctor,

63
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,480
or shares in the hospital?

64
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,320
Apologize.

65
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,160
What?

66
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,640
Just an apology is enough.

67
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,920
Words are nothing but air.

68
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:33,480
You'll get nothing, and your burn
won't stop hurting just because I say them.

69
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,560
You're right.

70
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,600
An apology wouldn't heal my burn.

71
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,960
But an apology that comes from the heart
would make me feel better.

72
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,120
Why?

73
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:59,720
Because apologizing is telling
the other person you didn't mean it.

74
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,000
You feel guilty about what you did,
and you won't do it again.

75
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,920
People who did wrong and know
they're wrong deserve to be forgiven.

76
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,600
I…

77
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,360
I'm sorry.

78
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,200
I forgive you.

79
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,320
I'm not mad anymore.

80
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,960
It's late.

81
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,480
Go home and rest.

82
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,040
Don't keep Mr. Mok and your men
waiting too long.

83
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,000
When you're with me,
don't call for anyone else.

84
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,760
Huh?

85
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,760
I thought you were very careful.
Aren't you afraid I'd poison you?

86
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,120
You wouldn't do that to me, would you?

87
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,160
You're safe here.

88
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,560
You can trust me.

89
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,880
I'm sorry you had to wait long, Mr. Mok.

90
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,640
If you can't take it, just say so.

91
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,720
I can start looking for a new assistant.

92
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,040
You should go. It's late.

93
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,120
See you later.

94
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,600
I almost got you fired.

95
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,880
Please don't smile at me, Mr. Peach.
I could really get fired.

96
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,240
Get in the car.

97
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:41,919
I completely forgot.

98
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,560
Good night, stubborn one.

99
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,760
Huh?

100
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,880
Go to sleep early.

101
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,080
Don't be stubborn with that pillow
you rest your dreams upon.

102
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,880
THEE 1, BANGKOK

103
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,320
THEE 111, BANGKOK

104
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,760
Mok, get Peach some good ointment.

105
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,320
If his hand ends up with a scar,

106
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,120
it will be a scar on my heart too.

107
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,120
Yes, Boss.

108
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,920
Stubborn with the pillows?

109
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,640
How?

110
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,760
What's up, Ran?

111
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,440
(Are you free, Peach?)

112
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,800
Ran.

113
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,720
Peach.

114
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,200
Thank you for coming to keep me company.

115
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,440
I actually didn't want to come,
but I promised I would.

116
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,600
Peach!

117
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,480
Just kidding.

118
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,200
Come on.

119
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:31,360
So you asked me to come
because you broke up with him, right?

120
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,760
We can't break up.

121
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,680
We weren't even together.

122
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,560
But I did ask for a break.

123
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,960
Since when?

124
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,920
Since that night.

125
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,040
I thought I'd be fine on my own,

126
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:04,840
but now that I really am,
why is it so hard?

127
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,320
It's okay.

128
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,520
(Since you came into my life…)

129
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,880
The whole world feels brighter

130
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,920
and everything looks beautiful.

131
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,200
Especially…

132
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,320
One. Two.

133
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,640
Three.

134
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,280
You.

135
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,840
Thank you.

136
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,400
Is that line from the soapie you just watched?

137
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,720
You're watching it too, aren't you, Mok?

138
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,320
If you mean that one, it's so fun that
I can't wait for the next episode.

139
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,480
We just saw each other a few hours ago.

140
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,040
Good morning, Mr. Peach.

141
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,240
Mr. Thee asked me to give you
some ointment.

142
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,440
He wanted to come himself, but an urgent
overseas conference call came up.

143
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,480
The burn on my hand is barely visible now.

144
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,680
Don't worry.

145
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,080
It's nothing.

146
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,720
Why is your boss
making such a big deal about it?

147
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,600
Even a tiny burn on your hand
feels like a wound in my boss's heart.

148
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,960
A wound in his heart?

149
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,120
Alright.

150
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,000
By the way, you have work at ARSENI
at 11 a.m., right?

151
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:22,960
Yeah.

152
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,400
You have three hours.

153
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,080
What would you like for breakfast?

154
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,680
I'll take you.

155
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,360
I don't really eat breakfast.

156
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,080
I'm good.

157
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,480
It's Mr. Thee's order.

158
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,000
I don't have to follow his orders, do I?

159
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,400
But I do.

160
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,080
MR. PEACH IS PICKING A BREAKFAST PLACE.

161
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,760
ONCE HE DECIDES, I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

162
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,880
Tell him to change his clothes right now.

163
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,480
He's barely wearing anything.

164
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,120
How dare he leave the house
in that outfit?

165
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,760
One more thing.

166
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,080
You're not allowed to get closer than
one meter to him.

167
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,760
You're pretty down-to-earth, Mr. Peach.

168
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,600
I'm normal.

169
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,200
I think you're just used to
being around Mr. Thee.

170
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:12,080
What's Mr. Thee's life like,
based on your understanding?

171
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,080
He's rich.

172
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,080
He has money to buy anything.

173
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,280
Literally anything, right?

174
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,040
Almost anything.

175
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,800
Alright, besides Aran,

176
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,160
what else can't his money buy?

177
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,640
Probably family and love.

178
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,280
His family mainly runs their businesses
in Hong Kong.

179
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,200
His parents are settled there.

180
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,760
The Lee family has many businesses.

181
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,160
Mr. Thee's perfume business
is the smallest of them.

182
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,760
Besides being the smallest,

183
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,120
is it also just a front?

184
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,440
It was going to be at first,

185
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,480
but now Mr. Thee is very serious about it.

186
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,760
So serious these days that the Master
is getting displeased with him.

187
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,760
The Master?

188
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,840
Mr. Thee's father.

189
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,840
Everything sounds straight
out of a soapie.

190
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,880
The soapies we watch are always
based on someone's real story.

191
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,600
Have you heard that saying?

192
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,200
I have.

193
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,920
You said the other thing
Mr. Thee can't buy is love?

194
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,960
We're all forbidden to love.

195
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,400
Why?

196
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:23,119
Because it's a weakness
our enemies could use to destroy us.

197
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,760
But I think love can make you stronger.

198
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,520
I love my sister, Plub, and photography.

199
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:47,040
These two things help me overcome
difficulties in my life.

200
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,080
I don't know.

201
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I guess I see things differently
from you guys.

202
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,000
You're right.

203
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:13,120
I think I'll need your help soon.

204
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,320
About what?

205
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,680
Once I'm more certain, I'll let you know.

206
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,280
Please keep eating.

207
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,840
That's not all of your breakfast.

208
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,720
Ready.

209
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,240
Whoa.

210
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,720
(I heard you don't like eating heavy
in the morning,)

211
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,200
(so I had Mok prepare
something light for you.)

212
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,680
How is that light?

213
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,760
Really, Mr. Mok?

214
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:37,480
(I hope what I prepared can make up for
my absence this morning, Peachayarat.)

215
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,680
Everything has been taken care of, I trust?

216
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,120
Do you mean work or your personal matters?

217
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,240
Can you tell me everything at once?

218
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,640
We've dropped Mr. Peach off here.

219
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,760
They're probably shooting
the first set now.

220
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,480
Regarding work, you don't have
any meeting scheduled in the morning,

221
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,400
and no urgent documents either.

222
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,920
If you want to go down to the studio for…

223
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,320
Hey, Peach.

224
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,560
Someone sent this to you.

225
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:23,840
Thanks.

226
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,240
It's really beautiful.

227
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,520
Aren't you going to go in?

228
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,320
If I go in now,
Peach might not enjoy it fully.

229
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,040
He'll be shy around me.

230
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,880
That bouquet matches the brief, right?

231
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,600
Yes. Flowers from all four seasons,

232
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,200
as a thank you for the Fall Collection, and to
prepare for Winter, Spring, and Summer.

233
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,000
Peach has agreed to
the other three projects, hasn't he?

234
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,440
Not yet.

235
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,560
What are you waiting for?

236
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,400
Mr. Peach wants to take the contract
project by project.

237
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,480
I'll talk to him.

238
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,840
Are you close with him now?

239
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,880
Let's test the lighting.

240
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,680
Sure.

241
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,080
Okay.

242
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,960
Um, Peach,

243
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,720
that bouquet prop looks so expensive.

244
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,320
Once you're done with the shoot,
can I have it?

245
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,320
I want to give it to a girl.

246
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,600
I'd love to help you, but it's not a prop.

247
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,200
Oh.

248
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,880
So that means it's yours?

249
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,840
Your partner really went all out.

250
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,160
It's not mine either.

251
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,760
It's not yours? Then whose?

252
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,280
All good. Beautiful.

253
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,000
THIS IS FOR YOU. IF YOU GIVE IT
TO SOMEONE ELSE AGAIN,

254
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,280
I'LL CRUSH YOU TO PIECES.

255
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,800
Whoa. Crush to pieces?

256
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,080
Hey, Peach.

257
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,680
Hey, supermodel.

258
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,040
You look totally
different from last night.

259
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,800
You look cheerful now.

260
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,280
What happened last night stays there.

261
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,320
I can just find someone else
to get over him.

262
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,240
This is from the same person as last time.

263
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,400
Mr. Thee is actually pretty generous.

264
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,600
He's caring and always sending you gifts.

265
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,840
Are you playing matchmaker?

266
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,080
I'm just saying what I see.

267
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,920
Honestly, we should thank him.

268
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,480
He made you smile
for the first time in days.

269
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,840
Look.

270
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,360
I don't know how he picked these flowers,

271
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,440
but they don't go together at all.

272
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,400
How unusual.

273
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,880
If you see him, please thank him for me.

274
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,280
If you see him, thank him yourself.

275
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,240
It's rude to have someone else
say it for you.

276
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,960
Great.

277
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,600
Why is this so amazing?

278
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,720
That's right.

279
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,640
Go with the vibe.

280
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,680
-Looking great.
-Beautiful. Hold that pose.

281
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,040
Yes, that's right.

282
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,760
Last 10 shots.

283
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,440
Yes!

284
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,400
-Last one!
-Almost there!

285
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,720
Awesome!

286
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,160
Well…

287
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,120
Let's check the photos.

288
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,760
Let's go.

289
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,680
May I?

290
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,480
Okay.

291
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:17,280
Hey, you should book
a good Italian restaurant.

292
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,080
Italian?

293
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,040
Ran, come take a look at the photos.

294
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,280
Sure.

295
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,760
Is there anything you don't like, Mr. Thee?

296
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,360
It looks amazing.

297
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,360
Your photography skills
really are as amazing as people say.

298
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,040
That's right.

299
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,680
Peach is a really talented photographer.

300
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,840
If everyone's okay with the photos,

301
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,360
you can take a break, Ran.

302
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,920
Plub, Nuch,

303
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,480
please take care of Ran.

304
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,200
Sure.

305
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,040
(Come here.)

306
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,720
Love Italian food?

307
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,280
It's a favorite.

308
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,600
Okay.

309
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,280
I'll wait in the car by the back entrance.

310
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,600
Okay. Let me pack up.

311
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,200
Oh, about your bouquet.

312
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,160
Even though it's a bit unusual,

313
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,920
it works.

314
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,440
It's a wrap, everyone.

315
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,360
Ran!

316
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:30,960
Huh?

317
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,200
Why are you yelling? You startled me.

318
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,840
Don't remove your makeup yet.

319
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,400
I don't want to get acne.

320
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,480
Let me see.

321
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,560
Is something going on?

322
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,840
Florentine steak.

323
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,960
Veal with tuna sauce.

324
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,440
Milanese-style beef tenderloin.

325
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,440
Thank you.

326
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,840
Peach said
you wanted to have dinner with me.

327
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,840
Great.

328
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,200
I also want to apologize for that night.

329
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,360
What did you say?

330
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,000
I'm letting Ran go to dinner with you
because I trust you.

331
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,080
Don't disappoint me.

332
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,320
Peachayarat!

333
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,720
I know you can do it.

334
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,840
This is your chance. You got this.

335
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,280
I'll leave it to you, Mr. Mok.

336
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,480
See you, Ran.

337
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,680
Too bad freelancers don't get a bonus.

338
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,280
Otherwise…

339
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,800
Hurry up! We don't have time.

340
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,760
Sorry about that.

341
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,320
What are they running from?

342
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,440
Is there a fire?

343
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,720
I'm sorry. We didn't have time
to clear out the customers.

344
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,120
We tried our best.

345
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,120
Understandable.

346
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,800
I know I called you on short notice.

347
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,560
The food and the private zone are ready.

348
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,280
Please go inside, Mr. Aran.

349
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,560
Hold on.

350
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,080
What's going on?

351
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,120
Why were people running out?

352
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,320
This is the best Italian restaurant
in the country.

353
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,600
The private zone is fully booked
until next year,

354
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,320
so Mr. Theerakit bought the place.

355
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,120
What?

356
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,120
He bought the place?

357
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,280
Please go in and have a seat.

358
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,640
It's time for Mr. Theerakit's dinner.

359
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,800
Please follow me.

360
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,680
Enjoy your meal.

361
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,320
Why did you agree to have dinner with me?

362
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,880
That night, you acted all haughty,
like Soraya from Defendant of Love.

363
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,960
Defendant of Love?

364
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,240
You played hard to get,
but I didn't try to make up with you, right?

365
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,440
Sorry, I'm not playing your game.

366
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,320
It's not like that.

367
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,320
I'm here because of Peach.

368
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,280
Peach?

369
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,920
Peach wants us to talk

370
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,560
since we'll be working together
for a long time.

371
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:36,200
As someone working for you,
I may have spoken too harshly that night.

372
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,920
I'm really sorry.

373
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,880
But honestly,

374
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,400
I don't like it when you say
disrespectful things to me like that.

375
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,560
You don't have to repeat that.

376
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,120
Someone else already told me
what I did was wrong.

377
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:57,280
I hope this meal can heal your feelings.

378
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,200
Pardon?

379
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,800
Let's change the topic.

380
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,320
Are you very close to Peach?

381
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,040
Yes.

382
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,240
I respect him like he's my real brother.

383
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,880
No matter what happens,
he always helps me.

384
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,560
Both with work and personal stuff.

385
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,760
Personal stuff?

386
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,600
No matter what I go through,

387
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,880
he's always there for me.

388
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,800
I sleep over at his place a lot.

389
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,120
Continue.

390
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,080
Peach is kind.

391
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,080
He loves helping people.

392
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,080
He might seem quiet,

393
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,000
but he has some magical power.

394
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,880
I feel happy and comforted
every time I'm near him.

395
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,880
You're welcome.

396
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,680
(You're welcome.)

397
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,000
I was just going to put some meat
on your plate.

398
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,040
You haven't eaten anything
since we got here.

399
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,000
You're safe here.

400
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,280
You can trust me.

401
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,440
Mr. Thee.

402
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,480
Mr. Thee!

403
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,960
You can continue eating.

404
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,120
Please excuse me.

405
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,600
Pardon?

406
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,920
This place is yours.

407
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,040
Huh?

408
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,320
But no sleeping over at Peach's house again.

409
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,920
Mok, handle the paperwork.

410
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,120
Today!

411
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,320
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

412
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,440
Mr. Thee.

413
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,400
Everyone, leave.

414
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,440
I'm sleeping here tonight.

415
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,320
Pardon?

416
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,960
You've never disobeyed my orders, Mok.

417
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,280
Yes, sir.

418
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,440
I'll have Team A stand by in the area

419
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,480
without letting Mr. Peach know
or feel uncomfortable.

420
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,080
Wait.

421
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,840
Mr. Thee, if Master finds out
you're not carrying—

422
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,920
Peach doesn't like guns.

423
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:58,520
And he said it's safe here.

424
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,600
Mr. Thee.

425
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,720
What are you guys doing here so late?

426
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,400
Honestly, your house is only
a little bigger than my bathroom.

427
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,800
Can I buy you a new one?

428
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,440
I told you not to make fun of my house.

429
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,600
I'm not.

430
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,080
I asked because
I can really buy you a new one.

431
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,240
Hey.

432
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,680
You need to change your shoes first.

433
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,680
Why should I?

434
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,400
Your shoes are dirty.

435
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,680
I don't want to have
to mop the floor again.

436
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,160
I can call my maid to come over.

437
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,440
Just change your shoes.

438
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,200
Or I can replace the tiles
in this entire house.

439
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,320
How about marble tiles?

440
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,480
Mr. Thee.

441
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,920
I only have two pairs.

442
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,120
This one belongs to my sister.

443
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,280
You can wear it for now.

444
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,400
You can manage that, right?

445
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,680
It'd be so much easier
to replace the tiles.

446
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,760
I didn't bring my gun tonight.

447
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,240
Why not?

448
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,600
Because you don't like it.

449
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,080
I know I did very well,
and you're very pleased today.

450
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,800
But you didn't have to come all the way
to my house to thank me in person.

451
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,800
Thank you?

452
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,040
What you did today
doesn't deserve my thanks.

453
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,720
It actually deserves punishment.

454
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,040
Punishment?

455
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,680
You did something I didn't order you to.

456
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,280
Aren't you pursuing Aran?

457
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,000
I'm just helping you out.

458
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,560
You think you know everything on my mind,
huh, Peachayarat?

459
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,440
(My dear Chet.)

460
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,200
(I made Ran Juan curry for you.)

461
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,880
(Look.)

462
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,080
(It looks so tasty.)

463
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,720
Ms. Nat was still young here.

464
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,640
You know her?

465
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,880
She was so famous when I was a kid.

466
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,480
You like watching soap operas?

467
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,000
Don't you?

468
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,440
I did when I was a kid,

469
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:10,800
but now that I've grown up, I don't really
have time and have forgotten about them.

470
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,280
Seeing the show rerun like this
brings back memories.

471
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:20,800
Yes.

472
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,600
I miss it so much.

473
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,800
He really grew up with primetime soapies.

474
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,920
What are you doing here tonight, though?

475
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,280
Can you cook something for me?

476
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,080
What?

477
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:48,040
You bought that Italian restaurant
for Ran, but didn't eat anything?

478
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,240
That model told on me?

479
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,040
Hey.

480
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,800
He has a name.

481
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,840
Don't call Aran that.

482
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,280
Calling someone by their job
is not very nice.

483
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,480
What would you like to eat?

484
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,440
That dish in the soapie.

485
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,840
I don't know how to make
that difficult curry.

486
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,160
I only know how to make this.

487
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,040
Blow on it first.

488
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,280
Besides my father, no one can order me.

489
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,760
Fine. Don't blow on it.

490
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,880
Go ahead and eat.

491
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,120
Do you believe me now?

492
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,640
Give that to me.

493
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,120
Look, you should do this.

494
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,160
I thought you were going to feed me.

495
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,160
A mafia boss like you probably has
people feeding you at home, huh?

496
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,880
When you're done eating, call Mr. Mok.

497
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,640
It's late.

498
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,320
Who says I'm leaving?

499
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,200
You can't sleep here.

500
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,440
I'm staying the night.

501
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,040
No one can stop me.

502
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,080
Why can't I stay the night here?

503
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,960
Do you want me to pay rent?

504
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,200
If you're going to bring up money again,
we're done talking.

505
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,280
But Aran gets to stay over.

506
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,920
He's my brother.

507
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,280
Then who am I supposed to be in your life?

508
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:20,840
Tell me.

509
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,640
Hey, no means no.

510
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,680
Sorry for bothering you, Mr. Peach.

511
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,240
It's okay.

512
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,320
Safe trip home.

513
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,000
Thank you.

514
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,480
Mr. Peach seems to be the only one

515
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,280
who can give you orders
or go against yours, Mr. Thee.

516
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,000
Mr. Thee bought the whole restaurant
and kicked everyone out.

517
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,400
That's crazy.

518
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,160
Well, that's just normal for him.

519
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,120
That's normal?

520
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:44,240
No, I mean he's normally not normal.

521
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,400
You talk like you know him well.

522
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,080
Anyway, I got to talk it out with him,

523
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:56,520
apologized, and randomly
got an Italian restaurant.

524
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,400
That's enough.

525
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,920
One more thing,

526
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,000
it seems he's not that into me.

527
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,920
I think he's into someone else.

528
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,840
I wouldn't say I'm into him.

529
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,200
I just feel good about him.

530
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,680
I feel…impressed.

531
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,360
(I don't understand what you mean.
Could you explain it again?)

532
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,320
When you feel good about someone,

533
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,800
how do you let them know?

534
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:34,680
(Try to make a good first impression,
like complimenting their outfit.)

535
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,280
Complimenting their outfit?

536
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,400
Blue polka dots.

537
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:11,480
What makes you sure it's me?

538
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,120
The blue polka dot outfit.

539
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,840
That's what the letter says.

540
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,960
I guess you're wearing a student uniform.

541
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,680
Yes, I'm in a student uniform.

542
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,480
That's lovely.

543
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,320
The pattern and colors

544
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,600
are unlike anything I've seen before.

545
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,600
Any ideas to make me
seem more serious and trustworthy?

546
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,680
(How about making a vow to him?)

547
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,960
(That would be serious and trustworthy.)

548
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:03,680
Thee.

549
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:10,840
Thee!

550
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,200
Peach, dear.

551
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,280
I swear on my blood in front of the shrine.

552
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:25,000
I will love and wait for Peach only.

553
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,280
Will Peach find that too intense?

554
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,320
(Then how about something simple?)

555
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,880
(Starting the day with him with a smile.)

556
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:45,640
A smile?

557
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,080
Hey, Mr. Thee.

558
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,320
That outfit is way too revealing.

559
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,760
Everyone can see it.

560
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,000
Hey.

561
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,600
This is normal.

562
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,240
It's comfy.

563
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,920
You have 10 minutes to change.

564
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,440
I'm not going to.

565
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,440
It's my day off. I'm going to wear this.

566
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,440
This is so not it!

567
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,240
And you didn't answer my calls!

568
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,360
You didn't reply to my messages!

569
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,040
I don't answer calls
from unfamiliar numbers.

570
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,080
Next time, have Mr. Mok call me.

571
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,440
I already saved his number.

572
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,800
You saved Mok's number, but not mine?

573
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,720
Every sentence you say
is driving me crazy.

574
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,120
What are you doing at my house
this morning, anyway?

575
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,960
Mr. Thee came to pick you up
for breakfast.

576
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,360
Give me three minutes to lock up my house.

577
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:19,840
Wait.

578
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,200
Give me your phone.

579
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,000
The three minutes you asked for

580
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,680
should be enough time for me
to save my number on it.

581
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,920
Thank you so much for letting me
pick the place this time.

582
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,600
But don't shut the place for yourself.

583
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,440
Don't buy it,
don't buy the whole building,

584
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,520
or anything like that, okay?

585
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:02,560
HEI BAI CONGEE

586
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,520
Please make yourself at home, Mr. Peach.

587
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,400
Our bodyguards are
all disguised as customers.

588
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,000
Very subtle.

589
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,240
My apologies, Mr. Peach,

590
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,680
but I had to do it for Mr. Thee's safety.

591
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,120
Hey.

592
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,680
The place has no AC.
It'll feel even hotter than outside.

593
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,680
We're just here to eat congee.
You don't have to look so cool.

594
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,760
What are you doing?

595
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,040
Stay still.

596
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:25,840
I'm not used to this.

597
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,240
There's a first time for everything.

598
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,440
You still look cool even without the suit.

599
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,240
Peach.

600
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,480
You make me feel…

601
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,120
naked.

602
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,320
Let's get inside.

603
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,080
Mr. Peach.

604
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:19,560
Here you go.

605
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,960
What'd you two like to order?

606
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,040
I'll have pork congee with everything,
and two soft-boiled eggs.

607
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,440
With everything and two soft-boiled eggs.

608
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,080
What about you?

609
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,200
Abalone congee.

610
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,000
We don't have it.

611
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,600
Do you have the Emperor's congee?

612
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:39,680
Also no.

613
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,160
I'll have plain congee then,

614
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,400
but with a topping of foie gras.

615
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,840
Are you trying to get on my nerves?

616
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,480
We'll have the same thing.

617
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:53,680
Okay.

618
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,120
How do they even run this place?

619
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,160
They don't have a single thing I ordered.

620
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,200
You ordered unusual dishes.

621
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,000
I want to eat foie gras.

622
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:19,800
What's up with Mr. Thee?

623
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,600
Why did he order breakfast
for his employees?

624
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,280
Hi, Nuch.

625
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:24,920
Hi.

626
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:25,640
Hey.

627
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,200
Here's your coffee, Note.

628
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:27,920
Oh, thank you.

629
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,840
Do you want some congee, Peach?

630
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,480
Something's going on with Mr. Thee.

631
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,280
He had congee delivered
for the whole company.

632
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:41,560
Isn't it normal for a boss
to treat his employees?

633
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,680
It wouldn't be weird
if it were some other company,

634
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,360
but this is our company.

635
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,680
It's weird.

636
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,720
The One and Only…

637
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,280
Hey!

638
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:58,720
Who's that?

639
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,720
I'M WAITING ON THE ROOFTOP.

640
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,880
IF I DON'T SEE YOUR FACE
IN THREE MINUTES,

641
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,760
I'LL HAVE THE RECEPTION TEAM
ANNOUNCE YOUR NAME.

642
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:08,840
Damn.

643
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:10,800
Spill.

644
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,600
It's probably a scammer.

645
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:15,960
I need to go to the bathroom.

646
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,400
Note, take your coffee.

647
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,120
Thank you.

648
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,000
(Mr. Theerakit would like...)

649
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,280
(to see Mr. P—)

650
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:51,800
Stop.

651
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,480
Hey!

652
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,000
What's going on?

653
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,080
I thought you said today was your day off.

654
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,400
If you were coming to the office,
why didn't you come with me this morning?

655
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,080
What?

656
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:09,720
You made me run up here
in three minutes just for that?

657
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,240
I thought it was something important.

658
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:19,000
Of course, it's important
when it comes to you.

659
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,640
What's wrong with you?

660
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,080
Answer my question.

661
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,200
I came to see my sister.

662
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,560
Next time, if you're coming to the office,
you have to let me know in advance.

663
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:33,920
Why do I have to?

664
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,680
You and your endless talking back!

665
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,000
Who are you?

666
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,200
Why do I have to report my every move
to you?

667
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,040
This is the second time
you've talked to me like this.

668
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,480
You want a label, huh?

669
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,200
Isn't it too soon?

670
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,360
There's a problem with the working file,
so I came in to help Plub.

671
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,520
Anyway, I have no obligation to tell you.

672
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,880
But you already have my number.

673
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:14,560
Just texting me
wouldn't take that much time.

674
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,880
"The One and Only"?

675
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:19,920
Seriously?

676
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,280
What made you save your number
under that name?

677
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:23,760
Why not?

678
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:31,480
Don't tell me you save your number
under that name on everyone's phones.

679
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:36,680
Only yours.

680
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:39,680
Only mine?

681
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,080
Why?

682
00:56:54,240 --> 00:57:00,400
Because I want to be
your one and only, Peach.

683
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:08,000
(Your one and only.)

684
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:27,960
Young Master

685
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:35,760
Babe

686
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,200
Theerakit-kins

687
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,880
Theerakitza55+

688
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:12,680
Theerakit with smiley, puppy,
heart-eyes, and cheerful emojis

689
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,360
Perhaps I should be more serious.

690
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,840
Theerakit K. Lee

691
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:34,680
That's too basic.

692
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,080
Mr. Thee's parents came to visit
from Hong Kong without notice,

693
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,040
so he sent me to take care of you instead.

694
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:04,760
Am I still the only one
who has your heart, Kian?

695
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:05,600
Are you in love?

696
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,760
Mr. Peach asked me to bring you some happiness.

697
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,960
(Is this what it really feels like
when a young man falls in love?)

698
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,720
Hi, I'm Wiwid, your new team leader.

699
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,920
I really had no idea
I'd be doing this shoot with you.

700
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:18,800
What happened?

701
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,680
It's none of your business,
you lousy photographer!
