00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,290
Characters, actions, places, occupations,

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:08,060
and events in this series are fictional and
created for entertainment purposes only.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,270
They are not intended to urge
or promote any behavior in the series.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,670
Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,050
I’d like to put Mr. Peach’s
Winter Collection contract on hold.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,000
Wiwid is the guy
you had a problem with, isn’t he?

7
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,300
What a freaking loser.

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,560
He acts like he’s so big and powerful.

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,650
While true love is really hard to find,

10
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,200
it doesn’t mean it can’t be found.

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,230
Are you in love?

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,680
MISS YOU

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,500
You don’t have work tomorrow, right?

14
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,500
I’m going to Bang Krachao.

15
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:34,780
I can even go with you.

16
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:35,900
I’m free tomorrow.

17
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,380
I already booked a hotel,
so I don’t have to wake up early tomorrow.

18
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,820
I only have a vacation home there.

19
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:40,890
Will that do?

20
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:41,800
Who are you?

21
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,500
You haven’t answered my question.

22
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,500
Is there any way
you could be mine only, Peachayarat?

23
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:25,760
Oh, shit!

24
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,570
Good morning, Mr. Peachayarat.

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,150
Warm water at 37°C is ready.

26
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,250
Huh? What warm water?

27
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,650
Water between 30-40°C

28
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,500
is good for stimulating blood circulation.

29
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,650
It refreshes your body
without making your heart beat too fast.

30
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,900
I just need a quick shower.

31
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,750
A quick shower?

32
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,300
Here, we believe

33
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:54,100
a new morning should start perfectly.

34
00:01:54,370 --> 00:02:00,700
Bathing for about five minutes helps
your body transition from rest to energy.

35
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,980
Everything is ready for you,
Mr. Peachayarat.

36
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,700
When he said his bathroom was the size
of my house, I thought he was joking.

37
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,400
Turns out it’s true.

38
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,610
Oh.

39
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,800
May I have some privacy?

40
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:34,300
Very well, if you need anything,
please ring the bell to let us know.

41
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,980
The bathroom doors are even made of glass.

42
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:02,600
Is this real?

43
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,790
A life like Gorya from F4 really exists?

44
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,000
This is even beyond Gorya, Peach!

45
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,950
The clothes are ready.

46
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,650
I have my own clothes.

47
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:54,800
They’re in the car.

48
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,900
Breakfast will be ready in 10 minutes.

49
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,400
The guys over there said that
Master has arrived in Hong Kong.

50
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,790
But Madam is still here.

51
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,400
She said she’s not done
with her errands in Thailand yet.

52
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,840
Who exactly told you that?

53
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,900
You’re good at everything,
except this, Mok.

54
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,210
Boss.

55
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,780
No more of this!

56
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,250
Staying over? I can live with it.

57
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,300
But troubling others like this? I’m done.

58
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,409
Your working location is only
15 minutes from here.

59
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,659
You still have an hour and a half
for breakfast.

60
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,850
But if you need to get ready,

61
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:52,180
I’ve already had your
breakfast prepared in the car.

62
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:52,780
Stop!

63
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,730
What you all are doing is not normal.

64
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,600
Like what?

65
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,450
Like waking up and troubling them.

66
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,000
Not to mention the water temperature
and the clothes.

67
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,300
It’s not normal.

68
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,830
It’s normal.

69
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,300
What about the violin in the bathroom?

70
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,100
Are you saying that’s normal too?

71
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,850
That’s not normal.

72
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:23,830
See?

73
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,100
I bathed in muddy canal water
during my military reserve training.

74
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,300
Just one shake of my clothes
and they were considered neat.

75
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,130
It’s not like that.

76
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,550
This is a vacation home
built for relaxation.

77
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,700
The care and attention here
is more special than anywhere else.

78
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,850
Let’s talk outside.

79
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,230
Can’t we talk here
so you can eat at the same time?

80
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,100
No.

81
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,850
If you don’t eat your meal on time,

82
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,840
you might get a stomachache.

83
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,470
That’s fine. I can just skip it.

84
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:55,180
But you’re under my care.

85
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:59,000
Your health is important,
and I need to take care of it too.

86
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,900
I’m already full.

87
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,450
Can we go now?

88
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,240
It was dark last night,

89
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,300
so I didn’t realize
your house was this big.

90
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,130
You want me to knock it down
and make it smaller?

91
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,850
Get a grip, Mr. Thee!

92
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:43,180
Seriously, do you really need
that many people when you take a bath?

93
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,370
That’s not normal to me,

94
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,980
because everything they do,
I can do myself.

95
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,060
I don’t want to bother them.

96
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,600
But it’s their job.

97
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,200
We got here at almost 2 a.m. last night.

98
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,710
If I’d known staying here
for just a few hours

99
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,100
would inconvenience them this much,

100
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,100
I would’ve stayed at the hotel I booked.

101
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,600
I just…

102
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,600
want to take care of you as best as I can.

103
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,450
That’s all.

104
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,130
I’m not…

105
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,270
Let’s try this again.

106
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,200
We grew up differently.

107
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,700
I’m not used to having
so many people wait on me.

108
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,030
Then, shall we open up

109
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,950
and learn about each other?

110
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:56,300
Honestly, I understand them
more than I understand you.

111
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,150
Why is that?

112
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,300
I’m also someone who works for a living.

113
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,970
Your job is to give orders.

114
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,600
Your men and I are the ones taking orders.

115
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,150
Do you see the difference?

116
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,200
How do you know

117
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,600
I don’t have to take orders too?

118
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:34,770
Mr. Thee.

119
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,640
This is a job I can’t quit.

120
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,450
I can’t even run away from it.

121
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,530
What you’re doing is not wrong

122
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,250
and I’m not upset.

123
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:08,650
It’s good of you to want to
take care of someone.

124
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,350
I mean it.

125
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,850
I’m just a little shocked by
how rich you are.

126
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,150
When you said my house was only
a little bigger than your bathroom,

127
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,300
I thought you were being sarcastic.

128
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,950
Who would’ve thought it was true?

129
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,400
Actually, I have another house
that’s a little smaller than this one,

130
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,120
if you’re scared of big spaces.

131
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,200
Hey, are you crazy?

132
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,180
I’ve only heard of people
being scared of tight spaces.

133
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,600
Your house is really pretty, though.

134
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,400
So is the garden. I like it.

135
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,380
Next time, you can bring
your turtle shell and tap it here.

136
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,070
You can come by any time you want.

137
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,000
Turtle shell?

138
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,200
Your turtle shell
that makes an echoing sound.

139
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,800
That’s called a hand pan.

140
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,100
It’s a musical instrument,
not a turtle shell.

141
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,900
It’s a musical instrument?

142
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,050
I never had time to learn music.

143
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,050
You’re free today, right?

144
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,900
I’ll take you to do something fun.

145
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,050
What is it that you’re talking about?

146
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,900
Well, I’ve learned about
your extravagant life.

147
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,400
It’s your turn to learn about
my ordinary one.

148
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,260
Come on. I don’t want to be late for work.

149
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,800
Please go to that gazebo
all the way in the back, team.

150
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,400
Turn right if you need to go
to the bathroom.

151
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,130
Oh, hey, Peach! There you are!

152
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,100
Hi, In.

153
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,000
Wow, you brought an assistant?

154
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,700
I thought you were going with
natural lighting.

155
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,600
And didn’t the coordinator tell you
I had a very limited budget?

156
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,320
They did mention it,
but this is my intern.

157
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,230
Just lunch will do, right?

158
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,400
Are you sure?

159
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,050
Everyone who works should get paid.

160
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,000
Does he need any support?

161
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,980
I can try shifting the budget around
to pay him.

162
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:25,500
Don’t worry.

163
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,170
Please just give him a boxed lunch.

164
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,150
He’s not fussy.

165
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,140
You’re not fussy?

166
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,980
I’m going to check the set.

167
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,600
Sure.

168
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,470
Turn left and head to the gazebo
in the back.

169
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:41,800
Let’s go.

170
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,250
The bathroom will be on your right
if you need it.

171
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,730
Team, Peach is here!

172
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,100
It’s hot.

173
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,050
Please go back to the cafe area, sir.

174
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,000
This is a filming set.

175
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,100
No outsiders allowed.

176
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,950
You can go.

177
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,020
And tell everyone to stay away from me.

178
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,050
Yes, Boss.

179
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,300
We’re just getting started.

180
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,400
Why didn’t you choose
a better place to work?

181
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,530
What kind of place
would be better for you?

182
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,470
An air-conditioned studio,

183
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,170
like the one at ARSENI.

184
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,750
Give me the bag.

185
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,370
Can you go over there
so I can test the lighting?

186
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,000
Me?

187
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,300
Did you forget that you’re supposed to
follow my orders today?

188
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,580
Right, intern?

189
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,500
Hey, take off your glasses.

190
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,750
Give me a smile.

191
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,300
The lighting is perfect right now.

192
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,900
Today’s job is to promote
the cafe to couples.

193
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,230
That smile doesn’t match the concept.

194
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,730
I don’t know how to do it.

195
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,350
When you look at someone you love,

196
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,400
what kind of eyes
do you usually give them?

197
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,150
The eyes I give someone I love?

198
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,500
Did I do it right?

199
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,180
You asked for the eyes
meant for someone I love.

200
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,430
Is this it?

201
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,900
Who were you imagining when we shot this?

202
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,300
I didn’t have to imagine anything.

203
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,650
You’re that good, huh?

204
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,910
I just…

205
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,860

All I had to do was recall

224
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,190
the feeling of meeting those eyes

225
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,300
and look through the lens.

226
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,210
We have a problem, Peach!

227
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,850
The model guy fell down the stairs!

228
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,590
What?

229
00:18:58,990 --> 00:18:59,740
Oh, shit.

230
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,790
But don’t worry, I’ve asked the crew
to look for a handsome young man

231
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,400
who’s radiant

232
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,300
and…charming.

233
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,500
Not a chance.

234
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,990
If Dad sees my face in the magazine,

235
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,800
not only will I get in trouble,

236
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,580
but everyone on set, including you,

237
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,460
will need to start looking for a new job.

238
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,900
Your only condition is
to not show your face, right?

239
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,800
Please get into position, intern.

240
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,000
Alright, hold the coffee a bit higher.

241
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:17,300
Turn a little more toward the back,
so your face can’t be seen.

242
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,100
Uh… Can you two move closer?

243
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,250
Make it look like you’re a couple.

244
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,760
Okay. One, two, three.

245
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,230
Touch your cups together.

246
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,100
You can turn the other way.

247
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,740
Yes, that’s right.

248
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,030
Okay. One, two, three.

249
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,060
Awesome.

250
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,490
Honestly, even without seeing
the guy model’s face,

251
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,800
-they still look like a real couple.
-Five more shots with this pose.

252
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,090
Great. That’s it.

253
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,780
Nice and sweet. Wow!

254
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:43,700
Okay.

255
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,850
I think we’re good to go.

256
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,630
Thank you so much for today, Peach.

257
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,350
Anyway, we worked together all day,
but I still don’t know your name.

258
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:53,700
You don’t need to know.

259
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,580
Oh, you’re mysterious, huh?

260
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:00,090
You also didn’t let your face be captured
during the photoshoot.

261
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,500
Honestly, if it weren’t for your skills,

262
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:06,690
I’m not sure how photos without
the model’s face would even work, Peach.

263
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,900
If everything’s good, please excuse us.

264
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,200
Alright.

265
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,500
Hold on!

266
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,400
I almost forgot.

267
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,200
Here’s a small token of appreciation.

268
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,350
Thanks for helping out.

269
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,700
Thank you so much.

270
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:28,910
No problem.

271
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,130
Can we leave already?

272
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,500
Please excuse us.

273
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,100
Alright.

274
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,700
(Isn’t he kinda weird?)

275
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,200
You’re tired, intern?

276
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,800
You’re feeling better now, right?

277
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,640
Why are you smiling so sweetly
at the bottle?

278
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,420
The one you should be smiling at is me.

279
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,200
I helped you out at work.

280
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:42,100
No, I’m smiling because of you.

281
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:51,450
Here.

282
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,700
A reward for your work.

283
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,300
Maybe it’ll help you feel less tired.

284
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,500
It’s a lot, right?

285
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,600
A lot?

286
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,770
This is probably just enough to buy the kind
of tissues used to wipe off my sweat today.

287
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:18,150
5,000 just for tissues?

288
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,590
Are your tissues made from
100-year olive trees or what?

289
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:35,250
Let’s see what else you can do with
the 5,000 you’d spend on tissues.

290
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,130
Can you handle riding that bike?

291
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,400
It’s a little old.

292
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,800
Push it out.

293
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,600
And bite.

294
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,400
Like this.

295
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,510
Mmm.

296
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,130
This is a gizzard.

297
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,530
I think this is the best one.

298
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:03,710
Come on.

299
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:04,740
Stop it!

300
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,300
Hey!

301
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:06,930
Are you okay?

302
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,300
I’m not used to this.

303
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,120
Do you want some carrots?

304
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,350
Hey!

305
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,000
We had both savory and sweet
for just a few hundred baht today.

306
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,130
Hmm?

307
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,000
I love watching you focus on something.

308
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,330
I’ve been meaning to ask

309
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,970
about your tattoo.

310
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,250
I got it when I received my first paycheck
as a photographer.

311
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,300
It’s to remind myself
to stay focused at work

312
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:55,700
and be mindful of everything I do.

313
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,850
But honestly, I won’t get another tattoo.

314
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,250
It hurt so bad.

315
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:05,870
What about you?

316
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,670
You’re not a mafia boss
without a tattoo, right?

317
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:11,920
Mmm.

318
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,200
But mine is not as meaningful as yours.

319
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,670
It’s just a rule I have to follow.

320
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,170
A rule again?

321
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,730
Your life really doesn’t sound like fun.

322
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:37,000
But you gave me so much fun today.

323
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,300
The day’s not over yet.

324
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,300
We still have plenty of money left.

325
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,570
I’ll take you to do more fun things.

Welcome.

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,200
Oh, I forgot.

359
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:19,750
Do I have to find a place
for Mr. Mok and your men too?

360
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,300
I had everyone leave.

361
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,250
Leave? Why?

362
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,900
With you, I have nothing to fear.

363
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,550
The pajamas—

364
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:56,800
Oh.

365
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,100
These are all the pajamas
I could prepare for you.

366
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,700
And don’t worry about your clothes.

367
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:06,600
I’ll wash them.

368
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,300
Just leave them in front of your room,

369
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:11,100
so you have nice clothes to wear
when you go home tomorrow.

370
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:11,900
Thank you.

371
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,180
Make yourself at home.

372
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,700
Alright, go take a bath.

373
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,100
Where’s the bathroom?

374
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:45,000
Are you really going to make me
take a bath here?

375
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,730
Well, yes.

376
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,300
The locals wash themselves here too.

377
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,400
Don’t worry.
No one’s going to sneak a look.

378
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,900
There’s no tub.

379
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,700
How am I supposed to take a bath?

380
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,150
You stand.

381
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,100
Here, take the bowl.

382
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,700
Here’s the soap,

383
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:10,070
and here’s the toothbrush and toothpaste.

384
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,500
Where’s the mirror?

385
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:24,100
Every time I wash my face
and brush my teeth,

386
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,700
I need to look at my face in the mirror.

387
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,700
You can look here.

388
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:32,500
Are you crazy?

389
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,550
I’ll wait upstairs.

390
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,350
You can…brush your teeth
and look at yourself in the water.

391
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,250
Or do I have to brush your teeth for you?

392
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:04,300
Will you?

393
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,500
Are you joking?

394
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,550
I never joke, do I?

395
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,300
Are my teeth white?

396
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,350
Well, yeah.

397
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:02,900
Hey!

398
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,400
This is beyond embarrassing.

399
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,000
Theerakit Kian Lee,

400
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,050
the owner of ARSENI,
who carries his gun everywhere,

401
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,550
is afraid of cockroaches?

402
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,700
Don’t worry. It’s gone.

403
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,700
Your tattoo is pretty big.

404
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:09,850
Did it hurt a lot when you got it?

405
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,290
Yeah, it hurt.

406
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,500
But I’m so used to the pain
that I didn’t feel anything anymore.

407
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:42,350
Pain is something to overcome,

408
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:45,700
not something to get used to.

409
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,180
I can’t get through it.

410
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,170
Hi, young man.

411
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:08,969
Are you looking for a room?

412
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,070
Oh, no.

413
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,400
I’m waiting for my friend,

414
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,210
but I’m leaving soon.

415
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:19,300
Well, you can do this to kill time.

416
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,000
I have this for guests to enjoy.

417
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,280
Oh, it’s alright.

418
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:24,500
Just try it.

419
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,699
I’m not charging extra.

420
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:28,340
Alright then.

421
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:29,300
Have fun.

422
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:48,830
Do the pajamas fit?

423
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:54,550
I’m not quite used to them yet.

424
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,450
What do you usually wear to sleep?

425
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,230
Everything I own has
Theerakit K. Lee engraved on it.

426
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,400
Including your pajamas?

427
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:33,970
What are you doing?

428
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:35,970

447
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,030
I won.

448
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,550
How was today? Did you enjoy it?

449
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,300
I haven’t forgotten.

450
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:10,200
You said that if we say 'sorry'
and 'thank you' too often,

451
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,900
they stop being an honor.

452
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,700
They stop being ‘honored.’

453
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,350
But I really want to thank you for today.

454
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:32,900
You make me unusually happy.

455
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,000
Really?

456
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:47,130
Thank you, Peach.

457
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,650
You’re welcome, Mr. Thee.

458
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,450
What’s the meaning of this?

459
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:25,570
Hmm?

460
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,100
What did I do?

461
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:29,700
I remember I already told you

462
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:34,150
Peach will be the photographer for
every collection of All Season’s One Word.

463
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:41,240
Wait, but I thought only the Fall contract
has Mr. Peach’s name.

464
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,700
If you’ve made a spoken promise,
that’s on you.

465
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:49,000
I don’t know whether you and Peach
had a problem before,

466
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,500
but you’re ruining my work.

467
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:57,200
As the head of this project,

468
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:01,180
I think my working style
and Peach’s don’t match.

469
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:09,200
Besides, I think ARSENI brought me in
to be on the same level as you.

470
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,400
What are you saying?

471
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:17,450
You’d better spend your time
making sure your work is good, alright?

472
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,370
Don’t interfere with someone else’s work.

473
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,050
It’s unprofessional.

474
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,850
You’ve dropped Peach home safely, right?

475
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,880
Was he sulking because he missed me?

476
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:45,970
Boss—

477
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,350
If I hadn’t had to come back early
for the meeting,

478
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:49,450
we wouldn’t have had to leave separately.

479
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:50,230
Boss—

480
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:54,530
Should I make up for my mistake
by buying that homestay

481
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,450
and transferring the ownership to Peach?

482
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:02,300
It’ll be a memento of our memories.

483
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:07,750
There’s an urgent document, Boss.

484
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,530
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT

485
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,400
What’s the meaning of this?

486
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,630
Why is Peach not the photographer?

487
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,000
The new project head asked to replace him.

488
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:26,500
He suggested using a full-time
photographer to reduce costs.

489
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:28,900
Who made that suggestion?

490
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,850
The new team leader.

491
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:31,900
His name is Wiwid.

492
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,250
I’m not approving it.

493
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,100
But we need a reason
to argue with Marketing.

494
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:40,400
They’ve already signed the document.

495
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,430
Wiwid was filed for child sexual abuse,

496
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:53,650
but there wasn’t enough evidence
to prosecute him,

497
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,400
so he was able to settle the case
by paying compensation.

498
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,010
That’s enough to answer
Marketing’s questions, isn’t it?

499
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:04,600
Yes.

500
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,650
And as for him daring to mess with Peach,

501
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:12,500
just firing him won’t be enough.

502
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,900
What do you mean, Boss?

503
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:19,450
I’ll just make sure he never dares
show his face to bother Peach again.

504
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,200
Got it.

505
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:32,500
I’ll still get to work on
the Spring Collection with Nuch.

506
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:33,570
I’m not worried.

507
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,200
But he played dirty.

508
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:39,200
See? I told you he’d find a way
to kick you out.

509
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:41,800
Calm down.

510
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,370
You’re too calm.

511
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:50,430
How am I calm? I’m very impatient.

512
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,500
I can’t wait to take a 3-month vacation.

513
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:55,400
This is not the time to joke.

514
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:58,810
If I don’t have money for food,
will you take care of me, sister?

515
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:01,370
Not funny.

516
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,300
Okay, okay. Don’t scold me.

517
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:10,700
Plub, I’m going to see Mother
next Saturday.

518
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:12,200
Do you want to come with me?

519
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:16,020
Sure. I'll go home this Friday.

520
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:16,500
Plub!

521
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:17,660
Plub! Plub!

522
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:18,900
Plub!

523
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:20,890
Peach, I have to go.

524
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,110
(Hang up.)

525
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:23,900
What’s going on?

526
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,600
Wiwid is gone.

527
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,240
Huh?

528
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,690
What do you mean he’s gone?

529
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,710
He’s gone, like really gone.

530
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,750
Gone as if he never existed.

531
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,500
Yeah.

532
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,700
Nuch, Note, please speak slowly.

533
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:37,770
I don’t understand.

534
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,120
Wiwid’s stuff is gone from his desk,
and he’s gone from ARSENI

535
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,500
with no way to reach him.

536
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:43,010
Yeah.

537
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,200
I had no reason not to help you, did I?

538
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:53,600
You’re my man.

539
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:56,950
No one has the right to bully you.

540
00:43:58,870 --> 00:43:59,900
What did you do to Wiwid?

541
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:04,780
It’s something you shouldn’t know about.

542
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,650
Is he hurt?

543
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,700
He treated you that badly,
and you’re still worried about him?

544
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:13,050
Can I ask you not to hurt him?

545
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:16,900
Getting fired without notice was enough.

546
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:22,700
Do what Peach asked.

547
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:24,770
Yes, Boss.

548
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:33,350
I fired him not only because
he was a bad leader,

549
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:37,800
but also because he didn’t even have
basic humanity.

550
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:44,800
Mr. Thee.

551
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:05,100
Are you going anywhere this weekend?

552
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:11,600
I want to stay there with you again.

553
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:16,300
I already have plans with my sister.

554
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:21,020
Then invite your sister to join us.

555
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:22,250
Are you crazy?

556
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,800
If my sister finds out I’m close to…

557
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:29,900
Mr. Theerakit Kian Lee,

558
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,000
she’ll die of shock.

559
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,050
But I—

560
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:33,790
No.

561
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:36,050
I really can’t make it.

562
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:38,730
How about this?

563
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:43,450
I’ll find somewhere new so we can
go together when we have time.

564
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,050
Don’t worry.

565
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:46,900
I’m free for the next three months anyway.

566
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:49,000
How come?

567
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,000
I already fired him.

568
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,600
Did no one tell you?

569
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:02,800
Before Wiwid fired me,

570
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
he had already signed a new photographer.

571
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:14,380
Mok.

572
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:15,710
Yes, Boss.

573
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:16,600
Stop.

574
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:18,510
Both of you stop. Don’t do anything yet.

575
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:22,300
But all the contracts reviewed by Wiwid
are considered invalid.

576
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:24,800
I understand,

577
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:29,460
but Nuch said the new guy
already quit his previous job.

578
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:32,550
If you fire him, he’ll be in a tough spot.

579
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:33,580
You care about everyone in the world!

580
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:34,790
You worry about everyone in the world!

581
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:37,300
Are you the guardian of people’s peace?

582
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:38,800
Money.

583
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,810
Your money and other people's money
aren’t the same.

584
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:48,230
Remember the 5,000
you were going to spend on tissues?

585
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,900
Other people can do a lot with that money.

586
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:57,300
Being unemployed
in this economy isn’t fun.

587
00:46:57,770 --> 00:46:59,200
But you were removed from the project.

588
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:01,550
Isn’t that losing a job?

589
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:03,900
It’s not the same.

590
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:05,150
How is it not the same?

591
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:11,400
It’s not the same because
I have you to treat me to meals.

592
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:19,850
Mok.

593
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:22,500
Have Peach removed from every project.

594
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,120
Hey!

595
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:23,960
Hold on!

596
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:27,230
And make sure the name Peachayarat
is blacklisted.

597
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,750
Make sure no one can hire him again.

598
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:31,300
Hey, I was joking.

599
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:32,890
Mr. Mok, I—

600
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,000
Get a grip.

601
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:42,700
From now on, I’ll take care of you.

602
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:46,000
Mr. Mok, I was joking.

603
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:47,300
Please don’t do that. I’m begging you.

604
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,250
Please get a grip and wait.

605
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:54,760
It’s just one collection.

606
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,050
I already signed the Spring
and Summer collections with Nuch.

607
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,120
Don’t worry.
We’ll be together for a long time.

608
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:06,380
Can we do that for the rest of our lives?

609
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,100
I’m bringing dolls for the kids.

610
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,700
Marn is going to love them so much.

611
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:33,330
Let’s hurry.

612
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,200
Mother just called to ask
when we’ll arrive.

613
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,490
She said the kids miss
their big sister so bad.

614
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,470
Who are you calling “big sister”?

615
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:44,500
Let’s take my car, so I can go straight
to my condo afterward.

616
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:49,000
But you’re driving.

617
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:53,950
Okay.

618
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:55,850
Let’s go.

619
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:05,350
Mr. Thee.

620
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:09,880
Here’s my leave letter.

621
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:17,200
How many days this time?

622
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:22,900
They said seven days.

623
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:29,200
But if anything urgent comes up,
please feel free to call me anytime.

624
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,450
BAAN KLAMAI PLAYGROUND

625
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:38,250
Come on!

626
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:43,900
Plub never grew up in my eyes.

627
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:46,550
She’s still as mischievous
as when she was a kid.

628
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:48,770
Plub is actually amazing.

629
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:51,400
She becomes a completely
different person when she works.

630
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:55,180
You’re both amazing.

631
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:58,100
You two grew up really well.

632
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:01,300
All because you raised us well, Mother.

633
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,800
We are who we are today because of you.

634
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:09,650
Peach, do you remember
what you said to me back then?

635
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:15,900
Is someone taking Plub away, Mother?

636
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:19,900
I don’t want to go.
I want to stay with Peach.

637
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,500
I promise I’ll study hard
and save a lot of money.

638
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,200
While I’m saving, can you please take care
of Lookplub, Mother?

639
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,100
I’ll come back for her.

640
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:44,950
I’m really grateful you did what I asked.

641
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:52,500
Your eyes that day
told me you could do it.

642
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:58,300
And today, you’ve shown me that
you can take care of Plub really well.

643
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:08,600
How are the new kids?

644
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:10,450
Peach!

645
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:12,150
Come play with us.

646
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:14,020
Marn, Mork, go get Peach.

647
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:14,590
Got it.

648
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:17,650
Alright.

649
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:18,910
-Come on.
-Okay.

650
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:19,520
Let’s go.

651
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:21,200
Oh, your hands are messy.

652
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:23,090
Give me your legs too.

653
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:23,670
Okay.

654
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:26,090
Run! They’re coming!

655
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:27,470
We’re coming!

656
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:29,680
Come here!

657
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,370
I’m almost there.

658
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,520
We’re about to pass you.

659
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:44,300
We’ve arrived at your condo.

660
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:49,630
We’ve arrived?

661
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,310
All that mischief wore you out.

662
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,600
Well, I don’t get to go home often.

663
00:51:58,270 --> 00:51:59,800
Go take a shower and sleep.

664
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,530
Go now.

665
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,100
Oh, your hair smells sweaty.

666
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,040
Who asked you to kiss it?

667
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:12,110
I’m going now.

668
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:27,200
Plub.

669
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:30,470
You forgot your car key.

670
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:33,900
Thank you.

671
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:35,980
Plub.

672
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:39,230
I’m so proud of you.

673
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:43,600
I’m so proud of you too, brother.

674
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,100
Go take a shower and sleep.

675
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:52,100
Let me know when you get home.

676
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:54,250
Have you booked a ride?

677
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:55,550
Yes.

678
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:56,960
Okay.

679
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:57,770
Bye-bye.

680
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:58,730
Bye-bye.

681
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:13,630
Hello.

682
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:15,810
Oh, where are you?

683
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:19,650
Anything that can help me spot you?

684
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:23,450
Oh, okay. You need to take a U-turn there.

685
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,450
I’ll walk over. Okay.

686
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:27,700
Ouch!

687
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:31,900
Wiwid.

688
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,900
You’re the one who screwed up my life,
aren’t you?

689
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:37,400
Where do you think you’re going?

690
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:39,810
Where are you going, huh?

691
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,250
Come here!

692
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,490
Damn it!

693
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,180
Ouch!

694
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:51,100
Hey!

695
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,800
Where the hell
are you running off to, huh?

696
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:16,400
Do you think you can run away from me?

697
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,800
You’re so cocky, huh?

698
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:20,900
Stop pissing me the hell off.

699
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:21,900
You see what this is?

700
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:22,600
Huh?

701
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:24,430
Hey!

702
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,100
Let go!

703
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:26,400
Calm down!

704
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,600
Hey! No!

705
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:29,810
I told you to stop!

706
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:30,860
Hey!

707
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:32,360
Hey! Don’t do it!

708
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:38,200
Don’t hurt the kids!

709
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:42,070
I’m going to hit you!

710
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,050
Mr. Thee!

711
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:50,750
Hold on, Mr. Thee.

712
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:53,670
Please calm down and drop your gun,
Mr. Thee.

713
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:54,500
Nothing’s going on here.

714
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:56,340
Please drop the gun.

715
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:57,450
Please calm down.

716
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:06,430
Ouch!

717
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:13,360
Ouch!

718
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,100
Ouch!

719
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,500
Please calm down.

720
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:23,980
Ouch!

721
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,000
Calm down.

722
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:27,750
Please calm down.

723
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:29,250
Hey.

724
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:29,960
No.

725
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:32,200
Don’t shoot.

726
00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:38,150
I’m not going to kill him,
but he needs to hurt more than you do.

727
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:39,890
Many times more.

728
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:10,400
Welcome, Mr. Kritdanai.

729
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:16,730
I missed you so much.

730
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,210
If you’d opened your eyes
just one hour later,

731
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:37,840
I would've gone into your dream
to pull you out.

732
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:38,980
There’s nothing to worry about.

733
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:39,580
Are you sure?

734
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:41,410
Let me open it for you.

735
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,150
(Whose voice is that?)

736
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:44,160
Hide! My sister is on her way here!

737
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,380
But you have a lot of stuff in here.

738
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:46,120
Try to get in.

739
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:47,250
I’m trying.

740
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,500
(Hope you enjoy this peaceful rest.)

741
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:52,990
It’s not so peaceful anymore
because of you.

742
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,090
You’ve crushed my heart into pieces.

743
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:55,920
So cheesy.

744
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:57,000
I want to try playing it.

745
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,290
Are you interested in music?

746
00:56:58,310 --> 00:56:59,170
I’m interested in you.
