Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,760
If I’d known staying here
would inconvenience them this much,

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,460
I would’ve stayed at the hotel I booked.

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,300
I just want to take care of you
as best as I can.

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,370
That’s all.

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,490
You have to follow my orders today.

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,400
Give me a smile.

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,210
When you look at someone you love,
what kind of eyes do you usually give them?

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,790
The eyes I give someone I love?

13
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,299
What’s the meaning of this?

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,540
Why is Peach not the photographer?

15
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:34,730
Did no one tell you?

16
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,350
Before Wiwid fired me,
he had already signed a new photographer.

17
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,400
You’re the one
who screwed up my life, aren’t you?

18
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:42,600
Mr. Thee!

19
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,900
I’m not going to kill him.

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,410
Don’t hurt our kids!

21
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,390
Let go of me!

22
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,629
I’m here. It’s okay.

23
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,400
Does it hurt, Peach?

24
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,650
Don’t be afraid.

25
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,450
I’ll protect you, Lookplub.

26
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,250
But what about you?

27
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,200
No one can protect you.

28
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,350
I’ve been worried sick about you.

29
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,700
Did you stay with me all night?

30
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:54,300
Do you realize how long you were asleep?

31
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,850
If you’d opened your eyes
just one hour later,

32
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,400
I would've gone into your dream
to pull you out.

33
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,600
Why are you smiling?

34
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,530
Did I hurt you?

35
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,900
Wait here. I’ll get you a doctor.

36
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,000
Hey.

37
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,610
No.

38
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,150
It doesn’t hurt.

39
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,940
-You don’t have to.
-But you’re crying.

40
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,000
No.

41
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,950
I can see it with my own eyes.
Why are you denying it?

42
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,420
You’re with me.
What are you still afraid of?

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,900
You’re the reason.

44
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:04,270
Is someone like me, who’s willing to
protect you with my life, making you cry?

45
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,000
Make the most of your days off.

46
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,250
I can handle things here. Don’t worry.

47
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,520
(But Boss…)

48
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,420
Talk to you later, Mok.

49
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,050
I have to take care of Peach now.

50
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,010
(Yes, Boss.)

51
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,500
How is he?

52
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,170
The doctor said
there’s nothing to worry about.

53
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,000
Are you sure?

54
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,200
There’s no internal injury?

55
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,700
What about his brain,

56
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,700
internal organs,

57
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,970
or anything that could become
a chronic problem in the future?

58
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,900
Is there anything like that?

59
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,700
I think you should listen to the nurse.

60
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,010
Earlier, the doctor did a full check.

61
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,200
What about his hands?

62
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,700
Can he still hold a camera like usual?

63
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,400
There’s nothing to worry about, right?

64
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,100
All the test results came back good.

65
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:22,700
You can leave.

66
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,330
I need some private time.

67
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,230
Let’s finish settling this.

68
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,550
What is this about?

69
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,700
If someone had to make you cry,

70
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,000
can I be the last person on earth
to do that?

71
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,150
Kian’s right-hand man
is still as good as ever.

72
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,500
Please keep your distance.

73
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,600
How far do you want?

74
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,400
A normal distance between
a boss and an employee.

75
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:40,730
You’re so cold.

76
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,000
Please don’t do that again, Mr. Kritdanai.

77
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,140
You know I don’t like it.

78
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,010
But I like it.

79
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:50,820
Ouch!

80
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:01,850
Wow.

81
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,070
Your heart is beating pretty fast.

82
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,100
How’s it going in the love department?

83
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,650
Single.

84
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,500
I’m asking about Kian.

85
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,060
I’m talking about Mr. Thee too.

86
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,050
Amazing.

87
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,300
How’s that amazing?

88
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:36,780
You two used to wish each other
would find good love.

89
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,200
What I think is amazing…

90
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,900
is you.

91
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,550
Why didn’t you call me?

92
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,700
At that moment,
it was hard to even run away.

93
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,940
I mean before that.

94
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,650
Why didn’t you call to tell me
you didn’t have a car?

95
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,750
Can I really call you
about something that small?

96
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,200
Hundreds and thousands of people
want my number.

97
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,040
You have my number, but won’t call me.

98
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,299
I didn’t know you’d allow me to do that.

99
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,200
I was the one who saved my number
on your phone.

100
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,100
That means I gave you permission
to call me

101
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,350
about anything at any time.

102
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,500
Or as often as you want.

103
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,150
Don’t bite your lips.

104
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,950
They could crack.

105
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,670
I can’t stand seeing you hurt
any more than you already are, Peach.

106
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,250
You look like you’re going to cry again.

107
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,630
Am I hurting you?

108
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,550
Do you want me to leave?

109
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,900
You’re making me feel like a little kid.

110
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,070
It’d be great if you were little.

111
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,750
I’d carry you in my pocket everywhere.

112
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,500
I won’t let anyone hurt you again.

113
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,610
Mr. Thee.

114
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,400
You’re mine.

115
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,300
No one has the right to mess with
the one I call mine.

116
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,330
Reasons humans cry.

117
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,860
(Humans cry for many reasons.)

118
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,290
(They can be physical or mental.)

119
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,980
(Humans cry because of
overwhelming feelings.)

120
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,500
(Sadness, happiness, pain,
or even stress.)

121
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,420
(Tears are a form of release.)

122
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:46,380
I’m sorry I cried to you.

123
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,670
You’re probably surprised.

124
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,830
I didn’t cry because
you did something bad,

125
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,370
but because you did something good.

126
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,100
If I did something good,
then you should be smiling.

127
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,300
You might know a bit about my background.

128
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,040
Did Mok tell on me?

129
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,450
You might already know that
my sister and I only have each other.

130
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:25,240
I had to grow up quickly to become
a father, a mother, and a brother to Plub.

131
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,850
It’s like I’m forced
to never show weakness.

132
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,750
I actually don’t even remember
the last time I cried.

133
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,450
If I had to cry,
I’d have to do it alone in secret.

134
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,300
With you earlier, I felt like a kid again.

135
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:03,100
I just realized how good
being taken care of by someone feels.

136
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,820
(If you want to take care of someone
for the rest of your life,)

137
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,100
(the best way is to get married
and constantly give each other love.)

138
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:20,640
(But before you get there,
don’t forget to win their heart first.)

139
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,400
(I’m rooting for you.)

140
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,620
Yes, I’m sorry.

141
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,500
I didn’t text you back because
I fell asleep.

142
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,350
(I called you so many times,
but you wouldn’t pick up.)

143
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,190
(I was worried sick.
I almost went to see you at home.)

144
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,300
Huh? Did you come?

145
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,740
(You sound weird,
like you didn’t come home last night.)

146
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,300
Of course, I came home.

147
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,700
Where else would I have stayed?

148
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,700
I promise it won’t happen again.

149
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,180
Come on. Let me open it for you.

150
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,300
(Whose voice is that?)

151
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,000
Whose voice? No one.

152
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:40,970
(Send me a selfie.)

153
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:41,480
Huh?

154
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,950
(Send me a selfie.)

155
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,780
Oh, okay.

156
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,050
Give me a second.

157
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,660
Let me take one inside the house.

158
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,450
Hello?

159
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,140
I’ll send it in a bit.

160
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:10,470
Sent.

161
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,250
(Whose shadow is that in the mirror?)

162
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,700
Huh? Who?

163
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:17,900
Was it the light?

164
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,900
Don’t say stuff like that, Plub.
You’re scaring me.

165
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,370
Plub! Are you pranking me?

166
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,140
(Don’t let me find out
you’re secretly dating)

167
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,400
(and that’s why you didn’t come home.)

168
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,130
I’m an adult. Why would I date in secret?

169
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,230
(If you want to confess,
just tell me when to meet up.)

170
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,530
(Don’t make me find out on my own.)

171
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,570
What are you doing, by the way?

172
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,300
Are you at the office?
What time do you get off?

173
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,600
(I’m at the outpost.)

174
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:50,500
Huh?

175
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,000
You’re at the guard post?

176
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,900
Hey, hide!

177
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,150
My sister is almost here!

178
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:58,820
Right here. Hide yourself.

179
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,250
-Are you sure this is a good idea?
-Get inside.

180
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,620
But you have a lot of stuff in here.

181
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,600
Try to get in.

182
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,400
I’m trying.

183
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,200
Alright, come out.

184
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:07,970
Come out.

185
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,010
Go hide under the table.

186
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,360
Duck down.

187
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:12,500
Under the table.

188
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,250
Hide your head too.

189
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,300
Your sister must be blind

190
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,510
if she doesn’t see me.

191
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:22,910
Come here.

192
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,020
Go over there. Go!

193
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,200
(Help me push the bottom lane.
They’re in our outpost.)

194
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,500
(Freaking pay attention!)

195
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,250
Which post are you at, Plub?

196
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,190
(I gotta go, Peach.
My base is getting destroyed.)

197
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:44,580
Is it down yet?

198
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,200
Almost.

199
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,370
Hey. Crush! Crush! Crush!

200
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,690
The outpost?

201
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,930
Oh, it’s my head
that’s about to get crushed.

202
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,870
Let’s get to work.

203
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,700
Protect the outpost!

204
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,660
Don’t let it get destroyed.

205
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,010
Come on!

206
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,250
Come here.

207
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,000
Hmm?

208
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,550
Lie down properly.

209
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,660
What are you doing?

210
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,500
Come on.

211
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,300
Close your eyes.

212
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,250
Hmm?

213
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,900
I said, close your eyes.

214
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:55,850
Let’s apply this.

215
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,550
You’ve been crying a lot.
Your eyes could get really swollen.

216
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,550
If we don’t do this, it’ll get worse.

217
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,200
Oh, wow.

218
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,900
You’re so good at this.

219
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,650
You must do it
for other people all the time.

220
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,730
I got it from soap operas.

221
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,570
You really are obsessed
with soap operas, aren’t you?

222
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,850
So, is it true that you don’t have anyone?

223
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,150
Hmm?

224
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,230
Your sister asked if you had a partner.

225
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,410
Please.

226
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,820
Where would I find the time to get one?

227
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,600
But recently,

228
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,400
someone’s made your heart
flutter and waver.

229
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,250
Am I right?

230
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,700
Hmm? No.

231
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,500
Not even a little?

232
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,900
Where would I find the time
to catch feelings for anyone?

233
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,180
I’m only spending time
with you these days.

234
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:05,900
Mr. Thee.

235
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,750
Ouch!

236
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:08,600
Hey.

237
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:09,810
Hey!

238
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:10,560
Hey!

239
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,040
Get a grip, Mr. Thee!

240
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,600
Half of my face almost went numb.

241
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,100
Can I try that instrument?

242
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,370
I’ve never seen you this interested
in anything.

243
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,500
Are you sure?

244
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,250
I want to try playing it.

245
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,250
You’d better take off your ring.

246
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,040
Take it easy.

247
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,550
These things take time.

248
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,740
But I want to be able to do it.

249
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,650
Why do you suddenly want to play it?

250
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,060
Are you interested in music?

251
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,050
I’m interested in you.

252
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,370
I want to get to know what you like.

253
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,000
Why did you ask me
to come take photos here with you?

254
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,370
You want to learn about what I like,
don’t you?

255
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,550
A handpan might be a bit too difficult.

256
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,900
Let’s start with photography.

257
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,940
Besides, I love taking photos
more than playing the instrument.

258
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:52,850
Just a little.

259
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,650
Give me a smile.

260
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,750
I only know how to make this face.

261
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,700
Happy or sad, it’s the same face.

262
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:08,800
You want to smile so badly,
but you have to act cool.

263
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,030
That’s why you’re stuck with that face.

264
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,600
See? You can make more than one face.

265
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,500
How many millions
could this photo sell for?

266
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,300
The ARSENI president with his sweet smile.

267
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,100
Sweet smile?

268
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,700
You have a beautiful smile.

269
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,800
You should smile often.

270
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,850
Smile at you.

271
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,750
Teach me how to take photos.

272
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,040
Let’s try something easy first.

273
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,290
Let it do that automatically.

274
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,210
Okay.

275
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:18,400
Put something interesting here.

276
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,600
See? The sharpness changes.

277
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:25,480
Try taking one here.

278
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:28,460
Not bad.

279
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:29,780
Well done.

280
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,290
Try this.

281
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,300
What’s wrong?

282
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:48,900
That photo looks great.

283
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,330
It’s tilted, and you can see it.

284
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:52,800
You don’t have to comfort me.

285
00:23:54,450 --> 00:24:00,000
If it’s tilted,
next time just check this line.

286
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,350
It’s the cut of the nine-box grid.

287
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,030
Cut what?

288
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,630
Why?

289
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,380
It's the Rule of Thirds.

290
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,570
It’s used to check
the symmetry of a photo.

291
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,000
This one is a bit blown out.

292
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,300
How should I adjust it?

293
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,700
Press here and look here.

294
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,700
This is called a histogram.

295
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,560
It’s all like an alien language.

296
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,200
Did you have to study all that?

297
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:33,500
You’re really good at this.

298
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,900
We all have things we’re good at
and things we’re not.

299
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:41,200
Managing a business like you do?

300
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,000
That’s something I can’t do.

301
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:49,900
My job is just pressing the shutter.

302
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,600
I can take ten or a hundred shots,
just in case.

303
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,370
But your work?

304
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,050
Just one wrong decision,

305
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,700
and you’re responsible for
the whole of ARSENI.

306
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:03,240
Not to mention your employees’ families.

307
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,470
You’re doing amazing.

308
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,150
Am I doing okay?

309
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,060
Hey.

310
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,700
No one’s ever told me I’m amazing.

311
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,500
Once I manage to do something,
I have to do better.

312
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,100
No matter how much I do,
it’s never enough.

313
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:44,000
What you’re doing is more than
any one person can handle.

314
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:50,700
Take a break and be lazy sometimes.

315
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,200
Add some silly things to your life.

316
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:10,950
Hey.

317
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,150
Hey.

318
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,820
Do you get what I’m saying?

319
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:28,700
Come on.

320
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:30,200
Let’s take some photos together.

321
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,300
For what occasion?

322
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,650
Why would we need one?

323
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:45,770
It’s just to add something silly
to your life.

324
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:48,250
Come on. Get in the frame.

325
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:51,700
Two amazing people.

326
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,660
Cheese.

327
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:09,280
Hey.

328
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,500
You still haven’t called your men
to pick you up?

329
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,700
And what are all these things
hanging in front of my house?

330
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:17,950
I don’t want to leave you alone just yet.

331
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,450
But it’s late.

332
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,580
You haven’t slept since yesterday.

333
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,580
I’m fine now. I can be on my own.

334
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,180
Can you stop being used to being
on your own

335
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,450
and just let me into your world?

336
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,700
I’m going out of my way
to offer myself to you.

337
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,650
If you reject me,

338
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,800
you might regret it
for the rest of your life.

339
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,300
What soap opera did he get that from now?

340
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,700
(I’ve sent the team to pick you up, Boss.)

341
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,140
What about the other thing
I asked you to take care of?

342
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:57,400
Is it done?

343
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:58,850
(Yes.)

344
00:27:59,370 --> 00:27:59,900
Good.

345
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,500
If we’re going to strike a snake,
we have to finish it off.

346
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:17,550
Is that about Wiwid?

347
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,400
I didn’t think he’d go so far.

348
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,630
I’ve had my people watching him

349
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,300
since the day you asked me to let him go.

350
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,200
And look what happened.

351
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:38,400
He eventually showed the stupidity
he mistook for cleverness.

352
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,850
I won’t even let an ant bite
the tip of my finger.

353
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,140
How dare he mess with my man?

354
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,200
I think what I’m about to ask
will upset you.

355
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,600
No matter how displeased
your question makes me,

356
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,200
I’d never hurt you.

357
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,100
You’re my exception in everything.

358
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:07,340
How’s Wiwid?

359
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,500
Don’t tell me he’s dead.

360
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,740
Why would I do that and make you mad?

361
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,250
Then how is he?

362
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:25,150
You’re really upsetting me
with your question.

363
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:28,970
Hey.

364
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,600
No.

365
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:31,850
Don’t shoot.

366
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,300
I’m not going to kill him,

367
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,800
but he needs to hurt more than you do.

368
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:39,700
Many times more.

369
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:43,700
I’m sorry, Mr. Thee!

370
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:44,600
I won’t do this again!

371
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:48,750
Hey.

372
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,900
You’re the reason he’s still alive.

373
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,330
Ouch!

374
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,200
You were the one who saved him
from being slaughtered.

375
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:03,900
Did you forget?

376
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,530
I only asked for his life to be spared.

377
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,400
You sound like
you’re talking about an animal.

378
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:13,620
You should stop talking about him
and try to make up with me already.

379
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:15,400
If he’s not dead, then how is he?

380
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,200
He’s still alive somewhere in this world.

381
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,050
What do you mean?

382
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,900
Shouldn’t it be enough for you
that he’s alive?

383
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,200
Do you have any idea
how shattered I felt when I saw you hurt?

384
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:46,230
Honestly, when I saw that you were
the one saving me in that moment,

385
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,500
I kinda felt good.

386
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:54,450
I knew I was safe with you.

387
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,200
People are usually afraid of me.

388
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,880
Once again, you’re the first
to think otherwise.

389
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:03,830
Thank you.

390
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:06,980
Without you, things would’ve been
worse for me.

391
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:07,850
But you have me.

392
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,000
Your men probably arrived.

393
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,180
Let’s hurry up and eat. It’s late.

394
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,150
You have to leave soon.

395
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,250
No.

396
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,580
Well…

397
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,970
Can I walk you up and see you to bed?

398
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,250
Huh?

399
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,200
What’s the meaning of this?

400
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,400
What are you talking about?

401
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:14,350
This!

402
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,250
You’ve crushed my heart into pieces.

403
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,530
You’ve done it, Peachayarat.

404
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,600
I’m hurting to the point of dying.

405
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,250
Huh?

406
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,000
I keep repeating it to you
from morning to night

407
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:50,700
that you will be safe under my care!

408
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,670
And you still think of
running away from me?

409
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,150
Hear me out.

410
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,460
Remember this!

411
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,400
Not even death can take you away from me!

412
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:01,700
If Hell or Heaven has anyone
from the Lee family there,

413
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,980
I’ll have my ancestors lock you away
until the day I die and fall after you!

414
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,450
Die and fall?

415
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,040
You’re not planning on going to Heaven?

416
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:10,790
Keep it coming!

417
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,200
Come up with more cruel words.

418
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,900
Keep stabbing my heart with them!

419
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:15,800
Go on!

420
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,540
Get a grip.

421
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,400
I phrase every word carefully
before I speak.

422
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,420
I do not act on impulse!

423
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:25,000
And I’m reasonable enough not to run away!

424
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,600
I’m just going on vacation.

425
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,740
What did you say?

426
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:39,570
If you’d kept it together
and read it carefully,

427
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,140
you would’ve seen that
it’s a domestic ticket

428
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,350
with a return flight.

429
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,060
A return flight?

430
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,100
In that case,
can I buy you a private plane

431
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,050
to make it up to you?

432
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,400
You won’t have to sit cramped
next to anyone.

433
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,300
Or a private jet.

434
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,590
I can just hire one,
so it’ll be a bit cheaper.

435
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:28,060
Or a private beach with a land deed!

436
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:29,900
How about a private island?

437
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,800
Oh, Peach!

438
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,699
I can’t think of anything
simpler than these!

439
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:40,600
Are you sick?

440
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:41,750
No.

441
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,550
Maybe someone’s missing you.

442
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,300
It’s probably just dust.

443
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:12,670
You’re probably right

444
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,700
because I haven’t started missing you yet.

445
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,600
I have three months off from ARSENI,

446
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,500
so I just thought I’d go on vacation.

447
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,650
I’m not going to Hell.

448
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,200
I’ve asked you this before,

449
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,350
but I’ll ask again.

450
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,750
If you want to keep working
on the project,

451
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,600
you know I can make it happen, right?

452
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,400
Of course.

453
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,860
Is there anything
Theerakit Kian Lee can’t do?

454
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,670
I’ll say it again.

455
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,510
Thank you, but I’m fine.

456
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,270
I don’t want to cause trouble for anyone.

457
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:23,200
But it’s been your project from the start.

458
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:25,450
It’s everyone’s project.

459
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:29,300
Even without me, it can go on as usual.

460
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,200
I believe everyone will work hard
as usual—

461
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:36,900
Nuch, Plub, Note,

462
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,000
and Aran.

463
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,300
Especially him. You don’t have to worry.

464
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,350
-He’s professional.
-I’m not worried about Aran or anyone else.

465
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,230
I’m only worried about you.

466
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,900
I’m about to go on vacation happily.

467
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,770
Why do you need to worry about me?

468
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,250
The day after tomorrow, I have a meeting

469
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,860
and dinner with my younger brother.

470
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,960
And?

471
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,160
I can’t go with you.

472
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,060
When did I invite you?

473
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,700
Your words are hurting my feelings again.

474
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:18,670
I’m sorry.

475
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,600
I actually don’t want to trouble you.

476
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,950
I travel alone all the time.

477
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,700
I stop to take photos along the way

478
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:35,340
and sell them online for pocket money.

479
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,200
You’re squandering your days away.

480
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,950
Can you be nicer with your words?

481
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,000
If Thai is so difficult for you,

482
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,300
you don’t have to use difficult words.

483
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:56,150
I have a hotel in that area.

484
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,200
It has the best views in the city.

485
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,140
I don’t want to—

486
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,650
If I can’t go to take care of you
in person,

487
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,400
can you at least be under my watch?

488
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:16,830
Alright.

489
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:23,800
I won’t let you be in danger again.

490
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,150
Even to the farthest edge of the sky,

491
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:28,930
I will chase you down and save you.

492
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,380
Rest assured, Peach.

493
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,800
Your words are…

494
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,020
so cheesy.

495
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:41,900
But I’m starting to get used to them.

496
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:47,150
Is my Thai really that bad?

497
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,000
Honestly?

498
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:49,950
Yes.

499
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,760
This time, it’s weird too.

500
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,600
I thought you said you were
getting used to them.

501
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:05,140
Why is it still weird?

502
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,860
This time, it’s not your words
that are weird.

503
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,030
It’s more about the feelings.

504
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,600
Hearing your cheesy words makes me…

505
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,900
feel safe somehow.

506
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:31,300
Thank you.

507
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:49,000
You’re welcome.

508
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,470
Mm.

509
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:09,100
Kian!

510
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,180
Kian!

511
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,360
When did you get back?

512
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,350
What a weird question.

513
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,300
Weren’t you the one who chose my flight?

514
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,550
And the one you sent to pick me up?

515
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,600
You really know me.

516
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:38,100
Or was it not you?

517
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,900
If I had to do everything myself,

518
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,210
what would I need an assistant for?

519
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,600
Ah, no wonder everything was
exactly how I like it.

520
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:52,500
Even the food on the plane
was all my favorites.

521
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,010
Let go of me. I’m going to take a bath.

522
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,950
Kian!

523
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,990
Come have some fruit first.

524
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,710
I peeled it myself.

525
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:01,550
Pretty please.

526
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:14,050
(Auntie Oon, I made the flower garland
tighter than usual today,)

527
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:15,600
(so you won’t scold me.)

528
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,700
(Well done, Miss Kaew.)

529
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:20,020
(You’re amazing.)

530
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:23,160
This is the first and only drama
where I played the female lead.

531
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,350
(I learned from the best.)

532
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:29,400
I can’t believe you still ask them
to rerun this.

533
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:31,030
(So tight.)

534
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,100
This one is the closest to your real life.

535
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:44,600
When I watch it,
it feels like I’m close to you.

536
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,870
We’re together now.

537
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,650
Are you happy?

538
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:55,400
If you miss her, just fly to see her.

539
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,700
Hong Kong is only a short flight away.

540
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,140
You can bring your partner too.

541
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,890
You talk like
things have changed over there.

542
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,450
You haven’t been back for so long.

543
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,100
A lot has changed.

544
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:11,950
If things really had changed,

545
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:15,850
you wouldn’t have had to fly here
to celebrate your birthday in secret.

546
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,950
Don’t lie to yourself.

547
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,000
Nothing can change.

548
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:30,380
ARSENI’s enemies
will never cease to exist.

549
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,550
Please excuse me, Mom.

550
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:53,840
Why were you and Dad able to get married,

551
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:56,600
but Kian and I

552
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:00,000
are forbidden to love?

553
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:13,800
Don’t you think that’s unfair to us?

554
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:22,400
It’s a rule that you both must accept.

555
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:33,850
You have no idea how much Kian and I
have always tried to break this rule.

556
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:37,200
You cheeky thing!

557
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,700
Time to sleep and stop
letting your mind wander.

558
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,730
Sweet dreams, son.

559
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:44,550
Yeah.

560
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:46,900
Good night.

561
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:47,650
Good night, Mom.

562
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:56,000
Take care of him, Mok.

563
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:58,270
I will.

564
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:07,450
Let me turn off the light for you.

565
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:09,800
No need.

566
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:13,700
Will you stay here until I fall asleep?

567
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:42,450
(You haven’t replied to my messages.)

568
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:43,670
Sorry.

569
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:46,600
I’m on vacation, so I turned
my notifications off.

570
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:48,700
(Alright. When will you come back?)

571
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,060
(It’s been three days already.)

572
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:50,930
Are you crazy?

573
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:52,150
What do you mean, three days?

574
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:55,400
Not even three hours have passed.

575
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,290
LET’S EXCHANGE SELFIES.
I WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE NOW.

576
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:21,550
Sorry. I couldn’t stop him in time.

577
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,300
I saw that.

578
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:24,500
You were smiling just now.

579
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:27,850
What’s your business?

580
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,780
Tomorrow, Mom’s not free anymore.

581
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:31,900
The plan is off.

582
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:35,050
What? Your birthday dinner is off?

583
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,900
But she’s the host.

584
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,980
Why are you so slow with things like this?

585
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,010
Why beat around the bush?

586
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:46,900
Just say what you want to say.

587
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,080
I want to spend time alone with him.

588
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,200
You’re free to go wherever you want, Kian.

589
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:56,100
Dinner tomorrow is canceled.

590
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:56,850
What did you say?

591
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:57,600
You heard me.

592
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:04,420
Oh.

593
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:06,930
It’d be great

594
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,050
if you could give me your secretary
as my birthday present.

595
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,100
In your dreams.

596
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:15,650
So mean.

597
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:17,800
Both the boss

598
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:19,980
and the employee.

599
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:35,370
Hang in there, Mok.

600
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:37,600
Yes, Boss.

601
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:42,110
Mok.

602
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:45,030
I need your help with something.

603
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:53,800
Here’s some coconut water.

604
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:14,540
Damn.

605
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:17,200
Hurry!

606
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,270
Hurry, guys!

607
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:19,200
Get into position.

608
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,700
HOPE YOU ENJOY THIS PEACEFUL REST.

609
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:52,530
(Hope you enjoy this peaceful rest.)

610
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:56,600
(Hope you enjoy this peaceful rest.)

611
00:47:57,870 --> 00:48:00,500
(Hope you enjoy this peaceful rest.)

612
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:04,600
It’s not so peaceful anymore
because of you.

613
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:08,050
(Hope you enjoy this peaceful rest.)

614
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:11,420
(Hope you enjoy this peaceful rest.)

615
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:27,900
Panachakorn from
the Art department, right?

616
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:29,700
Yes.

617
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:32,300
Why has the work gotten so bad?

618
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:39,460
Well, this is just the first draft.

619
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:44,700
We included the references we found,
so it might be a bit rough.

620
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:47,250
We apologize, President.

621
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:48,980
We’ll fix it right away.

622
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:50,020
Fix the whole thing.

623
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:54,100
I don’t like anything about this work.

624
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:58,420
Not even the model’s strand of hair.

625
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,800
If this had been done by your brother,

626
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:06,100
it would've gotten approved more easily.

627
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,150
You mean Peach?

628
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:15,200
Our photographer is still very new.

629
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,790
The team is still adjusting, President.

630
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:22,780
I didn’t realize ARSENI was
a training school.

631
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,800
I’ll improve myself right away.

632
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:29,000
I’ll also learn more about the job
and ask for Peach’s advice.

633
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:31,800
You know each other?

634
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:34,100
When did you become close?

635
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:37,700
Everyone in my field of work
knows who Peach is.

636
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:39,870
He’s one of the top photographers
in the country.

637
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,800
I think this is a great opportunity
for me to get to know him.

638
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:46,140
I’m excited just thinking about it.

639
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:47,900
You must be so excited, huh?

640
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:52,130
If you don’t have
anything better to present,

641
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:54,630
don’t show your face to me again.

642
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:15,500
Yes?

643
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,100
Mr. Peachayarat.

644
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,050
Please call me Peach.

645
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:22,110
Alright, what would you like
for dinner, Mr. Peach?

646
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:29,900
That man didn’t already
prepare something for me?

647
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,650
I’ll have stir-fried beef
with basil, then.

648
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:38,860
Of course.

649
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,650
Stir-fried beef with basil and rice,
served with seven levels of fried eggs.

650
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:47,500
Okay.

651
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:56,350
(Save your smile for my eyes.)

652
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:59,100
(Don’t make me jealous of
this piece of paper.)

653
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:01,700
I’m not smiling.

654
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:17,900
(I hope you feel good
every ‘thee’ you think of me.)

655
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:33,340
Hmm?

656
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:35,570
OISHI GREEN THEE

657
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:36,600
Seriously?

658
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:51,460
(What? Just seeing my name
makes you smile that much?)

659
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,200
Is he crazy?

660
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:58,600
(You sound so cheerful.)

661
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:02,100
(I bet you’re fully rested, unlike me,
who just got scolded by the boss.)

662
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,000
Really? Which boss?

663
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,900
Why are your bosses so strict?

664
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,500
(Mr. Theerakit, of course.)

665
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:11,650
Huh?

666
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:15,600
I thought you said if you’re not
senior management,

667
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:16,700
you don’t get to see him.

668
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:19,100
Why did he suddenly
look at your work himself?

669
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:24,300
(I don’t know. Since Wiwid disappeared,
he's been overseeing the work himself.)

670
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:28,100
(Note, Nuch, and I
are still jumping out of our skin.)

671
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:31,100
There, there. Let me handle it.

672
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:33,000
(How are you going to handle it?)

673
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:36,900
Oh.

674
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,700
I’m going to curse him.

675
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,200
What else can I do?

676
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:43,600
That’s the only thing I can do.

677
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:47,600
I don’t dare do anything
to Mr. Theerakit Kian Lee.

678
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:54,500
(Anyway, Mr. Thee said in the meeting
that he liked your work.)

679
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:00,700
(Oh, Trend, the new photographer
wants your contact.)

680
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:03,400
(I think he wants to ask you about work.
Can I give it to him?)

681
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:04,500
Sure.

682
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:06,500
(Enjoy your vacation.)

683
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:08,100
(I need to get back to work.)

684
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:09,090
Okay.

685
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,650
Take care of yourself, Plub.

686
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:13,200
(You’re the one who should
take care of yourself, Peach.)

687
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,290
HI, PEACH.
I’M TREND. :)

688
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:21,740
Hey.

689
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:22,930
Shit.

690
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,300
Shit!

691
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:29,400
Mr. Thee!

692
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,670
What are you doing here?

693
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,400
And why did you swim from the shore?

694
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,600
My plan today got canceled,

695
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:47,550
so I flew to see you.

696
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:49,150
In your private jet?

697
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:51,070
No.

698
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,350
I researched carefully and learned that

699
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:56,900
a private jet creates 10 times
more pollution than a regular plane.

700
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:00,500
Now I understand why you don’t like it.

701
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:04,800
Very good.

702
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:07,100
Sit back and relax.

703
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,900
Let me take you on a tour.

704
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,720
It’s pretty nice being
in the middle of the sea.

705
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,220
It’s humbling.

706
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:39,850
You like the sea?

707
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:43,530
Actually, I like anywhere that’s peaceful.

708
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:44,890
Including the sea.

709
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:52,400
In that case, you can come here anytime.

710
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,500
Bring your sister or anyone you want.

711
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,000
This place is yours.

712
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,760
You’re unbelievable.

713
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:04,700
Stop randomly giving people things.

714
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,200
If you were my son,
I’d smack some sense into you.

715
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:11,400
I don’t want to be your son.

716
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,420
The sea here is really beautiful, though.

717
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:26,900
Wherever I look, it stretches
as far as the eye can see.

718
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:31,500
No wonder people call the ocean mighty.

719
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:35,900
It’s really beautiful.

720
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:37,650
Hmm?

721
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,750
Especially the ocean
reflected in your eyes.

722
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:46,530
It’s so beautiful,
I really can’t look away.

723
00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:55,940
Is this too close?

724
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,970
Besides the words “Thank you” and “Sorry”,
do you remember what else

725
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,200
you’ve taught me, Peachayarat?

726
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,200
When have I taught you anything?

727
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,000
If I kissed you right now,

728
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:20,600
would that be taking liberties with you?

729
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:25,450
People don’t just grab someone’s hand
and do that without their consent.

730
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,700
But you’re Peach, not just anyone.

731
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:31,300
But even people who know each other
wouldn’t do that. It’s weird!

732
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:34,600
Some would even think
you’re taking liberties with them.

733
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,850
If you get consent from the person,

734
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:42,650
then it’s not taking liberties.

735
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:45,050
In that case,

736
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:54,100
may I take liberties with you?

737
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:48,600
How could you let him go out there alone?

738
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:49,800
Where’s the boat? Is it ready yet?

739
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:51,660
It’s coming, Boss.

740
00:58:57,980 --> 00:58:58,900
I can’t wait any longer.

741
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:05,600
The boat is here, Boss!

742
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:06,540
Boss!

743
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:13,870
Boss!

744
00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:16,420
Boss!

745
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:17,130
Boss!

746
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,630
Boss!

747
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:24,310
Shit!

748
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:27,250
Mr. Thee!

749
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,220
I’m Rome.

750
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:31,560
Kian’s younger brother.

751
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:32,750
Is it Mr. Rome’s birthday today?

752
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:33,300
Yes.

753
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,620
Then we must find a cake.

754
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:37,400
Mr. Thee and Mr. Krit
are not allowed to celebrate.

755
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:38,200
It’s a rule.

756
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,500
Get ready.

757
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:42,770
Starting tomorrow,
I’m going full force in chasing you.

758
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:44,020
It really suits you.

759
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:46,860
I thought you were taking a break
from matters of the heart.

760
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:50,200
What would you say if I told you…

761
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:52,090
I’ve accidentally caught feelings
for someone?
