and events in this series are fictional

Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,440
I can actually recommend
some other good photographers.

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,450
No way, Peach.

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,810
I only want you, Mr. Peach.

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,660
Tatsuya is not an ordinary man
like you think he is.

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,020
I’ve had people keep an eye
on you for now.

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,650
So this is the real life
I have to face, huh?

11
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,580
Something big happened.

12
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,840
Tawan got into a fight
with Peach at the studio.

13
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:31,800
Peach!

14
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:33,700
So…you two…

15
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,000
are already boyfriends?

16
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,450
I want you to call my name.

17
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,380
Kian.

18
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:39,800
P’Kian.

19
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,920
Mr. Thee, there’s something urgent
I need to inform you about.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,700
I’m in trouble.

21
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:01,800
You’re already aware?

22
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,600
Look at all this breakfast.

23
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,940
If Peach sees this,
I’m definitely in trouble.

24
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:07,460
Huh?

25
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,830
Did someone just call my name?

26
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,140
It’s stuffy in here.

27
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,700
Huh?

28
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,300
Let’s eat at the glasshouse.

29
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,500
708, prepare two sets of
American breakfast for me.

30
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,100
Small sets.

31
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,000
Tell the team to replace the breakfast.

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,950
Keep in mind that it should be small sets.

33
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,680
He doesn’t like it big.

34
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,650
Did you sleep well last night?

35
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,400
Yeah, I did.

36
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,200
Can I have your house key?

37
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,020
Why do you want it?

38
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,800
I’ll have people move your things,

39
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,930
so you can move in with me, Lookpeach.

40
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:08,900
Are you crazy?

41
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:09,820
Why not?

42
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,150
You said yourself that you slept well.

43
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,870
That means you like it here.

44
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,580
Why not move in?

45
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,660
You’re being sneaky.

46
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,470
We’re just boyfriends.

47
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,900
No, we only just became boyfriends.

48
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,100
Hey.

49
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,270
Don’t.

50
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,540
I know what you’re thinking.

51
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,050
If you get down on one knee right now,
I’ll definitely stab you.

52
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:02,980
Keep eating.

53
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,600
(Tawan’s family is in trouble.)

54
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,270
(I think it’s serious this time.)

55
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,550
(I heard the whole family fled abroad.)

56
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,810
BANKRUPTCY CASE FILED AGAINST
“WEERA-ARPAKORN” FAMILY,
EXPOSING TENS-OF-BILLIONS FRAUD
THAT SHAKES THE COUNTRY

57
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,470
Is something wrong?

58
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,870
Pick up, Tawan.

59
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,070
Notice of Property Seizure.

60
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,200
You don’t have work today, right?

61
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,700
Let me drop you off at home

62
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,270
before I go to the office.

63
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,000
Hey.

64
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,070
What happened to Tawan
was your doing, wasn’t it?

65
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,300
Yes.

66
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,900
Didn’t you go too far?

67
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,150
I just reported the truth to the police.

68
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,050
Everything is going through
the proper process.

69
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,250
Isn’t it for the best to rid the country
of corrupt politicians?

70
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,550
You didn’t frame them, did you?

71
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,370
Everything happened
because of their own actions.

72
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,050
I swear.

73
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,760
I didn’t do anything
you wouldn't like, Lookpeach.

74
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,100
I wonder how Aran feels right now.

75
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,510
Hello, Mother.

76
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,380
Huh?

77
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,730
Sure, I’ll be there as soon as I can.

78
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:17,930
What’s going on?

79
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,130
Mother called me.

80
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,680
The family that adopted Marn hurt her.

81
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,570
She’s in the hospital.

82
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,260
I’m coming with you.

83
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,500
The car is ready.

84
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,940
I’m not going to the office anymore.

85
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,580
But you have a meeting this morning
about the new Spring Collection schedule.

86
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,900
But I’m going with Peach.

87
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,980
Please just have a driver drop me off.

88
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,020
You should go to work with Mr. Mok.

89
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,500
Don’t worry.

90
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,570
If there’s anything, I promise...

91
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,200
you’ll be the first person I call, P’Kian.

92
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,750
Please.

93
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,350
Alright. I’ll meet you
as soon as I’m done with the meeting.

94
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,450
Peach!

95
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,450
I feel so bad for her.

96
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,050
It’s okay.

97
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,010
She’s safe now.

98
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,150
The doctor said it’s nothing serious,

99
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,100
so she’s allowed to rest at home.

100
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:54,800
Those people have been prosecuted.

101
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:56,900
Please pursue the case
to the fullest extent.

102
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,130
We shouldn’t let people like that
be in society.

103
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,500
By the way,

104
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,800
how did you find out she was hurt?

105
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,000
Their neighbor heard the noise
and saw what happened by chance,

106
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,700
so they called the police.

107
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,550
Have you talked to her at all?

108
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,500
What did Marn say?

109
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,800
Luckily, Marn has a strong heart.

110
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:32,500
But I’ll ask a psychologist to take care
of both Marn and Mork’s mental health.

111
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,950
If there’s anything I can help with,
please let me know.

112
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,050
Can I talk to you?

113
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,750
State your business.

114
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,380
If this is about you tearing up
your brand ambassador contract,

115
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,570
I won’t take action against you.

116
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,530
You can leave.

117
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,570
This isn’t about that.

118
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:44,600
Tawan’s family was sued into bankruptcy.

119
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,450
It was your doing, wasn’t it?

120
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,000
That’s the result of his own actions.

121
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,800
I just sped up his karma.

122
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:01,060
Did you expect me to give appreciation
flowers to a horrible guy like him?

123
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,950
But if he hadn’t gotten
in trouble with you,

124
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,020
none of this would have happened.

125
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,750
Those bad things
were hidden under the rug.

126
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,300
Even if I hadn’t exposed them,

127
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,200
someone else would have noticed them
sooner or later.

128
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,150
You can leave.

129
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:16,730
I’m going to work.

130
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,100
I have an offer.

131
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,150
About Tawan,

132
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:32,500
I know someone at your level
can help him no matter what.

133
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,600
Whatever you want from me, just take it.

134
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,250
What are you doing?

135
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:51,770
I’ll do anything.

136
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:52,900
Don’t do this.

137
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,800
Get up.

138
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,270
Aran!

139
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,530
Get up first.

140
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,250
Let’s talk outside.

141
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,400
Peach.

142
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,000
Let’s talk later.

143
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,630
(Stop playing around and
come back to your duties already.)

144
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,860
My duties?

145
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:31,300
You mean being your
favorite son’s punching bag, Father?

146
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,700
(Trying to dethrone ARSENI is basically
signing your own death warrant.)

147
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,350
Did you really have to
threaten me like that?

148
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,900
Are you afraid that if I succeed,

149
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:46,200
it’ll humiliate the next leader of Shohei?

150
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,400
(There are so many ways
to prove yourself,)

151
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,100
(but not ARSENI.)

152
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,400
The more you say that,

153
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,200
the more curious I get.

154
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,500
If I managed to shoot Theerakit just once,

155
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:03,860
would I be worthy enough for you
to dare reveal that I’m your other son?

156
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,200
Touch, you jerk!

157
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,400
Is this what you meant
when you said you’d help me?

158
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,570
I wasted so much time on your stupid plan.

159
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,000
Everything fell apart because of you.

160
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:19,500
The fact that I’m even helping your family
is already mercy.

161
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,700
Fleeing the country?

162
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,740
That’s your idea of helping me?

163
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,000
If it weren’t for me,

164
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,930
your parents would’ve been arrested
the moment they stepped into the airport.

165
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,600
A cornered dog like you

166
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,300
has no right to negotiate with me.

167
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,100
Tell me honestly.

168
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,570
Have you even seen me as a friend?

169
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,130
I don’t have time for this nonsense.

170
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,530
Just hurry.

171
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,600
I’ll have someone prepare
a new flight ticket for you.

172
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,400
You’ve changed a lot.

173
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,800
The feelings of someone
who’s never been accepted…

174
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,900
No matter how well I do,
it’s never enough.

175
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:01,000
How could someone who’s had it easy
like you possibly understand?

176
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,830
Why do you want acceptance
from someone who never accepted you?

177
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,250
If your father wanted to acknowledge you,

178
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,150
he would’ve done it a long time ago.

179
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,950
He wouldn’t have let you
get away with this idiotic nonsense.

180
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,500
Tell me honestly.

181
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,800
Is what you’re doing right now
really what you want,

182
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,650
or do you just want to win?

183
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,700
Just go.

184
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:38,000
Once you’re free from your father’s game,

185
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,100
we can be friends again.

186
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,930
I don’t know how to help Tawan.

187
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,600
I really don’t know, Peach.

188
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,150
Is it my fault that Tawan’s family
is going through all of this?

189
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,830
What were you trying to do earlier?

190
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,800
Mr. Thee has everything.

191
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,300
He has both money and power,

192
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,750
but I have nothing to negotiate with him.

193
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:28,900
I only remember...

194
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,100
what he wanted from me when we first met.

195
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,350
You know how dangerous this would’ve been
if this weren’t Mr. Thee, right?

196
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,300
I just want to help Tawan.

197
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:58,350
If you want to help him because you feel
guilty and think you caused all of this,

198
00:14:58,990 --> 00:14:59,900
stop thinking like that.

199
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,390
It’s not your fault at all.

200
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,900
But if you want to help
because you still care about Tawan,

201
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,530
just tell me.

202
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,550
Even though I don’t really like him,

203
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,050
I’ll try talking to Mr. Thee for you.

204
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:26,850
But will Mr. Thee listen to you?

205
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,700
Well… he will, to some extent.

206
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,800
We’re dating.

207
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:37,800
What?

208
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,900
I’m sorry, Peach.

209
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,970
I’m really sorry. I didn’t know.

210
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,750
If I’d known you and Mr. Thee were dating,

211
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,820
I’d never have done something like that.

212
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,570
I swear nothing happened
at the stairs earlier.

213
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,700
I’m really sorry.

214
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,900
I’m sorry.

215
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,170
It’s okay.

216
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,000
I know.

217
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,430
And I trust both you and Mr. Thee.

218
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,600
Don’t worry.

219
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,400
Don’t overthink it.

220
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,700
Right now,

221
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,700
someone else is probably overthinking
way more than you.

222
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,850
I’m sorry.

223
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,270
I’m really sorry, Mr. Thee.

224
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,800
If you made Peach angry with me,

225
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,170
you’re dead!

226
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,240
Hey.

227
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:39,660
That’s enough.

228
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,800
He’s already scared.

229
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,050
I’ve prepared the CCTV footage
from the corner of the stairs.

230
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:49,230
Every angle and every moment,
with clear video and audio.

231
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,060
And I’ve already had Mok prepare the file.

232
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,460
I said it’s fine.

233
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,420
He did it because he didn’t know.

234
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,070
Do you know now?

235
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,250
I already have the owner of my heart.

236
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,060
Not even you.

237
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,300
Even if a lemur walked past,
I wouldn’t even glance at it.

238
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,060
Why are you laughing?

239
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:10,500
I’m sorry.

240
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,099
But I’m glad you’re not mad at me,
Lookpeach.

241
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,099
I was shaken to my core.

242
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,790
I was looking up thousands of ways
to make up with you on my phone.

243
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:23,099
Let’s forget about that.

244
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:30,700
But we both have something to ask of you.

245
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,700
P’Kian, can you please help Tawan?

246
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,600
You’re always worrying about other people.

247
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,140
Why don’t you worry about yourself
for a change?

248
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,400
You’re the same.

249
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,400
You’re always worrying about me.

250
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,970
Why don’t you worry about yourself
for a change?

251
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:17,750
Here.

252
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,450
So, have you figured out...

253
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,100
how to help Tawan?

254
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,500
Mr. Tawan’s family fled to Japan.

255
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,420
They got help from the Shohei family.

256
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,100
But according to
the country’s entry and exit records,

257
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,830
Mr. Tawan is still in Thailand.

258
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,700
So, will he face any charges?

259
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,450
Mr. Tawan has no involvement
in any of the charges.

260
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,540
They might have planned well,

261
00:18:53,820 --> 00:19:00,940
or maybe Mr. Tawan stayed out of politics,
so there’s nothing they could pin on him.

262
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,150
Then I guess we don’t have to do anything.

263
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:08,050
But all the family assets
obtained through fraud will be seized,

264
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,500
including his house.

265
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:15,950
He might not face any charges,
but it’ll still be quite tough for him.

266
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:17,970
What now?

267
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,350
Shall we throw him some money
to help him get back on his feet?

268
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,500
Let’s just help him
only as much as necessary.

269
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:33,020
This could be a big lesson
for Tawan to grow up.

270
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,900
Call me when you get home.

271
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,100
I want to sleep over here.

272
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,100
Hey.

273
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,100
How would you even sleep over?

274
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,800
You don’t have any pajamas here.

275
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,100
But you let me stay over last time.

276
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,600
How about this?

277
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:08,700
You can next time.

278
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,970
I give you permission to move
some of your necessary stuff here.

279
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,400
Now that you said that,

280
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:21,340
please get ready to put your things
in boxes and have your house renovated.

281
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,900
Just personal items
and no more than 5 outfits.

282
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,820
I repeat, only necessary items.

283
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,300
Whatever your heart desires.

284
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,350
Good night.

285
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:20,350
Hello?

286
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,290
(Mr. Mok, Mr. Thee forgot his phone.)

287
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,050
Mr. Mok?

288
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,100
What’s that sound?

289
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:28,600
Mr. Mok?

290
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,300
(It’s not possible to reach the number
you’ve dialed at this moment.)

291
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,250
Hey.

292
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:10,870
Let go!

293
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,400
If it’s that easy,

294
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,820
ARSENI would’ve been done for

295
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,290
even before you opened your eyes
to this world.

296
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,670
You win. Just shoot me!

297
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,500
Even if you killed me or my father,

298
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:31,610
a son who’s not blood like you
would never get to be the leader.

299
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,400
Shut up!

300
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,300
You’re lucky you were born
without the burden of your family,

301
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,570
but why do you still want to
run around in this game,

302
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,700
when you’re not even a part of it?

303
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,500
The winner is not the one
with the most power.

304
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:05,850
The winner is the one who doesn’t
have to be in this game at all.

305
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,830
Another thing you’re lucky to have

306
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,030
is your friend.

307
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,700
If Mr. Tawan hadn’t tipped us off,

308
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,200
we probably wouldn’t have been able to
switch the cars in time.

309
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,810
It would’ve been more exhausting.

310
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,200
You knew beforehand,
but didn’t call for backup.

311
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,690
You think you were so cool
handling it all by yourself, huh?

312
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:02,800
Pretty much.

313
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,200
Oh, I almost forgot.

314
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,170
Before that happened, Mr. Peach called me.

315
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,340
He said you forgot your phone
at his house.

316
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,900
He’s probably asleep already.

317
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,700
Let’s get it back tomorrow.

318
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:27,700
Yes, sir.

319
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,170
EVICTION NOTICE

320
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:05,800
Ran.

321
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,500
I thought I wouldn’t see you.

322
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:11,650
What brings you here?

323
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,860
Do you need any help?

324
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,600
Where are you going?

325
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:21,800
I don’t know yet.

326
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,850
I’ll probably have to find
somewhere to stay,

327
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,730
then figure out what to do next.

328
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,100
Is there anything I can help with?

329
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,850
-You’ve helped me so much already.
-Get in the car.

330
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:36,900
I’ll give you a ride.

331
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,220
Then, can you drop me off
at a condo nearby?

332
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,100
They might have rooms for rent.

333
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,750
Actually,

334
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,300
as far as I remember,

335
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:02,330
my condo is spacious, if you don’t mind.

336
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:10,800
Thank you so much.

337
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:14,950
Thank you for what?

338
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,900
Rent, water, electricity,
everything’s split half and half.

339
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,500
If you give me a chance,

340
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:26,540
I promise I won’t disappoint you.

341
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,050
You’re not even cute.

342
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,200
Why can’t I stop liking you?

343
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,950
Welcome.

344
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:51,350
Where’s Kian?

345
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,300
He’ll join the breakfast table
within half an hour.

346
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:57,490
Mr. Mok.

347
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,200
Is that Kian’s phone?

348
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:15,100
Yes.

349
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,330
P’...

350
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:22,000
Mr. Thee forgot it,

351
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,700
so I came to return it.

352
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,050
How did you get here?

353
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:35,950
Did anyone hurt you?

354
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,800
Didn’t you tell your friend?

355
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,900
This is not a place
to walk in and out at will.

356
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,500
If Mok had stopped our men any later,

357
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,900
he’d have been dead.

358
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:54,820
Dad.

359
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:59,400
He must be a close friend of yours,
since you brought him home.

360
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:03,650
Won’t you introduce him
to your Mom and Dad?

361
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:10,830
Hmm?

362
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,450
He’s not a friend, Mom.

363
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:17,900
Oops.

364
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:19,200
Oh.

365
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:25,210
Is this the surprise about you
that Rome mentioned to me?

366
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,370
We met sooner than I thought.

367
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:39,930
Hey.

368
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,660
Mom.

369
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,780
Alright,

370
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:58,700
I’ll have someone bring coffee
to your dad’s office.

371
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,200
You should hurry and meet him there.

372
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,370
Dad probably has something
to talk to you about.

373
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,200
To be honest,

374
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,730
I don’t like eating alone at all.
It’s so lonely.

375
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,410
Please stay and eat with me.

376
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:52,450
Thank you, Ms. Nat.

377
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,200
Oh, dear!

378
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,000
You know who I am?

379
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:01,100
Oh, I’ve seen you in soap operas.

380
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,000
I didn’t think anyone
would still remember me.

381
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,010
Did you watch me when you were a kid,

382
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,420
or did you watch the soap operas
Kian had rerun?

383
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,500
P’Kian has them rerun?

384
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:21,450
I get so shy whenever I see my old
soap operas being rerun to this day.

385
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:29,200
But you’re making my soap operas
finally come to an end, you know?

386
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,300
Me?

387
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,870
I don’t understand.

388
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:46,850
Ever since Kian was sent
to Thailand alone,

389
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:55,500
the mom who raised him
has been the woman on screen.

390
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:03,700
But now, my soap operas
are finally coming to an end,

391
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,300
along with Kian’s loneliness.

392
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:14,700
The one who’s ending them is you.

393
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,650
You know that, right?

394
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:27,900
Dad, may I have this space for myself?

395
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,300
Let me love,

396
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,000
be happy with the one I love,

397
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,300
and live my own life.

398
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,980
So you’ve finally come
asking for my permission.

399
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:46,550
And if I say no,

400
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,380
will you break up with him?

401
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,300
No, I won’t.

402
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,900
Does that kid know who we are?

403
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,350
Did he fall in love with
the perfume company owner,

404
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,200
or the heir to the Lee family?

405
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,170
Peach loves me for who I am.

406
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,630
He knows everything.

407
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,670
He knows how my life is.

408
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:19,900
He’s afraid of guns.

409
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,700
Do you have to carry that everywhere?

410
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,050
(He’s afraid of the sound of guns.)

411
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,090
Hey. Don’t.

412
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,900
He’s afraid of everything about me,

413
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,950
but he chose to stay by my side.

414
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,380
And now, I’m the one
who’s afraid of losing him.

415
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,250
Finally, you’ve found it.

416
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:52,900
Sorry?

417
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,600
I once told you that from where we stand,

418
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:04,370
there are two things that are valuable
and hardest to find.

419
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:09,500
True friends and true love.

420
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,000
You have Mok as your true friend

421
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,700
who’s been by your side
since you were kids.

422
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,700
The other half is true love.

423
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:29,850
You’re sure

424
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,500
you’ve really found it, right?

425
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,450
Peach is that person.

426
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,230
He’s the one.

427
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,870
We’ve been talking for a while,
but you haven’t introduced yourself to us.

428
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:10,170
I’m Peach.

429
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,199
Peachayarat Jane-kit.

430
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,900
I’m P’Kian’s boyfriend.

431
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:24,400
So…

432
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:28,510
So what do you do for work?

433
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:30,600
Tell me about it.

434
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,600
I’m a freelance photographer.

435
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,900
I’m currently working for ARSENI.

436
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,060
Oh.

437
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:41,540
So that means All Season’s One Word
is your work, right?

438
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,300
That’s right, Ms. Nat.

439
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:44,739
No.

440
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:47,800
“That’s right, Mom.”

441
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,699
Say that again.

442
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,580
That’s right, Mom.

443
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:57,730
Very good.

444
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:03,600
When you get a chance,
bring your family to meet Mom and Dad.

445
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:07,100
So we can have a meal
and get to know each other.

446
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:14,100
I’ll also ask your family
for your hand properly.

447
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,400
If you only have a younger sister.
We can just meet her.

448
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,820
I’m an orphan, so I only have my sister.

449
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:31,650
Oh.

450
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,500
Now we know who’s the sneakiest.

451
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:42,700
You secretly looked into his background
and didn’t tell me?

452
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,300
I don’t think that’s important.

453
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:47,140
Of course, it is.

454
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,620
Who am I supposed to ask
for Peach’s hand, then?

455
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:52,300
Huh?

456
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:54,750
Oh.

457
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:56,560
Right.

458
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,350
Just so we’re clear,
everything has to be done by the book.

459
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:08,540
And… don’t rush into
intimacy before marriage, kids.

460
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,770
Or did you already do that?

461
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,900
Alright, Peach.

462
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,950
Next time, bring your sister to meet me.

463
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:31,150
I’ve dreamed of having a cute daughter
to dress up and do hair with,

464
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:37,370
but I ended up with
a big giant and a little giant.

465
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,380
What did you talk to Dad about?

466
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,020
Why does everything seem so easy?

467
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,000
Nothing has been hard from the beginning.

468
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,500
What do you mean?

469
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,700
Dad has always known about us.

470
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,100
If he thought our relationship
was impossible,

471
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,800
he wouldn’t have
let us continue until now.

472
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,400
I see.

473
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:31,690
How are you, Lookpeach?

474
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:41,250
Don’t you feel bad knowing your background
was investigated and you were followed?

475
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:44,650
I’m dating Theerakit Kian Lee.

476
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,500
I guess I’ll have to get used to it.

477
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,700
I understand your dad, though.

478
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,220
He did that out of worry.

479
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,600
It’s only the first day you’ve met him.

480
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,500
Don’t be so sure yet.

481
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:06,050
Every family is raised differently.

482
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,220
You might have been pressured
a bit too much by your dad,

483
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,820
or whatever it is.

484
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,350
But trust me,

485
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:20,400
having a family that worries about you
is better than having no one.

486
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,610
Don’t say that.

487
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:25,010
You have me now, Lookpeach.

488
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,850
You turned out this well

489
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,810
partly thanks to the people
who raised you.

490
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,500
Rome is in trouble.

491
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:42,620
He’s probably going to lose his spot
as the number one favorite child today.

492
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,500
I’m telling the truth,
not stealing anyone’s spot.

493
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:52,900
What about you and Mom?

494
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,500
When you were alone together,

495
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,000
what did you talk about?

496
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:07,820
(My soap operas are ending,
along with Kian’s loneliness.)

497
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:14,100
The one who’s ending them is you.

498
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,150
You know that, right?

499
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,050
No.

500
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,020
I think we complete each other.

501
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:28,300
Actually, my life before meeting P’Kian
wasn’t that great.

502
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,900
Many people might say I changed his life.

503
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:37,640
But in reality, he changed
many things in mine too.

504
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,850
Thank you.

505
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,650
Thank you for loving Kian...

506
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:49,350
for who he is.

507
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,600
Thank you so much, too,

508
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,300
for giving me a chance to love him.

509
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,500
That’s so cute.

510
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:14,870
One more thing,

511
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,500
Mom also said

512
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,970
you didn’t watch her soap operas
just because you liked them,

513
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:27,730
but because that’s the only way
you could feel close to her?

514
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:30,500
That’s true.

515
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,900
Back then, I had to live here alone.

516
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:38,050
I was scared that if I called her,
I’d seem weak.

517
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,200
With Mom’s soap operas,

518
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:45,950
it felt like there was someone
waiting for me at home.

519
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,700
Even though it was only on screen,

520
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,700
it was more than enough at the time.

521
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,750
What about now?

522
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:06,500
I let them come to an end
the day I asked you to date me.

523
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,100
Since that day,

524
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,400
I feel like I have a home to go back to,

525
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:18,530
someone who waits for me,

526
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,090
and someone I love.

527
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,250
Can I kiss you?

528
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:31,830
P’Kian.

00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:57,680
♪ I will always love you
for all that you are ♪

535
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:01,200
♪ Every part of you
belongs to my whole heart ♪

536
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:02,800
Don’t look at me like that.

537
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,000
Go to bed. It’s late.

538
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,700
♪ Let me tend to your heart ♪

539
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:17,540
Don’t give me that look. Off you go.

540
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:18,410
Go take a bath now.

541
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:56,100
You know it’s not easy, right?

542
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:02,140
No matter how much Kian tries,

543
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:08,300
he can’t escape being part of
the Lee family.

544
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:10,850
I know that.

545
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,650
Do you think you’re up for it?

546
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,850
I should be the one asking you that.

547
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:21,550
After having people follow us all this time,

548
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:27,700
do you think I’m qualified enough
to be here?

549
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:31,950
You really are the same.

550
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:36,300
You only asked
after you’ve made your decision.

551
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,950
If I said no,

552
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,250
would you break up with Kian?

553
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,000
I’d ask what I’m lacking,

554
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:55,850
so I can improve on those things
until I’m ready to stand next to P’Kian.

555
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,850
You’re exactly like Natlada.

556
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,000
Sorry?

557
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,300
Mom was a fighter like you.

558
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:11,100
She was seized, kidnapped,

559
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:15,400
and faced danger countless times,

560
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:18,700
but when she came home,

561
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,250
she could still smile.

562
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:27,900
She’s so strong that I didn’t know
if anyone else could be as strong as her,

563
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,550
until I saw the look in your eyes today.

564
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:37,500
P’Kian is like you too.

565
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:41,200
No matter how many times he’s in danger,

566
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,900
he always keeps the people he loves safe.

567
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:53,600
Did you come to see me about something?

568
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,950
I want to thank you.

569
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,500
Thank you for giving me a chance.

570
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:05,020
I promise I won’t damage
your family’s reputation.

571
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:09,400
What did Kian say to scare you?

572
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,850
How could the Lee family’s reputation...

573
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,600
be more important
than the family’s happiness?

574
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,200
Just live your life normally

575
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,800
like Kian has always dreamed of.

576
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:37,350
Please take care of
the pretend mafia like Kian for me.

577
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,100
Why did you let me cuddle you
so easily tonight?

578
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,500
I’m tired today.

579
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:22,700
If I make you tired,
you’ll let me cuddle you?

580
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:23,800
Hey.

581
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,250
There’s something I want to ask of you.

582
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,670
I can give you everything, even my life.

583
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:49,900
I want to learn how to shoot and fight.

584
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:54,900
Why?

585
00:46:57,090 --> 00:47:00,500
I know you’re trying to make
this place safe,

586
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,900
but I don’t want you to be
the only one putting in the effort.

587
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:07,000
You’re not afraid anymore?

588
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:08,900
I am,

589
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:13,000
but let me try.

590
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:24,200
You don’t have to do this much for me.

591
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:27,450
This is not even half of
what you do for me, P’Kian.

592
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:33,500
You golden retriever.

593
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:37,340
That brown ball of fur?

594
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:39,900
I’m a lot more handsome than he is.

595
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:45,460
And he’s a lot cuter than you.

596
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,800
He might be cuter,

597
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:52,380
but you can’t love him more than me.

598
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:05,700
Can I kiss you again, Lookpeach?

599
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,500
You know you don’t have to ask
every time you want to kiss me, right?

600
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:15,700
No.

601
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:19,950
I don’t want you to do it
against your will.

602
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,150
Not saying anything
means you’re still okay with it.

603
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,140
That’s still okay, right?

604
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:10,530
If I do more than that,

605
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:13,800
it’ll still be okay, right?

606
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:38,100
You’re too cute, Lookpeach.

607
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,400
Are you going to kill me?

608
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,030
Please watch your step.

609
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:49,670
I just want to be sure.

610
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,800
You love me more than
this brown ball of fur, right?

611
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,630
I just want you to confirm who’s cuter.

612
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:00,660
If I say it, it’s going to hurt you.

613
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:02,400
Lookpeach!

614
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:04,800
Just kidding.

615
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:07,420
You’re even jealous of a dog?

616
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:10,000
I don’t know.

617
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:12,000
Just tell me

618
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:13,650
who’s cuter.

619
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,010
The dog.

620
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:21,500
The dog wins for being cute,

621
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,780
but you win for being loved by me.

622
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:34,500
You spend too much time
with me, Lookpeach.

623
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:37,700
Is that right?

624
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:39,000
Is that right?

625
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:40,230
Yes.

626
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:49,190
What?

627
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:50,010
Don’t worry.

628
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,700
Everything in this house
will stay the same.

629
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,000
You’re moving my house?

630
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,410
Plub! Boss wants to see you urgently.

631
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,200
I need more team members for this project.

632
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:00,000
Huh?

633
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,690
You swear this is a house?

634
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:02,650
There you are.

635
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:04,630
My beautiful daughter!

636
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:06,100
I don’t just want to take care of you.

637
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:08,300
I want to take care of
everything in your life.

638
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,900
I want you to be the luckiest person
in the world.
