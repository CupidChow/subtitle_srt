You’re mine.

No one has the right to mess
with the one I call mine.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,900
I just realized how good
being taken care of by someone feels.

8
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,600
Your sister asked if you had a partner.

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,770
Is it true that you don’t have anyone?

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,180
Where would I find the time
to catch feelings for anyone?

11
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,260
I’m only spending time with you
these days.

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,590
Kian!

13
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,930
If you miss her, just fly to see her.

14
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,300
Hong Kong is only a short flight away.

15
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:35,330
Mok.

16
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,550
I need your help with something.

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,650
HOPE YOU ENJOY THIS PEACEFUL REST.

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:39,840
Shit!

19
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,420
Mr. Thee!

20
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,540
May I take liberties with you?

21
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,900
(You have my body.)

22
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,920
(But you’ll never have my heart.)

23
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,500
No, no, no, no, no.

24
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,200
We’re not there yet.

25
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,070
(You took advantage of me!)

26
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,900
(You wanted me so desperately,
didn’t you?)

27
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,020
(I just indulged you, that’s all.)

28
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:28,900
(I hate you!)

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,970
I didn’t take advantage of him.

30
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,640
In that case,

31
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,670
may I take liberties with you?

32
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,100

00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,800
SOS, Lookplub.

39
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,770
(This is the only thing)

40
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,800
(that might help me forget
your terrible actions, even just a little.)

41
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,100
What is it?

42
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,500
Take this.

43
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,100
You might want to splash it on my face.

44
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,740
This soap opera is nothing like
you’ve seen before.

45
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,800
What do you mean?

46
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,820
Wanna take a walk along the beach?

47
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,950
Can we go anywhere but that place, please?

48
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,000
Don’t you always spoil me?

49
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,100
I just want to celebrate my birthday
at the beach.

50
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,700
You’ve taken me there in past years.

51
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,100
Why is it a problem this year?

52
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,900
Could you not be demanding, please?

53
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,670
You know I don’t like that word.

54
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,200
Why do you still say it?

55
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,600
It’s just for today.

56
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:24,900
Can’t I have that?

57
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:32,610
Okay.

58
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,770
Take me wherever you want.

59
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:41,400
I never get to choose anything
in my life anyway.

60
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,300
I’ll take it from here.

61
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,690
LEE 99, BANGKOK

62
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,290
Please get in.

63
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,770
I’m sorry, Mr. Thee.

64
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,210
Aren’t you afraid
your clothes will get dirty?

65
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,370
I can just wash them, right?

66
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,570
Come on.

67
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,700
Are you sure you don’t want to
splash water on my face?

68
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,430
What do you want to do, then?

69
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,800
Why would I want to do anything to you?

70
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,000
I rushed into intimacy too soon.

71
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,070
I couldn't control myself.

72
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,770
If I could turn back time,

73
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,260
I wouldn’t have done
something so thoughtless.

74
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,670
What you did…

75
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:49,600
No.

76
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,650
What we did…

77
00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:01,200
You think that was thoughtless?

78
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,070
I’m just afraid

79
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,400
I might’ve accidentally
hurt your feelings.

80
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,800
I’m not hurt.

81
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,300
I’m just surprised.

82
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,800
Surprised?

83
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,299
I should’ve pushed you away
when you moved your face close to mine,

84
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,799
instead of letting you kiss me.

85
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,500
Just being friends with you

86
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,320
already feels like something
out of my reach, but now we—

87
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,200
If anyone should feel like
this relationship is out of reach,

88
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,600
it should be me.

89
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,980
The Master wants to see you, sir.

90
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,950
You might want to fix your clothes first.

91
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:21,930
Not yet.

92
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,420
I’m breaking the rule

93
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,050
by letting my heart overrule my head.

94
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,050
I know this is not easy.

95
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,440
Our worlds…

96
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,230
They’re separate.

97
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,970
This is the end, isn’t it?

98
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,000
Well…

99
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,160
What would you say if I told you…

100
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,900
I’ve accidentally caught feelings
for someone?

101
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,700
(Who? What? Where? How?)

102
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,300
(Has someone been pursuing you?)

103
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,400
(So this trip is actually a date?)

104
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,200
(How naughty.)

105
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,700
You’re reading way too much into this.

106
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,300
Calm down, Lookplub.

107
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,600
I’m actually confused.

108
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,600
Really confused.

109
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,500
(Tell me the truth.)

110
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,100
(How far have you two gotten?)

111
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,600
Well…

112
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,870
We already kissed.

113
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,400
(How do you feel?)

114
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,700
(Do you want to kiss this person again?)

115
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,730
Plub!

116
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,200
What are you talking about?

117
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,750
(That’s a serious question.
I’m not teasing you.)

118
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,650
(I’m helping you figure it out.)

119
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,700
How?

120
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,900
(If it was just a kiss, then it’s goodbye.)

121
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:40,900
(But if it left you wanting more,
you can move forward.)

122
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,070
Well…

123
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,600
I don’t know.

124
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,300
But from what others told me,

125
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,970
this person seems like someone
I wouldn’t like at all.

126
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,730
We have nothing in common.

127
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,350
We’re different in almost everything.

128
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,650
(Learning from others’ work)

129
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,500
(can never be as good as seeing through
your own lens, Mr. Photographer.)

130
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,930
Don’t rush to the ending just yet.

131
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,100
I…

132
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,100
I want to keep watching a little longer.

133
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,070
I’m handing you the remote to turn it off,

134
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,100

Sorry for showing up so suddenly.

151
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,260
If the villa is not ready yet,
I can wait in the lobby.

152
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,320
The villa has been ready
since this morning.

153
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,450
We’ve been hosting—

154
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,100
Mr. Rome.

155
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,100
Oh, I’m sorry.

156
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,600
The wind was blowing, and I was afraid
sand might get in your eyes.

157
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:14,910
Uh…

158
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,600
If the villa is hosting another guest,

159
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,730
could you prepare a room
on the yacht instead?

160
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:24,600
The villa is hosting Mr. Theerakit.

161
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,650
Kian is here?

162
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:28,970
What’s he doing here?

163
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,470
Did he come alone?

164
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,640
Mr. Theerakit’s guest is staying
in the luxury sea view room.

165
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,650
Let me bring your luggage to your room.

166
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,150
Oh.

167
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,870
So this is why
you didn’t want to bring me here.

168
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,500
Please don’t tease Mr. Thee.

169
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,700
You know I’m not mean.

170
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:12,100
Ugh, I’m so tired.

171
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,600
I feel so much older.

172
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,650
Do you want to take a bath?

173
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,000
I’ve asked them to prepare
a big seafood meal for us.

174
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,100
What time is it now?

175
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,200
The sun is probably setting soon.

176
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,700
You want to watch the sunset?

177
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,600
I know a very beautiful spot.

178
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,660
Shall we go now?

179
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,970
Where is it?

180
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,460
The Grand Canyon in Arizona.

181
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,360
Or we could just go to
Mount Fuji in Japan,

182
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,840
but we probably wouldn’t make it
in time for sunset.

183
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,440
ARSENI has a hotel there,
in case you’re interested.

184
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,000
It’s not about the place.

185
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,470
It’s about who’s next to you.

186
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:13,800
You’re right.

187
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:21,700
The view beside me right now is more
beautiful than any sunset in the world.

188
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,170
It really is more beautiful.

189
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,750
What are you thinking?

190
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,000
I’m thinking…

191
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,700
I want to kiss you again.

192
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,370
But I want this to be a kiss
you’re willing to allow.

193
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,760
One you have no more doubts about.

194
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:40,530
Oh, shit!

195
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,660
I didn’t see anything.

196
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,050
Relax. I just thought the light
was pretty.

197
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,150
I swear.

198
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,850
I’m Rome.

199
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,700
Kian’s younger brother.

200
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,350
I’m Peach.

201
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,200
You’re…?

202
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,240
Well…

203
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:16,500
You getting this flustered is
a good answer.

204
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,100
I’m sorry for being a bit rude earlier.

205
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,030
I was just going to take photos
of the views,

206
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,800
but I ended up taking candids
of my brother.

207
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,300
I’ve deleted all of them, though.

208
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,900
Trust me.

209
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,410
By the way, I've already had them
move your stuff here, Peach.

210
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:42,700
I’m so glad we have so many people
for the party tonight.

211
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,400
Have you asked Peach if he can make it?

212
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:52,020
Oh, am I being rude again?

213
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:52,940
No!

214
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,350
It’s alright.

215
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,450
I don’t have plans this evening.

216
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,200
Okay.

217
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,440
Your room is in the back, Mr. Peach.

218
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,500
That room has the best views.

219
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:06,950
It’s yours, Peach.

220
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,900
Well…please excuse me.

221
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,500
Of course.

222
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,550
I’ll go help him.

223
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:30,600
No need!

224
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,600
You had one job,

225
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,700
but you still fell short.

226
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,000
What a mean boss.

227
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,900
If it were me, I’d quit.

228
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,700
I’m not quitting.

229
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,850
Since he’s protecting you so much,

230
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,700
you should ask him for a bonus instead.

231
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,700
Oh.

232
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,800
How stingy!

233
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:04,950
You don’t have to put up with
someone like him.

234
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,290
Come work with me instead.

235
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,610
I’ll triple your salary.

236
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:11,900
No, thank you.

237
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,400
Is my brother bothering you?

238
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,100
You came here to rest,

239
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,850
but things ended up getting chaotic.

240
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,050
It’s okay.

241
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,650
Your brother is adorable.

242
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,660
Are you complimenting another man
in front of me?

243
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,900
I mean, your brother is friendly.

244
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:54,700
What a relief.

245
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,170
My heart almost shattered.

246
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,850
Don’t be dramatic.

247
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,200
Enjoy your rest.

248
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,670
I’ll come get you when dinner’s ready.

249
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,460
No need.

250
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,100
After I take a shower, I’ll come down.

251
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:17,970
Cute.

252
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,200
Hurry up,

253
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,900
before I start missing you.

254
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,750
Did I make the right decision or not?

255
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,060
Why are you here?

256
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,450
You should be asking how I got here,

257
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:54,850
not why I’m here.

258
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,900
Your Thai is still as lousy as ever.

259
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:02,900
I’m asking the right question.

260
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,300
Why are you here?

261
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,500
Do you think you’re the only one
getting interrupted?

262
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,100
I always come here
to celebrate my birthday with Mok.

263
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,140
You’re the one interrupting me.

264
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,200
I don’t want Mom and Dad
to know about this.

265
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,270
Sure.

266
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,300
We’re a team, bro.

267
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,300
This is his birthday gift.

268
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,670
I’m sorry, Mr. Mok. What did you say?

269
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,400
A normal life without bodyguards.

270
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,550
No escort vehicles.

271
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,800
It’s the birthday gift
Mr. Krit wants the most.

272
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,630
Mr. Krit?

273
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:04,700
It’s Mr. Rome.

274
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,380
Is it Mr. Rome’s birthday today?

275
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,000
Yes.

276
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,270
Oh, then we must find a cake.

277
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,500
Has anyone prepared it yet?

278
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:19,380
If not, could we trouble the staff
to prepare one for him?

279
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:25,450
Mr. Thee and Mr. Krit
are not allowed to celebrate.

280
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,800
It’s a rule.

281
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:33,190
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

282
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:38,220
♪ Happy birthday, happy birthday ♪

283
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:40,910
Mr. Thee!

284
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:48,300
Since that incident, the Lee family
has never held any parties again.

285
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,470
Master said that when we gather,

286
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,700
we become a fixed target for our enemies.

287
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,900
Mr. Thee was sent to Bangkok

288
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:05,800
partly because Master wanted
to diversify the risk.

289
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,250
If one day, something were to happen
in Hong Kong,

290
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:12,850
ARSENI wouldn’t fall,

291
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,600
because Mr. Thee is here.

292
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,500
Why does Mr. Rome get to live
with his family in Hong Kong?

293
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,020
No.

294
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,700
Mr. Krit is just waiting for his time.

295
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,100
Once he’s ready, he has to move far away.

296
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:39,800
Maybe to the other side of the world.

297
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,200
Maybe even further than here.

298
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,270
Their lives

299
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,900
aren’t as glamorous as
everyone thinks, are they?

300
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,130
Hey!

301
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,900
You two over there!

302
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,000
Seafood is almost done.

303
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,890
This is what you called “cooked”?

304
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:24,150
Please have a seat, you two.

305
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,060
And you said, “Trust me.”

306
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,660
Let’s redo the whole thing.

307
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:39,170
Yes.

308
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,370
Let’s start over.

309
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,770
We could’ve had the kitchen handle it.

310
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,510
All this trouble,
just to have it your way.

311
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,200
Come on! It’s my special day.

312
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,100
Did you forget?

313
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,190
I just wanted to have fun.

314
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,500
Let’s eat while it’s hot.

315
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:38,450
Oh.

316
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,200
I forgot.

317
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,180
I saw you left this at home.

318
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,570
If Dad hears about this,
you’ll be in trouble.

319
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,160
Peach.

320
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,740
Peach.

321
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:08,870
Peach.

322
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:10,700
Peach.

323
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,610
Peach.

324
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,300
Someone just called you.

325
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,400
Oh.

326
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,500
I’ll be right back.

327
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,600
Lock up the house properly tonight.

328
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,200
Don’t forget to lock the windows too.

329
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,500
I’ll be back tomorrow.

330
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,700
Hmm?

331
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,250
Ka.

332
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,900
Good night na ka.

333
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,000
Is everything alright, Mr. Rome?

334
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,300
They say a man who says “ka” is romantic.

335
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,400
Are you romantic, Peach?

336
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,170
I only use it with my sister.

337
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,100
You’re warmhearted, you know?

338
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,750
Happy birthday, Mr. Rome.

339
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,000
I wish you lots of happiness this year.

340
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:42,570
Also, I know it’s hard,

341
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,600
but I hope you get to live
the life you want.

342
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,700
Did Mok tell you my story?

343
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,250
He’s so good at talking to everyone,

344
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,300
except me.

345
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,400
You only get one day a year

346
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,000
to do whatever you want.

347
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,800
Why did you choose to come here?

348
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:23,010
I guess because this is
where I can live my most normal life.

349
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,270
Normal?

350
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:33,400
I really can’t imagine
what real life is like for you two.

351
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,000
Can I ask you another question?

352
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,970
You said the other thing
Mr. Thee can’t buy is love?

353
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:51,900
We’re all forbidden to love.

354
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:01,000
So he’s not only standing in the way of
his own happiness, but someone else’s too.

355
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,570
Don’t listen to him too much.

356
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,330
But what Mr. Mok said is true, isn’t it?

357
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:17,500
Yes.

358
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,600
It’s true.

359
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:26,000
But Kian has always been
trying to change those rules.

360
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,650
Can you be there to encourage him?

361
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,350
Me?

362
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,650
Can you stay to guide him and
give him the confidence

363
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:54,670
that he’s doing the right thing?

364
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,050
Peach hasn’t finished his call?

365
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,230
He has, but he wanted to take a walk.

366
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,060
What did you talk to Peach about?

367
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,670
Everything about you.

368
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,500
Everything?

369
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,900
This one is good.

370
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,650
You chose well.

371
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:49,370
Are you already boyfriends?

372
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:52,900
Not yet.

373
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,100
Not yet?

374
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,200
I haven’t officially asked him.

375
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,600
I haven’t ordered a ring, either,

376
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:06,800
or prepared dowry, engagement gold,
or a marital home.

377
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,900
Everything takes time.

378
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:15,700
I’m not spontaneous or demanding
like you always are.

379
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,300
You’re asking him to be your boyfriend,
not to marry you.

Please get in the photo.

You’re breaking the rule, Mr. Peach.

394
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:14,670
But I saw you smiling with them.

395
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:20,400
I want a team, if you’re interested.

396
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:28,739
Why are you stealing mine?

397
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,659
Take that one.

398
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:30,670
Just take that one, Kian!

399
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:32,219
I want to eat chocolate!

400
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,409
Peach gave that to me!

401
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,590
That one is more beautiful!

00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:39,429

Thank you for the birthday party

Yes?

416

I’ll leave this with you.

417
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,370
Only use it when necessary.

418
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:45,600
Yes.

419
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:53,500
Actually, if it’s necessary,
you can carry it.

420
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,250
I’ll get used to it.

421
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,750
I’m just the owner of a perfume company,

422
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:02,970
not a police officer.

423
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:08,600
I don’t need to carry that thing
all the time, do I?

424
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,350
Is that really all you are?

425
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,170
I’m not carrying a gun right now.

426
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,500
If something happens to me,

427
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,500
you have to protect me.

428
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,700
Your muscles are as big as my head,

429
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,500
and you want me to protect you?

THEE 9, BANGKOK

431
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:56,300
So how’s that for refusing to fly back?

432
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,550
Can’t say I didn’t warn you.

433
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,700
Well, Rome suggested I do this.

434
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,100
He said it’d buy me more time
with the person next to me.

435
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:05,200
Who would’ve known

436
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,340
you’d sleep the whole way here?

437
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,570
Take a warm bath when you get home,
so you don’t get back pain.

438
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,830
Do you have a tub at home?

439
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,800
No.

440
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:20,000
Then I’ll have one installed right now.

441
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,130
Stop.

442
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,000
Plub is home today.

443
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,900
I can’t let you in the house.

444
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,300
You’re dating Theerakit Kian Lee.

445
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:32,100
Isn’t that something to show off
to the whole town?

446
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,270
We’re not boyfriends yet.

447
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,700
Don’t be presumptuous
or try anything sneaky.

448
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:42,840
You’re so mean.

449
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,200
Your words hurt my feelings
time and again.

450
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,470
You should go.

451
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,060
See you at ARSENI tomorrow.

452
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,500
You’re going to the office tomorrow?

453
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,800
I’ll come pick you up.

454
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:00,530
No.

455
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,800
Don’t send people to pick me up.

456
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,050
Don’t prepare breakfast.

457
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,000
I’ll just see you at the office.

458
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:21,600
I completely forgot.

459
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,270
Now that I know
I’ll see you at the office tomorrow,

460
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,500
I want to go to bed already.

461
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,600
Good night in advance.

462
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,100
If you say so. Good night.

463
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:37,670
Oh.

464
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:38,900
One more thing.

465
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,400
Get ready.

466
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:45,500
Starting tomorrow,
I’m going full force in chasing you.

467
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,900
How’s it going, Mr. Lovestruck?

468
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,800
Who’s that?

469
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,500
Tell your sister.

470
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,400
Please.

471
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,620
Tell me.

472
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,730
I promise I won’t tease you.

473
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,050
And I won’t tell anyone either.

474
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:28,000
When I’m ready,
you’ll be the first to know.

475
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:36,690
Well, I thought you said you were
taking a break from matters of the heart.

476
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:41,600
Who’s the girl who snapped you out
of your hibernation?

477
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,250
Tell me.

478
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,500
Please.

479
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:02,900
Well…

480
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,390
It’s not a girl.

481
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:28,800
Are you into men?

482
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,700
Since when? I had no idea.

483
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:54,700
Actually, this is the first man
I’ve ever had feelings for.

484
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:00,830
Are you mad at me?

485
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,400
I’m sorry.

486
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:23,200
Why would I be mad at you?

487
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,610
I’m just a little surprised.

488
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:42,500
That person must be amazing

489
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,500
and take really good care of you,
right, Lookpeach?

490
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,700
Why do you think that?

491
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,500
Because when you talk about him,

492
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:00,980
you turn into this tiny thing.

493
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,800
Are you okay with who I am?

494
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,550
Of course.

495
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,020
I don’t have any problem with it at all.

496
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,750
As long as he’s a good guy

497
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,200
who can take care of you.

498
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:53,900
Thank you.

499
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:05,400
I hope this love brings you
nothing but happiness.

500
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:13,850
And I hope that person
takes care of you properly.

501
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,270
Just half of what I can do is enough.

502
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,100
Who takes care of whom these days?

503
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:26,000
I take care of you, of course.

504
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,310
Let’s go.

505
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,330
If we don’t hurry,
you’ll miss your flight.

506
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:47,200
I won’t let you see me off.

507
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,450
Go back inside the house.

508
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,380
But Mr. Thee told me to—

509
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,300
This is my order.

510
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:03,250
Once I’m allowed to love,

511
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,130
I’ll hurry back to love you.

512
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,000
Safe travels.

513
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,250
Once I’m allowed to love,

514
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:56,900
I’ll hurry back to love you.

515
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:12,600
When will you finally admit how you feel?

516
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,510
They said Mr. Kritdanai
has arrived home safely.

517
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,420
Do you want to take a few more days off?

518
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:45,650
It’s alright.

519
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:47,570
This is more than enough for me.

520
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:54,730
If there’s nothing else, please excuse me.

521
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:03,230
Oh, before you go,
turn off the lights for me.

522
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:04,970
I’m going to sleep now.

523
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:14,380
But it’s only…

524
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,250
(Good night.)

525
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,810
(I hope we meet again in our dreams.)

526
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,200
(But if another man shows up
in your slumber,)

527
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:54,300
(wake up immediately. I’m possessive.)

528
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:23,200
Peach, I need to scan my fingers now,
or I’ll be late.

529
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,150
I have to go.

530
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,010
Do your best at work.

531
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,160
Hey.

532
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:49,980
Here’s a bouquet of flowers from
every continent where plants can grow.

533
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,090
It really suits you.

534
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:53,400
My whole world.

535
00:47:57,050 --> 00:47:57,800
Thank you.

536
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:04,100
Do you like it?

537
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:10,100
Yes.

538
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:15,500
I mean the person in front of you.

539
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:16,800
Do you like him?

540
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:31,010
Mr. Mork, good to see you.

541
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:34,550
I didn’t know you’d be at the beach too.

542
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:35,900
I already got you some souvenirs.

543
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:38,100
Thank you.

544
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:40,350
Here you go.

545
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,540
You can snack on it while working.

546
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:48,430
I’m going in.

547
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:50,400
Do your best at work.

548
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:00,730
Boss.

549
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,060
I thought you didn’t like
anything spicy or squid.

550
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,240
No bonus for you this year.

551
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:11,600
Is there even any left to take away?

552
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,000
If there’s none left,
I’ll dock your salary.

553
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:22,100
Hey, Nuch.

554
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:23,800
Hi.

555
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:27,130
Oh, there you are!

556
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,000
My extraordinary photographer.

557
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,400
I’ve missed you so much.

558
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:31,660
I got you some souvenirs.

559
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:32,200
Oh!

560
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:33,700
Hey, everyone.

561
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,220
There are mild ones and extra spicy ones.

562
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,000
Pick whichever you like.

563
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:45,300
ARSENI without you is like
an elephant without a trunk, Peach.

564
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:46,700
Can I have two?

565
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:47,420
Oh?

566
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:50,900
I’m good now.

567
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:53,550
I’m just here to help with your work.

568
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:54,700
I’m not getting paid.

569
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:56,650
Don’t get rid of anyone.

570
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:58,800
Oh, you’re too kind.

571
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:00,900
You’re so kind.

572
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:04,900
Hi, Peach.

573
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:06,400
I’m Trend.

574
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:32,800
Would you like to eat something else?

575
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:34,800
I’ll ask the maid to replace it.

576
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,600
Get me the three-flavored dried squid.

577
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:40,620
But you don’t eat—

578
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:41,900
It’s my business whether I eat it or not!

579
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,070
I want it.

580
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:46,250
You should tell Mr. Peach directly

581
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:49,600
that you’re mad
about not getting a souvenir.

582
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:53,430
I can’t be unreasonable or silly.

583
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,850
What if Peach gets annoyed with me?

584
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:58,200
You’re good at everything,

585
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:00,200
except love.

586
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:10,180
Are you caring about someone else’s
feelings more than your own?

587
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,800
You’re lucky I’m not ordering you to slap
your mouth as many times as your age!

588
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,700
Don’t ever let me hear you call Peach
“someone else” again.

589
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:21,950
I’m sorry.

590
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:24,700
He’s not someone else.

591
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,100
He’s a special someone.

592
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:36,800
You can leave.

593
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,200
I have to work hard
like Peach told me to.

594
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,530
Yes, sir.

595
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:02,500
The company got me a new camera.

596
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,600
Wow, this is a good one.

597
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,110
No matter how good it is,
I still take bad photos.

598
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,100
I’m slowing everyone down.

599
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:25,970
I know the whole story now.

600
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,010
I’m sorry for being the reason
you got removed from the project.

601
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:32,800
It’s alright.

602
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:34,300
You don’t need to apologize.

603
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,780
It’s Wiwid’s fault.

604
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:41,500
He just saw you as a pawn.

605
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:42,670
Don’t think too much about it.

606
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,780
I was so scared of you at first,

607
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,850
but Plub said you’re kind.

608
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:57,400
I didn’t think
you’d be this kind and cute.

609
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:06,850
You can talk to me about anything…

610
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:08,620
work-related.

611
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,930
TWISTKO

612
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:23,500
Peach!

613
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:27,180
-Oh!
-Hey!

614
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:30,600
Your outfit’s all crinkled now!

615
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:32,100
I’ve missed you so much!

616
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,210
Yeah, get down first.

617
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:33,770
Mind my back.

618
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:34,880
Okay.

619
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:38,220
Are you the photographer today?

620
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:40,220
No, I’m just helping out.

621
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:43,100
Oh.

622
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:48,600
How many hours of OT
should we expect today?

623
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,340
Don’t tease him.

624
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:52,380
Give him a chance.

625
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,200
I’m here to help.

626
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,570
I’m just kidding.

627
00:53:56,890 --> 00:53:57,600
That looks good.

628
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,730
No, you have to hold
the product, don’t you?

629
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:03,600
You can’t get your hands messy.

630
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:05,680
Here.

631
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:10,800
Mmm.

632
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:12,430
It’s so good.

633
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:14,330
Can I have more?

634
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:14,910
Here.

635
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:21,020
Mr. Peach would be so happy

636
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,000
if he knew you were
working this hard, Boss.

637
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,370
Shameless!

638
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:27,970
How dare they do that
with the lights and cameras around?

639
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:35,600
(I’m going to get coffee.)

640
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:36,800
(Do you want anything?)

641
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,100
Get me any coffee,

642
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:54,380
but if they have you in a cup on the menu,
buy out their whole stock.

643
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:07,300
Let’s hurry.

644
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:12,500
I have to be a good boy
and wait for my coffee in my room.

645
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:26,130
Puppy love when you’re old is kinda scary.

646
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:29,400
Here’s your order.

647
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:39,650
Hello.

648
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:41,100
(Peach.)

649
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:44,210
(What’s with the cold greeting?)

650
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:48,500
Well, I didn’t expect you to call me.

651
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,550
If I told you I missed you,
would you believe me?

652
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:57,400
When the sun rises in the west,
I’ll think about it.

653
00:55:57,870 --> 00:56:01,100
I have a favor to ask.

654
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:06,200
My boss really loves your work
and wants to collaborate with you.

655
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,500
But he hasn’t been able to reach you.

656
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,400
So I…

657
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:15,300
So you’re using your connection
as my ex to get me hired.

658
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,050
Guilty as charged.

659
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:38,500
So sweet.

660
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:39,970
Huh?

661
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,700
But I ordered it unsweetened.

662
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,150
It’s probably because
you were carrying it.

663
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:47,100
Oh, get a grip.

664
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,770
Things are going well downstairs.

665
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:57,300
Trend is not bad. He’s just very new.

666
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:02,200
Do you want to go for dinner
and a movie tonight?

667
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:04,300
Why?

668
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,660
Isn’t that what people do
when they’re getting to know each other?

669
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:11,400
If you want to get to know me,
why not take it more seriously?

670
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:15,350
Sure.

671
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,550
I’ll learn with you.

672
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:27,500
I already have plans this evening.

673
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,430
It’s another hobby I love.

674
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:30,300
I’m coming with you.

675
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:33,570
It’s pretty quiet and boring, though.

676
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:39,950
Just breathing and doing nothing with you

677
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:42,900
is interesting enough.

678
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:47,500
Excuse me.

679
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:51,940
You have an urgent meeting
with the Hong Kong team.

680
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:53,480
But I’m leaving with Peach.

681
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,340
I’ll go ahead.

682
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:57,770
You can stay, finish your work,
and catch up with me later.

683
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:01,800
I’ll send you the location.

684
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:07,200
See you later.

685
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,800
(Learning from others’ work)

686
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:54,050
(can never be as good as seeing through
your own lens, Mr. Photographer.)

687
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:05,130
Hey! How old are you?

688
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:11,640
Bottoms up! Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

689
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:16,700
One, two, three.

690
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,670
I get it now, Lookplub.

691
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,200
Are you done with work?

692
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:46,980
You took so many photos of me in secret.

693
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,600
You’re just…

694
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,060
so madly in love.

695
00:59:54,450 --> 00:59:55,000
No.

696
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:58,000
It’s my mission to figure out the answer.

697
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:01,300
Am I your answer?

698
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:10,500
The answer is your smile.

699
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:16,070
Because it made me realize

700
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:17,900
the wolf here

701
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,200
is fake.

702
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,100
You’re actually just
a goofy golden retriever.

703
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:35,600
Dogs of that breed
really love their owners.

704
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:48,100
When did you take that?

705
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:28,700
When the puppy knew for sure

706
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:34,100
who his owner was.

707
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:43,370
Can I pick up where we left off?

708
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,500
A kiss you’d be willing to allow.

709
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,300
No one’s going to interrupt us
this time, right?

710
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:08,690
No one can come in anymore.

711
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:38,610
THE DARKROOM PURCHASE CONTRACT
HAS BEEN FINALIZED, MR. THEE.

712
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,220
If it’s too much,
please don’t force yourself.

713
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:09,500
You’re only going to suffer.

714
01:03:09,570 --> 01:03:10,100
No!

715
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:12,250
It’s Peach’s favorite.

716
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:14,000
I’ll learn to eat it!

717
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:31,560
You’re the only one who shows up
at my house this early in the morning.

718
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:32,400
I’m the only one?

719
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:33,690
Peach!

720
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:34,590
Hey! Plub is here!

721
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:35,300
Lie down!

722
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:37,300
Here’s a souvenir for you.

723
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:40,770
This shows that, to Peach,
I’m not just anyone.

724
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:43,100
I don’t think I can make it
to dinner with you anymore.
