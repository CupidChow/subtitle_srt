Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,680
(Any activity that I can do on my own—)

6
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,080
(I believe it’s what God created for me.)

7
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,160
(And even if He didn’t,
I could still handle it myself.)

8
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,960
(I became a photographer)

9
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,840
(because I thought I wouldn’t
have to talk to too many people,)

10
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,800
(and I’d get to see people
from different perspectives every day.)

11
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Have you decided?

12
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,400
Do you have anything cheaper than this?

13
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,840
Do you want a film camera?
That’s only 300 baht.

14
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,880
A disposable one.

15
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,079
What kind of photography do you like?

16
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,120
Here.

17
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,520
You can borrow mine.

18
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,640
If we run into each other at a studio
someday, just give it back then.

19
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,240
(But I guess I was wrong,)

20
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,600
(because when people call you
one of the top in the country,)

21
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,480
(this job is never peaceful again.)

22
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,960
Please put the perfumes away, and separate
the color-graded from the ungraded ones.

23
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,760
Peach!

24
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,000
(She’s probably the only chaos I allow
and love having in my life.)

25
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,000
(My sister, Plub.)

26
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,040
Without Plub’s connection,

27
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,040
I couldn’t have booked a top photographer
in the country for this project.

28
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,480
I’m not that good, Nuch.

29
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,000
You’re that good.

30
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,600
I emailed and called, but couldn’t
get in touch with you, Mr. Peach.

31
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,360
Meanwhile, Plub kept her lips sealed
and wouldn’t tell me she’s your sister.

32
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,120
You just don’t have what it takes.

33
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,440
Couldn’t help you there.

34
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,520
No need to call me Mr.,

35
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,520
and you probably reached out
during my break.

36
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,920
I’m sorry.

37
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,040
No worries.

38
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,800
My brother is a free-spirited freelancer.

39
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,080
He only takes jobs when he feels like it.

40
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,880
Thank you so much for feeling like
taking this one, Peach.

41
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,680
Without you, I’d be in trouble.

42
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,000
Mr. Aran specifically requested to work
with a photographer he’s close to.

43
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,279
That’s you, Peach.

44
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,800
Great. That’s great.

45
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,480
That’s great too.

46
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,560
Awesome, Ran. Can you change the pose?

47
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,440
Give me a side glance.

48
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,760
One. Two.

49
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,200
Three. Four.

50
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,600
Okay, Ran.

51
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,000
This time, I want you
to spray the perfume.

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,840
Portray the scent.

53
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,080
Follow the timing.

54
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,880
One. Two. Three.

55
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,640
Okay.

56
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,080
Alright, three shots.

57
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,320
Okay.

58
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,640
This set should be good to go.

59
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,200
Can we switch the reflector
for the softbox?

60
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,320
Thank you.

61
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,280
I think all of these look good.

62
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,000
-Is it okay?
-Yes.

63
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,040
How’s it going?

64
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,880
Do I look handsome today?

65
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,000
Don’t you trust my skills?

66
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,680
Come see for yourself.

67
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,640
I know you can make me
look handsome no matter what.

68
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,440
I brought the shots for you to approve,
Mr. Top Model.

69
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,200
Great.

70
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,680
Aren’t you going to answer the phone?

71
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,040
I don’t want to talk to him.

72
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,480
I’m tired of the same old stuff.

73
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,280
If you don’t like Tawan,
why not just tell him?

74
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,400
This is wasting both of your time.

75
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,200
I don’t want to talk about this anymore.

76
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,840
Let’s change the topic.

77
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,680
Are you going to the wrap party tonight?

78
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,159
No, I’d rather stay home and sleep.

79
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,000
Come on.

80
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,280
You know I don’t like
these kinds of parties.

81
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,200
Besides, I’m just a freelancer.

82
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,640
I’m not close with anyone.

83
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,240
You’re close with me.

84
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,640
It’s different.
The wrap party is one thing.

85
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,200
But don’t you want to be there
for Arseni’s new ambassador launch?

86
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,840
Here, look.

87
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,120
The new brand ambassador is ready
to spark a next-level sensation.

88
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,480
Wow.

89
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,520
I’ll go change.

90
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,200
Okay.

91
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,240
Theerakit Kian Lee.

92
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,880
The most unforgivable thing is a mistake.

93
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,600
That’s the new perfume
from the Spring Collection.

94
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,440
The butler must have grabbed the one
the team prepared for you to try by mistake.

95
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,480
I’m sorry.

96
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,120
You can leave.

97
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,480
The Fall Collection party tonight
starts at 8.

98
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,280
According to the schedule,
you’ll have to give a speech.

99
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,560
You know I don’t do things like that, Mok.

100
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,240
Don’t pretend you don’t know
why I’m going to the party tonight,

101
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:10,200
even though it disgusts me
and drives me insane

102
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,840
to be around crowds
who are only after my power.

103
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,240
They said Mr. Aran
is already at the event.

104
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,840
Now that’s what I want to hear.

105
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,920
I’m going to the restroom.

106
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,680
Don’t sneak off.

107
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,200
Can I get another glass, Note?

108
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,840
You got it.

109
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,480
Watch him. Don’t let him leave.

110
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,000
Leave it to me.

111
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,080
Cool.

112
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,280
I’ll be right back.

113
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,400
Note.

114
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,680
Yes?

115
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,520
Where’s Plub?

116
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,240
Something came up at work,
so she couldn’t come.

117
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,440
Hey.

118
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,680
It’s okay.

119
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,800
I’ll take care of you tonight.

120
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,000
Come on. Cheers.

121
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,280
Have a little.

122
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,040
Awesome.

123
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,200
Beautiful.

124
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,640
Hey!

125
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,160
So what?

126
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,280
Peach!

127
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,640
Ran.

128
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,640
What are you doing there?

129
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,880
You’re always like this when you’re drunk.

130
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,680
Sorry about my brother.

131
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,840
He’s always like this when he’s drunk.

132
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,720
I’m sorry.

133
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,800
Please excuse us.

134
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,400
Shall I get him in the car?

135
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,520
No, I’m not in the mood anymore tonight.

136
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,360
But—

137
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,000
I’ll let him have his moment for now.

138
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,880
Don’t think you can get away from me,
my little lemur.

139
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
What just happened?

140
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,400
Tell me. What do those people want?

141
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,360
I don’t know.

142
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,080
They handed me a 10-million check
out of nowhere.

143
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,120
10 million?

144
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,160
My boss wants to sleep with you tonight.

145
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,880
Why the hell would you say that?

146
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,600
Where’s your boss?

147
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,480
Hey! You must watch too many soap operas

148
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,280
if you think you can throw your money
at everyone like they’re nothing.

149
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,480
Is the money not enough?

150
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,280
Do you want a blank check

151
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,800
to fill in the amount later?

152
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,080
Hey!

153
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,200
What are you doing?

154
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,080
Hey!

155
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,600
So what?

156
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,640
Too bad I didn’t get to tell them off.
They pushed me down first.

157
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:18,920
Tell them off?

158
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,240
Ran!

159
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,960
Didn’t you see they had guns?

160
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,880
Yes.

161
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,680
But only when I was about
to punch their boss in the face.

162
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,800
It’s okay.

163
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,000
Hey!

164
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,480
Peach!

165
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,680
What are you doing, Tawan?

166
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,800
So you didn’t answer my calls
because you were with this photographer?

167
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,880
Are you okay, Peach?

168
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,600
I’m fine.

169
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,280
Peach saved me.

170
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,440
Saved you? I saw you were going to hug!

171
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,600
Have some sense, Tawan!

172
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,600
We’re not even anything yet.

173
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,160
If you’re just going to be hotheaded
and refuse to listen,

174
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,000
then leave!

175
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,000
But if you want to get a grip and talk,
go wait by the car.

176
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,480
Otherwise,...

177
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,920
we don’t have to see each other again.

178
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,360
Okay.

179
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,000
I’ll wait by the car.

180
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,080
I really apologize on Tawan’s behalf,

181
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,480
even though I’ve done it
countless times before.

182
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,680
I’m really sorry.

183
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,000
Ran, are you okay?

184
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,240
I don’t know.

185
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,680
But if there comes a day
when I’m not okay anymore,

186
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,160
you have to drink with me.

187
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,600
Of course.

188
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,440
I’m envious of Plub for having you
as an older brother.

189
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,040
You’re basically my little brother.

190
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,640
Is your hand okay?

191
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,160
It’s nothing.

192
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,640
Just go sort out your situation.

193
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,000
See you.

194
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,480
It’s bleeding?

195
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,840
You can’t open it with your hand
hurting like that.

196
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,440
Thank you.

197
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,800
That’s what happens when you
stick your nose where it doesn’t belong.

198
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,520
If it hurts, just cry.

199
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,000
Why are you pretending to be strong?

200
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,160
It doesn’t make me
want to admire you more.

201
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,240
Well, it doesn’t hurt.

202
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,480
Why would I cry?

203
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,960
What do you think you’re doing?

204
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,280
My breath will ease the pain
you’re going through.

205
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,280
He watches too many soap operas.

206
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,200
If I got bitten by a snake,
he’d probably try to suck the venom out.

207
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,520
I'm...

208
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,839
I’m sorry for stopping you
in the restroom,

209
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,400
but that’s my little brother,

210
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,760
and it’s clear he wasn’t willing.

211
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,599
Please let Ran go.

212
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:22,599
You should know that someone like me
always gets what I want.

213
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,680
Why are you laughing?

214
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,160
Nothing.

215
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,000
I was just shocked to hear you say that.

216
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,000
What do you mean?

217
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,560
I didn’t think anyone would
actually say that in real life.

218
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,400
It’s bossy and self-centered.

219
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,880
Are you scolding me?

220
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,640
Watch yourself.

221
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,800
I could totally crush you.

222
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,600
Did that model tell you

223
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,720
how much more money he wanted?

224
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,720
Hey, get a grip.

225
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,040
You can’t buy Aran with money.

226
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,600
You probably can’t imagine
how much money I have.

227
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,200
I’ll have you know, my money
can buy everything in this world.

228
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,240
Have we met somewhere?

229
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,800
Why do you look so familiar?

230
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,640
Please step back.

231
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,600
Your way of seducing is really bad.

232
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,440
Did you learn that from soap operas?

233
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,920
Theerakit Kian Lee.

234
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,040
You’re the owner of Arseni.

235
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,080
Now, do you want to call that model
to come running back to me?

236
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,640
Being the brand owner is all the more
reason you shouldn’t be doing this.

237
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,200
Aran is your brand ambassador.

238
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,480
You should show him some respect,
not act like this.

239
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,640
You’re lecturing me.

240
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,840
Well, I should go.

241
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,680
Since you’ve started, keep going.

242
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,440
Lecture me to your heart’s content.

243
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,600
I…um…

244
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,080
I’m already content.

245
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,000
Please excuse me.

246
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,280
Damn, what the hell?

247
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,480
Sucking snake venom out with your mouth
only happens in cheesy dramas.

248
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,200
Everything he says sounds weird.

249
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,600
Hey.

250
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,160
Oh, hey, Peach.

251
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,400
I thought Note said work came up.

252
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,960
Why are you home?

253
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,840
The promotion team was rushing
to get the materials,

254
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,200
so I had to choose the photos and
plan the graphics guidelines for them.

255
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,680
Are the photos okay? Any issues?

256
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,880
Not at all.

257
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,280
If I’d known the work was this neat,
I’d have gone to the party with you.

258
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,280
I barely had to do anything
for each photo.

259
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,720
Just adding some text,
and it’s good to go.

260
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,080
But I’ve been waiting for you

261
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,920
because something else came up.

262
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,640
What is it?

263
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,320
Please become Arseni’s
regular photographer, Peach.

264
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,000
Everyone loves your work.

265
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,760
They asked me to beg you.

266
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:16,880
Please.

267
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,200
Arseni?

268
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,040
Can you sit properly?

269
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,800
You’re an adult now.

270
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
Alright, Dad.
You’re an adult now.

271
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,120
Thank you.

272
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:50,840
Come on.

273
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:00,920
Hey.

274
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,000
Why did you mention my company earlier?

275
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,080
Are you interested in becoming
our regular photographer now?

276
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,280
Have you met the owner of your company?

277
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,680
The owner?

278
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,480
You mean Mr. Thee?

279
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,040
Whenever he comes,
he goes straight to the top floor.

280
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,080
He rarely visits other floors.

281
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,640
Unless you’re someone
high up on his floor,

282
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,600
you usually don’t get to see him.

283
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,480
Why do you ask?

284
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,280
Well, I met him at the party.

285
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,800
Did you two talk?

286
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,520
That’s for the best.

287
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,400
People say just being near him
sends shivers down their spine.

288
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,880
You’d better stay away from him.

289
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,920
Someone got told off and ran crying
from his room to HR.

290
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,520
She quit right away.

291
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,600
Is it that bad?

292
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,080
Yes.

293
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,000
Rumor has it that his perfume business
is just a front for money laundering.

294
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,400
Arseni’s real business is shady.

295
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,080
They have a network overseas.

296
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,680
I’m here as Arseni, not anyone’s son.

297
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,240
Not anyone’s proxy.

298
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,480
Then act like it.

299
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,000
Didn’t your father tell you?

300
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,480
I’m not here to buy your stupid perfumes.

301
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,680
And they also say that

302
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,040
some days, Mr. Thee’s sleeves
are stained with blood.

303
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,680
What?

304
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,000
(I’ll go.)

305
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,200
(Don't think you’ve won.)

306
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,240
(All this time,)

307
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,840
(it’s my fault for not seeing the truth.)

308
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,720
(What do you see now?)

309
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,240
-(Now, I only see you.)
-Now, I only see you.

310
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,920
You’re the one I’ll love

311
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,720
forever.

312
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,280
THE END

313
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,120
Yes, Boss?

314
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,200
Tell the station to keep rerunning
Shadow of Vengeful Love.

315
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,840
Keep it in the primetime slot.

316
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,720
Yes, Boss.

317
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,600
Is the other thing I asked for
taken care of?

318
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,040
This is his full background file.

319
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,680
What’s that?

320
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,240
Mr. Peachayarat’s profile.

321
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,720
I prepared it just in case.

322
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,200
But if you don’t—

323
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,200
Why is there so little information
about his family?

324
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,200
Mr. Peachayarat only has
one younger sister.

325
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,840
Her name is Panachakorn.

326
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,280
She’s a full-time employee on
Arseni’s graphics team.

327
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,680
Make a restaurant reservation for me.

328
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,000
Pick somewhere that will make
a good first impression on him.

329
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,480
But Mr. Aran is shooting all day today.

330
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,360
I’m afraid—

331
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,600
Did I accidentally say Aran’s name?

332
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,440
Please leave the parcel
in front of the house.

333
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,640
You’re in trouble, Peach.

334
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,680
I’ll just pretend to be asleep.

335
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,480
(They say anyone who offends Mr. Thee
either goes missing)

336
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,320
(or ends up getting killed.)

337
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:01,640
No.

338
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,320
No.

339
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,880
No! No!

340
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,360
No!

341
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,080
Hello.

342
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,640
How many minutes
do you need to get dressed?

343
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:13,880
Get dressed?

344
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,840
Mr. Thee wants to have lunch with you.

345
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,360
Huh?

346
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,800
I’m giving you 15 minutes.

347
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,240
Mr. Thee has already started the timer.

348
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,160
THEE 1, BANGKOK

349
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,080
Please get in the car.

350
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,640
Which one?

351
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,160
Hello.

352
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,240
Wait, is there still space
in the car behind?

353
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,400
I shouldn’t have asked.

354
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,720
Why are you so tense?

355
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,840
Where’s the audacity from last night?

356
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,200
I was probably a bit too drunk last night.

357
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,600
I’m sorry if I did anything bad.

358
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,880
I didn’t tell you off, did I?

359
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,120
What did I say that made you think that?

360
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,800
Why don’t you talk
like you did last night?

361
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,880
I’m speechless.

362
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,840
You’re scared of me?

363
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,400
A little.

364
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,480
Just a little?

365
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,240
A little more.

366
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,800
Not just a little.

367
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,200
Order as much as you want.

368
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,400
Pardon?

369
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,480
Boss said you can order anything
you’d like, Mr. Peachayarat.

370
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,920
Oh, I can eat anything.

371
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,440
Please order whatever you want.

372
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:46,800
But I want to know
why you brought me here today.

373
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,600
Huh?

374
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,880
Boss just sighed. He hasn’t said anything.

375
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:07,920
Please excuse me.

376
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,040
Please continue.

377
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,280
Your way of seducing
hasn’t improved at all, Peachayarat.

378
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,920
I moved this close to you because
I couldn’t hear you from far away.

379
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,800
Please stop thinking
I’m trying to lock you down.

380
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:38,800
That’s ridiculous.

381
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,880
Ran is your type. I’m nothing like him.

382
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,800
You’ll never fall for me.

383
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:51,360
If this is a challenge to earn pity,
you’d score at least 99 out of 100.

384
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,080
Why did you bring me here?

385
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,480
If you’re going to kill me, I beg you,

386
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,880
please don’t.

387
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,920
I have a younger sister to take care of.

388
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,280
Boss saw that you’re close with Mr. Aran,

389
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,000
so he wants more information.

390
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,480
That’s it?

391
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,600
I hope I’ll hear some good advice
from your smart mouth, Peach.

392
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,440
Let’s break up.

393
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,120
I understand.

394
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,120
Ever since I started dating you,
I’ve gotten so much better at being alone.

395
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,120
Let’s go our separate ways.

396
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,760
I see you as my best friend.

397
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,400
I just got broken up with

398
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,440
for being too boring.

399
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,440
I don’t think I’m the right person
to give you advice, Mr. Thee.

400
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,080
So you’re single now?

401
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,800
Aren’t you going to eat with us?

402
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,000
There’s plenty of food.

403
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,920
Mr. Thee, you’re serious about Ran, right?

404
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,679
What do you mean?

405
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,280
I’ll help if you’re serious about him,

406
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,840
I mean, if you want to date him.

407
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,840
But if you just want sex,

408
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,000
I have to be honest,
I’m not okay with that.

409
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,800
My brother is not that kind of person.

410
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,160
How do I make a move on him?

411
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,400
Maybe you could start with a gift.

412
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,800
How about a car?

413
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,680
Are you crazy?

414
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,520
The first thing you’d buy
to build a connection is a car?

415
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,120
He won’t like it, huh?

416
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,520
A diamond ring, then.

417
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,200
Come on.

418
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,640
Get a grip, Mr. Thee.
That’s too expensive.

419
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,720
How is a car expensive?

420
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,800
Just a small bouquet will do.

421
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,680
That can be an apology for yesterday, too.

422
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,720
A bouquet?

423
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,680
Small.

424
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,280
I repeat, small.

425
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,280
As encouragement for a workday morning.

426
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,360
I think that’ll be enough
to make Ran happy.

427
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,080
And you?

428
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,640
What would make you happy?

429
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:52,800
Me?

430
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Why are you asking about me?

431
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:04,840
Wait.

432
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,880
I took up your time today.

433
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,080
How much money do you want?

434
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,840
Would 10,000 be enough?

435
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,680
What?

436
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:13,920
Is that not enough?

437
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,000
Why are you giving me money?

438
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,840
You did well, and I’m satisfied.
It’s only right that I reward you.

439
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,080
You throw money around like this
all the time, huh?

440
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,120
You might not think my money
is a big deal,

441
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,320
but it solves everything.

442
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,800
If I didn’t know a bit about you,
I’d be really mad at what you just said.

443
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,200
Actually, I’m a bit mad.

444
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,640
Your words are confusing me again.

445
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,400
You talk like you’re throwing money at me.

446
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,360
What you said was really mean, you know?

447
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,200
How is repaying you for your kindness mean?

448
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,480
Treating me to a meal today
is more than enough.

449
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,000
I’m leaving.

450
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,040
I don’t let anyone walk away from me
when I’m not done talking.

451
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,000
Then just say what you have to say.

452
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,400
Does that little meal
really mean that much to you?

453
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,760
That little meal cost like 10,000.

454
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,280
I’d never spend that much
of my own money on it.

455
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,200
Yes, it’s really delicious and I’ve been
wanting to try this place for so long,

456
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:38,600
but it’s not worth you spending that much
just to get advice about Ran.

457
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,200
You’re the one losing out here,
and you still want to pay me?

458
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,640
What are you rambling about?

459
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,080
I don’t understand.

460
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,720
If you don’t know how to repay people when
they make you feel good or impress you,

461
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,400
just saying thank you is enough.

462
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,280
I’m heading out.

463
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,640
Thank you for today.

464
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:14,840
Thank…

465
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,280
Thank you.

466
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,360
You’re welcome.

467
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,920
(You’re welcome.)

468
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,360
(You’re welcome.)

469
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,520
(You’re welcome.)

470
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,320
Hey.

471
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,080
Hey.

472
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,440
Hey.

473
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,200
Mr. Thee!

474
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,280
Do we have any shoots
at the studio tomorrow?

475
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,240
Yes, we’re shooting a video ad.

476
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,160
A video ad?

477
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,800
Mr. Aran will model for us as usual,

478
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,080
and we got a skilled camera operator,
but it’s not Mr. Peachayarat.

479
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,640
Mmm.

480
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,560
But Mr. Peachayarat is coming in
to take behind-the-scenes photos as usual.

481
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,480
Next time, just say everything at once.

482
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,040
Why hold back?

483
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,440
I’m sorry.

484
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,080
Order a small bouquet for Aran.

485
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,640
What kind of flowers would you like?

486
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,400
Anything.

487
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,800
It’s up to you.

488
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,280
Got it.

489
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,320
Is that all, Boss?

490
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:51,920
Wait.

491
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,640
And you?

492
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:57,920
What would make you happy?

493
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,080
Why are you asking me?

494
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,760
I’m just asking for a reference.

495
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,840
I don’t think you can use me
as a reference for this.

496
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,560
Just answer me. Is that so hard?

497
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,320
Chocolate, I guess.

498
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,880
The more bitter, the better.

499
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,880
Order chocolate for Peach.

500
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,640
Yes, Boss.

501
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,400
Make sure it’s not sweet.

502
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,880
The more bitter, the better.

503
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:34,240
Get the most expensive brand
and prepare a card too.

504
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,920
What should I write?

505
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,400
I’ll write it myself.

506
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,480
I’ll write, “Take care of it.”

507
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,880
(If you come a little closer,)

508
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,120
(you'll hear my heart beating your name.)

509
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,120
What kind of heart beats a person’s name?

510
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:58,880
Right, Boss?

511
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,720
That’s his idea of a small bouquet?

512
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,640
Hey, Peach.

513
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,120
I didn’t know you were coming.

514
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,480
I came to get the behind-the-scenes
photos for the magazines.

515
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,800
You’re all set.

516
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,680
Thank you.

517
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,480
I just found out that the mafia boss is
Mr. Thee, who owns Arseni.

518
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,800
I almost punched my own boss.

519
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,480
What are you going to do
now that you know he’s your boss?

520
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,240
If he doesn’t interfere with my work,
I’m fine.

521
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,880
But if he tries to force me
to sleep with him to get work,

522
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,360
I’d rather quit.

523
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,200
I knew you’d think that way.

524
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,880
He sent you a bouquet, though.

525
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,520
Maybe it’s to apologize for that night.

526
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,640
I actually don’t hold it against him.

527
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,680
Rich kids are all spoiled.

528
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,800
I’ve met plenty of them.

529
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,440
Be right back. I’m going to the restroom.

530
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,040
Okay.

531
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,840
Hey, there you are.

532
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,800
There’s a delivery for you.

533
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,240
This?

534
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,640
Yes, this one.

535
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,800
Oh, okay.

536
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,440
Yeah.

537
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:36,920
Hmm?

538
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,680
“Take care of it.”

539
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,080
TAKE CARE OF IT. - THEE

540
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,000
Take care of what?

541
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,120
Who is this for?

542
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,600
It must be for Aran.

543
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,680
Chocolate?

544
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:56,960
Who bought this for me?

545
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,080
The one who sent you the bouquet.

546
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,320
Mr. Thee again?

547
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,120
Take it. I don’t want to eat it.

548
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,320
-It’ll make me fat.
-What?

549
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,600
Have some, Ran. He bought it for you.

550
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:08,920
I’ll take a bite, then.

551
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:16,000
Ugh, it’s so bitter.

552
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,840
Just how you like it.

553
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:18,880
Try it.

554
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,480
Alright.

555
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,080
It’s not bitter at all.

556
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,400
It’s good.

557
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,240
It’s premium-grade chocolate.

558
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,880
Then I guess he bought it for you.

559
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,680
Why would he buy it for me?

560
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,400
Hey, Ran.

561
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,080
In 15 minutes, please change
and get ready for the next shoot.

562
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,080
Okay.

563
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,200
See you soon.

564
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:52,880
See you.

565
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,120
Take it, Peach.

566
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,000
It’s yours. He bought it for you.

567
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,800
You said it’s good, right?
You can have it.

568
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,520
Just take it.

569
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,640
You’re unbelievable.

570
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,280
Get back to work.

571
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,280
I’m going then.

572
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,680
Yeah, I’ll follow you in a bit.

573
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,400
Great lighting, shots, and composition.

574
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,680
Everything is perfect,
including the model.

575
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,200
Mr. Ran, please just go with the vibe.

576
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,360
You’re feeling refreshed,
there’s a gentle breeze,

577
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,680
and you’re enjoying it.

578
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,320
Okay.

579
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,280
That’s professional.

580
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,080
Don’t blow too hard or his hair will fly.

581
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,000
Just blow softly.

582
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:28,840
Great job.

583
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,040
Hey, Peach.

584
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,000
Look, he just randomly came down
to watch us work.

585
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,880
The AC in this studio
was already freezing.

586
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,040
Now it’s getting even colder.

587
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,040
I don’t think it’s anything.

588
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,000
What? Nothing?

589
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,440
Look at my director.

590
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,960
He’s shaking like crazy.

591
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,680
I’ll get him something to drink.

592
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,920
He needs warm water.

593
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,240
Oh, no!

594
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,040
Mr. Thee.

595
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,000
I bought you that chocolate,
but you fed it to someone else.

596
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,280
Uh…that was for me?

597
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,080
You’re insane!
You can’t even figure that out yourself?

598
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,960
Why would I order custom
peach-shaped chocolate for someone else?

599
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,400
Damn.

600
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,920
What do you want for dinner?

601
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,240
Huh?

602
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,240
I know you heard me.

603
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,080
Well, I don’t know yet.

604
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,080
I’m not hungry,
so I can’t think of anything.

605
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,200
Sir.

606
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,480
You really live life with no plans.

607
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,080
That’s who Peachayarat is, huh?

608
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,600
Excuse me?

609
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,400
Pork BBQ, I guess.

610
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,720
See you at 6 p.m. sharp.

611
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,440
My car is parked in front of the company
in the VIP zone.

612
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,320
You saw it before coming in, right?

613
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,120
Wait.

614
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,240
So you came down
to the studio just for this?

615
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,000
Can you not ask anything
that makes me more irritated?

616
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,320
I’m weary.

617
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,560
Our definition of pork BBQ is different.

618
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,400
Do you want anything in particular?

619
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,480
Just pick whatever your heart desires.

620
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,800
Don’t worry about the price.

621
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,280
Aren’t you going to eat?

622
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,320
What are you doing?

623
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,640
I’m sorry.

624
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,280
I was just going to
put some meat on your plate.

625
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,280
You haven’t eaten anything
since we got here.

626
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,320
Your hand.

627
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,040
It’s fine.

628
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,640
I already had your car brought home.

629
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:58,520
Thank you.

630
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,040
Let’s go to the hospital.

631
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,200
Why?

632
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,520
Your hand got burned.

633
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,480
It’s not that bad.

634
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,000
But you’ve been quiet the whole way here.

635
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,200
I’ve been quiet because
I didn’t want to talk,

636
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,400
not because it hurts.

637
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,320
What’s wrong? Why won’t you talk?

638
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:37,840
I’m not in a good mood.

639
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,560
Are you angry that I hurt you?

640
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,440
Exactly.

641
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,440
You hadn’t eaten anything,
so I was grilling meat for you.

642
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,800
And what did you do?
You pushed my hand away.

643
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,720
Seriously, did you think
I was going to kill you?

644
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,440
If you don’t trust me this much,

645
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,320
why did you even invite me to dinner?

646
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,000
Peachayarat.

647
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,400
How could I even hurt you?

648
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,840
I’m scared enough that you and your men
came to my house with guns.

649
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,080
Are you scared?

650
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:18,720
Yes!

651
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,600
I grew up with cameras.

652
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,000
I’m not a mafia boss
who grew up with guns like you.

653
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,920
But I would never use them to shoot you.

654
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,600
Should I be happy or grateful for that?

655
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,560
If your burn stops hurting,
will you stop being angry?

656
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,200
I don’t know. I’ll think about it.

657
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,760
How deep is your anger?

658
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,640
What do I have to do for us
to go back to the way we were?

659
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:03,000
When you hurt someone, what do you do?

660
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,760
Do you want me to put my hand
on the grill so I’ll hurt like you?

661
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,160
Or do you want a hospital,
a personal doctor, or—

662
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:12,800
Hey.

663
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:13,880
That’s not what I mean.

664
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:14,880
Then what?

665
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,280
(Please, Heaven.)

666
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,680
(Please take all her pain away
and give it to me instead.)

667
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,400
Hey.

668
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,440
Please, Heaven.

669
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,120
Please take all his pain away

670
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,640
and give it to me instead.

671
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:48,960
Get a grip, Mr. Thee!

672
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:08,800
(If you come a little closer,)

673
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,880
(you'll hear my heart beating your name.)

674
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,240
What kind of heart beats a person’s name?

675
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,080
Right, Boss?

676
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,600
What’s this sound?

677
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,960
Get a grip, Mr. Thee!

678
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,480
Even people who are closer
wouldn’t do that. It’s weird!

679
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,720
Even a tiny burn on your hand
feels like a wound in my boss’s heart.

680
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,400
When you like someone,
how do you let them know?

681
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:12,920
(Try to make a good first impression,
like complimenting their outfit.)

682
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,880
That outfit is way too revealing.
Everyone can see it.

683
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:16,760
Everyone, leave.

684
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,400
What are you guys doing here so late?

685
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,560
I’m sleeping here tonight.

686
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,400
No one can stop me.
