5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,370
My boss wants to collaborate with you.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,690
Mr. Thee, I don’t think
I can make it to dinner anymore.

7
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,780
Based on the information we found,
she dated Mr. Peach back in university.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,100
Tomorrow’s a day off. Are you free?

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,640
There’s somewhere I’d like to take you.

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,540
This is my real life.

11
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,400
What’s been stressing you out all day?

12
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,440
Are you afraid I’d mind
that you grew up there?

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,810
I don’t want to think that way,
but I can’t help it.

14
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,130
Knowing this makes me love you even more.

15
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,710
How about we try dating?

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,250
I swear I’ll love, take care of,
and protect you and your sister for life.

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,900
4-inch stilettos.

18
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:05,900
You haven’t learned, huh?

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,000
I can walk on my own now.

20
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,710
No need for anyone to hold me up.

21
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,170
Are you doing well?

22
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,920
Yeah, I’m okay.

23
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,500
This is Mr. Touch.

24
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,650
He’s my boss.

25
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:24,900
This is Peach.

26
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,780
Nice to finally meet you, Mr. Peachayarat.

27
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,010
Yes.

28
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,250
I’m really sorry for asking Mim
to reach out to you privately.

29
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:52,050
We really want to work with you,

30
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,500
but we couldn’t reach you at all.

31
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:57,300
No worries. I’m currently in
a long-term project with another company,

32
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,780
so I haven’t been taking on other jobs.

33
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,450
ARSENI?

34
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,860
Yes. You know it?

35
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,700
Only a few people don’t know it.

36
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,700
Anyway,

37
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,700
what would a mafia family
need a photographer for?

38
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:20,300
Oh, I’m working for
Mr. Theerakit’s perfume business.

39
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,500
So they use perfume for money laundering?

40
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,200
By the way, what’s the scope
of the project you want to hire me for?

41
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,500
Shohei is launching
an artist management company.

42
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,750
We currently have a few models signed.

43
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:49,700
We want you to take their profile photos
and shoot content to promote our company.

44
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,700
When’s the launch?

45
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,770
Hmm.

46
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,370
As soon as possible would be great,

47
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,550
but we’ll work around your schedule.

48
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,790
Oh, if you’re really in a rush
and it’s just a profile shoot,

49
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,750
I can actually recommend
some other good photographers.

50
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:09,850
No way, Peach.

51
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,700
You promised me.

52
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,850
I just don’t want to keep you waiting.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,900
I can wait.

54
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,600
I only want you, Mr. Peach.

55
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,130
Have you been waiting long?

56
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,140
Now I know who’s going to be
the first to have their eyeballs removed.

57
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,370
Calm down.

58
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,000
How can I?

59
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,900
Every time he looks at you,
it’s like he wants to eat you up.

60
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,900
I’m a human. How could he eat me?

61
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,550
But I already ate you up.

62
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,190
You can’t say that!

63
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,200
Where should we go?

64
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,000
Your place?

65
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,200
I’m going home.

66
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,980
You’re going back to work.

67
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,130
Can’t I go with you?

68
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,100
No.

69
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,100
I’m not feeling well.

70
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,100
I feel feverish and shivery.

71
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,780
I guess I’ll have to take sick leave.

72
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,340
If you’re sick, go to the hospital,

73
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,620
not my house.

74
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,400
Fine.

75
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,100
But if it turns out I’m really sick,

76
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,700
you have to let me sleep over
at your house

77
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,070
and take care of me
without leaving my side.

78
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,550
Mok, take me to the hospital.

79
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,500
An ARSENI hospital...

80
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,500
where doctors can give medical
certificates the way you want them?

81
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,000
Or which hospital, Boss?

82
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,610
Mok!

83
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,650
You’re so sneaky, Mr. Thee.

84
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,800
What did I do wrong?

85
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,000
I just don’t want to be away
from my boyfriend.

86
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,400
You’ve hit me twice already, Lookpeach.

87
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,700
Let’s go, Mr. Mok.

88
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,100
Please take me home
and take Mr. Thee to the office.

89
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:09,500
Got it.

90
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,800
Give me his name card.

91
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:54,850
You’re off work now, Mok.

92
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,000
I’m sorry.

93
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,950
What’s wrong?

94
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,200
Sorry?

95
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,550
Are you saying you drink all the time?

96
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,850
I just couldn’t sleep,

97
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,210
so I came down to chill for a bit.

98
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,600
Congratulations on Peach.

99
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,810
This is not the end, and you know it.

100
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,200
But it’s a really good beginning,
isn’t it?

101
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,400
I know now why love is dangerous for us.

102
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,200
Do you understand what Master
has been trying to tell us now?

103
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,100
I was never afraid of dying

104
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,000
until I fell in love with Peach.

105
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:13,950
ARSENI’s bodyguards are taught
to see death as something close.

106
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,350
It’s probably right

107
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,470
that I should stay away from love.

108
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,010
But you’re not just a bodyguard.

109
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,800
You’re my friend, Mok.

110
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,799
You’re happy that I found Peach.

111
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,270
I want to be happy for you, too.

112
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,170
Still,

113
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:52,950
in the end,

114
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,700
I have to take a bullet for my friend.

115
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,160
But as long as ARSENI
is under my supervision,

116
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,300
no one will die.

117
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,900
-Peach!
-Oh!

118
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,100
You’re startled, huh?

119
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,770
Ran!

120
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:29,850
What are you doing here?

121
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,000
They said there are
a few more details to discuss.

122
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,700
What about you? What are you doing here?

123
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,300
Hi, Mr. Peach.

124
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,300
Mr. Touch.

125
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:43,400
Mim.

126
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,870
Glad to see you, Peach.

127
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,350
What brings you two here?

128
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,100
This is Tawan.

129
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,170
He’s a model under Shohei

130
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,300
and another presenter for
the Spring Collection.

131
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,900
We’ll be working together
sooner than I thought.

132
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,490
The special scent for the Fall Collection,

133
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,410
our special project,
was very well received,

134
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,990
so ARSENI wants to invite you

135
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,500
to work with us fully
for the Spring Collection, Mr. Tawan.

136
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:30,300
It’s a great pleasure
that Shohei has accepted our offer.

137
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,970
The pleasure is all mine.

138
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,050
I've personally been wanting to come back.

139
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,400
Partnering with a famous model like you
on such a big project like this,

140
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,700
Tawan might need your help
with a lot of things, Mr. Aran.

141
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,500
No problem.

142
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,540
There shouldn’t be any issues
since they’ve worked together before.

143
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,200
Yes, we get along well.

144
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,350
It’s lunch break,

145
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,000
and all the places are packed.

146
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,850
Are you hungry?

147
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:17,980
Not yet.

148
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,400
You’re lying. I know you eat on time.

149
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,900
What would you like to eat?

150
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,800
Name the place.

151
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,200
Why?

152
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,750
Are you going to use your power again?

153
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,500
ARSENI has shares
in some of the restaurants.

154
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,600
It’s not unusual for them
to keep a special table for the owner.

155
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,570
No.

156
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,800
I don’t want to see people
getting chased out of a restaurant.

157
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,500
I never chase anyone out empty-handed.

158
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,150
The compensation I give them
for their wasted time

159
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,890
might even be enough
for them to enjoy 10 free—

160
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,600
(Get a grip!)

161
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,110
—meals.

162
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,350
But I probably won’t do that.

163
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:01,700
I won’t do it anymore.

164
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,930
You suddenly got it together, huh?

165
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,100
I don’t want to be scolded by you.

166
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,400
Besides scolding you,

167
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,500
I don’t want you using your money
to interfere in other people’s lives.

168
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,650
I get it now.

169
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,530
From now on, I’ll focus on saving money

170
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,900
just for you to use.

171
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,500
Eat this to tide you over for now.

172
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,800
Once the restaurants clear out,
we can have a proper meal.

173
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:56,370
It’s a little hot here,
but it’s the most peaceful spot.

174
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,810
If I’d known you’d be this cute
as my boyfriend,

175
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,500
I’d have sealed you as mine
in our past life.

176
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:30,900
You like it?

177
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:31,710
Yeah.

178
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,450
I love eating this
when I’m busy with work.

179
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,600
One hand working, the other eating.

180
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,410
It’s easy.

181
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,800
What do you think?

182
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:47,900
It’s good.

183
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,900
Actually, you can just tell me
what you’d like to eat next time.

184
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,970
I can have Mok prepare it in my office,

185
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,920
so we don’t have to
fight over it with others like this.

186
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,580
It’s just lining up for restaurants,
not fighting over them.

187
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,100
Besides, I don’t want to
keep going in and out of your room.

188
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,570
Don’t forget that others
still don’t know about us.

189
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,900
I have a meeting with the executive board
the day after tomorrow.

190
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:15,340
How about I announce our relationship
right in the middle of the meeting?

191
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,970
But if that’s too late,

192
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,180
I can issue a statement and
circulate it to all departments first.

193
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,170
WHERE DID YOU GO? I WAS GONNA…

194
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,500
I don’t mind if other people
know about us.

195
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,300
I only care about one person.

196
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,490
WHERE DID YOU GO?
I WAS GONNA INVITE YOU TO LUNCH.

197
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,200
Yes, already.

198
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,050
I saw you were busy, so I slipped out.

199
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,300
Sorry.

200
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,450
Let’s eat together next time.

201
00:14:59,250 --> 00:14:59,910
Okay.

202
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,500
Do your best at work.

203
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,380
You think Panachakorn won’t like me?

204
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,900
It’s not that she won’t like you.

205
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:15,400
I just need to find the right time
and opportunity to tell her.

206
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:20,200
If she finds out from someone else,
she’ll probably make a fuss.

207
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,690
Her big brother is just dating.

208
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,100
Is it really that big of a deal?

209
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,060
It normally wouldn’t be,
but it is because it’s you.

210
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,400
Think about it.

211
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,800
Her brother and her boss are dating.

212
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,980
And in Plub’s eyes,
you’re not exactly a kind boss.

213
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,800
I’ve taken care of Rome a bit before.

214
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,810
I’ll try to dig up whatever little bit of
‘older brother’ I have and use it.

215
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,050
Thank you.

216
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,650
Whatever you’re carrying,

217
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,780
put it down and let me help you carry it.

218
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,980
About that model, too.

219
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,450
You mean Tawan?

220
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,000
The marketing team
just proposed his name this morning.

221
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,200
I haven’t approved it yet.

222
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,000
I wanted to ask you first.

223
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:19,500
Actually, I don’t have
any issues with Tawan.

224
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,600
We can just work and get it over with.

225
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,090
Aran also said he doesn’t want to
mix work with personal matters.

226
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,850
I’d be more worried about Tawan.

227
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,150
Who knows what trouble he’ll cause again?

228
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:37,180
I can replace him if you want.

229
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,850
Let’s go with what the team wants.

230
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,200
I don’t want to involve personal matters.

231
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:49,600
Besides, if Aran finds out

232
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,090
his personal issues
are affecting the team,

233
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,400
he won’t be happy.

234
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,150
You’re only worrying about
other people again.

235
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:59,490
Well…

236
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,829
That’s because I already have you
looking out for me.

237
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,099
Wait, Peach.

238
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,000
I have one more thing to tell you.

239
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,930
Tatsuya is not an ordinary man
like you think he is.

240
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,550
The Shohei family is no different from
my father’s Lee family.

241
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,400
Mr. Touch is a mafia boss too?

242
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,810
I’ve had people
keep an eye on you for now,

243
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,250
but you can live normally.

244
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,210
My men won’t make you feel uncomfortable.

245
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:13,000
So this is the real life
I have to face, huh?

246
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,500
Are you afraid?

247
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,500
I believe you won’t let anything
happen to me.

248
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,250
Thanks for helping me, dude.

249
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,400
You know I’m not helping you for free.

250
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,300
I just want Aran back.

251
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,200
You can take whatever you want.

252
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,300
I can’t wait to see

253
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,170
what ARSENI is really capable of.

254
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,220
Hey!

255
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,500
Mr. Thee.

256
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:33,850
Did I startle you?

257
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:40,550
Don’t do that again.

258
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,650
Sorry.

259
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,300
It’s okay.

260
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,780
You have work at the studio today, right?

261
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,750
We’re just doing fittings today,

262
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,700
but it’s a big one
before we shoot on location.

263
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,970
Are you tired?

264
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:11,240
If you are, you can rest in my office.

265
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,210
Tired? I just got here.

266
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,690
I haven’t even taken my camera out
to set anything up yet.

267
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,470
I have a meeting this morning,

268
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,100
but I’ll come down to see you
as soon as it’s over.

269
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,100
Do your best at work.

270
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,100
(Do your best at work.)

271
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,500
(Do your best at work.)

272
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,200
I love you.

273
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,270
Do you wuv me?

274
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,000
Mr. Thee.

275
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,950
Do you wuv me, Lookpeach?

276
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,600
I love you too.

277
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,430
Peach and Boss…

278
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,100
Boss and Peach…

279
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,500
Oh my! I’m going to faint.

280
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,100
Come on. Let me help.

281
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,600
-It’s okay.
-Let me help.

282
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,600
Thank you.

283
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,000
What a coincidence
to be working together again.

284
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,300
So it’s really like I thought.

285
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,100
Well, I didn’t know
how else to approach you.

286
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,500
I called, but you didn’t pick up.

287
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:52,000
I texted, but you didn’t reply.

288
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,600
Don’t you think that’s because...

289
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,900
I don’t want anything
to do with you anymore?

290
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,500
But I’m still in love with you.

291
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,760
Very much.

292
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,700
Ran, can I have another chance?

293
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,800
This can be the last time.

294
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,300
I’m sorry,

295
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,600
but I’m not in love
with you anymore, Tawan.

296
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,580
You’ve settled in now?

297
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,300
I feel much more comfortable
being your assistant.

298
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:07,900
Don’t hold back, Peach.

299
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,450
I’d even carry a house if you ask.

300
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,350
Just let me know when you need anything.

301
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,300
Uh…

302
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:34,600
It’s such an honor that you came down
to oversee the work yourself, Boss.

303
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:40,400
If I hadn’t, I wouldn’t have realized
how much attention the photographer gets.

304
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,800
You can take the whole bag, Mr. Thee

305
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,150
Please have a seat here, Boss.

306
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,300
Alright.

307
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,300
Come on, everyone.

308
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:10,410
Okay.

309
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,650
This should be good.

310
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,600
The real lighting will make everything
pop even more.

311
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,250
Is there anything you’re hung up on?

312
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,400
You.

313
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,000
Hey.

314
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,900
There are lots of people here.

315
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:46,300
Let’s switch to the next set.

316
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,330
Okay.

317
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,400
Let’s go, you two.

318
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,200
Tawan, you can take a break.
Aran, please change your outfits.

319
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,800
Next, we’ll do solo shots of Aran
with the product.

320
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,100
It’s almost time for the meeting
with the Hong Kong team.

321
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,200
We still have half an hour.

322
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,770
Don’t do this.

323
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,350
Go upstairs to prepare for the meeting.

324
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,800
I’ll take it from here.

325
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,000
Trust me.

326
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:30,810
I’ll leave it to you.

327
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:32,560
Of course.

328
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:38,000
Okay. We have 10 minutes.

329
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,000
Ready, Ran?

330
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,050
Ran?

331
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,110
Are you okay?

332
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,180
Give me a second.

333
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,000
My eye hurts.

334
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,700
Do you want me to take a look?

335
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,600
Look up for me.

336
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:12,800
Hey!

337
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,100
I told you to stay
the hell away from Ran!

338
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:18,350
Don’t hurt Peach.

339
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,100
Why not?

340
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,050
You're protecting him so much, huh?

341
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,770
You love him so much, huh?

342
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:27,580
I hate you so damn much for
always acting like this.

343
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,980
What does that mean?

344
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:31,720
You chose him?

345
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,700
Stop being like this and take a hard look
at yourself, will you?

346
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,100
You can’t take care of anyone

347
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,600
because you keep acting like
a demanding kid.

348
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,240
You’re calling me a kid?

349
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:40,840
Stop it!

350
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:42,970
Hey!

351
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,240
The power’s out!

352
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,240
Go check if something’s broken.

353
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,330
Tawan’s gone!

354
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:49,900
Oh!

355
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,020
Where did he go?

356
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:56,900
Hey.

357
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,700
You got hurt again, Peachayarat.

358
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,200
Are you sure you don’t want to
go to the hospital?

359
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,080
At least have a doctor check you.

360
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,100
You have a bruise.

361
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,200
It’s nothing.

362
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,470
Dropping a phone on my face
hurts more than this.

363
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,950
Are you sure you’re okay?

364
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,100
Can you put some ointment on it for me?

365
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:49,600
Me?

366
00:28:58,530 --> 00:28:59,900
Plub! Plub!

367
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,800
Something big happened.

368
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,350
What happened?

369
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,720
Tawan got into a fight with Peach
at the studio.

370
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,300
Where’s Peach now?

371
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,280
At the studio?

372
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,180
Well…

373
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,550
Nuch, where’s Peach?

374
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,300
The CEO took Peach upstairs.

375
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:21,700
Huh?

376
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,300
Why?

377
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,400
It’s clear now.

378
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:31,500
What’s clear?

379
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,100
The CEO and Peach…

380
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,650
Wouldn’t it be better
to have a doctor do this for you?

381
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,100
It’s nothing serious.

382
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,300
Let’s not bother an emergency doctor.

383
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,700
But I…

384
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,250
I don’t know how to do this.

385
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:19,550
Give me your hand.

386
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,180
I’m afraid of accidentally hurting you.

387
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:04,600
Just be gentle, and it won’t hurt.

388
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,700
Hey.

389
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,460
I can’t see my own bruise.

390
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,160
You have to look.

391
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,100
Is this too hard?

392
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,500
No.

393
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:38,700
You’re at ARSENI,

394
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:41,890
but you ended up getting hurt.

395
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,050
I’m really useless.

396
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,000
It was so sudden.

397
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,600
No one could’ve prepared for it.

398
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,850
Don’t blame yourself.

399
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,810
Where’s Tawan, by the way?

400
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,050
You didn’t do anything to him, did you?

401
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,670
I just had people
throw him out of the company.

402
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:21,900
Is that all?

403
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:25,350
That’s really all.

404
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,600
If you don’t believe me, check the CCTV.

405
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,010
He even drove off by himself.

406
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,170
You’ve gotten much calmer, you know?

407
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,400
I know.

408
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,460
Because if this were me before,

409
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,170
not even his name

410
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,830
would be left in this world.

411
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,150
How cruel.

412
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,090
Whose boyfriend are you?

413
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,200
I forbid you

414
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,100
from getting hurt

415
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,520
or getting any more wounds,
under any circumstances.

416
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,550
Is that even something you can forbid?

417
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:29,530
Staff from other floors
aren’t allowed on this floor.

418
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,100
Then I quit.

419
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:34,910
Ms. Panachakorn.

420
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,450
Peach!

421
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,700
The CEO?

422
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,700
What’s the meaning of this?

423
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:01,010
(Sorry, it’s not possible
to reach the number…)

424
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:08,659
(Sorry, it’s not possible
to reach the number you’ve dialed…)

425
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,380
(Sorry, it’s not possible…)

426
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,550
Ran.

427
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:31,300
Ran, hear me out.

428
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:32,650
Ran.

429
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:35,850
I did everything I did because I love you.

430
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:38,429
So Punching Peach
was your way of loving me?

431
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,580
Peach?

432
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:41,300
You’re mentioning his name again.

433
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,000
Isn’t this all his fault?

434
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,000
I’ll say this one last time.

435
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,699
Peach is my big brother.

436
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:56,110
Big brother?

437
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:57,750
Big brother, huh?

438
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,100
Weren’t you about to suck lips?

439
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,700
The one I love is you, Tawan!

440
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,580
It’s always been you!

441
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,300
But thanks to today,

442
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,150
I can finally stop loving you.

443
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:19,100
No.

444
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:20,900
Listen to me, Ran.

445
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,260
Hear me out.

446
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:22,890
Hey!

447
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,050
Ran, hear me out.

448
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,170
What?

449
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,510
I’m sorry, Ran.

450
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,400
I guess we really won’t work out, Tawan.

451
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,600
Ran, I’m sorry.

452
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,580
Ran. Ran.

453
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:34,770
Ran.

454
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,100
Can you leave me alone?

455
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:42,100
There’s only one thing I’m asking you.

456
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:46,670
I want my life back.

457
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,600
Stop bothering me already.

458
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,100
I can’t even be friends with you!

459
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:57,410
Ran, can you hear me out?

460
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,100
Ran.

461
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,530
Go wherever you want!

462
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:32,850
Gosh!

463
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:37,000
So…you two…

464
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,300
are already boyfriends?

465
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,290
Damn.

466
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:48,500
Please don’t be rude.

467
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,400
You…

468
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,380
and the CEO?

469
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,800
Are you really dating?

470
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,100
Just call me Mr. Thee.

471
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,160
Or if there’s an opportunity,

472
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,230
you can call me P’Thee.

473
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:12,250
I’m your brother’s boyfriend.

474
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,900
So I’m basically your other brother,
Panachakorn.

475
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,700
So, Peach,

476
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,150
you don’t have anything to say to me?

477
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,750
Whatever you want to say to me,

478
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,500
just say it.

479
00:37:58,990 --> 00:37:59,750
Mr. Thee,

480
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,950
do you really love Peach?

481
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,450
Whatever you want me to swear to,

482
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,300
just tell me.

483
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,750
But aren’t you a mafia boss?

484
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:15,900
You’re so scary.

485
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:19,000
Why isn’t Peach scared of you?

486
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:29,700
What you see is just a made-up story
that the outsiders believe.

487
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:34,600
I’m not like that.

488
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,150
But I only have one brother.

489
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,500
I mean,

490
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:52,250
Peach is the only one I have.

491
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,700
To be honest, I’m possessive of him.

492
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:09,010
I’m afraid he’ll love you more than me.

493
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,250
Peach has dated many people,

494
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:30,300
but I’ve never felt my heart
sink this much before.

495
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:36,600
Do I seem that dangerous in your eyes?

496
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,400
No.

497
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,400
It’s just that Peach
seems to really love you.

498
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,030
You say you two only have
each other, right?

499
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:12,200
What’s wrong with having
one more big brother?

500
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:18,450
You know how to be a brother?

501
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,700
Why not?

502
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,810
I have a younger brother myself.

503
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,200
We actually have something in common.

504
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,150
What is that?

505
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,100
We both...

506
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,570
love Peachayarat.

507
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,500
It’s not the same.

508
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:50,600
I love him more.

509
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:57,270
Alright.

510
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,030
You love him a little more than I do.

511
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:05,050
Wouldn’t it be better
if we were on the same team?

512
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,500
The same team?

513
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:21,100
Our team’s mission is to make Peachayarat
happy for the rest of his life.

514
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:29,600
Deal?

515
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:50,810
Tap it.

516
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,650
Mr. Tatsuya wants to see you

517
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,300
in order to take responsibility
for the damage that happened.

518
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:20,950
They’re happy to send another model
from their agency to replace Tawan.

519
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:23,100
We won’t work with that company again.

520
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:28,330
We’ll also cancel all the jobs
they’ve already booked Peach for.

521
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:30,450
Will Mr. Peach be okay with that?

522
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,050
I’ve already talked to him.

523
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:38,200
Besides, I couldn’t interfere
with his work before

524
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:40,780
because we weren’t anything yet.

525
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:44,200
But now we’re dating.

526
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,780
That means I can cuddle Peach.

527
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:51,580
I said it’s “meddle”, Boss.

528
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:53,300
Yeah.

529
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:55,590
I can do everything.

530
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,660
We also heard from
the Weera-arpakorn, Tawan’s family.

531
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:06,340
They want to send a lawyer to negotiate

532
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:10,570
the lawsuit we filed for damages
for their assault on Peach.

533
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,200
I don’t want to see anyone.

534
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,300
When they were causing all that mess,
no one bothered to ask for my permission.

535
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:23,200
Now they’re in trouble,
and they want to negotiate?

536
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,450
That’s too easy, isn’t it?

537
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:31,750
I promised Peach no one would get hurt,

538
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,100
but you can handle everything else.

539
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:40,900
Make them learn their lesson
for daring to hurt my man.

540
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,400
Yes, Boss.

541
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,100
When did you two secretly plan this?

542
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,300
We didn’t sneak around.

543
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,760
We just planned a family meal.

544
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,050
I want to eat salmon.

545
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:02,900
Do you want the whole salmon?

546
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,210
Let me take care of that.

547
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:05,930
That’s too much.

548
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,700
Half of it then.

549
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:09,700
Plub.

550
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:11,690
Just kidding.

551
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,950
But I’m not kidding.

552
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:22,220
When we get a chance,
I’ll take you fishing in Iceland,

553
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,770
then watch the Aurora. What do you say?

554
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:26,600
Sounds good.

555
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:29,500
Stop it, brother and sister.

556
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,000
Is the power out?

557
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,370
But I already paid the electricity bill.

558
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,760
VILLAGE GROUP CHAT

559
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:01,850
MANAGEMENT: A CAR HIT A POWER POLE
AND A TRANSFORMER EXPLODED.
WE’RE GETTING TECHNICIANS
TO REPAIR IT. @ALL

560
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:05,060
A car hit a power pole.

561
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,850
The power will probably be back tomorrow.

562
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:11,550
That’s too bad.

563
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:13,300
What should we do?

564
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,200
You say it’s bad,

565
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,170
but you’re smiling from ear to ear.

566
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:23,200
I’m not smiling.

567
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,300
Are you seeing things?

568
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:31,240
I might have to trouble you to—

569
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,000
Sure.

570
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,300
Drop me off at Plub’s condo.

571
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:39,580
Oh?

572
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:42,610
That’s not what I had in mind.

573
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,000
What did you have in mind, you sneaky?

574
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,650
My house is so much closer
than Plub’s condo.

575
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,100
This is your house?

576
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,300
Let’s get inside.

577
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:03,250
If it were me,
I wouldn’t even dare call this a house.

578
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:05,040
It’s yours.

579
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:06,850
Are you crazy?

580
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,300
Oh, it’s okay. I’ll carry this myself.

581
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:35,050
Isn’t that Ms. Natlada?

582
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:38,900
Ms. Nat was still young here.

583
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:42,050
You know her?

584
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,200
She was so famous when I was a kid.

585
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:46,120
She’s your mom?

586
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,100
I need private time.

587
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:20,920
Whoa.

588
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,330
This is your bedroom?

589
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:27,580
Our bedroom.

590
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:29,700
Hold on.

591
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,700
So you love watching soap operas

592
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:38,150
because…?

593
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,550
Yes.

594
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:52,070
It makes me feel close to my mom.

595
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:06,100
Are you okay?

596
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,380
Of course.

597
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,650
It can’t hurt me anymore.

598
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:22,650
Are you lonely?

599
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:26,300
I used to be,

600
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:28,950
but I have you now.

601
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:32,380
Mr. Thee!

602
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:37,300
Go take a bath.

603
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,950
I’ll get you the kind of pajamas
a normal person would wear.

604
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,470
I really want to know,
between your pajamas and mine,

605
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:50,100
which one is closer to being normal.

606
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:23,000
Why did you come in?

607
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:23,980
I’m going to take a bath.

608
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,350
I want you to brush my teeth again.

609
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:30,200
Where’s your babysitter gang?

610
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:35,850
I told everyone I needed privacy.

611
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:38,830
And?

612
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:44,100
That means no one can come up
to intrude anymore.

613
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:49,650
Usually, I have people brush my teeth

614
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,400
and give me a bath.

615
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:57,500
Mr. Thee.

616
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:02,250
Now I only have you.

617
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:17,800
Mr. Thee is upstairs, right?

618
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:18,600
Yes.

619
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:19,750
Mr. Mok,

620
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:22,600
Mr. Thee ordered that
no one go up and disturb him.

621
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:36,900
(Peachayarat Jane-kit?)

622
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:39,450
(Is there something I should know
about this name?)

623
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,850
You’re really not going to soak with me?

624
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:57,300
No.

625
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,500
My instincts tell me it’s dangerous.

626
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:10,450
Is this really necessary?

627
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:11,980
Theerakit Kian Lee.

628
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:23,550
In Hong Kong, my relative died
from using soap with poison.

629
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:29,560
Since then,

630
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:34,500
all items must be safety-checked first.

631
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:38,380
But that was a long time ago.

632
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,700
It was probably even before I was born.

633
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:08,700
It’s a gunshot wound.

634
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:11,700
Luckily, it was just a graze.

635
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:16,250
But it left a mark until now.

636
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:37,500
I’m fine now.

637
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:39,000
Don’t worry.

638
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:53,100
You said you wouldn’t allow me
to be wounded or hurt again.

639
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,800
The same goes for you. Got it?

640
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,770
Can you promise me

641
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:04,400
that no matter what happens,

642
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:07,400
we’ll get through it together?

643
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:17,400
Didn’t you say the world you’re building
will be just the two of us?

644
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:21,400
Don’t worry, Mr. Thee.

645
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:28,700
There’s one thing I want to ask of you.

646
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,370
Hmm?

647
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,900
I want you to call my name.

648
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:40,730
You mean call you...

649
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:44,370
Mr. Thee?

650
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:47,550
Kian.

651
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,650
Can I really call you that?

652
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:59,600
Only my family is allowed
to call me by my middle name.

653
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:06,950
Now, you’re my lover.

654
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:18,550
Kian.

655
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:21,970
P’Kian.

656
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:23,750
Huh?

657
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,100
I want you to call me P’Kian.

658
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,400
P’Kian.

659
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,350
Peach loves you, P’Kian.

Aren’t you scared anymore?

669
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:25,800
I was just saying that.

670
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,700
Otherwise, I couldn’t be with you,
Mr. Thee.

671
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,580
What did you just call me?

672
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:37,100
I said it out of habit.

673
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:41,800
Then you have to practice
until you’re used to it.

674
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,700
Try calling me P’Kian.

675
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:52,770
P’Kian.

676
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:55,100
That’s so good.

677
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:56,700
I love it.

678
00:55:58,310 --> 00:55:59,330
Can you try saying it like...

679
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:01,400
you miss me so much?

680
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:09,100
P’Kian.

681
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:11,810
Oh.

682
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:13,190
I love it.

683
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:17,200
Now, can you call me in a lovey-dovey way?

684
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:19,900
Try it.

685
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:22,450
P’Kian.

686
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:28,400
This time, can you say it in a sulky way?

687
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:30,750
P’Kian.

688
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:34,300
Even when you’re scolding me,
your voice sounds beautiful.

689
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:40,070
So, I want you to call me P’Kian—

690
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:40,880
Come on!

691
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:42,100
P’Kian!

692
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:44,480
How many more versions of Kian
do you want today?

693
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,780
Just give me one more version.

694
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:51,400
Whisper next to my ear
and wish me good night before I sleep.

695
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,200
Get a grip, P’Kian!

696
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:09,670
You’re crazy.

697
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:11,150
This is crazy.

698
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,720
I’m so shy.

699
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,430
What happened to Tawan,
was it your doing?

700
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,130
Yes.

701
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,600
Did you really have to
threaten me like that?

702
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:19,270
Good night.

703
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,200
I want to sleep over here.

704
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:20,910
Next time.

705
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,990
I give you permission to move some
of  your necessary stuff here.

706
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:25,090
Now that you said that,

707
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,340
please get ready
to have your house renovated.

708
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:30,470
Call me when you get home.

709
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:32,800
Hello.

710
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:35,900
(Mr. Mok, Mr. Thee forgot his phone
at my house.)

711
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:36,770
Mr. Mok?

712
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:37,900
What’s that sound?
