Characters, actions, places, occupations,

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,430
and events in this series are fictional and
created for entertainment purposes only.

They are not intended to urge

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,970
Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,300
What are you thinking?

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,250
I want to kiss you again.

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,350
But I want this to be a kiss
you’re willing to allow.

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,780
I didn’t see anything.

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:23,920
Why are you here?

10
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,760
Do you think you’re the only one
getting interrupted?

11
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,640
Get ready.

12
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,660
Starting tomorrow,
I’m going full force in chasing you.

13
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,270
It really suits you.

14
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,030
You took so many photos of me in secret.

15
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,120
You’re just…

16
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,700
so madly in love.

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,930
THE DARKROOM PURCHASE CONTRACT
HAS BEEN FINALIZED, MR. THEE.

18
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,600
Power of attorney for land and building
ownership transfer.

19
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,400
Gosh, Mr. Thee!

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,890
-(Good mor—)
-Are you crazy?

21
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,260
(Can't you discuss things with me
before you do anything?)

22
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,180
What do you mean you bought that
entire building and transferred it to me?

23
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,860
It’s not like it costs five or ten baht.

24
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,940
The land alone is worth
hundreds of thousands,

25
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,450
not to mention the equipment in the shop.

26
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,820
What you did isn’t funny.

27
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,420
Where would I find the time
to look after that building?

28
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,500
Working for ARSENI alone
is already costing me sleep.

29
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,060
This is not funny.

30
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,450
I have my reasons.

31
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,780
(What reasons?)

32
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:24,970
Tell me.

33
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,450
That place is full of our memories.

34
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,100
I don’t see
why I shouldn’t want to keep it.

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,380
That’s not enough reason.

36
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,210
But…

37
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:40,700
(I really can’t accept it.)

38
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,500
It’s too much.

39
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,240
Fine.

40
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,450
Transfer the place to ARSENI instead

41
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:53,600
and have our team manage it.

42
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,500
Yes, Boss.

43
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,150
But Peach gets to use it
for free for life.

44
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,300
Let’s talk later.

45
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,400
Someone’s calling me.

46
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,930
When will Peach finally realize

47
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,700
that my money could really
stack up into a wall?

48
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:36,700
Hello?

49
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,670
(Are you free tomorrow afternoon?)

50
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,630
(Let’s grab a meal.)

51
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:45,450
Actually, let’s wait until
your boss is back from Japan, Mim.

52
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,700
Then we can set up a meeting.

53
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,740
(You really don’t want to see me, huh?)

54
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,150
It’s not like that.

55
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,150
I just don’t want to waste your time.

56
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,150
We’re only going to
talk about work anyway, right?

57
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,650
(Up to you then.)

58
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,140
Besides, I have a meeting tomorrow
that runs until early evening.

59
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,290
(Really?)

60
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,600
(Let me text you some other time.)

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,340
The Shohei family reached out.

62
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,530
They want to meet with you, Mr. Thee.

63
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:26,640
Who?

64
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,570
They’re ARSENI’s arms-dealing partner

65
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:30,900
and a major client of Master.

66
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,500
They have influence in Japan.

67
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,030
Their youngest son is entering
the business scene in Thailand,

68
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,850
so they want to get to know you.

69
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,030
That won’t be necessary.

70
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,570
You know ARSENI here
isn’t like my dad’s territory.

71
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,630
I don’t sell guns.

72
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:07,900
Shit!

73
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,550
It’s me, Plub.

74
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,570
Plub!

75
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,300
What happened to you?

76
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,660
Why did you come back like this?

77
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,260
I can’t take it anymore.

78
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,630
Trend is better at his job now,

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,800
but helping him get there means
I haven’t had time to do my own work.

80
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,260
You think you won’t be able to
edit all the photos in time, right?

81
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,830
Go take a shower and sleep.

82
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,370
I’ll take care of the rest.

83
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:43,930
Really?

84
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,050
I want to give you my entire salary.

85
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,000
But even if you did,

86
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,980
I’d still have to take care of you,
wouldn’t I?

87
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,400
You know me so well.

88
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,780
More like I see right through you.

89
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,260
I don’t want to work anymore.

90
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,840
Is your boyfriend rich?

91
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,530
Can he take care of both of us?

92
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,180
He’s not my boyfriend yet.

93
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,300
Your boyfriend-to-be then.

94
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,370
Is he rich?

95
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,300
Well…

96
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,950
He has enough to get by.

97
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,850
What?

98
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:28,020
Go take a shower and sleep
before I change my mind.

99
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,980
If you do, I’m in trouble.

100
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,400
I should go.

101
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,200
Thank you, Peach.

102
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,000
Don’t run. You don’t want to fall.

103
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,100
He has enough to get by,
as in he’ll never run out of money.

104
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,150
What are you doing at my house
so early in the morning?

105
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,100
You’re wearing something bizarre

106
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,260
and awkwardly in-between again.

107
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,250
I wore this to sleep,

108
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,700
not to show off to anyone.

109
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,420
Besides, you’re the only one who shows up
at my house this early in the morning.

110
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,500
I’m the only one?

111
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,450
Where are my slippers?

112
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,600
They’re not yours. They’re Plub’s.

113
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:40,190
Peach!

114
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:41,850
Shit!

115
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,909
I’ve already booked a ride.

116
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,350
You can sleep in. No need to drive me.

117
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,260
Hey! She’s really here this time.

118
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,930
Go! Leave!

119
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,730
Go!

120
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,300
Oh.

121
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,900
Why are you standing in front of the door?

122
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,450
Well, I heard you shouting,
so I opened the door for you.

123
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,100
I didn’t make you breakfast, though.

124
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,260
Can you grab something to eat
at the office?

125
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:11,800
Sure.

126
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,200
My ride is here. I’m heading out.

127
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,200
Wait.

128
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,600
I’ll walk you out.

129
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:23,150
Come on.

130
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,100
Let’s go before you’re late.

131
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,400
Bye.

132
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,650
Bye.

133
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,100
Hey!

134
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,200
We’re lucky Mr. Mok
didn’t park in front of the house.

135
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,770
Otherwise, we’d be in trouble.

136
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,330
Panachakorn and I have met before.

137
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,850
Meeting at the house
and at the office are different.

138
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,860
You’re making a mountain
out of a molehill.

139
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:16,100
If Plub saw you at my house,
she’d die of shock.

140
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,100
I mean, you even brought me breakfast.

141
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,370
When are you going to tell Panachakorn

142
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,580
about us?

143
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:27,640
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

144
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:29,740
Plub is here!

145
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,140
You need to lie down.

146
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,820
Lie down!

147
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,370
Luckily, I turned back in time.

148
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,780
Why are you lying face down?

149
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,970
My back hurts.

150
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,930
Oh, do you want me to walk on your back?

151
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,500
Hey!

152
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,630
No, it’s okay.

153
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,450
Your driver is waiting, right?

154
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,700
Alright. Sweet dreams, Lookpeach.

155
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,200
Make sure you don’t forget anything else.

156
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,100
Bye-bye.

157
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,600
Lookpeach.

158
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,300
Are you hungry?

159
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,270
(Lookpeach.)

160
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,330
(Lookpeach.)

161
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,010
(Why is my heart beating your name?)

162
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,130
Hey.

163
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,210
(Lookpeach.)

164
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,000
(Get a grip.)

165
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:34,690
(Lookpeach.)

166
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:35,430
Hey.

167
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,150
I’m going to take a shower.

168
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,950
I’ll be right back.

169
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:40,850
I can wait.

170
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,850
I can wait my whole life.

171
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,300
Mok, I need you to do something urgent.

172
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,320
You have only 20 minutes.

173
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,000
Hey!

174
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,370
What are you doing?

175
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,150
Do you like this?

176
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,340
Call me Peach.

177
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,050
Lookpeach.

178
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:35,700
Peach.

179
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,450
Lookpeach.

180
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,630
I said Peach.

181
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,580
Lookpeach.

182
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,700
I can pronounce the ‘ch’
more clearly if you want.

183
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,560
Lookpeach.

184
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,000
Smile, Lookpeach.

185
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,140
Lookpeach.

186
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:00,700
Peach.

187
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,200
Lookpeach. Lookpeach.

188
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:02,720
Lookpeach.

189
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,800
Are you trying to get on my nerves?

190
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,860
Look…peach.

191
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,430
Are you really not going to take that off?

192
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:21,400
Anyway, why are you here
so early in the morning?

193
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,430
Hmm? Don’t you have to go to work?

194
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:24,750
I came to pick you up.

195
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,220
You have the Spring Project meeting today,
don’t you?

196
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,430
That’s at 2 p.m.

197
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,110
I think I’ll take a nap before I go.

198
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,220
You can go without me.

199
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,350
I can wait.

200
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,530
Mr. Thee.

201
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,050
Don’t let me affect your work.

202
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,650
You’re so strict.

203
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,470
It’s time to go.

204
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:50,400
Alright.

205
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,670
There’s coffee in the fridge.

206
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,690
You can have some when you wake up.

207
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,250
Hold on.

208
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,200
Are you really wearing that out?

209
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:13,800
Hey.

210
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,350
I’m returning it to its real owner.

211
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,400
We’ll see each other in just a few hours.

212
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,340
I pray my heart doesn’t break before then.

213
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:37,950
Wait.

214
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,800
Have a seat and wait a moment.
I’ll be right back.

215
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,500
Here’s a souvenir for you.

216
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:51,450
From where?

217
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:55,300
From our beach trip.

218
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,800
On my first day there,
I went to a handmade market.

219
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,700
I saw it and thought of you.

220
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,380
You thought of me?

221
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,300
Can you stop picking up
only what you want to hear?

222
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,940
I said a lot more than that.

223
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,350
I painted and glazed it,

224
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,700
so it needed time to dry.

225
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,100
The shop had to send it to me later.

226
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,850
I’m sorry I’m giving this to you so late.

227
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,350
They say the sound of a wind chime helps
people calm down and collect themselves.

228
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,300
I think it suits you.

229
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:49,800
Try hanging it up.

230
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,900
This has my name on it too?

231
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:05,300
I remember that everything that’s yours
has your name marked on it, right?

232
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,600
Everything that’s mine has
Theerakit K. Lee marked on it.

233
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,500
I love it so much.

234
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,450
Thank you, Look…

235
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,650
You’ve fallen asleep, Lookpeach?

236
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,400
Let your heart rest and your body recover.

237
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,870
Sweet dreams, Lookpeach.

238
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,250
That’s right.

239
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:00,410
Everything that’s mine
has my name marked on it.

240
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,250
The meeting room is ready.

241
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,050
I need your advice, Mok.

242
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:20,900
Of course, Boss.

243
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,220
Where should I hang this?

244
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,100
If I hang it here, I won’t see it at home.

245
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,500
But if I take it home,

246
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,800
what will I do at work?

247
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,090
Why don’t you buy another one?

248
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,700
I didn’t buy this myself.

249
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,600
Peach got it for me.

250
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,300
Actually, this is much more special
than the squid he gave you guys.

251
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,200
This clearly shows that, to Peach,

252
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,460
I’m not just anyone.

253
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,370
Let’s go to the meeting.

254
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,540
My name is on this too.

255
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,070
Peach said he painted it with his own hands.

256
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:01,650
Boss—

257
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,340
Not only does he take beautiful photos,

258
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,800
but his handwriting
is also really beautiful.

259
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,600
You can have a love life,

260
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,460
but please don’t let it affect your work.

261
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,800
I love it so much, Mok.

262
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,400
I really love it.

263
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,330
This has my name on it too?

264
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,850
I remember that everything that’s yours
has your name marked on it, right?

265
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,450
A wind chime should be hung up.

266
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,550
Is it almost time
for the meeting with Peach?

267
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,520
You can’t ask the same question
every five minutes, Boss.

268
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,080
He’s acting like a kid.

269
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,300
What’s wrong, sis?
Why are you pacing around like that?

270
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,700
You’re going to end up
complaining about knee pain again.

271
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,860
Didn’t the doctor say
they’re starting to wear out?

272
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,880
Mr. Mok told me the Spring Collection
meeting will be moved

273
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,930
to the large conference room.

274
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,500
I’ll call and let Peach know.

275
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,080
Isn’t the small meeting room available?

276
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,100
It is.

277
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:12,850
Oh?

278
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,300
Then why don’t we use that room?

279
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:16,500
Because…

280
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,890
Boss is going to join the meeting.

281
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:20,690
What?

282
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:30,940
Why are you walking around?

283
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,750
-Why?
-Why are you walking around?

284
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,600
I’m freaking out.

285
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,690
Hey! Note!

286
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,900
Why are you following me?

287
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,080
Why are you walking around?

288
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,300
Well, I don’t know what to do.

289
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,150
I’m stressed.

290
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:40,640
Oh!

291
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,730
First of all,

292
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,700
it’s such an honor to have you
join our update meeting, Boss.

293
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,730
As the project lead,

294
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,700
shall I go ahead and give you an update?

295
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,140
I guess that means I can start now.

296
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,450
Spring is the third sub-project
of All Season’s One Word.

297
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:32,020
For this one, our brand ambassador Aran
will be our main model as usual.

298
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,060
However, from the special-scent release
for the Fall Collection,

299
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:39,360
we saw higher sales
when we used two models.

300
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,270
So we’re currently looking for

301
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:44,650
another model who’s trending right now
to shoot with Aran.

302
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,780
Once we find the person,
we’ll let you know right away, Boss.

303
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:49,970
Mm.

304
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,400
There’s one more change
from the last project.

305
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,500
For this one, Peach is back
as our main photographer.

306
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:02,050
Trend will be his assistant.

307
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:05,990
Is an assistant really necessary?

308
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:11,350
Uh…

309
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,200
Shall I start proposing my ideas?

310
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,870
Yes, that’d be great.

311
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,050
Since the concept
of this collection is “Spring,”

312
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,200
I want to highlight nature.

313
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:49,370
So I’m proposing that
we don’t shoot in the studio.

314
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,200
Let’s shoot outdoors.

315
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,050
THE ONE AND ONLY TH -
YOUR OUTFIT IS REALLY CUTE TODAY.

316
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:01,960
Agreed.

317
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,120
Your ideas are amazing.

318
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,200
I like them.

319
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,200
Would you like to have dinner tonight?

320
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,800
What did I present?

321
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,900
Can you give me a recap?

322
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,800
See? You weren’t even listening to me.

323
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,170
You were just staring at my face
in the meeting room.

324
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:27,700
Don’t do that.

325
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,850
Your work will suffer.

326
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,100
Besides, the others might get suspicious.

327
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:35,930
Okay.

328
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,600
So what do you want to eat for dinner?

329
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,400
Anything is fine,
but let’s keep it simple.

330
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,690
SEE YOU AT 7 P.M. AT YOUR FAV PLACE,
JUST IN CASE YOUR MEETING RUNS LATE.

331
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,020
Mr. Thee…

332
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,300
I already had Mok book a restaurant.

333
00:23:58,450 --> 00:23:59,300
Whose car should we take?

334
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:00,740
Mine or yours?

335
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,300
I don’t think I can make it anymore.

336
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,550
Be reasonable.

337
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,190
But you gave me your word.

338
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,900
I’m sorry.

339
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,290
I mixed up the date.

340
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:29,330
Mm.

341
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,600
I have a work meeting,

342
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,850
but ours is just dinner.

343
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,250
We can always reschedule.

344
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:36,660
As you wish.

345
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,370
I’ve explained myself,

346
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,450
so I’m not going to beg you.

347
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,500
I thought you’d already left.

348
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,500
Do you want to talk to me about something?

349
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,550
But Boss seemed to like
your presentation earlier.

350
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,070
What’s wrong?

351
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,050
When it comes to love,

352
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,050
should we rely more on reason or feelings?

353
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,000
Why do you ask?

354
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,000
What’s going on?

355
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:29,800
Well…

356
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,400
I forgot I had a work meeting
this evening,

357
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,700
so I’d already agreed
to have dinner with him.

358
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,750
When I realized I couldn’t make it
and explained,

359
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,500
he got mad at me.

360
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:45,900
And then?

361
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,500
Nothing.

362
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,600
I just don’t understand
why he doesn’t understand.

363
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,130
Hmm…

364
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,380
When someone’s already made plans

365
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,700
and they fall through,

366
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,500
it’s normal for them to feel disappointed.

367
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,400
I don’t think he’s mad at you.

368
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:04,650
He might just be sulking.

369
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:08,700
What should I do?

370
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:11,150
Hmm… you need to weigh your options.

371
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,000
Work is obviously more important.

372
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:19,100
No, I mean you should think about

373
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,500
which plan you can ditch
without regretting it later.

374
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:30,780
And to answer your question about whether
love requires more reason or feelings,

375
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,900
if you ask me,

376
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:36,370
I’d say I lean a bit more toward feelings.

377
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,100
Why?

378
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,550
Because love is about feelings.

379
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,800
Because you feel, you love.

380
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:28,500
What is it?

381
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,250
Why do you keep biting your lip?

382
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:47,250
Hello, Mim.

383
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,730
Sorry for calling on short notice.

384
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,700
I misunderstood your message a bit.

385
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,250
Can we postpone today’s plan?

386
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,480
Something urgent came up.

387
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,850
I’ll take the job to make it up to you.

388
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:04,700
Okay.

389
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,570
See you soon.

390
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,600
Now I’m free this evening.

391
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,200
Hey.

392
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,450
Someone could walk in and see us.

393
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,800
If anyone comes in right now,

394
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,170
I’ll have their eyeballs taken out.

395
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,600
I have something to tell you.

396
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,400
Actually, Mim isn’t just a friend.

397
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,170
She’s my ex.

398
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,000
But there’s nothing between us now.

399
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,550
We just work together.

400
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:08,220
Mm.

401
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:15,250
I didn’t want you to find out later
or hear it from someone else.

402
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,500
Are you okay with me working with my ex?

403
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,600
Of course. I trust you.

404
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,410
If Mr. Peach finds out, won’t he get mad?

405
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,570
I trust Peach,
but I don’t trust other people.

406
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,750
Montpreeya.

407
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,300
She dated Mr. Peach back in university.

408
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,600
Based on the information we found,
she’s the ex who was with him the longest.

409
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,690
Why did she reach out now?

410
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,500
She works as a secretary to an executive
at a newly launched entertainment company.

411
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,800
They want Mr. Peach to join their project.

412
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,390
I won’t allow it.

413
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,450
Sir, Mr. Peach is a freelancer.

414
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,800
You can’t meddle with his decision
to take a job or not.

415
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:11,830
Who am I supposed to be

416
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,340
to cuddle with Peach?

417
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,340
“Meddle.”

418
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,050
That’s what I mean.

419
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,700
Well, maybe someone Mr. Peach allows
to help him make decisions.

420
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,650
Someone he allows to have the right

421
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,500
to be his other half.

422
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:36,900
Buy that startup
and bring it under ARSENI.

423
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,690
Replace both the executive
and the secretary.

424
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:44,900
And Blacklist Peach’s name.

425
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:50,450
I don’t think we can do that.

426
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:54,400
If they find out ARSENI is behind it,
they’ll be even less likely to agree.

427
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:59,200
Ms. Montpreeya’s boss is Mr. Tatsuya,

428
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,000
the youngest son of the Shohei family

429
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:05,100
whose appointment you just rejected.

430
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,100
That family again?

431
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,420
What do they really want?

432
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,600
The Shohei family is an old yakuza family.

433
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,600
They’re currently looking to expand
their power base into other countries.

434
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,320
Mr. Tatsuya seems to have broken away
from his family to start his own business.

435
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:25,200
He’s not under their control
like his siblings.

436
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,700
He didn’t break away.

437
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,170
He’s just chasing a shortcut.

438
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,900
I’ll arrange a protection team
for Mr. Peach.

439
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:38,300
Make sure Peach can live his life
as normally as possible.

440
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,400
Do not let ARSENI affect his happiness

441
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,200
or smile.

442
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:46,660
Got it.

443
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,900
As for the heir of that Shohei family,

444
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:52,920
I don’t trust him.

445
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,950
If he really is taking the shortcut
we think he is,

446
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,500
he’ll know soon enough

447
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,300
who the king of this mountain is.

448
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:27,700
Thank you.

449
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,970
Do you like the atmosphere here?

450
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,400
I do.

451
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,300
But I just want to come here to eat.

452
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,100
I don’t want to own the place.

453
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,750
Next time, you don’t have
to close it just for us.

454
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:50,550
Can I ask you something honestly?

455
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,100
I’m not being possessive or anything.

456
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,600
Why do you still take on more jobs?

457
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,300
Is ARSENI paying you too little?

458
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:04,750
It’s not about the money.

459
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:07,900
I do it because I love this job.

460
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,200
Most people hate working.

461
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,200
If they had a choice,

462
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,300
they’d just want to lie down
and do nothing.

463
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,060
I’m not like the others.

464
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,470
I’m where I am today because of my job.

465
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,870
Mok said your key is in your car.

466
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,100
Okay.

467
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,300
Hurry and go inside.

468
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:50,750
Thank you for today.

469
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:52,650
The food was delicious.

470
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,260
Good night.

471
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,800
Let’s go together again sometime.

472
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,100
Oh, hey.

473
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,200
Tomorrow’s a day off. Are you free?

474
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,550
Why?

475
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,000
There’s somewhere I’d like to take you.

476
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,170
-Hi.
-Hi.

477
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,500
Mr. Thee, this is Mother.

478
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:19,949
She’s the one who raised me.

479
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,770
Come on in.

480
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,980
The kids are just on break.

481
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:29,100
They’ll be so happy to know
you and your friend came to visit them.

482
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,730
Bring your friend inside.

483
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:33,199
Let’s go inside.

484
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:42,810
BAN KLAMAI PLAYGROUND

485
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,250
Marn has already moved out?

486
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:48,860
Yes.

487
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,139
For about two weeks now.

488
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:54,980
How’s Mork?

489
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,420
As you can see.

490
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,800
The last time I saw him smile was
when he watched his sister get in the car.

491
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,540
Since then, I’ve barely heard his voice.

492
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,330
This is my friend Thee.

493
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,150
Hi, Thee.

494
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:20,400
How are you?

495
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:22,700
I miss my little sister.

496
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:33,300
Once Marn gets settled in,
she’ll probably reach out.

497
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:37,100
I’ve been waiting for her
to call me every day.

498
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,010
I understand you, Mork.

499
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:51,050
I really do.

500
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,800
She’s happy there.

501
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,000
She has a home and a room of her own.

502
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,000
She has parents now.

503
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:04,210
Honestly, I’m really happy for her.

504
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:07,840
But I just miss her.

505
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,900
Kids, it’s time to eat!

506
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,000
Do you want to eat with us, Peach?

507
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:35,200
You too, Thee.

508
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:38,610
You go ahead.

509
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:39,650
I’ll join you in a bit.

510
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:40,500
Seeing Mork reminds me of
myself in the past.

511
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,650
I’m sorry for catching you off guard.

512
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,470
All the kids here…

513
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,600
They don’t have families?

514
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,380
Some are orphans.

515
00:37:56,050 --> 00:38:00,400
Some had families.

516
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,450
Like me.

517
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:03,750
What do you mean?

518
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:12,050
(Plub and I were sent here
because our family was abusive.)

519
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,700
(Our stepfather hurt us,)

520
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:17,100
(and our mom couldn’t do anything.)

521
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,050
Peach.

522
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,600
Don’t be afraid.

523
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,340
I’ll take care of you, Lookplub.

524
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:24,980
Hi, sweeties.

525
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:27,100
What are your names?

526
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,300
I’m Lookpeach.

527
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,500
My sister is Lookplub.

528
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,200
You’ve both been through a lot.

529
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,700
From now on, let me take care of you.

530
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,800
You used to be afraid of me.

531
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,800
Is this part of the reason?

532
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:57,300
I’d never hurt you.

533
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,700
I promise.

534
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,500
I believe you.

535
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:03,500
That’s why I brought you here.

536
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:08,050
Are you okay?

537
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,500
I started working when I was 18,

538
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:22,570
so that one day, when Plub was old enough,

539
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:24,550
I could take her to live with me.

540
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:30,370
Back then, she had to keep herself hidden,

541
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:34,100
hoping no one would take a liking to her
and adopt her,

542
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:40,170
because I wasn’t qualified
to take her out yet.

543
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,050
But in the end, we got to live together.

544
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:50,870
I think that’s why I love being
a photographer.

545
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:58,560
This is my real life.

546
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,050
How do you feel after hearing that?

547
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,120
Are you tired?

548
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,250
You’ve done really well getting this far.

549
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:49,600
From now on, you won’t have to
struggle like that anymore,

550
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,900
because I’ll take care of you
and your sister.

551
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,450
TWISTKO

552
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:49,300
This is yummy.

553
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,240
I’m going to crush you to pieces!

554
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,670
Where are you going?

555
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,490
Where do you think you’re going?

556
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,300
This has been a really tiring day off.

557
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,100
You were the kids’ favorite, though.

558
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,550
Let’s go there together again.

559
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,700
Let’s go often.

560
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:54,900
Can I ask you something?

561
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,600
How did you feel being there today?

562
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:13,050
I’m grateful you introduced me
to your home.

563
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:14,600
That’s all?

564
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:26,450
Actually, something’s been
weighing on my mind.

565
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:28,300
What is it?

566
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,100
Who do I ask for your hand in marriage?

567
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:40,760
Hey.

568
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:42,100
I’m serious.

569
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,800
Can I ask your Mother?

570
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:46,650
Or…

571
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:48,950
Do I have to ask your sister?

572
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:50,860
Mr. Thee.

573
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,500
What’s been stressing you out all day?

574
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:02,100
Are you afraid...

575
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:05,100
I’d mind that you grew up there?

576
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:14,950
I don’t want to think that way,

577
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:17,470
but I can’t help it.

578
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:23,800
Knowing this makes me love you even more.

579
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:45,300
It’s late. You should go.

580
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,500
Can I…

581
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:53,700
stay here tonight?

582
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:56,900
Please?

583
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:07,050
But this place doesn’t have a bathtub,

584
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:09,800
or butlers, or anything like that.

585
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:12,500
Just having you is enough.

586
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:35,100
What do you think of my in-between outfit?

587
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:36,340
Is it comfortable to wear?

588
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:37,950
It’s not bad.

589
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,200
-Mr. Thee.
-Peach.

590
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:49,820
You go first.

591
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,620
Thank you so much for today.

592
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,420
I really like who you are today.

593
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:05,100
I really like who I am today too.

594
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,300
And I like you a lot.

595
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:27,700
This is the first time
I’m looking at your face this closely.

596
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:32,900
Your eyes are beautiful.

597
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:39,500
Beautiful?

598
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:44,100
I’ve only ever been told they look scary.

599
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:45,700
No, they’re charming.

600
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:52,130
They’re yours.

601
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:02,700
This is yours too.

602
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:05,150
Mr. Thee.

603
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:07,400
Peach.

604
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:13,500
How about we try dating?

605
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,400
What did you say?

606
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,550
I might be pretty busy with work,

607
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,450
but I promise I’ll take good care of you.

608
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,900
Whatever you want to do,
wherever you want to go, just tell me.

609
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:29,800
I’ll make it happen.

610
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,100
If you like working,
I won’t get in your way.

611
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:36,900
I’ll let you live your life.

612
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,350
And don’t worry.

613
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:42,900
ARSENI won’t complicate your life.

614
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:48,370
The world I’m about to build

615
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,450
will be just the two of us.

616
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:01,460
Talk about a hard sell, huh?

617
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:04,200
We haven’t reached
the most important part.

618
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:07,600
If you’re with me,

619
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:17,800
I swear I’ll love, take care of,
and protect you and your sister for life.

620
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,290
How long will this honeymoon phase last?

621
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:26,670
For as long as I breathe.

622
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:36,400
Intimidating?

623
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:40,750
Nah.

624
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:43,900
Hungry?

625
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:58,890
I’m hungry.

626
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:18,500
This is Mr. Touch.

627
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,690
He’s my boss.

628
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:21,700
Nice to finally meet you,
Mr. Peachayarat.

629
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,100
I have one more thing to tell you.

630
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:26,000
The Shohei family is no different from
my father’s Lee family.

631
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:27,170
Mr. Touch is a mafia boss too?

632
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:27,900
Hey!

633
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:29,650
I know now why love is dangerous.

634
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,200
I was never afraid of dying

635
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:32,330
until I fell in love with Peach.

636
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:33,300
Do you have any problem with this?

637
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:36,100
The problem is I’m stuck on you.

638
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:38,180
Don’t forget that
others still don’t know about us.

639
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:40,420
Peach!
