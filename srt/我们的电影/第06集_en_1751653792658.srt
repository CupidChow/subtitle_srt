00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:30,948
OUR MOVIE

2
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,241
ANY RESEMBLANCE
TO ACTUAL PEOPLE, PLACES,

3
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:33,450
OR MEDICAL CONDITIONS
IS COINCIDENTAL.

4
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:34,660
CHILD ACTORS
WERE ALWAYS SUPERVISED

5
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:35,953
AND FILMED
UNDER OFFICIAL GUIDELINES.

6
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:39,915
5 YEARS AGO

7
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,252
How was your audition?

8
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:46,838
I didn't go.

9
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:49,883
Next time.

10
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:53,428
I want to go when I'm more prepared.

11
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:57,057
You act a little weird sometimes.

12
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,852
I like that about you.

13
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,610
I really wanted to say this today.

14
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,195
What if…

15
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,323
we tried dating?

16
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,703
Sorry, that was out of the blue.

17
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:19,288
But still…

18
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,749
I just had to say it today.

19
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,335
Thank you.

20
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,420
Okay.

21
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:28,797
Huh?

22
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,091
Thank you for saying that.

23
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:32,593
Right.

24
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,137
But why today of all days?

25
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,764
Sorry.

26
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,683
I guess I was clueless. I didn't know--

27
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,727
It's not about you, it's me.

28
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,146
I just don't have any space left in me.

29
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,773
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,525
What do you mean?

31
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:56,825
Well…

32
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:58,493
take care.

33
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,208
That's a bit harsh, Daeum.

34
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,002
What, like you'll never see me again?

35
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,545
How dramatic.

36
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,215
I'll take care of myself too.

37
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:25,896
<i>Me, of all people?</i>

38
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:27,898
<i>What was I planning?</i>

39
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,361
<i>When I can't even do anything…</i>

40
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:34,696
<i>When I'm going to die soon…</i>

41
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,075
<i>Who says you can't do anything?</i>

42
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,329
I told you,
you're someone who can do everything.

43
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,581
<i>Me, of all people?</i>

44
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,084
<i>Confessing my feelings…</i>

45
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,378
<i>when I'm going to die soon?</i>

46
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,839
Is it weird if I like you?

47
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,758
<i>You lunatic.</i>

48
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,138
<i>Of course, it's weird.</i>

49
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,855
I CAN GET HEALTHY IN A WEEK TOO

50
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:15,987
Talk about timing.

51
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,118
I guess I really am weird.

52
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:26,498
EPISODE 6

53
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,765
It's not weird.

54
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,936
You're not weird at all.

55
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:51,940
So take your time eating.

56
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,179
Go on ahead.
Pick up the key at the front desk.

57
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,434
Mr. Lee.

58
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,644
When the alarm went off earlier,

59
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,522
I really wanted to run away.

60
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,232
I didn't want to sit there eating

61
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,359
in front of the guy
I just told my feelings to.

62
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,322
I kept thinking
I wanted to get the hell out of there.

63
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,118
And honestly, you really weren't helping.

64
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,079
You should've just left.

65
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,582
You know I can't run.

66
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:53,794
Daeum.

67
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:57,130
Is this all part of your plan too?
Another gutsy move?

68
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,220
I guess this is…

69
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,514
improv?

70
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,023
That mismatch is driving me nuts.

71
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,613
Let me just tie this up before I go.

72
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,128
Can I be honest with you too?

73
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,174
Of course.

74
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,679
I thought,
by the time this film is finished

75
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,138
and shown to the world…

76
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,228
you might already be gone.

77
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,192
And even before that…

78
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,573
I wondered if you might not

79
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,241
make it.

80
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:24,843
That's not weird.

81
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,721
I even thought…

82
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,603
your death might generate publicity…

83
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,858
and ultimately lead
to this film's success.

84
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:47,407
This was my first chance to direct
in 5 years, and I felt completely lost.

85
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,950
Then you showed up…

86
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,163
and it eased my mind
because you were the final piece

87
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,457
that could complete this film.

88
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,219
You can blame me. I'll take it.

89
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,057
But we're collaborators on this movie,

90
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,059
and there's a line we shouldn't cross.

91
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,438
Those fleeting feelings

92
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,316
might actually be good for you right now.

93
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,109
But I…

94
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,157
don't want this film…

95
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,830
to be ruined because of those feelings.

96
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,131
Thank you

97
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,009
for being honest with me.

98
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,695
<i>This disease</i>

99
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,824
is accompanied by intense pain
and seizures at the onset.

100
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:38,495
As time passes,
the frequency of seizures increases,

101
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,622
ultimately leading to death.

102
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:44,167
<i>As you're aware,</i>
<i>there is no known cure at this time.</i>

103
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,465
<i>That's why so far,</i>

104
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,176
stem cell-based clinical studies

105
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,428
have focused on easing pain

106
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:59,641
and lowering the frequency of seizures.

107
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,121
<i>But sadly,</i>

108
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,248
the recent

109
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,668
continuous failures
of those trials suggest…

110
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,176
that this disease is, in fact…

111
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,382
Sorry I'm late.

112
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,466
No, it's fine.

113
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,012
But you're usually the earliest here.
What happened today?

114
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,723
Don't even get me started.

115
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,808
I went through hell this morning.

116
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,979
That's our first assistant camera,
Lim Hoseob.

117
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,940
I called a taxi at the crack of dawn
to take him to the ER.

118
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,569
We all got wasted drinking together,

119
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,322
but why was he the only one
who fell down the stairs?

120
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,034
That's worrying.

121
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,703
We'll just find a stand-in first AC
for a month.

122
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,997
I'm not worried about that,
I'm worried about him.

123
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,666
In this line of work,
your body is your asset.

124
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,006
He hasn't changed.

125
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,343
Still got that odd yet gentle side.

126
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,767
TERMS OF JEALOUSY

127
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,644
"TERMS OF JEALOUSLY"
NO.1 IN PRE-SALES…

128
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,604
WAS THE SCANDAL
A CRISIS OR OPPORTUNITY?

129
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,406
- Yuhui.
- Yes?

130
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,201
- Let's release two photos of Lee Daeum.
- Got it.

131
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,495
I'll choose them,
so you just send them to the press.

132
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,621
Yes, sir.

133
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:27,705
Oh, as for the reporter…

134
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:30,833
I'll call Noh Huitae.

135
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,085
Okay.

136
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,253
LEE GYUWON: LEE DAEUM

137
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,758
Oh, you're here.
The crew started eating first.

138
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,010
You're full of energy.

139
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,554
The mishap with the camera team…

140
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:44,681
I'm sorry.

141
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,934
Hey, if it's anyone's fault, it's mine.

142
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,978
- I'm sorry, Mr. Lee.
- No, it's all right.

143
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:51,854
Come in and eat.

144
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:58,861
Daeum said she'll eat on her own.

145
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,114
And her manager is probably…

146
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,241
Not going to be up by this afternoon?

147
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,325
I heard you did that.

148
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,077
What? No way.

149
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,454
He was making somaek like crazy
and literally just

150
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,081
passed out, you know.

151
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,126
Hong, you said there was
a university hospital nearby, right?

152
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,712
Can you check how long it takes
to get there by car?

153
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,880
The hospital? Why?

154
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:22,969
Ah, you mean because of that injury?
In case someone else gets hurt?

155
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,887
Yes. Look into it for me.

156
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,973
- Roger that.
- Okay.

157
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,141
Go and eat.

158
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,225
Okay.

159
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:35,940
TIME TO EAT

160
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:53,124
THE MISFIT RESTAURANT

161
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,771
What on earth
were you thinking, Lee Daeum?

162
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,857
Doesn't sound like
a line from our movie.

163
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,290
Mr. Lee, did you sleep well?

164
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,918
I slept a lot better
than I thought I would.

165
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,544
Feels so refreshing.

166
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,305
So…

167
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,350
are the spots
from yesterday all confirmed?

168
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,435
I'm guessing the bookstore is.

169
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,896
The nursing home probably is too.

170
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,189
Is that enough for your meal?

171
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,528
I just like bread.

172
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,784
Let's go get something to eat.

173
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,265
Eat up. Enjoy.

174
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,269
Thank you.

175
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,480
Enjoy your meal too.

176
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:40,565
Okay.

177
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,610
Mr. Lee!

178
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,988
An article just dropped.

179
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,740
An article about what?

180
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,206
LEE JEHA'S NEW FILM
"LOVE IN WHITE"

181
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,666
CASTS 1-IN-1,000 ROOKIE
LEE DAEUM

182
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:01,794
Daeum,

183
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,214
are you ready for this?

184
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,591
Pardon?

185
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,010
You both look good in the pictures.

186
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:14,098
Still, they could've chosen
a better profile photo for you.

187
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:18,144
Time to say goodbye
to your quiet life, Daeum.

188
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,067
Excuse me.

189
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,202
- It'll be all right.
- Okay.

190
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,210
Hey.

191
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,544
What did you do?

192
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,963
<i>Man, I was so busy</i>
<i>that I couldn't make it there.</i>

193
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,298
Everything's fine, right?

194
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,259
I said, what the hell is this?

195
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,514
Why drop an article like that
out of nowhere?

196
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,391
<i>Oh, you saw that?</i>

197
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,437
Hang on, I'll call you later
when I can head down there.

198
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,023
Forget it. I'm heading up now.
Let's talk in person.

199
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,870
- Good shot.
- Nice.

200
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,748
It looked like the studio
leaked the info on purpose.

201
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,084
The photos turned out too pretty
for a rehearsal.

202
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,419
Isn't she the kind of face
film directors love?

203
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,380
How should I put it?

204
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,423
Yes, she's got that vibe.

205
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,719
She doesn't even have an agency.
Just a single manager glued to her 24-7.

206
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,179
Word is, the director hired him.

207
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,474
Nice shot!

208
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,684
Nice shot!

209
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:44,647
Oh, isn't Seoyoung in that movie too?

210
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,066
Ms. Go, you must've seen this rookie.

211
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,944
I've only said hello to her
a couple of times.

212
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,362
Never seen her properly.

213
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:03,457
Oh, my.

214
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:06,794
Drat.

215
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,303
Daeum!

216
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,305
Daeum?

217
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,516
We're about to leave,

218
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,310
but you don't have a ride.

219
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:25,104
Oh, my manager's going to pick me up.

220
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,982
Uh, he's still not sober, I think.

221
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:30,318
Sorry?

222
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:33,362
Still drunk.

223
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,157
Daeum.

224
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,619
You can ride along with me.

225
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,706
- Pardon?
- You can ride along with me.

226
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,460
Okay.

227
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,422
Is there another ride?

228
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,049
Is there another ride?

229
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,051
Hmm?

230
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,389
You can go.

231
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:02,933
I'll see you later.

232
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:07,938
Let's go.

233
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,374
You'll be more comfortable
taking your meds in my car.

234
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,088
Clever of you, Mr. Lee.

235
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,384
Things are about to get noisy.

236
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,721
The article.

237
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,682
Don't worry about that.

238
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,767
I'll handle it like last time.

239
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,978
If word gets around that a rookie

240
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,774
is turning down
everyone in the industry left and right,

241
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,234
it'll just add fuel to the fire.

242
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,403
Mmm.

243
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,905
Oh, then I'll just say this.

244
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:01,325
That I'm just waiting to see
how this first movie goes

245
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,828
to jack up my value as much as I can

246
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,121
and take my pick of meetings.

247
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,831
That way, people will think,

248
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,875
"She's going to be trouble
if we sign her too fast."

249
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,169
Sounds good, right?

250
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,555
I'm feeling really sleepy
all of a sudden.

251
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,683
Let me nap for a bit.

252
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,435
Wake me up when we get there.

253
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:41,240
Because I'm not someone who exists
to act the way you want or predict.

254
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,701
That's something you should expect
from someone who loves you.

255
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:44,785
Not me.

256
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:50,666
MINHEE: JAEIN IS
IN MS. GO'S OFFICE RIGHT NOW

257
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,298
Go ahead.

258
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,134
So, what's this about?

259
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:04,305
I heard a lot about you from Seoyoung.
She says you're very close.

260
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,973
Ah.

261
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,349
Yes, we are.

262
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:10,603
I'm so excited
to be working with her on this movie.

263
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,730
I've heard a lot about you, too, Ms. Go.

264
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:25,951
I hear there's someone else you know
in <i>Love in White</i>.

265
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,995
Yes, there is. Lee Daeum.

266
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,789
Are you two friends?

267
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:32,875
Not exactly, but we know each other well.

268
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,084
Oh.

269
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:38,714
I'm very interested in Daeum,

270
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,341
so I wanted some information.

271
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:42,927
Are you saying

272
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:46,639
you asked to meet me
just to ask about Daeum?

273
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,015
Yes, that's right.

274
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:49,934
Why me, though?

275
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:53,354
That Daeum is
a tough one to get through to.

276
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:57,775
I thought it might help to get some info
before trying to approach her again.

277
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,486
You went to college together, no?

278
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:02,530
We did.

279
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:08,494
Hi.

280
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,664
GPA: 2.5, GRADE: B-

281
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,335
What about you, Daeum?

282
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,257
GPA: 4.5, GRADE: A+

283
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,591
An A+, huh?

284
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,264
Well, Daeum did carry the whole thing.

285
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,099
Of course, she got an A+.

286
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,602
You didn't even come to rehearsals
because of your shoot.

287
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,521
<i>But…</i>

288
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,524
she disappeared after just one semester
without telling anyone.

289
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,610
She made a real impact
in that one semester, though.

290
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,904
She got a reputation
for being a good actress.

291
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,615
The professors liked her,

292
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:48,993
and her classmates and upperclassmen

293
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,411
all liked her too.

294
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,620
Mmm.

295
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,164
A social butterfly, so to speak?

296
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:56,166
All the more interesting…

297
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,879
…someone like that having a long absence
and no background info. Isn't it?

298
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:01,881
Actually,

299
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,924
I saw something else in her.

300
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,718
Mmm. You did?

301
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:07,428
You're curious, right?

302
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:14,226
If you figure that out, I think
you might be able to get through to her.

303
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,312
Mmm. So let me hear it.

304
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,856
I think I'll stop here for today.

305
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,400
I know you very well, Ms. Go.

306
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,944
I think we're cut from the same cloth.

307
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,487
The same cloth?

308
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,282
Is there anything
you want to know about me?

309
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:35,873
Goodbye…

310
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:42,963
I'm not sure.

311
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,383
I've never really thought
about bringing you in.

312
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,011
I'm not even curious about you.

313
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:53,724
I'm looking for a lead actress
with real appeal.

314
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:54,892
Like Lee Daeum.

315
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,567
<i>They definitely started off</i>
<i>talking about Daeum,</i>

316
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:06,654
<i>but I can't figure out</i>
<i>what the context was.</i>

317
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,280
Hmm.

318
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:11,700
Jaein looked totally rattled
when she left.

319
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:14,620
Thanks for telling me, Minhee.

320
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,665
But also…

321
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,042
Yes, Ms. Chae?

322
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,169
You're getting better at this.

323
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,630
I'll keep…

324
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:25,798
I'll keep working hard.

325
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,557
Come in.

326
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:57,246
Dr. Lee, I never got
to properly say hello last time.

327
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:00,416
Right.

328
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,463
Well, then…

329
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,966
How have you been?

330
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,053
Just trying to survive.

331
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:15,014
That's all.

332
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,598
Sure.

333
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,811
What brings you to the hospital?

334
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,271
Are you unwell?

335
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:25,399
You know she only ever relied on you
while she was alive.

336
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:27,651
So I just came to see you.

337
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,320
And there's something

338
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,948
I really wanted to say to you.

339
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,411
Dr. Lee…

340
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,040
I have not been well.

341
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,088
Go on in.

342
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:49,298
If anything happens…

343
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,466
I'll call you right away.

344
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,594
From now on,
I'll get updates through Junbyung.

345
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:54,970
Reach out to him instead.

346
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:56,597
Okay.

347
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,224
Thank you.

348
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,477
Bye.

349
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,827
That was harsh, Lee Jeha.

350
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,372
Had to open your big mouth, huh?

351
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,166
What kind of an answer…

352
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,418
Lee Daeum, you idiot.

353
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:27,503
Come on.

354
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,930
Okay,

355
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,890
then let's start with the kiss.

356
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,600
Whether it's a kiss or confession,

357
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,977
how the other person acts afterwards
says everything.

358
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,687
But…

359
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,148
the things that he supposedly said

360
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,025
just make it confusing.

361
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,194
I heard he didn't seem to hate it,

362
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,863
but drew a clear line
when it came to the confession.

363
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,490
How do you know this person?

364
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:58,534
From the crew?

365
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,994
Yes, it's a crew member.

366
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:05,207
What are they doing at work?
I'm jealous.

367
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,751
Hey, this is a serious situation here.

368
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:09,002
Can you focus?

369
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,673
So, apparently the one
who kissed and confessed first

370
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,007
isn't usually like that.

371
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:16,051
She's usually very rational and--

372
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:19,388
Hey, who kisses and confesses
based on rational thinking?

373
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,224
Oh.

374
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,271
Does that mean she really likes him?

375
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,147
Is that why she felt hurt?

376
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,274
She felt hurt?

377
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:31,859
Yeah.

378
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:33,819
Hurt to the point of tears.

379
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,821
Hang on.

380
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,198
Do you have someone there?

381
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:39,741
What?

382
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,160
Look in the mirror.
You look very hurt right now.

383
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:45,080
Hey, I told you it wasn't me.

384
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,541
How can someone like me like someone?

385
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:50,752
Listen to me, Daeum.

386
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,506
Everyone dies.

387
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,009
Before that, we get old.
Before that, we're young.

388
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,177
We screw up, we cause trouble,

389
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,179
fall for random people,
kiss them, regret it.

390
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,016
That's what we do.

391
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,604
Where's that fearless,
nothing-to-lose Daeum

392
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:09,813
I used to know?

393
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,358
Hey! I told you it's not me.

394
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,237
Hmm?

395
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,991
NAM JAEIN

396
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,410
LEE GYUWON: LEE DAEUM
KIM HYUNSANG: KIM JUNGWOO

397
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,538
"A thousand to one"?

398
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,544
That was a great headline you wrote.

399
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:33,837
Yes, an exclusive…

400
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:35,964
Okay.

401
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,258
I'll arrange a meeting later.

402
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,135
Okay.

403
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:53,398
Hey, I wanted to trust you and wait, too,

404
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,193
but the whole mystery thing?

405
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,694
That's not the trend anymore.

406
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,112
She's our star.

407
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:00,238
She needs to be seen.

408
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,282
This is going to stir things up.

409
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,867
It won't stop with Ms. Go.

410
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:05,494
Everyone will start chasing after Daeum,

411
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,828
and if we keep declining…

412
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,750
they might start dragging her name
through the mud.

413
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,085
Yeah, that's nothing new.

414
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:17,422
You've been making a big deal
out of small things lately, you know?

415
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:21,385
And why would a director
even worry about that?

416
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,220
That's not your responsibility.

417
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,723
I want to push back all promo and exposure
until we finish filming.

418
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:30,060
And cancel the photo shoot
we talked about last time too.

419
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,144
Hey, Jeha.

420
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,522
Now you're really pushing your luck.

421
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:38,151
What, did I plaster Daeum's personal info
in the middle of downtown?

422
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:40,028
All I did was post one rehearsal photo!

423
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,949
And another photo with you, yeah.

424
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,829
I said this kind of promo isn't necessary.

425
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:51,039
You'll get everything you need later--

426
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,666
Get what?

427
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,294
Just let me do my job. I need to focus.

428
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,422
Let me just make this film, okay?

429
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,722
I'm not going to let this movie ruin me.

430
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,765
I'm not going to ruin this movie either.

431
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:14,896
I'm probably more desperate than you are
for this film to succeed.

432
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,194
Thanks, Gyo.

433
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:22,738
- That's yours, Daeum.
- Looks tasty.

434
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,406
I was hoping it'd just be the two of us.

435
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,828
Oh, I didn't know. Sorry.

436
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,831
No need to be sorry, though.

437
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,083
I'm leaving anyway.

438
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,045
See? I got it to go.

439
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:39,921
You two are still inseparable, huh?

440
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:43,341
Does that mean you lied, Gyoyeong?

441
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:46,094
What are you talking about?

442
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,513
When Daeum disappeared.

443
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:50,682
You said you didn't know where she was.

444
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,350
That's what people told me.

445
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,062
Gyoyeong didn't know back then either.

446
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,856
I just took a leave
without telling anyone.

447
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,360
Why are you all salty and nosy about it?

448
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,572
It's not you I'm salty or nosy about,
so stay out of it.

449
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:07,157
Wow.

450
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,869
Wow, that attitude.
It's gotten even worse.

451
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,165
I'm here to talk about the film.
Are you going to stay for that?

452
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:17,793
Ever heard of taking a hint?

453
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:32,974
I'll be out front taking a walk.

454
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,268
Call me when you're done.

455
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:36,436
Okay.

456
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:01,461
How have you been?

457
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:06,007
When I saw you at the table read,

458
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,051
I was so shocked I nearly fainted.

459
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,471
You've only ever done
a few bit parts, right?

460
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,141
Yes, that's right.

461
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,309
There are tons of great actresses.

462
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:18,645
So why you, of all people?

463
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,481
Did you get the role yourself,

464
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:23,942
or did someone hand it to you?

465
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,737
Just wondering if there was another route
besides the audition.

466
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,909
If I told you,
would you try to do the same?

467
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:39,082
It's actually a top secret of mine
that I keep for auditions.

468
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,464
I acted like my life depended on it.

469
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,801
I truly believed I was the only one

470
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:53,555
who could make this character feel real.

471
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,099
That's all.

472
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,893
Like your life depended on it?

473
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,062
Wow.

474
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,399
You haven't changed at all.

475
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,360
That phony act
will come back to bite you one day.

476
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:09,988
Jaein,

477
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,617
I was really excited to see you again,

478
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,951
but maybe that was just me.

479
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,705
But honestly,

480
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:22,542
I've never done anything to offend
or wrong you in any way.

481
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:26,129
So I hope
this kind of rudeness ends today.

482
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:27,714
If you do this again--

483
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,174
Who are you to decide that?

484
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:35,972
Nice pictures, by the way.

485
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:49,778
What?

486
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,281
I have something to say.

487
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,327
Are you her loyal little servant?

488
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,590
Please…

489
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,468
be good to Daeum.

490
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:16,054
Who are you to ask me that?

491
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,306
Her friend.

492
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:22,435
Jaein,

493
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,020
you've got a lot of experience

494
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:25,689
and know a lot of people.

495
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:29,109
So please help Daeum

496
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:30,902
settle in okay.

497
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,321
I don't know what
you're doing with your life,

498
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:35,865
but worry about yourself.

499
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,828
Daeum's the lead,
and I'm just playing her friend.

500
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,579
Who's supposed to be helping who?

501
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,212
<i>Hey, for the makeup test,</i>
<i>what exactly am I doing?</i>

502
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:51,214
It's just what it sounds like.

503
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:53,383
Just get her there and back safely.

504
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,011
Oh, okay.

505
00:34:58,722 --> 00:34:59,723
About Daeum…

506
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,892
Did she say anything?

507
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,562
Say anything? No, not really.

508
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,941
Why don't you call her if you're curious?

509
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:12,027
No, it's not like that.

510
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:13,570
Just…

511
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,990
wondering if she was stressed
about the article.

512
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,326
Yeah, so just call her yourself.

513
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:20,869
It's not like that.

514
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,829
Call her yourself!

515
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,247
I'm hanging up.

516
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:25,415
H-Hello?

517
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,334
What the heck?

518

and the best is all you can do?

525
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,747
That's truly irresponsible of you.

526
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,762
<i>I thought… you might already be gone.</i>

527
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:23,848
I even thought…

528
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,435
your death might generate publicity

529
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:32,357
and ultimately lead
to this film's success.

530
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:35,694
Thank you

531
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,738
for being honest with me.

532
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:57,090
Next is…

533
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:12,188
Dr. Lee?

534
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:13,982
Yeah.

535
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,608
Oh, just eat without me.

536
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,360
I need some rest.

537
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:18,486
Yes, sir.

538
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,238

We're about to begin shooting.

541
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:46,681
As I told you before,

542
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:50,226
Daeum won't be able to handle it.

543
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,482
Daeum is an actress.

544
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,235
One with a sickness.

545
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,780
I know that very well.

546
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:03,490
You do?

547
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,034
Yet you still can't give up on her?

548
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,578
Do you really have to
involve my sick child?

549
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:17,462
While I was searching
for information on Daeum's disease.

550
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:23,092
I kept seeing your name again and again,
on every paper, every article, everywhere.

551
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:27,388
After seeing your name so many times,

552
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:32,310
I finally understand why you said
it was irresponsible of me to just say

553
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:34,729
I'd do my best.

554
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:36,898
So…

555
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,859
I'm going to do my best

556
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:42,070
to take responsibility.

557
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,530
Is that so?

558
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,324
How so?

559
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,910
As Daeum needs to eat more frequently
than others to maintain energy,

560
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,454
I'll make sure that's taken care of.

561
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:56,709
Her shooting and rest schedules will
be entirely built around her treatment.

562
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:58,753
You listen to me, Mr. Lee.

563
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,630
I'm also preparing for the worst.

564
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,091
I know there's a chance

565
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:06,302
she could suddenly
go into a seizure during filming.

566
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,180
So every scene with her

567
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:12,433
will be shot within a 10 km radius

568
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:15,144
of a university hospital.

569
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,399
I spoke with Dr. Kim Minseok…

570
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,822
and he's trying to keep things stable
with preventive medication.

571
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:28,241
But if things…

572
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,453
still go wrong despite that…

573
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,664
If they do?

574
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,750
I'll personally make sure that Daeum…

575
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,587
is pulled from the film.

576
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:46,718
Really?

577
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,219
Then what about your film?

578
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:53,808
Isn't the movie
what's most important to you?

579
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:59,272
Yes. Even if I have to give up this movie…

580
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,153
I'll return Daeum to this hospital.

581
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,629
I just want my daughter to live

582
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:27,258
even if it's for one more hour,
for one more day.

583
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,386
I know that's selfish of me.

584
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,139
But I don't care what condition she's in.

585
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:35,475
As long as she's alive, that's enough.

586
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,110
Daeum got the film approved for production

587
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,155
with this one scene.

588
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:01,459
I won't pretend
I know every part of Daeum's life.

589
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,503
For me…

590
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,674
she's just an actress.

591
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,053
Someone I want to make this film with.

592
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:14,597
A good actress.

593
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:19,644
We'll show you the best we can do
with this film.

594
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:27,443
Loving someone who knows
when they're going to die…

595
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:32,073
it's one of the hardest things.

596
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:35,743
The one left behind
carries that pain forever.

597
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,366
<i>You know where Hyunsang is,</i>
<i>don't you?</i>

598
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,785
<i>Is he very busy in Seoul?</i>

599
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,759
<i>Dr. Lee…</i>

600
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,053
I have not been well.

601
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:44,896
Before her clinical trial,

602
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:48,357
I was so full of hope and excitement.

603
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:52,612
But Minjeong kept staring out the window.

604
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:55,990
Always saying she wanted to go outside.

605
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,660
I asked what she'd even do outside,

606
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,163
and it was nothing special.

607
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:06,459
She said she just wanted to
walk around like everyone else.

608
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:09,128
I didn't even

609
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:11,464
try to listen to her at all.

610
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,474
I only cared about

611
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:24,852
keeping my kid alive one more day.

612
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,980
Looking back, I regret it so much.

613
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:31,984
It was all me being selfish.

614
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:34,570
Ma'am…

615
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:35,655
Dr. Lee.

616
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,658
Let Daeum

617
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:41,869
do what she wants to do.

618
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,958
<i>You still have the chance</i>
<i>to do what's right.</i>

619
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:57,927
Travel time on weekday mornings
is usually two and a half hours.

620
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:01,222
Anyone driving or taking a van
instead of the bus,

621
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,558
please drive safely.

622
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:04,851
Also, we do have

623
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:08,104
full support and permits
from the city during our shoot,

624
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,356
but please don't forget your manners!

625
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,400
Especially you smokers.

626
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,027
If you're not going to
toss your butts properly,

627
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:16,445
just bring your vape.

628
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:18,447
Bring! Your! Vape!

629
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,700
Bring! Your! Vape!

630
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,451
Please make sure of that.

631
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:29,584
Okay, uh,
I know the schedule's been pretty tight.

632
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,128
Thank you for your hard work.
We're really starting soon.

633
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,422
It's only going to get tighter,

634
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:37,300
so let's all take care of ourselves first.

635
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,343
BONE HEALTH SUPPLEMENT

636
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:42,054
We can't have anyone
breaking any bones on set, right?

637
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:44,182
Everyone take one of these before you go.

638
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,812
Now, Director Lee.

639
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:51,063
Say "ah."

640
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:52,148
No, I'm good.

641
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,484
Yeah, it's all about
taking care of ourselves.

642
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:01,574
Ah. Hey, Hong. The other thing.

643
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:02,658
Oh, of course.

644
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:04,285
There's one more announcement.

645
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:07,205
Mr. Bu is treating all of us

646
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:08,915
to dinner tonight!

647
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:16,297
- Bu Seungwon! Bu Seungwon!
- Bu Seungwon! Bu Seungwon!

648
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,299
Let's go,<i> Love in White</i>!

649
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,675
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

650
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:22,261
I booked the place next door for 7 p.m.

651
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:24,305
Wow, bone health and a free dinner?

652
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,932
We're getting spoiled today.

653
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:27,725
Oh, stop.

654
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,353
What about the actors?

655
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:33,272
They'll head over with the makeup crew
once their test is done.

656
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,442
Look toward the front.

657
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:38,277
To the left.

658
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,490
- Okay, great job!
- Thank you.

659
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:43,866
Next, please!

660
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:47,828
That's odd.

661
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:49,830
What is it?

662
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,041
Are you sick?

663
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:54,919
Me? No, I'm not sick.

664
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:57,838
Give me your hand.

665
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,885
Doesn't seem like indigestion.

666
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:04,929
No, it's not.

667
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:09,267
I wasn't there for the test shoot
because I was abroad.

668
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,144
Has your face always been this pale?

669
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,481
My face?

670
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:16,649
I don't think so.

671
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:20,319
You're supposed to get even paler
later in the movie.

672
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:23,155
That's a bit worrying. Mmm.

673
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:35,167
You're nervous, aren't you?

674
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,505
Yes, can you tell?

675
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:43,009
TIME TO EAT

676
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:46,262
Ms. Jo,

677
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:49,557
I got so nervous, I'm starving.

678
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:52,935
Mind if I grab a quick bite
and hit the bathroom?

679
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:54,103
Sure, go ahead.

680
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:58,816
Though I just made you look all fragile.
The snack might ruin that.

681
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:02,236
No, please eat.

682
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:30,931
What kind of pills are these?

683
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:32,141
Diet pills?

684
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:35,061
Just vitamins.
They work better after meals.

685
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:36,896
Who carries vitamins
in this kind of bottle?

686
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:41,484
Look at the bottom.

687
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,527
What?

688
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,279
The bottom. Look at it.

689
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,076
PROP ITEM

690
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:01,420
Totally something
Gyuwon would carry, right?

691
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:05,925
Ah, Gyuwon and Yoona,
if you're ready, we're rolling.

692
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,009
Okay.

693
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:09,053
Let's go.

694
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:38,666
Yes, Mr. Ji.

695
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,585
I'm almost there. See you soon.

696
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,759
You lost a lot of weight, Jungwoo.

697
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:50,594
I lost a lot, yeah. I worked hard.

698
00:48:56,976 --> 00:48:59,311
You must work out a lot.

699
00:48:59,395 --> 00:49:01,147
- Is it good?
- It's delicious.

700
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:07,319
Seungwon, have a drink.

701
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:09,738
What's this?

702
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,165
Attention, everyone!

703
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,459
Are you all enjoying your meal?

704
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:22,668
- Yes!
- Yes!

705
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,420
When I say "<i>Love in White</i>,"

706
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,714
please say "I love you!"

707
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,632
Now, <i>Love in White</i>!

708
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,927
- I love you!
- I love you!

709
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:33,012
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

710
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,639
I love you.

711
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,072
Hey, you're here.

712
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,954
A moment please, everyone!

713
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:03,334
Let me introduce someone real quick.

714
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:07,087
Since our first AC Hoseob
is out for a month with a fractured ankle,

715
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:09,924
we brought in
a total ace from outside to fill in.

716
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,677
Hello, I'm Jeong Eunho.

717
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:16,472
It's a short stint, but I'll do my best.

718
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:29,318
So it's finally starting, Mr. Lee.

719
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:32,821
Yes, I look forward to it.

720
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:35,241
You know, you're a hard one to read.

721
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:36,825
Can't figure out what you're thinking.

722
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:39,495
He's always had a good poker face.

723
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:42,331
Mmm. Of course,
Seoyoung knows this guy very well.

724
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:53,717
I'll be fine. Go ahead and drink.
I can just grab a cab later.

725
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,553
I can't drink
in front of the actress I'm managing.

726
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:56,637
I'm good.

727
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,764
He says this now, but back in Gangwon-do…

728
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:01,684
Why don't you take a drink first, Ms. Yu?

729
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:07,565
So how did the director's friend
end up managing Daeum?

730
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:10,442
I've always wanted to work
on a film set at least once.

731
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,361
Why?

732
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:14,947
Admiration, I guess?

733
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,615
You know, it's romantic.

734
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:19,702
The actors, managers, and crew

735
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:22,079
all coming together for one project.

736
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:27,001
Who knew our dear manager
had a romantic side?

737
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:29,587
Excuse me for a bit.

738
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,005
I need some fresh air.

739
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:32,756
I might as well drink.

740
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:40,806
Oh, there he goes again.

741
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:42,933
Catch you later.

742
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:48,689
It's been a while, Hong.

743
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:55,821
I'm on a diet.

744
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:58,240
I think eating would help more

745
00:51:58,324 --> 00:52:00,200
with your diet than alcohol.

746
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:04,413
If you skip the snacks,
you can drink tons and not gain a pound.

747
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:08,542
What? What's so funny?

748
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:12,504
Ah, our Ms. Jo here
is always full of charm.

749
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:14,715
Ms. Jo, do you have a boyfriend?

750
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,300
Why would I bother with one of those?

751
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:19,178
Wow, so cool.

752
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:21,180
That means we're all single here.

753
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,685
I'm sorry.

754
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:28,270
Back to the point.

755
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:30,356
Sure, love happens.

756
00:52:30,439 --> 00:52:32,566
And then the woman dies.

757
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,526
That's when it got interesting for me.

758
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:35,611
The man

759
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:37,363
is total trash.

760
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,448
Just nonstop trash.

761
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:41,158
But that's real life.

762
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,951
This movie's basically a documentary.

763
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:44,703
It happened to me too.

764
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:49,249
Well, to say that's what
real life and real love is…

765
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:50,501
I don't think I agree.

766
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,587
Yes, our DP here said that famous line.

767
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:56,048
"That's not <i>Love in White</i>,
that's <i>Love in Black</i>."

768
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,426
He's such a romantic.

769
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,095
<i>Love in Black</i>! Nailed it.

770
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,721
It's totally dark.

771
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:05,641
So you're on Team Original Story?

772
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:06,892
Yes, I am.

773
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:08,310
That's a total fantasy.

774
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:11,105
Textbook love.
Nowhere to be seen around us.

775
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:15,693
Just because it's not around you
doesn't mean it's not out there.

776
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,237
Yes, you're too cynical.

777
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,697
He knows she's dying,

778
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,657
but he still loves her so much

779
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,867
that he comes back to her.
That's what's meaningful.

780
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:26,370
T-That's what's romantic, isn't it?

781
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,751
It's way more fun
when the man just uses the woman,

782
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:35,838
never comes back, and ends up in ruins
like a piece of trash.

783
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:38,424
This film's going to be a hit for sure.

784
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:41,176
If people are already debating the ending,

785
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:43,512
that means it's got plenty to chew on.

786
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:45,848
I need to use the restroom.

787
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:47,808
Okay.

788
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,646
The other day, I noticed…

789
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,316
No, never mind.

790
00:53:56,817 --> 00:53:58,444
Come on, don't leave us hanging.

791
00:53:58,527 --> 00:53:59,528
Exactly.

792
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:03,615
There's something…

793
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,119
between Mr. Lee and Daeum, right?

794
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:08,912
- What?
- What?

795
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:11,957
Why?

796
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,041
Did you see something?

797
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,461
Oh, please, you know exactly what I mean.

798
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,797
I'm just saying this
because I'm worried, okay?

799
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:22,634
Mr. Lee's young. Daeum's even younger.
The way the two look at each other…

800
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,557
Lee Jeha? In love?

801
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:31,935
That guy doesn't do love at all.

802
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:35,355
- I'm sorry.
- What's up with this dude?

803
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:37,649
Got a lighter?

804
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,406
I'm all right.

805
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:48,076
You've had a lot to drink.
Are you all right?

806
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,206
Actually, Mr. Ji.

807
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:55,000
I called you out here

808
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,169
because I had something to say.

809
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,171
What is it?

810
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:00,923
On our previous movie shoot,

811
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,675
Dasol, who worked
under me for three years,

812
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:07,471
got caught up
in a messy love triangle on set

813
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:08,805
and ran off.

814
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:11,016
We couldn't find anyone to replace her,

815
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:13,393
and it nearly derailed the whole project.

816
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:15,604
These kids are in their prime.

817
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:18,732
Their careers can't get destroyed
because of stuff like that.

818
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:22,611
Well, I agree that it shouldn't happen,

819
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:25,155
but why are you bringing this up with me?

820
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,449
You're the head of the camera crew.

821
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,163
I mean…

822
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:35,249
Why are you laughing?

823
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:38,043
Come on, Ms. Jo--

824
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,795
This isn't a laughing matter.

825
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:43,215
One wrong move
and the whole shoot could fall apart.

826
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:45,425
This is a really serious issue,

827
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:47,094
and you're laughing?

828
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:50,556
Well, I…

829
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:52,516
Oh, dear.

830
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:56,311
I understand. I'll keep an eye on my crew.

831
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:57,521
Sure. So take this.

832
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:58,647
This!

833
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:01,525
This is what I'm talking about! Stop it!

834
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,443
Your guys must've
learned this stuff from you!

835
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:05,612
Taking care of people in subtle ways!

836
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:06,738
Inside is a few steps away,

837
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:08,949
so why are you
taking your coat off for me here?

838
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:10,826
Well…

839
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:13,245
you seemed cold.

840
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:20,919
- Mr. Ji…
- Yes?

841
00:56:21,003 --> 00:56:22,212
- Gosh, what do I do?
- Huh?

842
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:23,505
Don't look at this.

843
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,048
Is that…

844
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,678
Did it leave a hole?

845
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:32,139
Goodness. It got a spot right there.

846
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:35,058
I'm sorry, Mr. Ji.

847
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:36,143
Oh, well…

848
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,354
this looks quite nice.

849
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,656
<i>We're about to start shooting.</i>

850
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:53,035
If your condition worsens, 70 or 80 people
will have to stop everything.

851
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:10,636
DAD

852
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:16,558
Hey, Dad.

853
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:18,894
Hey.

854
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:19,978
Where are you?

855
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:24,358
I had a makeup test today.

856
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:28,320
And now all the cast and crew
are having dinner together.

857
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,489
Is that so?

858
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:34,660
W-Why did you call?

859
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,872
Come to the hospital when you're free.

860
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:43,001
We need to check you
before the shoot begins.

861
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:47,255
Dad.

862
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,299
<i>Hanging up now.</i>

863
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,566
That's one hell of a sigh.

864
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:11,697
Long time no see, Daeum.

865
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:22,332
It's been a while, Eunho.

866
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:28,505
I didn't know you were still acting.

867
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:30,507
I didn't know.

868
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,343
As well as meeting again like this.

869
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:34,928
I was surprised too.

870
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:36,972
You're on the camera crew?

871
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:40,350
I prefer being behind the camera
rather than in front of it.

872
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,269
Mmm.

873
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:47,357
Honestly,

874
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,527
that article about you really shocked me.

875
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:52,738
You just…

876
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,407
completely disappeared back then.

877
00:58:58,577 --> 00:58:59,578
Could you…

878
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:02,998
tell me now

879
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:05,500
why you had to…

880
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,296
do that back then?

881
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:13,508
Daeum.

882
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,635
There you are.

883
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:18,346
Mr. Lee.

884
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:21,099
Hello, Mr. Lee.

885
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:22,768
I'm Jeong Eunho.

886
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:26,021
Yes, the new camera team member.

887
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:27,105
Yes.

888
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:31,526
You two seem to know each other.

889
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:34,863
We went to college together.

890
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:37,824
I see, you know each other from college.

891
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,994
Can we talk for a bit, Daeum?

892
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,747
- Right now?
- Yes, right now.

893
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:48,877
Sorry, Eunho. Let's talk more later.

894
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,045
Hang on.

895
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:52,506
You changed your number, right?

896
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:56,802
Can you give me that one?

897
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:04,976
Okay. I'll be in touch.

898
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,478
Okay.

899
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:20,283
You two must've been pretty close.

900
01:00:21,493 --> 01:00:24,162
You were laughing and all back there.

901
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:28,708
Doesn't everyone feel close
and sentimental

902
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:30,293
to their first love?

903
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:32,963
First love?

904
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,383
Why are you looking at me like that?
You're embarrassing me.

905
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:42,097
I'm allowed to have
a first love, too, you know.

906
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,891
That guy Jeong Eunho

907
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:47,185
was your first love?

908
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:49,980
Yes.

909
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:53,775
The kind where I couldn't date him
because I decided not to.

910
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:59,072
So he doesn't know
your situation, does he?

911
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:01,157
He doesn't.

912
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:04,661
It's fine to get along with him on set,

913
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:05,996
but you should

914
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:08,665
keep a little distance

915
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:11,293
if you don't want him
to find out about you.

916
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:14,212
Okay.

917
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:18,341
Seoyoung, Jungwoo,

918
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:20,010
Eunho.

919
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:21,636
Also you.

920
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:24,222
And Jaein.

921
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:27,100
I guess my dad counts too.

922
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:30,478
What do you mean?

923
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:33,982
The lines I should keep from crossing.

924
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:37,485
It's a bit sad, though.

925
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:43,450
I know I can't undo
what's already happened.

926
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:47,370
I already said how I feel,
and you heard it.

927
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:51,625
As hard and confusing as it is for me,

928
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,793
I imagine it's hard for you too.

929
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:58,256
I understand what you mean
about not crossing a line.

930
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:00,759
But after that day…

931
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:05,263
…I keep wondering
about all the possibilities like a fool.

932
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:07,515
What if…

933
01:02:08,016 --> 01:02:10,769
What would've happened if I wasn't sick?

934
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:15,440
What if Lee Daeum
was just an ordinary person?

935
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:19,402
Then I would've
just been a bratty daughter,

936
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:23,823
a friendly colleague and close friend,

937
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:28,703
and an actress
to a director who can't help

938
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:30,705
but feel a spark

939
01:02:31,373 --> 01:02:32,415
with each other.

940
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:37,420
All of that could've
come very naturally to me.

941
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:42,092
At least
that wouldn't have been impossible.

942
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:48,640
But right now,

943
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:52,477
I'm not someone
who can step inside that line.

944
01:02:58,942 --> 01:03:01,444
You're not about to cry, are you?

945
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:07,409
I'm not crying.

946
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:09,577
Never in front of Director Lee!

947
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:14,332
You know why?

948
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:16,501
Because I'm picturing you
dancing right now.

949
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:18,878
Like this.

950
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,132
That just dried up my tears!

951
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,763
It feels good, though.

952
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:31,725
Selfishly saying everything I want.

953
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:33,518
I'm sorry.

954
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,896
It seems like the night
made me sentimental tonight.

955
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,916
What are they doing?

956
01:03:58,376 --> 01:03:59,461
Beats me.

957
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,714
They look comfortable together.

958
01:04:04,132 --> 01:04:05,633
I wish they'd be uncomfortable.

959
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:09,095
Just enough to match what I felt.

960
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:21,900
And that concludes
the story of my third marriage.

961
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:26,863
There was a certain sincerity to it,

962
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:29,032
although it had a shady start.

963
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,950
Ah, so…

964
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:33,495
are you happy now?

965
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:34,621
Happy?

966
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:37,082
Well, I'll tell you my next story.

967
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:40,502
This one's about my fourth marriage.

968
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:43,254
Okay! Let's move on.
Anyone else got a fun story?

969
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:44,506
Doesn't have to be fun,

970
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:46,800
just anything to change the mood.

971
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:49,302
Could you…

972
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:53,890
love someone
even if you knew they were dying?

973
01:04:56,643 --> 01:05:00,313
Someone… …who's dying?

974
01:05:01,189 --> 01:05:02,190
Who is this about?

975
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:05,360
<i>Love in White</i>'s original story.

976
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:10,990
Hyunsang falls for Gyuwon
even though he knows she's terminally ill.

977
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:14,160
I wanted to know
if that's realistically possible.

978
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,121
Come on.

979
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:18,331
These days, people practically

980
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:21,376
trade medical records
before they get married and all that.

981
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:22,710
Doesn't seem likely.

982
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:24,796
Right.

983
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:28,133
Hiding it would be a problem
if you're in a relationship.

984
01:05:28,216 --> 01:05:31,136
But falling in love despite knowing it…

985
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:35,598
…yeah, that's tough.

986
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:36,808
It's a tough one.

987
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:38,268
Is that so?

988
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:40,770
What about you, Director Lee?

989
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:48,987
Did you rewrite it as a tragedy because
you don't believe in that kind of love?

990
01:05:58,329 --> 01:05:59,831
Excuse me, I need the restroom.

991
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:09,549
What about Lee Jeha as a person?

992
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:12,594
Could you love someone
knowing how it ends?

993
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:17,765
I'm not sure, but maybe…

994
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:21,853
that's what it takes for it to be love.

995
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:39,871
You weren't ready to hear that, were you?

996
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,089
Ms. Chae.

997
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,137
Spoken like a true romance director.

998
01:06:57,889 --> 01:07:00,350
Or maybe it's something
that you blurted out

999
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:01,976
because you're really in love.

1000
01:07:04,062 --> 01:07:05,188
Is it you that likes her,

1001
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:06,814
or her that likes you?

1002
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,067
What are you talking about?

1003
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:10,860
Are you running out of article ideas?

1004
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:13,363
Okay, then let me ask you this way.

1005
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:16,783
Are you two into each other,

1006
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,077
or are you just slapping

1007
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,829
a clichéd scandal
on top of an already clichéd film?

1008
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:28,836
Is it true?

1009
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,630
That you're dying?

1010
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:33,967
I said, is it true?

1011
01:07:36,261 --> 01:07:37,762
Are you really dying?

1012
01:08:26,728 --> 01:08:28,146
It's the sea!

1013
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:29,689
<i>Do you think I…</i>

1014
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:32,108
<i>No, we can finish this movie?</i>

1015
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:33,484
Mr. Lee!

1016
01:08:33,568 --> 01:08:36,863
<i>I don't know how it'll turn out</i>
<i>or how it'll be remembered either.</i>

1017
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:39,907
This is Noh Huitae from Npatch.

1018
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:41,617
Would you happen to know these people?

1019
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:43,911
They're graduates here.
Starting class of '19.

1020
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:48,916
That's some insanely realistic acting.

1021
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,502
She actually looks like a real patient.

1022
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:56,424
<i>I got the feeling</i>
<i>you didn't know much about this film.</i>

1023
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:02,138
Will you believe what I'm telling you?

1024
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,894
