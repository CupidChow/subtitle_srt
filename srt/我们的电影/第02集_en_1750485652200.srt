Don't move if you want to live.

Sorry…

8
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,050
…but I'm just too tired.

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,100
You'll have to die quickly.

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,560
What the?

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,400
Wasn't I supposed to be the one to faint?

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,150
Gosh, she's driving me nuts.

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,280
Hey, you there.

14
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,370
You're not the one who got shot.

15
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,120
Hang on. Something's not right.

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,580
We should call an ambulance.

17
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,040
Are you all right?

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,210
Yes, we're in Sangam-dong…

<i>It's not like I lived in fear,</i>

20

EPISODE 2

23
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,180
Can you see the ocean?

24
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,810
There's no ocean here.

25
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,400
Oh?

26
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,440
That's strange.

27
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,070
I definitely see an ocean here.

28
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,030
What? Where did you get this thing?

29
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,570
I told you to rest
since you have a lot of tests tomorrow.

30
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,370
It's okay. I'll take her downstairs later.

31
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,250
Wow, the weather is so nice by the sea!

32
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,960
How is it this nice?

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,710
It's a perfect day for a tan.

34
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,340
Ta-da!

35
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,550
Come closer.

36
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,460
Are you in?

37
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,670
Give it to me. I'll do it.

38
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,630
Here, now. Say cheese.

39
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,680
We're on vacation at the beach.

40
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,470
<i>My mom was sick.</i>

41
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,190
<i>Not any normal patient,</i>
<i>but a strange one at that.</i>

42
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,190
It's all right.

43
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,960
It's only us here because of the rain.

44
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,920
I know! It's so fun!

45
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,130
Then do you want to do something
even more fun?

46
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,940
♪ <i>La, la, la, la.</i> ♪

47
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,230
♪ <i>La, la.</i> ♪

48
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,910
Is that the medicine
that makes you feel better?

49
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,910
- That's not medicine.
- What?

50
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,170
It's grape juice.

51
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,500
That's grape juice?

52
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,170
Sure.

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,260
Mom.

54
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,470
Grapes are purple.

55
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,510
And bananas are yellow.

56
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,850
But when they're peeled?

57
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:13,980
Hmm.

58
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,060
White.

59
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,190
That's right.

60
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,980
Grapes are purple,

61
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,530
but they're that color when you peel them.

62
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,030
You're always trying to trick me, Mom.

63
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,830
What, you're too grown
to fall for it anymore?

64
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,710
It's so hard to make my daughter laugh.

65
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,750
It's not funny.

66
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,500
You shouldn't laugh either.

67
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,130
It hurts you when you laugh.

68
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,300
Daeum.

69
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,810
I read somewhere

70
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,270
that the DNA that makes you cry
when you're sad

71
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,610
is the same as the one
that makes you smile

72
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,150
when you're happy.

73
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,450
You have to eat, Mom.

74
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,540
Daeum.

75
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,300
It's going to be okay,

76
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,180
for you

77
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,470
and for Dad.

78
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,830
Dad.

79
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,370
Yes?

80
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,550
What's "genetics"?

81
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,180
Lie down now.

82
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,020
I hoped she'd get
the best of her mom, not this.

83
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,780
<i>My mom still lives inside me,</i>

84
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,950
<i>and that's the one special thing</i>
<i>that only I get to have.</i>

85
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,950
<i>That's how my doctor father</i>
<i>taught eight-year-old me</i>

86
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,830
<i>about genetics.</i>

91
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,340
may it never return.

92
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,550
<i>For a moment,</i>

93
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,430
<i>I felt like I had become Frida Kahlo.</i>

94
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,640
<i>No,</i>

95
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,730
<i>I actually did become Frida Kahlo.</i>

96
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,900
You're awesome, Daeum!

97
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,200
You're the best, Daeum!

98
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,820
<i>In a life too short to live my own story…</i>

99
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,660
Ladies and gentlemen…

100
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,830
<i>…the chance to perform</i>
<i>many different lives</i>

101
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,290
<i>is exactly what I wanted to do.</i>

102
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,210
I'll run with everything I've got!

103
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,960
Great. Good luck. Let's do it!

104
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,170
- Let's do it!
- Yeah!

105
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,300
Don't move if you want to live.

106
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,050
<i>And so…</i>

107
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,810
<i>although I tried hard not to live in fear…</i>

108
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,560
<i>…I've known this was going to happen…</i>

110
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,030
<i>In the end,</i>

111
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,830
<i>I couldn't escape that grape juice either.</i>

112
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,660
Drip.

00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,710

00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,780
<i>and had it by the time I turned 20.</i>

122
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,460
Okay.

123
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,540
One, two, three.

<i>And yet, the thing that keeps me going…</i>

125
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:44,640

What's this, Doc?

145
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,270
Oh, just a movie
I was asked to consult for.

146
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,400
Put it down.

147
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
- Put it down.
- Can I meet him instead?

148
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,730
- Meet him? No. You take this back.
- No thank you.

149
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,490
Why are you being like this?

150
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:23,740
Please, just once.

151
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,320
Once or twice, I don't care.
I told you no!

152
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,780
I'm your consultant,

153
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,620
the terminal patient, Lee Daeum.

154
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,010
Your name,

155
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,800
it means "next"?

156
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,810
Yes.

158
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:58,810
Ah.

GRAPE 100

160
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,740
Oh, grape juice. That's why.

161
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,580
You must really like grapes.

162
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,990
Dr. Kim said I should bring this for you.

163
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,460
Not grapes. Grape juice.

164
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,000
Especially when it's
on a "buy two, get one free" deal.

165
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,420
But someone happened to take it from me.

166
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,090
I actually told you I didn't need it.

167
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,520
Why didn't you say hi in the funeral home?

168
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,690
I wanted to focus on my sadness.

169
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,150
Focus on your… Okay.

170
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,610
Actually,

171
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,780
would you mind if I record this session?

172
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,540
I'd need to listen again
while I'm writing.

173
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,000
Actually,

174
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,920
do you mind if I film this?

175
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,790
It's a little hobby of mine.

176
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,300
All right.

177
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,260
Okay.

178
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,270
I heard from Dr. Kim
that you're very sick.

179
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,780
Do I look sick to you right now?

180
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,410
No.

181
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,700
I feel okay right now,

182
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,710
but when I'm really sick, it shows a lot.

183
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,170
That's why I can't do
everything I want to do.

184
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,260
What is it you want to do?

185
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,840
Adultery.

186
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,130
Premeditated serial murder.

187
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,090
- Sorry?
- I'd like to die sometime.

188
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,680
Maybe even become a ghost.

189
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,270
And then be reborn again.

190
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,980
Why do I have so many things
I want to do?

191
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,610
There is one job
where you can do all of that.

192
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:07,320
Yes, and that is my dream job.

193
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,150
Ah.

194
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,950
So you want to be an actress.

195
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,200
What do you do now?

196
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,620
Now? Well…

197
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,080
not much, as you can see.

198
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:21,460
I don't see a big film career
coming anytime soon,

199
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,000
unless I star in a hospice documentary.

200
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,130
Or if I'm playing a terminal patient.

201
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,550
The film, <i>Love in White</i>…

202
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,930
Well, you've seen it
at Cinema Jongno that time.

203
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,260
Not just that time.

204
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:39,930
It's my favorite movie that I regularly
go back to whenever I need to.

205
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,850
Every time I watch it, I bawl my eyes out.

206
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,190
It's my go-to tearjerker flick.

207
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,110
That's what melodramas are for.

208
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,030
Crying your heart out like that

209
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,660
makes you feel
like you had some epic love.

210
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,580
It's an illusion, I guess.

211
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,620
It tricks you into that illusion.

212
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,250
It's not an illusion.

213
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,540
Falling in love, and sharing that love…

214
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,050
Even if someone leaves
and someone gets left behind,

215
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,050
it'll all be okay

216
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,340
as long as there's love.

217
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,470
Watching that

218
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,720
gives me the strength to go on.

219
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,890
If that kind of love really does exist,

220
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,850
I want to experience it too.

221
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,270
And to do that, I have to stay alive.

222
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,030
So basically, <i>Love in White</i> is my chemo

223
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,740
and my radiation therapy and so on.

224
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,700
Is that really something to cry over?

225
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,910
My eyes are teary just talking about it.

226
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,960
I don't get it at all.

227
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,840
Aren't you leaving?

228
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,890
I'm bored, so I thought I'd walk you back.

229
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,260
- I'm okay.
- I'm okay too.

230
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,720
I said I'm fine.

231
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,810
I said I'm fine too.

232
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,910
If you really don't want to go,
how about a walk with me?

233
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,880
It wasn't even my funeral,

234
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,800
but I found myself taking in every detail.

235
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,930
What kind of face the family was making,

236
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,300
who was grieving.

237
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,810
I took the funeral director's card…

238
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,270
…and I started getting scared right then.

239
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,900
I'm not even dead yet,

240
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,740
but the thought of dying
felt like death itself.

241
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,200
Once you get sick,

242
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,540
your life is completely different
from before your illness.

243
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,210
There's a reason why
they say ignorance is bliss.

244
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,760
Slowly sinking into death,

245
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,600
being suffocated by fear…

246
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,440
You don't know what that is, do you?

247
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,420
I do know that not knowing is bliss.

248
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,310
Can I ask you something too?

249
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,520
Yes, go on.

250
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,400
In your version of <i>Love in White</i>…

251
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,240
does the ending…

252
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,660
stay the same?

253
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:27,910
No.

254
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,330
In the end…

255
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,790
In the end, she'll probably die.

256
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,180
<i>That was the moment I realized…</i>

257
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,820
<i>maybe I can be the star of my own story,</i>

258
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,280
<i>as long as I</i>

259
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,320
<i>cast Lee Jeha into my life.</i>

260
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,410
This voice-over
is hogging too many scenes.

261
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,000
I need to trim it down.

262
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,960
Director Lee?

263
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,210
Yes?

264
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,630
I like it.

265
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,420
- You do?
- Yes.

266
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,720
Especially the scene

267
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,090
where the terminal Gyuwon
stops Hyunsang from dying.

268
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,850
You reversed it from the original.
Why the change?

269
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,260
After meeting terminally ill people,

270
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:33,190
I realized nothing
is as strong as their will to live.

271
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,190
I wanted that to come through.

272
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,780
Seoyoung's hot right now,
so now's the time to take her to Cannes.

273
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,400
This film has a clear purpose,

274
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,030
and it doesn't work at all without her.

275
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,030
Let's talk in person, Ms. Go.

276
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,920
This script better turn out well.

277
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,210
Ms. Go is a bit off.

278
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,500
You read the same draft, right?

279
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:03,760
Wouldn't Seoyoung be
a better Junghwa than Gyuwon?

280
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,140
Though I bet Ms. Go will shut that down.

281
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,390
Let's forget Ms. Go's obsession
with lead roles

282
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:13,140
and say the fairy tale of a superstar
taking a supporting role comes true.

283
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,940
Our main problem? The investors will walk.

284
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,600
They're going to leave us.

285
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:21,650
Then why bother holding auditions
if the role has been cast?

286
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,150
It's all about the optics, man.

287
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,030
An unknown actor lands the lead
after a tough audition?

288
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,660
It's a romantic story. Like <i>La La Land</i>.

289
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,160
Of course, that never happens here
or in Hollywood.

290
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,500
LOVE IN WHITE
AUDITION

291
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,710
Hello, my name is Kang Seoha.

292
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,830
Okay, Seoha.

293
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,630
Go to the last page
of the audition script.

294
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,170
You'll see your sides there.

295
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,460
"Hyunsang."

296
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,010
"Hyunsang!"

297
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,510
"There is no such right!"

298
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,220
"You've got to try living,
even if it kills you."

299
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,850
"Only then"…

300
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,600
"Only then your tomorrow will come."

301
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,690
"Do as I say

302
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,110
for just one month."

303
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,940
"If you still want to die after that,

304
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,320
then go ahead. Do whatever you want."

305
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,410
Okay, thank you.

306
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,410
My brain is about to shut down.

307
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,040
How many do we have left?

308
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,700
The next one is our last one today.

309
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,080
Hey, even her name means "next."

310
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,790
LEE DAEUM, 25 YEARS OLD

311
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,590
Yes, come in.

312
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,680
Hello!

313
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,100
My name is Lee Daeum, and I'm an actress.

314
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,240
What's that camcorder for?

315
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,910
Could I just point it at me
and keep it on?

316
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,580
You can't for security reasons.

317
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,040
Okay.

318
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,170
That darn camcorder.

319
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,760
Do you know her?

320
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,060
Do you know Director Lee?

321
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,770
No, I've never met him.

322
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,230
Nice to meet you, Director.

323
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,150
I'm not looking to cast
for a documentary film.

324
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,030
Yes, I know that very well.

325
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:35,580
I'm just desperate
to take on this terminal patient role.

326
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,250
Shall we start with the sides?

327
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,750
"Ms. Gyuwon,

328
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,960
just calm down."

329
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,840
"It wasn't even my funeral,

330
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,970
but I found myself
taking in every detail."

331
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,970
"I wanted my funeral to be different."

332
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,140
"So I took the funeral director's card"…

333
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,140
That's enough for that.

334
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,770
Let's go to the last page.

335
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,270
Read the part where Gyuwon
stops Hyunsang's suicide.

336
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,460
"Hyunsang."

337
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,090
"I won't…"

338
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,930
"I won't say a single word."

339
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,300
"Just…"

340
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,930
"Just stay for a moment."

341
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,190
Okay, that's great.

342
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:50,940
I like your reinterpretation of the lines.

343
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,910
Yes, well, I think that's enough.

344
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,200
You can leave now.

345
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,080
Thank you!

346
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,340
She's incredible.

347
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,130
She wasn't forcing it. Just pure feeling.

348
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:20,350
Shame the role is already cast, no?

349
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,530
Director Lee,
is there anything left to discuss?

350
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,860
The perfect lead just came to us.

351
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,430
<i>Doors are opening.</i>

352
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,270
Mr. Bu!

353
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:10,690
What's all this?
I told you to just come hang out!

354
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,900
You must be exhausted from the auditions.

355
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,730
Thought you might be hungry.

356
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,150
- What's this?
- Oh, wow! What is it?

357
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,610
A handwritten letter?

358
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,740
I know we've only just met,

359
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:27,080
but you're just as praiseworthy
as they say you are.

360
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,000
Can you tell the whole world that?

361
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:31,960
Jungwoo.

362
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,420
Thank you so much for doing this with me.

363
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,300
Don't even say that.
We go way back since <i>The Lonely People</i>.

364
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,390
He's so loyal, isn't he?

365
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,150
WAIT THERE FOR A MINUTE

366
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,500
<i>I want to live.</i>

367
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,710
<i>I want to live right now.</i>

368
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,800
<i>I want to live right now.</i>

369
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,850
Are you a patient or an actress?

370
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,810
I'm just Lee Daeum.

371
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,020
Why did you come here?
What were you thinking?

372
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,530
Are you serious about this?

373
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,200
Yes, I'm very serious.

374
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,280
You said that you were dying.

375
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,740
You said you only have a year left.

376
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:59,170
This is a film, not a hospice documentary.
And it's an audition.

377
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,420
You knew all that when you came in, right?

378
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,510
Yes.

379
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:06,050
You debuted with <i>The Lonely People</i>.
You've won a lot of awards.

380
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,350
You're obsessed with realism.

381
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,270
Infamous for having
a difficult personality.

382
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,100
Was involved in a scandal.

383
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:14,600
More famous as Lee Duyoung's son
than for your own work.

384
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,480
I looked it all up online.

385
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,610
Honestly, I didn't have to prepare much
in terms of acting.

386
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:22,950
I am that character.

387
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,450
What if you die?

388
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,410
What if you die during production?

389
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Who'll die?

390
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,340
You.

391
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,560
Guess I was also desperate,
showing up here.

392
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,640
I'm sorry.

393
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,060
Let's pretend the audition didn't happen.

394
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,100
Wait!

395
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:59,730
Let's look at this
from a broader perspective.

396
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,070
What if I die during filming?
It'll go viral.

397
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,410
A terminal patient
playing a terminal role?

398
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,200
Even I'd want to watch that.

399
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,700
That's a big win for the investors.
Big win for you too.

400
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,370
Yeah. As long as I'm okay with it,

401
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,910
you or anyone involved
shouldn't have a problem, no?

402
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,500
How is it not a problem?
This is your life on the line.

403
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,250
Yes, and I'm fine with it.

404
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:23,420
I want to do this. Even if I die.

405
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,260
That's reckless and also selfish.

406
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:30,760
Not true. The film becomes a hit,

407
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,390
I get to have closure before I die,

408
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,560
and you'd make a comeback,

409
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,560
ride the success train to eternity.

410
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:40,400
Wow, look at that. Everyone wins, right?

411
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,190
It's also a bit…

412
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,490
bittersweet, I guess.

413
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,870
I don't know how you're so confident.

414
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,620
I get that you're sick,

415
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,960
but this is where I draw the line.

416
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,050
Find another way to get closure.
It can't be my movie, sorry.

417
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,630
I saw your face earlier.

418
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,640
To put it bluntly,
it felt like you totally fell for me.

419
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,260
Okay, I'll give you that.
You were good, but--

420
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:15,770
I can't really run,
so I can't really do action scenes.

421
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:18,730
Actually, even normal, everyday life
would be tough for me.

422
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,980
But this character is a terminal patient.

423
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,530
This is something I can really act well.

424
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:34,290
I want to do it,
even if it costs me everything.

425
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,790
Even if that's your life?

426
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,960
I don't have much time left anyway.

427
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,300
Would you rather die trying
or die full of regret?

428
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,300
If the roles were reversed,

429
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,430
would you answer differently?

430
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,800
So tell me…

431
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,520
How long do you think you have left?

432
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,360
How long do I need to live?

433
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,760
Were there any new scripts that came in?

434
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,600
Well, actually…

435
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,480
I heard Kim Jungin's script
is going around,

436
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,650
but it didn't reach us.

437
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,440
Anything from Lee Jeha?

438
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,570
I'm not sure.

439
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,990
I think I heard
he's doing a <i>Love in White</i> remake,

440
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,910
but it's not going so well.

441
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,620
I guess no one wants me anymore.

442
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,000
What do you mean? You've still got it.

443
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,920
You're the first one who got his script!

444
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,420
I knew it. It must've come to me first.

445
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:14,260
I'm sorry. I knew I should've come to you.

446
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,390
Forget it. What did you tell the studio?

447
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,770
What do you mean,
she's going to Hollywood?

448
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,480
It's what Ms. Go said.

449
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,100
She can't even speak English
and she's working abroad?

450
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,810
- Is it a silent film?
- A Korean character.

451
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,650
Oh, man.

452
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,150
Who's the director?

453
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,740
Damien Chazelle.

454
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,320
What? Cha-what?

455
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,120
Damien Chazelle.

456
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,240
Are you sure?

457
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,330
I couldn't push her

458
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:43,120
to go for Lee Jeha's film
when she's working with Damien Chaz…

459
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:46,330
- <i>The receiver is not available…</i>
- Oh, come on.

460
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,210
What should we do?

461
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:52,050
The investors think both Kim Jungwoo
and Chae Seoyoung have been confirmed.

462
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,180
Don't tell this to Jeha yet,

463
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:57,260
but let's focus more on the male lead
since Jungwoo is the star.

464
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:01,390
I guess the female lead
could be the one we saw at the audition.

465
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,770
That's the worst-case scenario.

466
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,350
Try persuading Seoyoung
right until production begins,

467
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,440
and if she's in, then the rookie is out.

468
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,400
Yes, I'll make it happen.

469
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,280
- What about Ms. Go?
- She can't be in the picture.

470
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,830
We have to get Jeha
to talk directly to Seoyoung.

471
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:19,910
Okay?

472
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:35,510
Something wrong? You seem down.

473
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,890
I just came from the agency,
and now I have to go back.

474
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,010
I guess Ms. Go pulled something again?

475
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,640
Something like that.

476
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,060
I'll tell you when I get back.

477
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,310
Oh, I heard you went to see
the <i>Love in White </i>auditions.

478
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,860
Yes, they made a big thing out of it.

479
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,190
Should I do that too?

480
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:59,450
Why the face?

481
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,080
You wanted to do it with me.

482
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,200
Of course.

483
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,040
Let's just go.

484
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,720
HOW LONG

485
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:23,310
DO I NEED TO LIVE?

486
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,020
<i>Lee Daeum.</i>

487
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,320
<i>Adultery. Premeditated serial murder.</i>

488
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,240
<i>Maybe even become a ghost.</i>

489
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,280
How long do I need to live?

490
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,040
Six months?

491
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,880
A year?

492
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,340
Can you please tell me?

493
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:01,220
Well…

494
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,390
I guess…

495
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,890
Sorry, could you pass me that ball?

496
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,060
Oh, of course.

497
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,880
So how long do I need to live already?

498
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,930
What, you think
you're in <i>Autumn in My Heart</i>?

499
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,480
Here's your Americano.

500
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,890
Yes, thank you.

501
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,490
Mr. Lee.

502
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,240
I heard you want to be a writer.

503
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,910
What do you think is wrong with my script?

504
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,210
You can be straight with me.

505
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:14,880
Well…

506
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,000
Can I be frank then?

507
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,920
I'm not sure why you're doing a remake.

508
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,680
<i>Love in White </i>came out

509
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,260
right in the middle of the '90s
melodrama boom in the industry.

510
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,390
I think that classic sentiment
transcends both time and age.

511
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,690
I've never even been in love,
and even I get giddy.

512
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,270
Go on.

513
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:42,860
The way you've twisted Gyuwon's character
is really fascinating, but…

514
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,110
it feels hollow.

515
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,620
Like something essential is missing.

516
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:51,830
Let me guess. Love?

517
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,120
Of course, it's love.

518
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:57,880
Take away love,
and you lose the foundation

519
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,960
and the reason to remake the film
in the first place.

520
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,800
Oh, one more.

521
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,300
I want to know what Gyuwon wants to do

522
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,300
besides saving Hyunsang.

523
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,510
What were her dreams before she got sick?

524
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,480
It'd be even sadder
if she has a lot she wants to accomplish.

525
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,270
You scared me.

526
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:23,030
What are you doing here?
What about your shoot?

527
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,780
Obviously, I didn't go.

528
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,410
That darn Ms. Park.

529
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,910
Did you read the pitch?

530
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,160
Do I have to read it?

531
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,920
I know the original.

532
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,090
Of course you didn't.

533
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,800
Did you forget that I choose the scripts
that come to me?

534
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,420
Now that's a bit harsh.

535
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,970
We've been doing that all along.

536
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,970
<i>Love in White</i> was just an exception.

537
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,390
I want to do that movie.

538
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,560
You have no good reason to do that

539
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,440
when there are better directors
with better scripts who want you.

540
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,770
Better directors?

541
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,230
Better scripts?

542
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,570
What exactly makes them better?

543
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:04,900
Something worthy
of the actress Chae Seoyoung.

544
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,150
Yes, I'm an actress.

545
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,620
So I need a movie that I want to do.

546
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,490
Let's do that. Next time.

547
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,160
No, this time.

548
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:18,250
There's no good reason?
I want to do it, and that's reason enough.

549
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,670
That's how I work as an actress, Ms. Go.

550
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,340
<i>Once you get sick,</i>

551
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,720
<i>your life is completely different</i>
<i>from before your illness.</i>

552
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,640
<i>There's a reason why</i>
<i>they say ignorance is bliss.</i>

553
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,560
<i>What is it you want to do?</i>

554
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,470
<i>Why do I have so many things I want to do?</i>

555
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:39,560
<i>Yes, and that is my dream job.</i>

556
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,450
LEE DAEUM

557
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,950
THIS IS LEE JEHA

558
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,380
THIS IS LEE JEHA

559
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,550
Hello?

560
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,720
<i>Mr. Lee, this is Ms. Go.</i>
<i>Can I see you tomorrow?</i>

561
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:28,690
You work in places like this?

562
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,410
Yes, I need
some background noise to focus.

563
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,450
That's good.

564
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:36,700
This situation we're in
is getting a lot of noise, so focus.

565
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,750
I don't have any personal feelings
for or against you.

566
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,670
You know that, right?

567
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:46,300
I know what you're talking about,

568
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,550
but the script has…

569
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:50,840
been changed these past few weeks.

570
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,550
Especially the character.

571
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,550
I'm sorry to tell you that these changes

572
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,220
don't make Seoyoung
suitable for the role anymore.

573
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,640
That's good.

574
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,230
I didn't need to come at all.

575
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:09,490
Sorry I can't give her the lead role,
but I want to suggest

576
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,320
the role of Junghwa.

577
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,490
I think…

578
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,280
Seoyoung would want to do it.

579
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,040
Are you kidding?

580
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:22,250
I'm saying this
with my sincerest apologies to you.

581
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,630
Director Lee…

582
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:30,210
have you forgotten everything
or are you just pretending to?

583
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:35,220
You're the one who abandoned Seoyoung.

584
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,300
The nerve.

585
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,310
<i>Mr. Lee,</i>

586
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:44,440
you know how this industry works.
Why are you doing this?

587
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,650
You know if a scandal hits Seoyoung now,

588
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:50,190
it would tank her career
before it even takes off.

589
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,400
Ms. Go.

590
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,360
Why are you leaving me out?

591
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,990
Let me hear it too.

592
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,950
You've got to be kidding me.

593
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:02,830
You've already got four ad deals signed
and over five more lined up.

594
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:07,250
So what's the problem?
It's not like dating him will ruin me.

595
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:08,340
Just acknowledge it.

596
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:10,670
No, stop the press.

597
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,840
Director.

598
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:19,180
Yes, we're friendly.
But we've never crossed the line.

599
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,640
I'd like to apologize if I did anything

600
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,100
to make her think otherwise.

601
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,110
<i>That was the first time</i>

602
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:31,780
<i>that Seoyoung got completely wrecked.</i>

603
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,570
She should've been the one to dump you.

604
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,870
I won't…

605
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:41,620
be fooled by you a second time.

606
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,430
LOVE IN WHITE

607
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:58,390
<i>Love in White</i>.

608
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,930
Do as I say for just one month.

609
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,900
DIRECTOR LEE JEHA

610
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:18,200
THIS IS LEE JEHA. I KNOW
IT'S LATE, BUT CAN WE MEET?

611
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,670
Hey there, little girl.

612
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,000
Want to see something cool?

613
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:56,780
SEAWEED SNACK

614
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,700
That act is a bit too much,
don't you think?

615
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,780
What act?

616
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,870
That's the snack they normally eat

617
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,080
at funeral homes.

618
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:13,880
I tried these there last time

619
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,800
and got totally hooked.

620
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,840
Do you stay at the hospital,
or your own place?

621
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:27,600
I don't give my address to men.

622
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,140
You see me as a man?

623
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,570
Well, you're not a woman.

624
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,570
You're not even offering me those?

625
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,930
Mmm.

626
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,720
How should I put it?

627
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,550
A subtle taste…

628
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:08,560
that really hooks you.

629
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:10,890
A subtle taste that hooks you.

630
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,690
How did you do
that drinking thing earlier?

631
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:20,570
Want me to show you?

632
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,240
No, it's fine.

633
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,320
I wanted to consult…

634
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:30,950
…you…

635
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,250
There's something I wanted to ask you.

636
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:41,470
I failed the audition,
but you still want to consult me?

637
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,520
Go on, ask me anything.

638
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:57,110
Was there something you wanted to do?

639
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:59,400
I told you last time, didn't I?

640
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,570
Adultery, murder, ghost.

641
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:04,200
No, not what you'd do in movies.

642
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:08,080
You know, a normal dream you've had.

643
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:09,830
Dream?

644
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:16,790
I want to tell you
something ambitious, but…

645
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,630
I want to leave something
for the people I love.

646
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,760
Like what?

647
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:31,220
Memories of me they can always bring up.

648
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,690
Ah.

649
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:37,770
So now we're in…

650
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:41,360
the "dream" phase
of that closure you wanted?

651
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:46,030
There's just so much left undone.

652
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:50,450
That kind of regret
makes you go a little too crazy.

653
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,830
There's so much I haven't done,

654
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:55,910
but it's not like I can do it "later."

655
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,250
So that's why you want to be in movies.

656
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:00,250
Because I can do everything in there.

657
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:03,920
The love I never had.
Goodbyes I don't want to say.

658
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:08,970
And I want myself to live free
and go wild like this…

659
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:12,430
in those movies

660
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,140
so people can see that whenever they want.

661
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,730
- Like who?
- My dad.

662
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,110
My mom passed a long time ago,

663
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,530
so if I leave, too,

664
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:26,700
then my dad is really alone.

665
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:32,490
You can consult me, too, if you want.
I'm also alone.

666
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:36,790
Hey, now.

667
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:39,210
This is getting too dark.

668
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:41,080
Let's not talk about my dad, okay?

669
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:43,670
I didn't.
You were the one who brought him up.

670
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:48,130
Hang on.

671
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:14,080
That was the first audition I passed
for a role with a name and lines.

672
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,500
It was just the first round,

673
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,580
but I felt good about the second.

674
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,460
I had prepared so hard…

675
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,460
That's when you first got sick?

676
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,510
The day I was admitted
was the day of the second round.

677
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,390
But I'm pretty realistic
for a terminal patient.

678
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:39,020
I knew I had to live first.

679
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:41,940
So I told myself,

680
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:45,730
"I'll survive and come back
for another audition."

681
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:48,530
So I walked away, swallowing my tears.

682
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,320
Is that so?

683
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,530
Yes, it was so.

684
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,960
That must've been hard.
I know hospital life isn't easy.

685
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,290
Not at all.

686
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:02,870
I was super busy.

687
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:05,290
I kept acting.

688
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,340
I had nothing but time.

689
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:12,380
I mean, sure, it wasn't
in front of those big cameras on set,

690
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,180
but a tiny one the size of my palm,

691
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,310
but I tried
every kind of character I wanted.

692
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,560
You live so hard.

693
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,020
I guess I shouldn't assume things,

694
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,810
since you keep proving me wrong.

695
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,400
Mr. Lee…

696
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:33,570
Knowing your time is running out,

697
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,070
it's a strange kind of rush.

698
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:45,380
Everyone!

699
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:48,630
You think you have a lot of days to live?

700
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:51,590
You think you'll live forever?

701
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:56,050
You think you'll stay healthy

702
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:59,180
until you're 40, 70, 80,

703
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:01,220
and even 100, right?

704
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,640
Who's she shouting at?

705
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:06,560
But life works in mysterious ways!

706
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:09,190
You always forget, don't you?

707
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:12,320
But I never forget!

708
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:16,240
I've been preparing for this
since I was eight years old,

709
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,330
so every second of every minute
is so precious

710
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:21,080
and so valuable to me

711
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,710
that they're all masterpieces!

712
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:27,540
All the moments you just let slip away

713
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:30,340
are like romance or fantasy films to me!

714
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:34,590
But you'll keep on living
without knowing that!

715
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:38,510
You idiots!

716
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:56,450
That kind of rush.

717
00:47:58,530 --> 00:47:59,570
What are you doing?

718
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:01,580
Honestly,

719
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:05,160
it'd make more sense
to cast me as an actress,

720
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:08,420
instead of using me for consulting.

721
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,250
It'd make more sense
for you to head back in.

722
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:12,920
It's cold.

723
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:26,940
Good night then.

724
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,610
You know,

725
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:41,990
I really want

726
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:45,120
to make this movie with you.

727
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:49,670
Can't I be a part of it?

728
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:59,340
Wait!

729
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,720
Why…

730
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,600
does it have to be me?

731
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:10,060
- Sorry?
- Why do you want to make a film

732
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:12,480
with me?

733
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:19,320
I don't know.

734
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,700
I just…

735
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:29,540
had the feeling

736
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:33,380
you might give me a chance!

Hey, Hong.

743
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:46,120
Sorry to call you this late.

744
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:52,960
- Dad.
- Yeah?

745
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,620
- I'm home.
- Hey.

746
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:58,130
Hey, Mom.

747
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:00,880
Mom.

748
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,170
How have you been?

749
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,680
What's all this?

750
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:11,810
Vietnamese spring rolls.

751
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,190
Not exactly traditional for a memorial.

752
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:17,610
I want us to eat some trendy stuff
instead of the usual.

753
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:20,280
I like it.

754
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:26,030
You know, Gyoyeong says
you and I have "cool syndrome."

755
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,200
What's that?

756
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,330
Well…

757
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:32,750
Pretending to be too cool with each other,
and overdoing it.

758
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:36,920
How can I be cool
when my daughter is about to die?

759
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Cool?

760
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,540
Freeze me to death, will ya?

761
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,840
Hey, I want to be cool, too, you know.

762
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:49,970
So then, in the spirit of being cool,

763
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:53,480
could you make me an outpatient
and let me act again?

764
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,690
What are you saying?

765
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,310
I want to act.

766
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,320
I want to act again.

767
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:04,570
No.

768
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,490
- Dad, please.
- I said no.

769
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:09,870
- Just once, please.
- No.

770
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:13,500
What if you pass out like last time?

771
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:15,750
How could I

772
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:19,080
face your mom again
if I go easy on your treatment--

773
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:21,210
That's just your perspective, Dad.

774
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:22,340
I won't allow it.

775
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,840
Dad.

776
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:26,590
Your view is different
from mine and Mom's.

777
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:28,930
You still don't get that?

778
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,600
Mom always wanted to come home.

779
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,680
But…

780
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:38,310
She couldn't.

781
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,110
She wanted to die here at home,

782
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:44,150
but she passed away at the hospital

783
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:46,860
while you were in surgery
and I was at school.

784
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:49,490
She died all alone with no one there.

785
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,330
Dad.

786
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:55,580
I'm her daughter.

787
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,620
Maybe that's why

788
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:00,420
I don't want to die in a hospital either.

789
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:03,380
No.

790
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:08,430
I said no.

791
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,560
CONGRATULATIONS ON PASSING ROUND
1 OF "WHITE IN LOVE" AUDITIONS

792
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:06,820
My goodness!

793
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:11,910
Yes! Yes!

794
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:18,750
Great, you're here.

795
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:21,790
Say hello.

796
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:23,960
- Hello.
- Yes.

797
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:27,170
Great to see you.
I've been hoping to meet you,

798
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:29,880
so I've been pestering Mr. Bu for a while.

799
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,260
HAN SUNGHO

800
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:34,680
<i>Actually,</i>

801
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:37,470
I don't know much about movies,
to be honest.

802
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:40,980
I leave that part to the artists.

803
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:45,310
I'm just a businessman who cares about
whether this will make money,

804
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,400
and how much money it'll make.

805
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,030
That's what matters to me.

806
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:51,740
Why would you talk yourself down?

807
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:53,280
He's being too modest.

808
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,110
A movie just on its own

809
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,620
is not enough anymore these days.

810
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:00,450
You know what I'm saying, right?

811
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:09,880
I'm curious, what did you think
of the original <i>Love in White</i>?

812
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:12,380
Never seen it.

813
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:15,930
Then…

814
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,260
Have you seen my adaptation plan?

815
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:20,680
Well,

816
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,850
I heard the gist.

817
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:29,270
I'm not copying some dusty old film.

818
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,820
It'll be something completely new.

819
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,700
I wanted to be up-front about that.

820
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:36,780
I see, but do I really need to know that?

821
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,830
Do you think that's important to me?

822
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,790
You're only investing because…

823
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,670
I'm Lee Duyoung's son, right?

824
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:49,290
That's all that matters to you.

825
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:52,420
Ah. Our director here sure is candid.

826
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:53,920
Says it like it is.

827
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:57,470
Most people wouldn't agree to do this.

828
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:02,430
My father made the film
a year after my mother passed

829
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:06,230
with the very actress he was rumored
to be having an affair with.

830
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:10,610
They shamelessly pour out this ode to love
as if they were finally free.

831
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,070
People think…

832
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:17,910
it's a heartfelt tribute to the dead wife
that he made in grief,

833
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:21,080
and they praise it
like it's something noble.

834
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:23,160
Forget the film.

835
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:25,290
It's the story behind the film.

836
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:27,920
That's where the real fun is.

837
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:34,340
I know this film and what needs fixing
better than anyone.

838
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:36,300
And I promise,

839
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,430
you won't lose a cent.

00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:57,450
It's me, Daeum!

842
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:00,820
Could you wake her up?

843
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:05,790
Leave her. She must've come in
in the morning again.

844
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:09,330
Take some of this food when you go later.

845
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:10,500
About time for a refill.

846
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:13,000
Aren't these elephant bush stems?

847
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:15,300
Are you marinating them in perilla oil?

848
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:18,930
I'll stir-fry them
with a ton of perilla oil.

849
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:21,300
Thank you.

850
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:24,060
Instead of me…

851
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:27,390
Instead of me…

852
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:31,310
Oh, she's driving me nuts.
Can you just go and wake her up?

853
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:38,150
Gyo.

854
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,780
What happened to you?

855
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:44,280
- Huh? Daeum.
- Yeah?

856
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:47,830
I told you not to wake me up like this.

857
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:51,420
Why are your eyes so puffy?

858
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:53,540
I dumped him.

859
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:57,840
You're such a sucker for cute faces.
What did I tell you?

860
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,760
You have to get to know them first
before dating them.

861
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:02,510
Who asked for your two cents?

862
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:06,100
I'll have you know,
that's a hereditary trait.

863
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:08,520
My mom fell for my dad's face too.

864
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:14,560
Oh, right.

865
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:17,070
- Did you go back home?
- Yeah.

866
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:18,150
How's your dad?

867
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:19,280
Fine.

868
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:22,410
I told him everything, you know.

869
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:24,570
How you said we're both

870
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:27,240
riddled with "cool syndrome."

871
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:30,040
What?

872
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,000
Jeez! Why would you tell him that?

873
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,330
Seriously!

874
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:36,090
I can't even slap you.

875
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:39,380
Well, anyway.

876
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,930
Just make sure
your next relationship goes well.

877
00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:44,260
What?

878
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:46,350
Hmm?

879
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,930
Spit it out. Something happened, right?

880
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:57,690
- The clinical trial?
- My audition!

881
00:58:57,770 --> 00:58:58,780
What did you say?

882
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:01,440
I auditioned for a movie.

883
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,450
How did you do that?

884
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:08,080
I just barged in and did it.

885
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,200
You know what happened?

886

What is it?

888
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:21,920
What happened? What is it?

889
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:23,760
Is it a cockroach?

890
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:26,970
- Mom.
- Let me see.

891
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:28,470
CONGRATULATIONS ON PASSING ROUND
1 OF "WHITE IN LOVE" AUDITIONS

892
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:34,020
Congratulations!

893
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,190
I'm so happy for you.

894
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:44,070
Please tell me two things.

895
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:46,410
"Well done."

896
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:49,280
and "Good luck."

897
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:53,330
Well done.

898
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:54,830
Good luck.

899
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:58,040
Well done! Good luck!

900
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:08,850
I see you've mostly worked on short films.

901
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:10,300
- Yes.
- Right.

902
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:13,890
What do you do in your free time
when you're not acting?

903
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,100
I work as a freelance translator.

904
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:19,560
How have you been after the first round?

905
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:21,270
I've been well, thank you.

906
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:22,650
What have you been up to?

907
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,950
I went to some university hospitals
to do research on Gyuwon.

908
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:28,070
University hospitals?

909
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,030
Okay, Taerin.

910
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,370
That's enough for today. Thank you.

911
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:33,910
Okay, thank you.

912
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:39,000
- Take care, Mr. Lee.
- Goodbye.

913
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:56,020
Oh, no.

914
01:00:56,770 --> 01:00:58,190
I'm sorry, Dr. Lee.

915
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:01,690
Why? What happened?

916
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:05,990
Daeum is gone.

917
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,790
Lee Daeum is coming in.

918
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:21,880
- Thank you.
- You got this.

919
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:22,960
I got this.

920
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:40,060
Hello!

921
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:41,850
Yes, hello.

922
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:44,150
Take a seat.

923
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:53,120
So I've analyzed the character.

924
01:01:57,750 --> 01:02:01,000
You're not here to act
or analyze the character today.

925
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,710
Instead,

926
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:04,040
let's have a chat.

927
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:05,590
Just the two of us.

928
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:08,510
Just the two of us?

929
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:09,590
Yes.

930
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:11,340
You know,

931
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,430
just chat like you normally do.

932
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:17,350
Okay, Mr. Lee.

933
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,140
Don't let the camera bother you.

934
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:24,190
We won't use this footage for anything.

935
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:28,030
Relax, and talk how you normally do to me.

936
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:36,780
Don't you think this character
and this film are too cliché?

937
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:38,580
I do.

938
01:02:42,830 --> 01:02:43,830
You do?

939
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,340
Some people might even find it boring.

940
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,750
Seems like you find it boring too.

941
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:52,550
But it'll never be boring to me.

942
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:55,680
When that "terminal illness" cliché
is your life,

943
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,600
every day feels like
the climax of a movie.

944
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:03,230
This will be real method acting.

945
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:09,320
It sounds like you're okay
with this movie using your illness.

946
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,360
But you already did.

947
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:14,570
You used my words in your script.

948
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:17,620
I'll change the lines then.

949
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:22,000
Have you found someone better than me?

950
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,080
We're searching.

951
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:28,130
Don't waste your time like that.

952
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:31,170
I just don't see this happening.

953
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:36,180
I want to forget about my illness
and live as an actress.

954
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:39,060
There's a difference between forgetting

955
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:40,680
and overlooking.

956
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:48,940
I'm attending an audition right now,

957
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:52,780
so please see me as an actress,
not a sick person.

958
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:13,630
There were over 200 videos
of you doing monologues.

959
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:15,880
I wanted to ask…

960
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:21,310
what drove you to come this far

961
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:24,430
even while you were sick?

962
01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:27,020
When I was eight,

963
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:30,820
I asked my mom lying in the hospital bed

964
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:33,360
what her dream was.

965
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,030
I still remember the face she made.

966
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:40,490
If she ever got to leave the hospital,

967
01:04:40,570 --> 01:04:43,120
she said she wanted to find
the dream that she had forgotten.

968
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,080
I don't know what her dream was,

969
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,870
but it sure wasn't being a patient.

970
01:04:49,210 --> 01:04:50,500
Same goes for me.

971
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:55,510
That's the kind of thinking
that brought me here.

972
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:58,180
I don't know if that makes sense.

973
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:11,690
Are you hungry?

974
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,320
Give me 10 minutes.

975
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,240
Mr. Lee,

976
01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:22,660
even though I'm sick,

977
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:25,700
I can still watch movies,
go to auditions, and even love.

978
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:28,250
So I can make movies too.

979
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,420
I can do everything. I really can.

980
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,090
Just let me prove that to you.

981
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,130
That's enough for today.

982
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:39,380
You may leave now.

983
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:41,640
We'll let you know the results.

984
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:55,520
Thank you.

985
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:06,160
Mr. Lee.

986
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:08,750
Yes?

987
01:06:10,790 --> 01:06:12,040
Put your faith in me.

988
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:18,170
What exactly do you have
that I can put my faith in?

989
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:20,170
A plan…

990
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:22,050
and guts.

991
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:30,270
Looks flimsy to me.

992
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:33,190
But I like your spirit.

993
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:09,220
I have one condition.

994
01:07:14,810 --> 01:07:16,020
Don't die.

995
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:04,740
<i>Everyone knows</i>
<i>Chae Seoyoung should get the part.</i>

996
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:07,610
<i>Why are you so stuck on Lee Daeum?</i>

997
01:08:08,490 --> 01:08:09,990
<i>What is it about her?</i>

998
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:11,700
A rookie?

999
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:13,160
You just need to do it.

1000
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:15,000
<i>I'll make it happen.</i>

1001
01:08:16,210 --> 01:08:17,540
<i>What's this?</i>

1002
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:19,380
<i>We're deciding if the role of Gyuwon</i>

1003
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:21,250
<i>should go to Chae Seoyoung</i>
<i>or you, a rookie.</i>

1004
01:08:22,210 --> 01:08:23,840
<i>Did you read the script?</i>

1005
01:08:24,550 --> 01:08:25,720
<i>Are you interested?</i>

1006
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:27,760
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

1007
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:36,060
