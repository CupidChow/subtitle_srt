12
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,550

13
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,550
- Just go! Now!
- You're a darn fox!

14
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,010
I won't forgive you!

15
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,180
She's a devilish fox!

16
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,720
I WAS AFRAID

17
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,100
THAT I SHARED
SOMETHING IN COMMON

18
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,470
WITH SOMEONE
I NEVER WANTED TO BE LIKE.

19
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,520
No, stop the press.

20
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,360
Yes, we're friendly.
But we've never crossed the line.

21
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,650
I'd like to apologize.

22
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,120
I NEEDED TO PROVE

23
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,830
THAT I WASN'T HIM.

24
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,500
You're just leaving like this?

25
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,290
You're really leaving?

26
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,840
Uh…

27
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,590
I didn't think it through.
I didn't think how you'd feel.

28
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,510
Do I feel like a burden? Is that why?

29
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,390
- Seoyoung…
- Hmm.

30
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,350
…our movie's over.

31
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:15,850
What do you mean?

32
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,350
I was just using you.

33
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,320
I used your feelings for me
during the shoot.

34
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,490
That's all.

35
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,280
I simply led you on.

36
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,950
And now,

37
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,910
I have to make it right.

38
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,470
I NEEDED TO PROVE

39
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,930
I WOULD NEVER MAKE
THE SAME CHOICES

40
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,260
AS MY FATHER DID.

41
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,900
Was that enough?

42
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,700
Not bad for a rehearsal,

43
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,080
but your left shoulder
tends to shake a bit.

44
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,540
It'll probably be worse
when we start filming.

45
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,830
It'll be noticeable on camera.

46
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
It'll look…

47
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,010
like you're bobbing.

48
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,880
Ah.

49
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,770
My shoulder?

50
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,640
What's wrong with that?

51
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,650
It's not right to use me this way.

52
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,100
I'm not an actor, you know.

53
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,270
Y-yes, of course.

54
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,400
I guess that didn't really help.

55
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,700
I'm sorry

56
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,910
that I wasn't much help.

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Still…

58
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,840
it wasn't that bad.

59
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,740
EPISODE 5

60
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,460
Hello!

61
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,670
Wow, Ms. Go.
You're full of energy this morning--

62
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,930
Help me sign Lee Daeum.

63
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,970
Straight to the point, as always.

64
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,850
I saw she's got a manager now.

65
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,430
Who is he? He wasn't family.

66
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,980
Oh, just some guy Director Lee knows.

67
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,850
So he's the one who set it up?

68
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,440
What did he say to make her turn me down?

69
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,770
Daeum turned you down?

70
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,110
She shut me out completely.

71
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,860
And that only made me want her more.

72
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,740
Give me her info. Background,
experience, education, everything.

73
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,620
You should hire a private investigator
if you want all that.

74
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,540
Mmm. Mmm.

75
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,960
Come on,

76
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,830
let's help each other like the old days.

77
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,750
I'm dying to sign Lee Daeum, okay?

78
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,340
Ms. Go,

79
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,970
I'm only saying this for your sake.

80
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:38,010
It's better for you
not to sign with Daeum.

81
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,010
Seriously? Even you?

82
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,810
I just said it's for your own sake.

83
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,980
I wouldn't sign her if I were you.

84
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,060
Forget it! I'll find another way.

85
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,740
I'm late. Hey, Daeum!

86
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,660
How long are you going to sleep?
Get up! I need to be at work soon.

87
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,870
You told me to wake you.

88
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,410
Daeum?

89
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,620
Mom! Mom!

90
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,750
Daeum was out in the rain
for a bit yesterday.

91
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,960
That explains it.

92
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,760
No wonder this happened.

93
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,300
What were you doing
while she ended up like this?

94
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,350
Let her sleep another hour,
then wake her up and get her to eat.

95
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,600
Doctor, don't mention this to Daeum's…

96
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,980
Hey.

97
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,610
- Hello again.
- Hello.

98
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,360
Is her fever down?

99
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,110
Yes. I'm sorry, Dr. Lee.
I take responsibility for--

100
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,280
Why are you sorry?

101
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,240
- Let's admit her.
- Pardon?

102
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,450
- Oh my. Sir…
- But…

103
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,580
Gyoyeong.

104
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,660
That's it.

105
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,370
Daeum's not leaving
the hospital anymore. Got it?

106
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,630
Ah…

107
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,880
DIRECTOR LEE JEHA

108
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,630
- Dr. Kim.
- Yes?

109
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,760
Send me this director guy's number
right away.

110
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,720
Yes, sir.

111
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,640
Goodness.

112
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:10,310
Dr. Lee, please calm down
and just listen to her side of the story.

113
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,690
Ah. Patient Lee Daeum in Room 1205
is no longer allowed to leave.

114
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,400
- Dr. Lee, wait…
- Oh.

115
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,900
Send me the director's number
so I can check it as I go downstairs.

116
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,990
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

117
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,710
LEE DAEUM

118
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,800
WHERE ARE YOU?

119
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,720
CALL

120
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,560
LIM JUNBYUNG

121
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:57,030
Hey, Junbyung. Let me ask you a favor.

122
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,570
I'm here, but nobody's home.

123
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:04,030
- <i>She's not answering your calls?</i>
- No. Did something happen yesterday?

124
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,370
No, nothing happened.

125
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:10,250
She came to ask something about the script
and left not long after.

126
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,630
Hang on.

127
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,510
Yes, hello?

128
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,110
ROOM 511, KIM MINSEOK
SPECIALTY: NEUROSURGERY

129
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,230
Surgery isn't really an option right now.

130
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,860
Even admission is just my recommendation.
I doubt she would agree to it.

131
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:42,990
NEUROSURGERY
KIM MINSEOK

132
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,430
Hey…

133
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,640
Where are you going?

134
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,690
You know where.

135
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:15,770
Gyoyeong…

136
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,020
I don't want to be here.

137
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,490
You're not okay.

138
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:23,570
You can't go.

139
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,820
But I have to go.

140
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,660
Director Lee's waiting for me.

141
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,910
Your father's going to meet
with that director right now.

142
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,000
Exactly.

143
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,870
That's why I have to be there.

144
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,710
Hey.

145
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,260
How can you be so selfish?

146
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,260
You know I have to go make that movie.

147
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,760
You're the one
who was the happiest for me.

148
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,720
I'm happy for you.

149
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,810
I was happy.

150
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,020
But you shouldn't have fainted, then.

151
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,480
Gyoyeong.

152
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,110
Listen to me.

153
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,910
Do you think I enjoy doing this
when my friend wants to do what she likes?

154
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,620
I'm scared.

155
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,460
I'm scared something might happen to you.

156
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,880
Just this morning,

157
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,710
do you know how scared I was
when you wouldn't wake up?

158
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,310
I'm sorry.

159
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,180
I'm sorry, Gyoyeong.

160
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,520
But, Gyoyeong…

161
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,530
look at me.

162
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,900
Don't I look different?

163
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,990
Being in this movie
means so much to me right now.

164
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,620
So call me selfish all you want…

165
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,210
but becoming Gyuwon
makes me happier than ever.

166
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,460
I'm sorry.

167
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,850
Help me out.

168
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,740
Yes, Manager?

169
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,780
I took the morning off.

170
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,830
Yes.

171
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,290
Yes?

172
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,960
Hello, Doctor.

173
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,960
- Who are you?
- Ah.

174
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,170
Ah. Aha.

175
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,090
Nice to see you again.

176
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,300
Yes, I heard a lot about you
from Director Lee.

177
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,680
So you're our consultant?

178
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,600
I thought your character
didn't need consulting.

179
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,140
What exactly is wrong with Daeum?

180
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,400
Ah. I'm not the type
to beat around the bush.

181
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,650
I know Daeum is sick.

182
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,200
I can't tell you
a patient's personal information.

183
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,530
That line appears often in movies too.

184
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,240
In movies, they dig it up some other way.

185
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,500
Why do you want to know this?

186
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,620
Hmm.

187
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,420
Daeum…

188
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,590
is trying to make a movie,

189
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,090
and I want to help her.

190
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,050
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

191
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,300
But even so,

192
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:36,510
there's nothing I can tell you here.

193
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,220
I have to ask you to leave.

194
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,900
CINEMA JONGNO

195
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,070
I couldn't think of a quiet place to talk.

196
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,450
This is nice and quiet enough.

197
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,530
I'm sorry.

198
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,620
I know it's out of line,

199
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,750
but I got your contact info
from Dr. Kim Minseok.

200
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,790
No, that's fine. What did you want to say?

201
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,500
Well…

202
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,750
Was it a "table read"?

203
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,260
The day before her table read,
Daeum told me that she was…

204
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,680
so happy she could die.

205
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,350
For her to say those words,

206
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,890
she must've really wanted…

207
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,730
to do this acting thing.

208
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,940
Yes, she's doing very well.

209
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,440
I should be happy to hear
my daughter is doing well,

210
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,190
but it's hard for me.

211
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:38,990
I'm sure you've had a lot on your mind
after hearing of Daeum's condition.

212
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,790
I heard you're keeping it a secret
from everyone else.

213
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,620
Yes, for her sake,

214
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,960
I plan to keep it a secret
until filming is over.

215
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,040
Is that so?

216
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,710
But if you really do care about her,

217
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,760
instead of keeping secrets,

218
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,260
shouldn't you be letting her
go to the hospital

219
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,390
to help her live longer?

220
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,220
I'm trying to honor her wishes.

221
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,100
I'll keep communicating with her
about her condition

222
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,360
and try my best to care for her.

223
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,940
But Daeum's not well enough
to finish this movie.

224
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:16,150
She can barely get through the day.

225
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,990
We'll arrange the schedule for her
and finish as quickly as possible.

226
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,160
And what if she has a seizure on set?

227
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,000
If she misses a single dose,
or a single meal,

228
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,040
that could be it for her.

229
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,590
Does filming a movie matter more
than someone's life?

230
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,630
You'll try your best?

231
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,680
My daughter's life is on the line,

232
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,390
and the best is all you can do?

233
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,980
That's truly irresponsible of you.

234
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:55,530
Is it fun making a terminal patient
play a terminal character?

235
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,110
Is this how all movies are?

236
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,920
There's nothing I can tell you here.

237
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,180
I have to ask you to leave.

238
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,970
1205, LEE DAEUM, CHECK REGULARLY

239
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,060
<i>Twelfth floor.</i>

240
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,280
Make a choice, Daeum.

241
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,490
Option one,

242
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,580
walking out of here,

243
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,290
doing everything you've only
ever dreamed of, and then dying.

244
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,420
Option two,

245
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,130
staying here

246
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,510
and living longer.

247
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,680
But you won't be able to do anything.

248
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,140
It'll be miserable.

249
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,020
That's a tough choice.

250
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,770
Is it?

251
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,110
It's easy for me.

252
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,650
Daeum!

253
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,450
The doctor was looking for you.

254
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,280
Oh! I forgot.

255
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,450
- Let's talk later, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

256
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,090
THE LATE KIM MINJEONG

257
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,880
<i>Every day in the hospital,</i>

258
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,880
<i>I couldn't stop picturing it.</i>

259
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,600
<i>What kind of life…</i>

260
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:32,060
<i>would I have led if I left this place?</i>

261
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,230
I know I need to go--

262
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,400
<i>I asked if Daeum got any better!</i>

263
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,570
Mom, I'll explain everything later.

264
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,530
<i>Why do you keep rambling</i>
<i>about the weirdest--</i>

265
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,750
<i>The heroine of a movie,</i>

266
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,710
<i>a fairy-tale romance,</i>

267
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,500
<i>and a "happily ever after" in the end.</i>

268
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:04,170
<i>Real life was always out there,</i>
<i>beyond the hospital.</i>

269
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,230
- Hello.
- Hi.

270
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,910
<i>First floor.</i>

271
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:56,730
Yes, Doctor?

272
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,350
Ms. Lee Daeum?

273
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,310
What?

274
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,730
She's not in her room?

275
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,860
She was there a minute ago.

276
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,820
Gyuwon.

277
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,570
When was the last time you slept?

278
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,080
You're on call today again, right?

279
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,290
I never get to eat with my own sister.

280
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,460
Aren't you hungry?

281
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,250
How about a sandwich?

282
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,460
I'll head back up there. Okay.

283
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,350
If we want sandwiches,
how about a little drive to Forestin?

284
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,890
<i>Basement level two.</i>

285
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,450
It's been a while, Dr. Lee.

286
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,450
Yes, hello.

287
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:08,300
<i>The outside world turned out</i>
<i>to be tougher than I thought.</i>

288
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,220
<i>But I don't want to give up.</i>

289
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:26,730
<i>Dad.</i>

290
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,990
<i>Can you leave the rest of our time to me?</i>

291
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:33,660
<i>I want to choose my own ending.</i>

292
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,500
Where should I take you?

293
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,520
I don't really have anywhere
I can go right now.

294
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,940
Give me a minute.

295
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,360
Anywhere safe is good enough, right?

296
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,440
I'll figure it out. Just rest.

297
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,480
Don't get up. Make yourself comfortable.

298
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:50,770
Oh. Okay.

299
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:52,650
Well…

300
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,780
You can take the room upstairs.

301
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,530
Want to go up and rest?

302
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,330
Or do you want something to eat?

303
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,120
Wait, I guess you can't just eat anything.

304
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,870
M-Ms. Chae.

305
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,960
I'll just be upstairs.

306
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,550
Of course. You should get some rest first.

307
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,630
Ms. Chae,

308
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,010
thank you so much.

LEE DAEUM

316
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:19,780
Why weren't you answering?

317
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,950
Where are you?

318
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:24,080
I wasn't really in a situation
where I could pick up.

319
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,540
I'm sorry I made you worry.

320
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,250
What kind of situation?

321
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,330
<i>I was at the hospital…</i>

322
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,380
but I ran away
because I was scared I'd have to stay.

323
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,840
So where are you now?

324
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,470
<i>Uh…</i>

325
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,260
I'm at Ms. Seoyoung's.

326
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,680
I ran into her at the hospital

327
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,520
- <i>and asked her to help me out.</i>
- Where did you say you were?

328
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,060
Do you mind if I explain more tomorrow?

329
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,850
I promise I'll tell you everything.

330
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,020
Stay there, I'm on my way.

331
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:54,730
Pardon?

332
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,190
I said, wait there for me.

333
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,280
Thank you for the meal.

334
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,660
But why aren't you eating anything?

335
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,950
I gave up rice three years ago.

336
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,250
Oh.

337
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,590
Can I ask why you were at the hospital?

338
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,720
Ah.

339
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,970
Prescriptions from psych.

340
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:26,680
I have a lot of stress and anxiety.

341
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,720
Has it been that rough?

342
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:31,640
Yes. I've been going for a while.

343
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:35,310
I didn't expect to see you there, though.

344
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,230
Like what happened before…

345
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,280
Can you tell me about that now?

346
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,650
I'm just worried about you.

347
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,120
I-It just…

348
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,660
It just happens sometimes, not very often.

349
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,830
You don't have to worry about that.

350
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,660
It's really nothing.

00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,750
DIRECTOR LEE JEHA

352
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,290
Sorry, I need to take this.

353
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,420
Yeah, what's up?

354
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,510
<i>I'll be at your place soon.</i>

355
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,300
Why would you come to my place?

356
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,890
To get Daeum.

357
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,600
How did you know she was here?

358
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,310
She told me she was there.

359
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,320
But why are you coming to get her?

360
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,610
I don't think
I need to explain myself to you.

361
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,060
Come in.

362
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,400
Mr. Lee.

363
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,070
Let's go.

364
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,530
You'll make things weird
if you go like this, you know.

365
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,790
Shouldn't you at least
explain what's going on?

366
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,540
Do you need help like you did earlier?

367
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,710
It's not like that, Ms. Chae.

368
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,970
Go downstairs and wait in the car.
I'll be right down.

369
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,970
- Mr. Lee…
- Go downstairs.

370
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,360
See you.

371
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,450
What?

372
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,620
You didn't explain anything.

373
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,410
What are you hiding?

374
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,460
I can't pretend not to notice anymore.
Explain before you go.

375
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,710
Why were you at the hospital?
How did you run into Daeum?

376
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,380
And why did you bring her here?

377
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:10,510
I don't understand
why you get so worked up about Daeum.

378
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,510
I saw something and wanted to know why.

379
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,970
You two are hiding something from me.

380
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,190
It doesn't concern you.

381
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,980
Why are you acting so weird?

382
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,110
Why are you so unpredictable?

383
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:28,030
I was excited and nervous
to work with you again.

384
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:31,490
Honestly, it felt like the old days
and I started acting on impulse.

385
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:35,660
But you keep acting in strange ways
like someone I don't even recognize.

386
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,080
Why are you doing this? What's the reason?

387
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:43,540
Because I'm not someone who exists
to act the way you want or predict.

388
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,670
That's something you should expect
from someone who loves you.

389
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,130
Not me.

390
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,740
Why do I keep running into Seoyoung?

391
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,280
Is it destiny?

392
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,780
I heard you were unwell.

393
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,540
Are you okay now?

394
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,160
I'm fine.

395
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,160
I'll tell you if I'm really not okay.

396
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,500
You don't need to worry.

397
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,040
Let's go to the hospital.

398
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,670
No, I can't go there.

399
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:33,140
Why are you so reckless
when you know you can't handle it?

400
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,930
We're about to start shooting.

401
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:38,020
If your condition worsens, 70 or 80 people
will have to stop everything.

402
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,060
Even if you're new,

403
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,650
a lead actor should at least have some
basic sense of professionalism.

404
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,400
If I go back to the hospital now,

405
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,070
I'll just lie there until I die.

406
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,110
That's my reality.

407
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:52,070
I don't care if you yell at me.

408
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,990
It's a million times better
for me to be out in the world.

409
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,870
Keep yelling, I can take it all.

410
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,330
And I'm not being reckless right now.

411
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:01,290
I got out because I'm desperate.

412
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:04,000
Mr. Lee, can you please give me this?

413
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,750
I'll take you to your friend's.

414
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,800
I can't go there today.

415
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,760
Where, then?

416
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,430
Somewhere you'd never want to go.

417
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,850
What?

418
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:22,600
A place that's your version
of my hospital.

419
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,690
Don't you have a place like that?

420
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:51,630
Is this the place you never want to go?

421
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,880
Yeah.

422
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,850
I've been wondering this since last time.

423
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,220
Why do you ask about the worst food

424
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,270
and the worst places?

425
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,310
I'm just curious.

426
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,490
I want to know what you like, don't like,

427
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:17,030
everything.

428
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,710
Come in.

429
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,410
Take this room.

430
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,160
What is this place?

431
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,790
My childhood home.

432
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:07,080
Ah. No wonder.

433
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,540
I looks like it hasn't been
maintained in a while,

434
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,380
but it feels grand and cozy
at the same time.

435
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,760
A little eerie, but feels antique.

436
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,300
It suits you, actually.

437
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,550
Suits me? Please.

438
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,850
But why don't you like this place?

439
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,310
Use this room, okay?

440
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,060
Bathroom's over there.

441
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,480
Just stay here for the night,

442
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,690
and after that…

443
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,480
Let's figure that out later.

444
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,320
Where are you going?

445
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,150
I have my own place.

446
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,820
What? This isn't some guesthouse.

447
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:45,370
You can't just throw me some guidelines
and walk away.

448
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:59,050
Did you tell your father you're here?

449
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,800
You should tell him.

450
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,720
You're not a kid.

451
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,400
He doesn't want you
to do this movie, right?

452
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,400
I guess you met my dad.

453
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:21,530
I won't tell you to do
whatever your father says.

454
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,280
I never did with mine.

455
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,370
Was your father…

456
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,950
against you making films too?

457
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,040
Not sure.

458
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,630
He would've at least been against me
remaking <i>Love in White</i>.

459
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,830
Hmm.

460
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,010
Can I ask, if you don't mind?

461
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:40,550
You said that…

462
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:46,640
you didn't think your father was actually
the one who wrote <i>Love in White</i>.

463
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,930
Let's change the subject.

464
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,060
Oh.

465
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,850
I honestly don't know what to do.

466
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,280
I understand how my dad feels…

467
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,320
but I can't live how he wants me to.

468
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:09,540
But your father's a doctor who understands
your condition better than anyone.

469
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,120
Exactly.

470
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:14,080
That's what makes me so scared.

471
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:17,630
He can't accept it because he's a doctor.

472
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,880
Can we change the subject?

473
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,010
I'll head out now.

474
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,890
Mr. Lee!

475
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,520
I'm sorry.

476
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,860
I'm terribly sorry.

477
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,320
About what?

478
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,030
You know, last time…

479
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:44,200
When I forced you to…

480
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,490
You know.

481
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:50,240
I'm sorry.

482
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,710
Who apologizes that seriously for a kiss?

483
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:58,750
Wouldn't acting like it didn't happen
be even weirder?

484
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,630
You don't have to apologize.

485
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:03,800
If anything,
I should be the one to be sorry.

486
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,300
Even if it was practice, you had to kiss
someone you don't even like.

487
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:10,890
Mmm.

488
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,440
How many times have you apologized today?

489
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,810
H-How many times?

490
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,650
Mmm…

491
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,740
Hmm?

492
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,070
Think you can finish this film
if you keep apologizing like that?

493
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,620
Open your hand again.

494
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:44,300
I know your heart's in the right place,
but stop apologizing so much.

495
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,170
If you want to do
what you've always wanted,

496
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,630
you'll have to…

497
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,890
learn how to deal with feelings like that.

498
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,100
You said you're a terminal patient
who could do anything.

499
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,020
You're someone
who can do anything, aren't you?

500
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,030
So stop belittling yourself.

501
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,500
Don't touch anything in this house.

502
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,920
Not a thing.

503
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:03,380
WATER, GRAPE 100,
SEAWEED SNACK, COOKIES

504
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:42,500
"GRANDMA'S TABLE" NEARBY
IS REALLY GOOD.

505
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:45,380
LEFT THE STUFF YOU NEED
BY THE DOOR.

506
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,830
GRAPE 100

507
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,400
Hmm.

508
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,110
Hmm?

509
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:58,320
Is that Mr. Lee? He's so cute…

510
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,540
<i>Don't touch anything in this house.</i>

511
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,580
Uh…

512
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,710
<i>Not a thing.</i>

513
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:11,710
<i>Not a thing.</i>

514
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,820
You're coming along?

515
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,150
Why not? It'll save gas.

516
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,530
It's uncomfortable sharing a car.

517
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:44,580
Director Park's looking for a new lead
for his next project.

518
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,660
So what?

519
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,620
Let's do it.

520
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,670
You made a strong comeback
with him last time.

521
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,420
The divorce got buried too.

522
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,380
Ms. Go,
didn't we already sign for <i>Love in White</i>?

523
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,930
You don't even have
much screen time in that.

524
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,640
Just shoot all your scenes at once.

525
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,850
You'll be credited
as a special appearance.

526
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,390
I want to focus on being Junghwa.

527
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,690
You're not the kind of actress
who can't handle two roles.

528
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,110
Don't drink when you get there.

529
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:15,360
You want me to tough it out sober?

530
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,070
The hospital called.
They said meds alone won't help.

531
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,160
Yes, Mr. Kim?

532
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,290
Ms. Go and Seoyoung just went in.

533
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:27,750
The timing's perfect, then.

534
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:28,960
I'll be there to get her.

535
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,630
How is she feeling?

536
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,840
Uh… What are the vibes there?

537
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,500
I don't think it'll take long.

538
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,920
She said she's not even drinking.

539
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:57,150
I think she might drink a little.

540
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,400
Here is this week's status.

541
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,860
The bookstore will likely
be completed this week.

542
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:03,530
HAVE YOU EATEN

543
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,950
The sea breeze gave us a hard time,

544
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:07,410
but we expect
to finish construction this week.

545
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,000
Mr. Lee.

546
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:18,340
You seem tired, Mr. Lee.
Shall we wrap up for today?

547
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,050
We have a lot of scenes
tracking the leads' eyes,

548
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,010
so the DP may have a tough time.

549
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,100
Since it's not a set,

550
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,390
I'll need to check
the locations in person.

551
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:30,440
I'll add that to the scouting schedule.

552
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:36,320
Are we running a bit short on time?

553
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,690
Well, I expected this and prepped ahead.

554
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,240
If you can just confirm
the remaining locations,

555
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,490
we'll have enough time.

556
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,780
Gosh. Sorry, I'm late.

557
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,290
- Hello.
- Welcome.

558
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:48,700
What kept you so long?

559
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:52,170
Got stuck listening
to <i>Terms of Jealousy</i>'s producer vent.

560
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,250
Isn't that coming out soon?

561
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:56,000
It's chaos over there.

562
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:57,380
What? Why?

563
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,590
There was a scandal.

564
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,800
The director and the lead.

565
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:06,050
Didn't Director Jungin spend six months
in auditions and cast a rookie?

566
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,510
Is dating that big a deal?

567
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,020
Happens all the time.

568
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,770
Yeah, if they're dating quietly.

569
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:16,110
But he was two-timing…

570
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,780
both of the female leads.

571
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,450
HAVE YOU EATEN ANYTHING?

572
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,080
<i>The call cannot be connected</i>

573
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,580
<i>and will be forwarded to voicemail--</i>

574
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,660
LEE DAEUM

575
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:44,180
What?

576
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:47,640
You've been staring. Got something to say?

577
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,350
Bit rude, aren't you?

578
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,270
I'll go if it's nothing.

579
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,100
That kind of mess can't happen on our set,

580
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,690
and obviously won't, right?

581
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,020
What kind of mess?

582
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,360
A disaster caused by one stupid decision.

583
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,780
That's not happening on my set, okay?

584
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:09,200
It won't.

585
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,910
Don't waste your energy worrying.

586
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,870
There's no fixing it
if we end up like <i>Terms of Jealousy</i>.

587
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,080
Okay?

588
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,390
At this point, Seoyoung is practically
your muse, isn't she?

589
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:32,680
Of course, she is.

590
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:35,560
Sorry.

591
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,980
I'm just thirsty.

592
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,150
This is strong stuff.

593
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:47,610
Hey, I like the vibes today.

594
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,120
You're very gutsy, Seoyoung.
That's why I like you.

595
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,700
The script's solid,
and the character is fantastic.

596
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:54,660
And it's Director Park's film, after all.

597
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,290
Seoyoung has to do it.

598
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,290
Since you like gutsy, I'll show you gutsy.

599
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:02,550
I'm the one who's acting.

600
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:07,340
Not Ms. Go, not the director,
not the producer, but me.

601
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:12,850
I haven't even seen the script,

602
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:15,140
but I'm supposed to step in
for an actress who bailed

603
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,980
because the director was a nightmare?
It makes no sense.

604
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,690
Odds are he'll act the same
toward me. Right?

605
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:23,610
That's enough.

606
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,490
I come first.

607
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,990
My feelings come first.

608
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,460
Do you have anything else to say to me?

609
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,170
Then say it behind my back.

610
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,180
One moment, Mr. Park.

611
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,270
You're nuts.

612
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,780
If I'm nuts,

613
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:09,030
then you're just heartless.

614
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:10,110
Know your place.

615
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,370
You're a divorcée
about to hit your mid-30s.

616
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:14,660
You want to throw away the lead?

617
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:15,910
Go back and apologize.

618
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:17,950
Divorcée?

619
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:22,000
A 30-something desperate for a lead role?

620
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:27,380
So that's how the person
I thought knew me best sees me.

621
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,760
You want to hit rock bottom?

622
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,680
Director Park…

623
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,840
always rewrites scenes last minute
just to get actresses naked.

624
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:35,220
Don't you know that?

625
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:37,640
I'm still on meds because of that.

626
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,810
And you want me to work with him again?

627
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:42,230
Isn't that too cruel? I'm human too!

628
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:43,850
Just focus on the results.

629
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,230
- Don't think about--
- How can I not think about that?

630
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,070
I feel like I'm about to explode--

631
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:57,330
Do you think
I enjoy sucking up to those pricks?

632
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,120
Go back in there.

633
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,410
Go back and apologize.

634
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,420
This is why I came here.

635
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,800
To make sure Director Park
never asks for me again.

636
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,760
And that blasted lead?

637
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:16,220
Find someone else
who'll do whatever you say.

638
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:44,540
Stop that, it hurts.

639
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,040
You drank a lot, huh?

640
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:50,050
I wasn't planning to,

641
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:51,710
but I did a bit.

642
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,840
I didn't want to,

643
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,800
but I had to do it, like it or not.

644
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,930
Let's go to the car first.

645
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:05,390
I…

646
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:10,070
I burned my bridges with Ms. Go today.

647
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:15,150
I have no idea what kind of crap
I'll have to deal with now.

648
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:17,280
Stop. Let's just go.

649
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,030
I was awesome back in there.

650
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:21,990
Don't you want to know?

651
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,620
I'd rather know if you need
to throw up or pass out.

652
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,130
I'll just go.

653
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:41,140
Get me everything on Lee Daeum.

654
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,680
Hire a private eye, get a reporter on her,
I don't care.

655
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:46,940
Get any information on her
so we can get her to join us.

656
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,900
LEE DAEUM

657
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,160
Why aren't you answering?

658
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:14,710
What are you doing?

659
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:17,260
Welcome back.

660
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,680
Are you going to keep breaking promises?

661
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:23,970
I only broke half the promise.

662
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,100
I didn't touch anything.

663
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:28,850
I just wiped off the dust.
You know how hard that was?

664
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:37,860
Did anyone ask you to clean?

665
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:41,280
And why didn't you pick up your phone?
I was worried.

666
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:45,370
Must've missed it while I was cleaning.

667
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,620
Should I mess it all up again, then?

668
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:50,750
A patient breathing in dust sounds great.

669
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,710
You're only a patient when it suits you.

670
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:58,550
TIME TO EAT

671
00:48:58,630 --> 00:48:59,840
I have to eat.

672
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:00,970
What did you have for lunch?

673
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:03,140
I ate at Grandma's Table.
It was delicious.

674
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:05,060
Hmm.

675
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,310
Good to hear.
Hand me your phone, unlocked.

676
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:16,780
ALARM

677
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,570
What are you doing?

678
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:26,080
7:00 A.M.

679
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,580
I need to know this too.

680
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:30,000
Just double-checking.

681
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:36,800
ALARM

682
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:39,090
Here you go.

683
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,090
Let's go eat.

684
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:42,890
Ah.

685
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:45,470
Are you okay with Grandma's Table again?

686
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:47,640
Yes, I can eat there
every day of the week.

687
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:48,930
Even a month.

688
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:55,610
GRANDMA'S TABLE

689
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:05,950
Go back to your friend's after we eat.

690
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:07,120
I guess I should.

691
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,120
Dig in.

692
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:18,170
Can I stay?

693
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,260
No.

694
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:24,090
Okay.

695
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:30,220
I'm heading to Gangwon-do
after I drop you off.

696
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:33,520
Are you going on a trip?

697
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,850
A trip? I wish.

698
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:37,610
It's for location scouting.

699
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:41,280
Can't you take me too?

700
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:43,610
Why?

701
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,450
Gyuwon lives in Gangwon-do.

702
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:47,370
I want to get to know her better.

703
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,660
You'll take me, right?

704
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:56,170
No.

705
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:01,800
I figured you'd say no.

706
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:04,340
Man, I'm getting shut down a lot today.

707
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:10,140
Because you keep asking for things
I have to shut down.

708
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:13,600
Daeum, let me ask you again.

709
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:18,270
If you want to do this movie,
can you be a bit smarter about it?

710
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:22,360
Have you forgotten what you are?

711
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:27,700
You're not just an ordinary actress.

712
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:31,950
Don't you forget that.

713
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:48,720

Cut! Okay, that's good.

718
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,460
"Going without food may cause seizures."

719
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:28,550
<i>That again. What is it?</i>

720
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:30,890
What's it for? Why set one just to eat?

721
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:34,770
The thing is, my body can't
absorb nutrients like most people's,

722
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:37,770
<i>so I need to eat a lot, often,</i>
<i>and at regular times</i>

723
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:39,560
<i>to get more nutrients.</i>

724
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:41,560
If I go too long without food,

725
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:43,400
I could go into shock,

726
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,820
or if it's bad enough, I could die.

727
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:57,450
HYLENOL

728
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:20,600
Yes, here it is!

729
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:22,310
Looks great.

730
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,750
RESTRICTED AREA

731
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:45,670
<i>When you're in the hospital long enough,</i>

732
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:48,010
<i>there are days that feel unbearable.</i>

733
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,010
This is just a glass window,

734
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:54,180
but life could be so different beyond it.

735
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:14,780
Filming from in here would be nice.

736
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:16,950
What do you think?

737
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:18,950
- I like it.
- Got it.

738
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:22,830
Sir, the director would like to film
from inside here.

739
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,540
You're not allowed in that area.

740
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:26,630
Mr. Lee.

741
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:29,590
He says we can't
because that's a restricted area.

742
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,930
Not here, then.

743
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:50,610
Mr. Lee,

744
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:52,150
did you put your phone on silent?

745
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,200
YU HONG: COULD YOU CALL ME,
MR. LEE? - MISSED CALLS

746
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:58,030
My alarms kept going off.

747
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,490
Please turn it on and pick up my calls.

748
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:02,540
The key to the bookstore.

749
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,170
We're going out for a drink,

750
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:06,790
but I'm guessing you can't go?

751
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,210
I have some work to do.

752
00:55:08,290 --> 00:55:10,130
Need to check out the bookstore too.

753
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:12,010
It's nighttime. Can't you go tomorrow?

754
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:14,260
We film at night too.

755
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:18,600
Hmm? I'll go look on my own.

756
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,560
Go on, but don't drink too much.

757
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,810
BOOK

758
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,280
Welcome! This is Lee Gyuwon's bookstore.

759
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:42,240
Is there a book you're looking for?

760
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,410
Ms. Lee Daeum.

761
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:46,620
What are you doing here?

762
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:50,790
How did you get here?

763
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,500
I got here by car.

764
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:00,680
- Mmm!
- I thought you were Mr. Lee's friend.

765
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,470
Are you sure you can abandon him
and be here?

766
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,930
He'll manage on his own.

767
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:12,860
Do you like somaek?

768
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:14,280
Of course I do.

769
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:18,030
This is called Gen MZ's somaek.

770
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:23,740
- Here. Let's have a glass.
- Sure.

771
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,410
Why are you here, though?

772
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:30,460
Actors don't usually come
for location scouting.

773
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,040
Well,

774
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:34,670
the shoot's coming up soon,

775
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,470
and I heard
checking out the location in advance

776
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:39,510
helps actors get into character.

777
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:45,810
Says who?

778
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:48,980
Well, I brought all my meds.

779
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:52,110
I stopped by the hospital
to get my checkup results

780
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:54,020
and got the all-clear from my doctor.

781
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:58,780
It's not like I'm running a marathon
or doing anything strenuous here.

782
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:02,870
I even stuck on a bunch of heat packs
so I wouldn't catch a cold.

783
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:04,280
So if I still get sick?

784
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:06,540
Then I don't deserve to be in this film.

785
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:10,370
At least you came prepared.

786
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:16,090
I really wanted to come here
at least once before the shoot.

787
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:23,010
Gyuwon's lived her whole life
in this neighborhood, right?

788
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:26,350
Mmm.

789
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:29,560
I thought seeing her bookstore in person

790
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:33,110
would help me understand
her loneliness and her sense of isolation.

791
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:39,030
I thought I'd be able
to feel these things better.

792
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,780
For Gyuwon, the bookstore.

793
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,410
For me, the hospital.

794
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:45,910
For Gyuwon, there's Hyunsang.

795
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:47,330
For me…

796
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:57,250
Gyuwon and I are very much alike.

797
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:00,880
The overwhelming loneliness I felt…

798
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,220
and the sudden ray of hope
that came to me.

799
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:29,370
I'm not sure if it would be right for me
to call that love,

800
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:32,750
so I came here to find answers.

801
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:35,420
Since you keep telling me it's not.

802
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:39,840
Since you came all this way,

803
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:42,260
do you want to go inside?

804
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:47,600
LEE GYUWON BOOKSTORE

805
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,720
<i>Hmm.</i>

806
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:51,640
Hmm?

807
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:54,140
So Mr. Lee's the one who said that.

808
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:56,060
Exactly.

809
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:59,780
I didn't even ask,
and he kept ranting on and on.

810
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,940
As a manager,

811
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:04,610
if something helps my actress,

812
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:06,490
it's not like

813
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:08,660
I can't come here, you know?

814
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:17,040
Oh.

815
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:20,210
But I'm glad I came.

816
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:22,210
I got to see you.

817
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:31,140
I need a smoke.

818
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:33,020
- I have one.
- Where's the restroom?

819
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:38,650
Just drink this!

820
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:40,110
Oh? Okay.

821
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:47,860
What the…

822
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:00,340
It's so dark in here.

823
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,670
Uh, wait here for a minute.

824
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:12,350
LEE GYUWON BOOKSTORE

825
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:18,850
The art team did a great job.

826
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:27,900
It's beautiful.

827
01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:31,910
Mmm.

828
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:35,910
I'm jealous of Gyuwon.

829
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:39,120
No, wait. I'm not, since I am Gyuwon.

830
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:42,960
Take a seat.

831
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:51,010
It's funny, isn't it?

832
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:54,010
I don't think you told my manager,

833
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:57,680
so how did he know to bring me here?

834
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:01,350
Are you warm?

835
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:03,270
I'm just fine.

836
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:05,650
I'm a bit cold.

837
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:15,120
Sometimes,
people say one thing and do another.

838
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:17,330
So what do you think?

839
01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:21,420
Do you feel something,
seeing where Gyuwon lives?

840
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:22,960
Hmm…

841
01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:50,700
EVERY CELL IN YOUR BODY KNOWS.
THAT IT'S LOVE.

842
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:53,370
What's with this sappy melodrama?

843
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:56,200
It came to me
while I was reading the script.

844
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:00,540
And…

845
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,870
I haven't been able to shake it.

846
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,340
The scene where Hyunsang kisses Gyuwon.

847
01:02:10,590 --> 01:02:12,510
Can't Gyuwon kiss him first instead?

848
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:14,470
Why?

849
01:02:14,550 --> 01:02:16,180
I realized, now that I've tried it,

850
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:20,020
that Gyuwon and Hyunsang
wouldn't just kiss on a whim.

851
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,310
They kiss because they know.

852
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:24,350
Because they know?

853
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:28,190
Their feelings are just impulsive
at that point.

854
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:29,690
It's only a week since they've met.

855
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:30,860
It's not love.

856
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,360
But Gyuwon wants him to know.

857
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:37,780
She's telling this man,

858
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:40,540
who doesn't believe in love or hope

859
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:43,250
and thinks they're just useless…

860
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,000
"Look.

861
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:49,630
Don't you feel it too?

862
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:52,380
It's already begun."

863
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:03,140
One week is…

864
01:03:03,230 --> 01:03:04,730
I CAN GET HEALTHY IN A WEEK TOO

865
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:06,770
…more than enough time to fall in love.

866
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:10,690
One week…

867
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:17,030
is more than enough time

868
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:20,040
to destroy love as well.

869
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:43,220
Actually…

870
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:46,940
I have one more secret.

871
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:50,320
A secret?

872
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:52,650
The first time I met you

873
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:55,450
wasn't at the hospital.

874
01:03:57,110 --> 01:03:59,120
I know. It was at the convenience store.

875
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:01,370
We saw each other.

876
01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:05,160
It was way before that.

877
01:04:09,790 --> 01:04:11,250
Five years ago,

878
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:15,840
I passed the first round of auditions
for your movie,

879
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:18,430
<i>The Lonely People</i>.

880
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:20,850
The one Seoyoung got.

881
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:26,810
You probably don't remember me,

882
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:28,560
since there were so many people.

883
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:31,060
I didn't even make the second round.

884
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:34,190
But I still remembered…

885
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:36,190
your name,

886
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,950
Lee Jeha.

887
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:45,290
So,

888
01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:47,750
when I saw your name on the proposal

889
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:50,290
on Dr. Minseok's desk,

890
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:53,380
my heart started pounding.

891
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:56,380
So I planned it all.

892
01:04:57,010 --> 01:04:59,720
I deliberately came looking for you.

893
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:04,310
I don't even know where I got the courage.

894
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,060
Funny, right?

895
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:09,140
Me, of all people?

896
01:05:09,850 --> 01:05:10,850
What was I planning?

897
01:05:12,190 --> 01:05:13,730
When I can't even do anything…

898
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:15,980
When I'm going to die soon…

899
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:31,540
Who says you can't do anything?

900
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,380
I told you,
you're someone who can do everything.

901
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:49,140
It's a pretty lame secret.

902
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:54,650
Do you want me
to tell you a bigger one, then?

903
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:09,200
Is it weird if someone like me…

904
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,040
likes someone like you?

905
01:06:25,470 --> 01:06:29,720
LEE GYUWON BOOKSTORE

906
01:06:56,790 --> 01:06:58,590
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN BORN THE SEA

907
01:06:58,670 --> 01:07:01,170
MOONLIGHT RIPPLES ENDLESSLY
ACROSS THE OCEAN'S SURFACE

908
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:03,720
IS IT THE NIGHT, THE TIDE,
MY HEART? I KEEP WAVERING.

909
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:06,470
LIKE TODAY, IF EVERY DAY WERE
FILLED WITH ONLY WHAT I LOVE

910
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:08,720
WITH THINGS LIKE YOU,
THE MOONLIGHT, AND THE SEA

911
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:10,640
- EVERY SEASON
A FAREWELL NOTE.

912
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:34,250
<i>There's something</i>
<i>going on between Mr. Lee and Daeum, right?</i>

913
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,960
<i>Is it you that likes her,</i>
<i>or her that likes you?</i>

914
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:41,380
I'm very interested in Daeum,

915
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:42,800
so I wanted some information.

916
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,050
<i>What are you doing?</i>

917
01:07:44,130 --> 01:07:46,630
Why drop an article like that
out of nowhere?

918
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:48,590
Has your face always been this pale?

919
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:52,100
This hospital is actually…

920
01:07:57,060 --> 01:07:58,860
I'll personally make sure

921
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,900
Daeum is pulled from the film.

922
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:03,860
Then what about your film?

923
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:06,570
Isn't the movie
what's most important to you?

924
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:09,570
Yes. Even if I have to give up this movie…

925
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,120
I'll return Daeum to this hospital.
