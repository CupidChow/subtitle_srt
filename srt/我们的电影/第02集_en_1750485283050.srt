Don't move if you want to live.

Sorry…

8
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,051
…but I'm just too tired.

9
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,096
You'll have to die quickly.

10
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,564
What the?

11
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,401
Wasn't I supposed to be the one to faint?

12
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,152
Gosh, she's driving me nuts.

13
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,279
Hey, you there.

14
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,365
You're not the one who got shot.

15
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,117
Hang on. Something's not right.

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,577
We should call an ambulance.

17
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,037
Are you all right?

18
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,207
Yes, we're in Sangam-dong…

<i>It's not like I lived in fear,</i>

20

EPISODE 2

23
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,181
Can you see the ocean?

24
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,810
There's no ocean here.

25
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:43,395
Oh?

26
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,439
That's strange.

27
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:49,067
I definitely see an ocean here.

28
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:51,028
What? Where did you get this thing?

29
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,574
I told you to rest
since you have a lot of tests tomorrow.

30
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,368
It's okay. I'll take her downstairs later.

31
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,245
Wow, the weather is so nice by the sea!

32
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,955
How is it this nice?

33
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,708
It's a perfect day for a tan.

34
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,336
Ta-da!

35
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:08,545
Come closer.

36
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,464
Are you in?

37
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,673
Give it to me. I'll do it.

38
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,634
Here, now. Say cheese.

39
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,678
We're on vacation at the beach.

40
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,472
<i>My mom was sick.</i>

41
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,185
<i>Not any normal patient,</i>
<i>but a strange one at that.</i>

42
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:29,191
It's all right.

43
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,959
It's only us here because of the rain.

44
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,920
I know! It's so fun!

45
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:54,132
Then do you want to do something
even more fun?

46
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,940
♪ <i>La, la, la, la.</i> ♪

47
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,233
♪ <i>La, la.</i> ♪

48
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:20,909
Is that the medicine
that makes you feel better?

49
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,913
- That's not medicine.
- What?

50
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:27,165
It's grape juice.

51
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,502
That's grape juice?

52
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,170
Sure.

53
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,256
Mom.

54
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,466
Grapes are purple.

55
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,512
And bananas are yellow.

56
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,849
But when they're peeled?

57
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:44,975
Hmm.

58
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,059
White.

59
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,185
That's right.

60
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,980
Grapes are purple,

61
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,526
but they're that color when you peel them.

62
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:58,029
You're always trying to trick me, Mom.

63
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,825
What, you're too grown
to fall for it anymore?

64
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,705
It's so hard to make my daughter laugh.

65
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,749
It's not funny.

66
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,502
You shouldn't laugh either.

67
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,131
It hurts you when you laugh.

68
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,303
Daeum.

69
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,806
I read somewhere

70
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:29,269
that the DNA that makes you cry
when you're sad

71
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:33,607
is the same as the one
that makes you smile

72
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,152
when you're happy.

73
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,449
You have to eat, Mom.

74
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,538
Daeum.

75
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,302
It's going to be okay,

76
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,180
for you

77
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,473
and for Dad.

78
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:30,831
Dad.

79
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,374
Yes?

80
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,545
What's "genetics"?

81
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,177
Lie down now.

82
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,021
I hoped she'd get
the best of her mom, not this.

83
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,777
<i>My mom still lives inside me,</i>

84
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,949
<i>and that's the one special thing</i>
<i>that only I get to have.</i>

85
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,952
<i>That's how my doctor father</i>
<i>taught eight-year-old me</i>

86
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,829
<i>about genetics.</i>

<i>For a moment,</i>

93
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,431
<i>I felt like I had become Frida Kahlo.</i>

94
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,641
<i>No,</i>

95
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,726
<i>I actually did become Frida Kahlo.</i>

96
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,898
You're awesome, Daeum!

97
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,195
You're the best, Daeum!

98
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,822
<i>In a life too short to live my own story…</i>

99

<i>…the chance to perform</i>
<i>many different lives</i>

101
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,287
<i>is exactly what I wanted to do.</i>

102
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,207
I'll run with everything I've got!

103
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,959
Great. Good luck. Let's do it!

104
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,169
- Let's do it!
- Yeah!

105
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,297
Don't move if you want to live.

106
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,054
<i>And so…</i>

107
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,808

108
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,563

<i>In the end,</i>

111
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,826
<i>I couldn't escape that grape juice either.</i>

112
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,661
Drip.

00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,705

<i>and had it by the time I turned 20.</i>

122
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,459
Okay.

One, two, three.

What's this, Doc?

145
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,269
Oh, just a movie
I was asked to consult for.

146
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,395
Put it down.

147
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,439
- Put it down.
- Can I meet him instead?

148
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:50,733
- Meet him? No. You take this back.
- No thank you.

149
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,486
Why are you being like this?

150
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,737
Please, just once.

151
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,323
Once or twice, I don't care.
I told you no!

152
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,783
I'm your consultant,

153
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,619
the terminal patient, Lee Daeum.

154
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,011
Your name,

155
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,804
it means "next"?

156
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:22,807
Yes.

158
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,814
Ah.

GRAPE 100

160
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,738
Oh, grape juice. That's why.

161
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,575
You must really like grapes.

162
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,994
Dr. Kim said I should bring this for you.

163
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,455
Not grapes. Grape juice.

164
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,000
Especially when it's
on a "buy two, get one free" deal.

165
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,419
But someone happened to take it from me.

166
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:58,092
I actually told you I didn't need it.

167
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:05,516
Why didn't you say hi in the funeral home?

168
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,688
I wanted to focus on my sadness.

169
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,152
Focus on your… Okay.

170
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,612
Actually,

171
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,783
would you mind if I record this session?

172
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,535
I'd need to listen again
while I'm writing.

173
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:26,996
Actually,

174
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,916
do you mind if I film this?

175
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,793
It's a little hobby of mine.

176
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,297
All right.

177
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,261
Okay.

178
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:53,273
I heard from Dr. Kim
that you're very sick.

179
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,780
Do I look sick to you right now?

180
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,407
No.

181
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,704
I feel okay right now,

182
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,707
but when I'm really sick, it shows a lot.

183
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,168
That's why I can't do
everything I want to do.

184
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,255
What is it you want to do?

185
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,840
Adultery.

186
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,133
Premeditated serial murder.

187
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,093
- Sorry?
- I'd like to die sometime.

188
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,678
Maybe even become a ghost.

189
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,266
And then be reborn again.

190
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,978
Why do I have so many things
I want to do?

191
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,606
There is one job
where you can do all of that.

192
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,318
Yes, and that is my dream job.

193
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,154
Ah.

194
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,947
So you want to be an actress.

195
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,198
What do you do now?

196
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,616
Now? Well…

197
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,077
not much, as you can see.

198
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:52,457
I don't see a big film career
coming anytime soon,

199
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,002
unless I star in a hospice documentary.

200
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,130
Or if I'm playing a terminal patient.

201
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,549
The film, <i>Love in White</i>…

202
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,927
Well, you've seen it
at Cinema Jongno that time.

203
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,262
Not just that time.

204
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:10,933
It's my favorite movie that I regularly
go back to whenever I need to.

205
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:14,854
Every time I watch it, I bawl my eyes out.

206
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,190
It's my go-to tearjerker flick.

207
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,108
That's what melodramas are for.

208
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:22,028
Crying your heart out like that

209
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,655
makes you feel
like you had some epic love.

210
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,575
It's an illusion, I guess.

211
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,619
It tricks you into that illusion.

212
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,245
It's not an illusion.

213
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,541
Falling in love, and sharing that love…

214
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,045
Even if someone leaves
and someone gets left behind,

215
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,047
it'll all be okay

216
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,340
as long as there's love.

217
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,469
Watching that

218
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,721
gives me the strength to go on.

219
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,892
If that kind of love really does exist,

220
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,853
I want to experience it too.

221
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:58,272
And to do that, I have to stay alive.

222
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,027
So basically, <i>Love in White</i> is my chemo

223
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,738
and my radiation therapy and so on.

224
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,698
Is that really something to cry over?

225
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:11,911
My eyes are teary just talking about it.

226
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:13,955
I don't get it at all.

227
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:25,842
Aren't you leaving?

228
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,886
I'm bored, so I thought I'd walk you back.

229
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,264
- I'm okay.
- I'm okay too.

230
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,724
I said I'm fine.

231
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,810
I said I'm fine too.

232
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,913
If you really don't want to go,
how about a walk with me?

233
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,879
It wasn't even my funeral,

234
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,798
but I found myself taking in every detail.

235
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,926
What kind of face the family was making,

236
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,304
who was grieving.

237
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,807
I took the funeral director's card…

238
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,270
…and I started getting scared right then.

239
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:22,899
I'm not even dead yet,

240
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,735
but the thought of dying
felt like death itself.

241
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,199
Once you get sick,

242
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:36,537
your life is completely different
from before your illness.

243
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,207
There's a reason why
they say ignorance is bliss.

244
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,759
Slowly sinking into death,

245
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,596
being suffocated by fear…

246
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,435
You don't know what that is, do you?

247
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,419
I do know that not knowing is bliss.

248
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,307
Can I ask you something too?

249
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:41,519
Yes, go on.

250
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,400
In your version of <i>Love in White</i>…

251
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,237
does the ending…

252
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,657
stay the same?

253
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:58,911
No.

254
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,330
In the end…

255
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,793
In the end, she'll probably die.

256
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,184
<i>That was the moment I realized…</i>

257
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,816
<i>maybe I can be the star of my own story,</i>

258
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,277
<i>as long as I</i>

259
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,322
<i>cast Lee Jeha into my life.</i>

260
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,411
This voice-over
is hogging too many scenes.

261
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:41,996
I need to trim it down.

262
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,957
Director Lee?

263
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,208
Yes?

264
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,627
I like it.

265
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,421
- You do?
- Yes.

266
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,715
Especially the scene

267
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,092
where the terminal Gyuwon
stops Hyunsang from dying.

268
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,845
You reversed it from the original.
Why the change?

269
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,264
After meeting terminally ill people,

270
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:04,185
I realized nothing
is as strong as their will to live.

271
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,187
I wanted that to come through.

272
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,776
Seoyoung's hot right now,
so now's the time to take her to Cannes.

273
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,403
This film has a clear purpose,

274
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,031
and it doesn't work at all without her.

275
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,034
Let's talk in person, Ms. Go.

276
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,915
This script better turn out well.

277
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,208
Ms. Go is a bit off.

278
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,503
You read the same draft, right?

279
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:34,757
Wouldn't Seoyoung be
a better Junghwa than Gyuwon?

280
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,135
Though I bet Ms. Go will shut that down.

281
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,388
Let's forget Ms. Go's obsession
with lead roles

282
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:44,141
and say the fairy tale of a superstar
taking a supporting role comes true.

283
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,936
Our main problem? The investors will walk.

284
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,604
They're going to leave us.

285
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,650
Then why bother holding auditions
if the role has been cast?

286
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,151
It's all about the optics, man.

287
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:57,029
An unknown actor lands the lead
after a tough audition?

288
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,657
It's a romantic story. Like <i>La La Land</i>.

289
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,159
Of course, that never happens here
or in Hollywood.

290
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:04,495
LOVE IN WHITE
AUDITION

291
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,706
Hello, my name is Kang Seoha.

292
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:07,832
Okay, Seoha.

293
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,626
Go to the last page
of the audition script.

294
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,169
You'll see your sides there.

295
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,462
"Hyunsang."

296
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,005
"Hyunsang!"

297
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,508
"There is no such right!"

298
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:21,220
"You've got to try living,
even if it kills you."

299
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,847
"Only then"…

300
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,600
"Only then your tomorrow will come."

301
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,686
"Do as I say

302
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,105
for just one month."

303
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,942
"If you still want to die after that,

304
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:38,320
then go ahead. Do whatever you want."

305
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,406
Okay, thank you.

306
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,409
My brain is about to shut down.

307
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,035
How many do we have left?

308
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,704
The next one is our last one today.

309
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,082
Hey, even her name means "next."

310
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,794
LEE DAEUM, 25 YEARS OLD

311
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:57,590
Yes, come in.

312
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,683
Hello!

313
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:11,103
My name is Lee Daeum, and I'm an actress.

314
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,239
What's that camcorder for?

315
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,910
Could I just point it at me
and keep it on?

316
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,580
You can't for security reasons.

317
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,041
Okay.

318
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,174
That darn camcorder.

319
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:42,760
Do you know her?

320
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,057
Do you know Director Lee?

321
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:50,768
No, I've never met him.

322
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,233
Nice to meet you, Director.

323
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,153
I'm not looking to cast
for a documentary film.

324
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,031
Yes, I know that very well.

325
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,575
I'm just desperate
to take on this terminal patient role.

326
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,245
Shall we start with the sides?

327
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:14,750
"Ms. Gyuwon,

328
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:16,961
just calm down."

329
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,840
"It wasn't even my funeral,

330
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,968
but I found myself
taking in every detail."

331
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,971
"I wanted my funeral to be different."

332
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,140
"So I took the funeral director's card"…

333
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,142
That's enough for that.

334
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,770
Let's go to the last page.

335
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,274
Read the part where Gyuwon
stops Hyunsang's suicide.

336
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,459
"Hyunsang."

337
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,091
"I won't…"

338
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,926
"I won't say a single word."

339
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,304
"Just…"

340
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,933
"Just stay for a moment."

341
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,189
Okay, that's great.

342
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,942
I like your reinterpretation of the lines.

343
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,905
Yes, well, I think that's enough.

344
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,197
You can leave now.

345
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,080
Thank you!

346
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:44,340
She's incredible.

347
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,134
She wasn't forcing it. Just pure feeling.

348
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:51,347
Shame the role is already cast, no?

349
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,528
Director Lee,
is there anything left to discuss?

350
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,864
The perfect lead just came to us.

351
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,430
<i>Doors are opening.</i>

352
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,268
Mr. Bu!

353
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:41,689
What's all this?
I told you to just come hang out!

354
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:43,899
You must be exhausted from the auditions.

355
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,734
Thought you might be hungry.

356
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,153
- What's this?
- Oh, wow! What is it?

357
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,614
A handwritten letter?

358
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,743
I know we've only just met,

359
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:58,080
but you're just as praiseworthy
as they say you are.

360
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,000
Can you tell the whole world that?

361
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:02,960
Jungwoo.

362
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,422
Thank you so much for doing this with me.

363
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,299
Don't even say that.
We go way back since <i>The Lonely People</i>.

364
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,385
He's so loyal, isn't he?

365
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,145
WAIT THERE FOR A MINUTE

366
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:38,495
<i>I want to live.</i>

367
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,713
<i>I want to live right now.</i>

368
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,800
<i>I want to live right now.</i>

369
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:59,850
Are you a patient or an actress?

370
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,811
I'm just Lee Daeum.

371
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:06,023
Why did you come here?
What were you thinking?

372
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,525
Are you serious about this?

373
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,195
Yes, I'm very serious.

374
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,280
You said that you were dying.

375
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,744
You said you only have a year left.

376
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,172
This is a film, not a hospice documentary.
And it's an audition.

377
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,424
You knew all that when you came in, right?

378
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:33,509
Yes.

379
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:37,054
You debuted with <i>The Lonely People</i>.
You've won a lot of awards.

380
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,348
You're obsessed with realism.

381
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,266
Infamous for having
a difficult personality.

382
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,102
Was involved in a scandal.

383
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,604
More famous as Lee Duyoung's son
than for your own work.

384
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,481
I looked it all up online.

385
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,610
Honestly, I didn't have to prepare much
in terms of acting.

386
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:53,946
I am that character.

387
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,449
What if you die?

388
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,414
What if you die during production?

389
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,000
Who'll die?

390
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,337
You.

391
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,555
Guess I was also desperate,
showing up here.

392
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:20,639
I'm sorry.

393
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:23,058
Let's pretend the audition didn't happen.

394
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,102
Wait!

395
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:30,732
Let's look at this
from a broader perspective.

396
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,068
What if I die during filming?
It'll go viral.

397
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,405
A terminal patient
playing a terminal role?

398
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,198
Even I'd want to watch that.

399
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:41,702
That's a big win for the investors.
Big win for you too.

400
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,370
Yeah. As long as I'm okay with it,

401
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,914
you or anyone involved
shouldn't have a problem, no?

402
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,501
How is it not a problem?
This is your life on the line.

403
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,253
Yes, and I'm fine with it.

404
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,423
I want to do this. Even if I die.

405
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,260
That's reckless and also selfish.

406
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,763
Not true. The film becomes a hit,

407
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:04,391
I get to have closure before I die,

408
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,560
and you'd make a comeback,

409
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,562
ride the success train to eternity.

410
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,398
Wow, look at that. Everyone wins, right?

411
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,192
It's also a bit…

412
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,486
bittersweet, I guess.

413
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:24,870
I don't know how you're so confident.

414
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:28,624
I get that you're sick,

415
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,959
but this is where I draw the line.

416
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:34,046
Find another way to get closure.
It can't be my movie, sorry.

417
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,633
I saw your face earlier.

418
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,636
To put it bluntly,
it felt like you totally fell for me.

419
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,263
Okay, I'll give you that.
You were good, but--

420
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:46,767
I can't really run,
so I can't really do action scenes.

421
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,728
Actually, even normal, everyday life
would be tough for me.

422
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,980
But this character is a terminal patient.

423
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,528
This is something I can really act well.

424
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:05,285
I want to do it,
even if it costs me everything.

425
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:08,789
Even if that's your life?

426
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,960
I don't have much time left anyway.

427
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:15,295
Would you rather die trying
or die full of regret?

428
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,298
If the roles were reversed,

429
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:20,425
would you answer differently?

430
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,804
So tell me…

431
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,520
How long do you think you have left?

432
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,362
How long do I need to live?

433
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,764
Were there any new scripts that came in?

434
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:09,599
Well, actually…

435
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:12,477
I heard Kim Jungin's script
is going around,

436
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:13,645
but it didn't reach us.

437
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,439
Anything from Lee Jeha?

438
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,566
I'm not sure.

439
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:21,987
I think I heard
he's doing a <i>Love in White</i> remake,

440
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,905
but it's not going so well.

441
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,620
I guess no one wants me anymore.

442
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:32,998
What do you mean? You've still got it.

443
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,916
You're the first one who got his script!

444
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,420
I knew it. It must've come to me first.

445
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:45,260
I'm sorry. I knew I should've come to you.

446
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,388
Forget it. What did you tell the studio?

447
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,766
What do you mean,
she's going to Hollywood?

448
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,476
It's what Ms. Go said.

449
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,103
She can't even speak English
and she's working abroad?

450
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,814
- Is it a silent film?
- A Korean character.

451
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,649
Oh, man.

452
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,151
Who's the director?

453
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,737
Damien Chazelle.

454
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,322
What? Cha-what?

455
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:07,115
Damien Chazelle.

456
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,241
Are you sure?

457
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,327
I couldn't push her

458
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:14,122
to go for Lee Jeha's film
when she's working with Damien Chaz…

459
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:17,334
- <i>The receiver is not available…</i>
- Oh, come on.

460
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,211
What should we do?

461
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:23,048
The investors think both Kim Jungwoo
and Chae Seoyoung have been confirmed.

462
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,175
Don't tell this to Jeha yet,

463
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:28,261
but let's focus more on the male lead
since Jungwoo is the star.

464
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:32,390
I guess the female lead
could be the one we saw at the audition.

465
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:33,767
That's the worst-case scenario.

466
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,353
Try persuading Seoyoung
right until production begins,

467
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,438
and if she's in, then the rookie is out.

468
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,399
Yes, I'll make it happen.

469
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,279
- What about Ms. Go?
- She can't be in the picture.

470
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,825
We have to get Jeha
to talk directly to Seoyoung.

471
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:50,909
Okay?

472
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:06,508
Something wrong? You seem down.

473
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,886
I just came from the agency,
and now I have to go back.

474
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,013
I guess Ms. Go pulled something again?

475
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:13,640
Something like that.

476
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,058
I'll tell you when I get back.

477
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:18,311
Oh, I heard you went to see
the <i>Love in White </i>auditions.

478
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:20,856
Yes, they made a big thing out of it.

479
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,192
Should I do that too?

480
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:30,448
Why the face?

481
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,075
You wanted to do it with me.

482
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,202
Of course.

483
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,041
Let's just go.

484
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,719
HOW LONG

485
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,306
DO I NEED TO LIVE?

486
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:01,021
<i>Lee Daeum.</i>

487
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:06,318
<i>Adultery. Premeditated serial murder.</i>

488
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,236
<i>Maybe even become a ghost.</i>

489
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,284
How long do I need to live?

490
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,041
Six months?

491
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:23,877
A year?

492
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,341
Can you please tell me?

493
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,219
Well…

494
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,387
I guess…

495
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:36,890
Sorry, could you pass me that ball?

496
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:43,063
Oh, of course.

497
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,884
So how long do I need to live already?

498
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,931
What, you think
you're in <i>Autumn in My Heart</i>?

499
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:20,475
Here's your Americano.

500
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,893
Yes, thank you.

501
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:34,489
Mr. Lee.

502
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,242
I heard you want to be a writer.

503
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,912
What do you think is wrong with my script?

504
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,207
You can be straight with me.

505
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:45,875
Well…

506
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:49,004
Can I be frank then?

507
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,924
I'm not sure why you're doing a remake.

508
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,676
<i>Love in White </i>came out

509
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:59,264
right in the middle of the '90s
melodrama boom in the industry.

510
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:03,393
I think that classic sentiment
transcends both time and age.

511
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,687
I've never even been in love,
and even I get giddy.

512
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,273
Go on.

513
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:13,862
The way you've twisted Gyuwon's character
is really fascinating, but…

514
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,114
it feels hollow.

515
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,618
Like something essential is missing.

516
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:22,829
Let me guess. Love?

517
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,124
Of course, it's love.

518
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,877
Take away love,
and you lose the foundation

519
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,963
and the reason to remake the film
in the first place.

520
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,798
Oh, one more.

521
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:36,301
I want to know what Gyuwon wants to do

522
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,303
besides saving Hyunsang.

523
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,514
What were her dreams before she got sick?

524
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,477
It'd be even sadder
if she has a lot she wants to accomplish.

525
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,274
You scared me.

526
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:54,027
What are you doing here?
What about your shoot?

527
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,779
Obviously, I didn't go.

528
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,408
That darn Ms. Park.

529
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,911
Did you read the pitch?

530
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,164
Do I have to read it?

531
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:07,916
I know the original.

532
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,085
Of course you didn't.

533
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:13,797
Did you forget that I choose the scripts
that come to me?

534
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,423
Now that's a bit harsh.

535
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,967
We've been doing that all along.

536
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:19,969
<i>Love in White</i> was just an exception.

537
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:21,388
I want to do that movie.

538
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,557
You have no good reason to do that

539
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:27,435
when there are better directors
with better scripts who want you.

540
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,771
Better directors?

541
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,231
Better scripts?

542
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,566
What exactly makes them better?

543
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,902
Something worthy
of the actress Chae Seoyoung.

544
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,154
Yes, I'm an actress.

545
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:40,615
So I need a movie that I want to do.

546
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:43,493
Let's do that. Next time.

547
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,161
No, this time.

548
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:49,249
There's no good reason?
I want to do it, and that's reason enough.

549
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,668
That's how I work as an actress, Ms. Go.

550
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,337
<i>Once you get sick,</i>

551
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,716
<i>your life is completely different</i>
<i>from before your illness.</i>

552
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,635
<i>There's a reason why</i>
<i>they say ignorance is bliss.</i>

553
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,556
<i>What is it you want to do?</i>

554
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,474
<i>Why do I have so many things I want to do?</i>

555
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,562
<i>Yes, and that is my dream job.</i>

556
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:18,445
LEE DAEUM

557
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,948
THIS IS LEE JEHA

558
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,382
THIS IS LEE JEHA

559
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,553
Hello?

560
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,723
<i>Mr. Lee, this is Ms. Go.</i>
<i>Can I see you tomorrow?</i>

561
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,694
You work in places like this?

562
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:02,405
Yes, I need
some background noise to focus.

563
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:04,449
That's good.

564
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,702
This situation we're in
is getting a lot of noise, so focus.

565
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:12,749
I don't have any personal feelings
for or against you.

566
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,667
You know that, right?

567
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:17,295
I know what you're talking about,

568
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,546
but the script has…

569
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,841
been changed these past few weeks.

570
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:23,551
Especially the character.

571
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,554
I'm sorry to tell you that these changes

572
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:29,224
don't make Seoyoung
suitable for the role anymore.

573
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,643
That's good.

574
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,231
I didn't need to come at all.

575
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:40,485
Sorry I can't give her the lead role,
but I want to suggest

576
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,320
the role of Junghwa.

577
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,488
I think…

578
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:47,283
Seoyoung would want to do it.

579
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,035
Are you kidding?

580
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:53,248
I'm saying this
with my sincerest apologies to you.

581
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,627
Director Lee…

582
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:01,214
have you forgotten everything
or are you just pretending to?

583
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:06,219
You're the one who abandoned Seoyoung.

584
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,303
The nerve.

585
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,308
<i>Mr. Lee,</i>

586
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:15,436
you know how this industry works.
Why are you doing this?

587
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,648
You know if a scandal hits Seoyoung now,

588
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,192
it would tank her career
before it even takes off.

589
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,402
Ms. Go.

590
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,362
Why are you leaving me out?

591
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:26,990
Let me hear it too.

592
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:29,951
You've got to be kidding me.

593
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:33,830
You've already got four ad deals signed
and over five more lined up.

594
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:38,251
So what's the problem?
It's not like dating him will ruin me.

595
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,335
Just acknowledge it.

596
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,671
No, stop the press.

597
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,841
Director.

598
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:50,179
Yes, we're friendly.
But we've never crossed the line.

599
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,641
I'd like to apologize if I did anything

600
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,103
to make her think otherwise.

601
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,105
<i>That was the first time</i>

602
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,775
<i>that Seoyoung got completely wrecked.</i>

603
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:05,570
She should've been the one to dump you.

604
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,866
I won't…

605
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,619
be fooled by you a second time.

606
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,425
LOVE IN WHITE

607
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,385
<i>Love in White</i>.

608
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:32,931
Do as I say for just one month.

609
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:46,903
DIRECTOR LEE JEHA

610
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,197
THIS IS LEE JEHA. I KNOW
IT'S LATE, BUT CAN WE MEET?

611
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:58,665
Hey there, little girl.

612
00:40:58,748 --> 00:40:59,999
Want to see something cool?

613
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,777
SEAWEED SNACK

614
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,697
That act is a bit too much,
don't you think?

615
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,784
What act?

616
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,870
That's the snack they normally eat

617
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:40,081
at funeral homes.

618
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,877
I tried these there last time

619
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:46,796
and got totally hooked.

620
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,844
Do you stay at the hospital,
or your own place?

621
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,599
I don't give my address to men.

622
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:01,144
You see me as a man?

623
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:05,565
Well, you're not a woman.

624
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,570
You're not even offering me those?

625
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:32,925
Mmm.

626
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:34,719
How should I put it?

627
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,554
A subtle taste…

628
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:39,557
that really hooks you.

629
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:41,893
A subtle taste that hooks you.

630
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,692
How did you do
that drinking thing earlier?

631
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,569
Want me to show you?

632
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,237
No, it's fine.

633
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:56,324
I wanted to consult…

634
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:01,954
…you…

635
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,249
There's something I wanted to ask you.

636
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:12,465
I failed the audition,
but you still want to consult me?

637
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,518
Go on, ask me anything.

638
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:28,106
Was there something you wanted to do?

639
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:30,399
I told you last time, didn't I?

640
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:32,568
Adultery, murder, ghost.

641
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:35,196
No, not what you'd do in movies.

642
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:39,075
You know, a normal dream you've had.

643
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:40,827
Dream?

644
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,792
I want to tell you
something ambitious, but…

645
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,634
I want to leave something
for the people I love.

646
00:43:58,761 --> 00:43:59,762
Like what?

647
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:02,223
Memories of me they can always bring up.

648
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:05,685
Ah.

649
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,771
So now we're in…

650
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,358
the "dream" phase
of that closure you wanted?

651
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:17,029
There's just so much left undone.

652
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:21,450
That kind of regret
makes you go a little too crazy.

653
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,828
There's so much I haven't done,

654
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:26,914
but it's not like I can do it "later."

655
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:29,250
So that's why you want to be in movies.

656
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,252
Because I can do everything in there.

657
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:34,922
The love I never had.
Goodbyes I don't want to say.

658
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:39,969
And I want myself to live free
and go wild like this…

659
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,431
in those movies

660
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:46,142
so people can see that whenever they want.

661
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,728
- Like who?
- My dad.

662
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,107
My mom passed a long time ago,

663
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:55,526
so if I leave, too,

664
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,695
then my dad is really alone.

665
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:03,492
You can consult me, too, if you want.
I'm also alone.

666
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,788
Hey, now.

667
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:10,208
This is getting too dark.

668
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,084
Let's not talk about my dad, okay?

669
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:14,670
I didn't.
You were the one who brought him up.

670
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:19,133
Hang on.

671
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:45,076
That was the first audition I passed
for a role with a name and lines.

672
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,495
It was just the first round,

673
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,580
but I felt good about the second.

674
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,458
I had prepared so hard…

675
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:56,462
That's when you first got sick?

676
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:03,511
The day I was admitted
was the day of the second round.

677
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,391
But I'm pretty realistic
for a terminal patient.

678
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,017
I knew I had to live first.

679
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,937
So I told myself,

680
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,732
"I'll survive and come back
for another audition."

681
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,527
So I walked away, swallowing my tears.

682
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,321
Is that so?

683
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:25,533
Yes, it was so.

684
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:30,955
That must've been hard.
I know hospital life isn't easy.

685
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,290
Not at all.

686
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:33,874
I was super busy.

687
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:36,294
I kept acting.

688
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,337
I had nothing but time.

689
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:43,384
I mean, sure, it wasn't
in front of those big cameras on set,

690
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,177
but a tiny one the size of my palm,

691
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:48,306
but I tried
every kind of character I wanted.

692
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,559
You live so hard.

693
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:54,020
I guess I shouldn't assume things,

694
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:56,814
since you keep proving me wrong.

695
00:46:57,398 --> 00:46:58,399
Mr. Lee…

696
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,572
Knowing your time is running out,

697
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:07,074
it's a strange kind of rush.

698
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:16,375
Everyone!

699
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,628
You think you have a lot of days to live?

700
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:22,590
You think you'll live forever?

701
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:27,053
You think you'll stay healthy

702
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:30,181
until you're 40, 70, 80,

703
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,224
and even 100, right?

704
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,643
Who's she shouting at?

705
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:37,563
But life works in mysterious ways!

706
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:40,191
You always forget, don't you?

707
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,319
But I never forget!

708
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:47,239
I've been preparing for this
since I was eight years old,

709
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:50,326
so every second of every minute
is so precious

710
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,078
and so valuable to me

711
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:54,705
that they're all masterpieces!

712
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:58,542
All the moments you just let slip away

713
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:01,337
are like romance or fantasy films to me!

714
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:05,591
But you'll keep on living
without knowing that!

715
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:09,512
You idiots!

716
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,446
That kind of rush.

717
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:30,574
What are you doing?

718
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,576
Honestly,

719
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:36,163
it'd make more sense
to cast me as an actress,

720
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:39,417
instead of using me for consulting.

721
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,253
It'd make more sense
for you to head back in.

722
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,921
It's cold.

723
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:57,935
Good night then.

724
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,614
You know,

725
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:12,992
I really want

726
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,120
to make this movie with you.

727
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:20,666
Can't I be a part of it?

728
00:49:29,258 --> 00:49:30,342
Wait!

729
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:34,722
Why…

730
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:37,600
does it have to be me?

731
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:41,061
- Sorry?
- Why do you want to make a film

732
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,481
with me?

733
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,321
I don't know.

734
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:56,702
I just…

735
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,539
had the feeling

736
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,376
you might give me a chance!

Hey, Hong.

743
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:17,116
Sorry to call you this late.

744
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:23,956
- Dad.
- Yeah?

745
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,624
- I'm home.
- Hey.

746
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:29,128
Hey, Mom.

747
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:31,880
Mom.

748
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:33,173
How have you been?

749
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,681
What's all this?

750
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:42,808
Vietnamese spring rolls.

751
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:45,185
Not exactly traditional for a memorial.

752
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:48,606
I want us to eat some trendy stuff
instead of the usual.

753
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:51,275
I like it.

754
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:57,031
You know, Gyoyeong says
you and I have "cool syndrome."

755
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,199
What's that?

756
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:00,326
Well…

757
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:03,746
Pretending to be too cool with each other,
and overdoing it.

758
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:07,916
How can I be cool
when my daughter is about to die?

759
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,001
Cool?

760
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,544
Freeze me to death, will ya?

761
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:15,841
Hey, I want to be cool, too, you know.

762
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,971
So then, in the spirit of being cool,

763
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:24,475
could you make me an outpatient
and let me act again?

764
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:27,686
What are you saying?

765
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:30,314
I want to act.

766
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,316
I want to act again.

767
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:35,569
No.

768
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:38,489
- Dad, please.
- I said no.

769
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,866
- Just once, please.
- No.

770
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:44,495
What if you pass out like last time?

771
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:46,747
How could I

772
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:50,084
face your mom again
if I go easy on your treatment--

773
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,211
That's just your perspective, Dad.

774
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:53,337
I won't allow it.

775
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:54,838
Dad.

776
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:57,591
Your view is different
from mine and Mom's.

777
00:52:58,759 --> 00:52:59,927
You still don't get that?

778
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,597
Mom always wanted to come home.

779
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:04,682
But…

780
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:09,311
She couldn't.

781
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:13,107
She wanted to die here at home,

782
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,150
but she passed away at the hospital

783
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:17,861
while you were in surgery
and I was at school.

784
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:20,489
She died all alone with no one there.

785
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:24,326
Dad.

786
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:26,578
I'm her daughter.

787
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:28,622
Maybe that's why

788
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,417
I don't want to die in a hospital either.

789
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:34,378
No.

790
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:39,425
I said no.

791
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,564
CONGRATULATIONS ON PASSING ROUND
1 OF "WHITE IN LOVE" AUDITIONS

792
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:37,816
My goodness!

793
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:42,905
Yes! Yes!

794
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:49,745
Great, you're here.

795
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:52,789
Say hello.

796
00:54:53,874 --> 00:54:54,958
- Hello.
- Yes.

797
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:58,170
Great to see you.
I've been hoping to meet you,

798
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,881
so I've been pestering Mr. Bu for a while.

799
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:04,259
HAN SUNGHO

800
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:05,677
<i>Actually,</i>

801
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:08,472
I don't know much about movies,
to be honest.

802
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:11,975
I leave that part to the artists.

803
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:16,313
I'm just a businessman who cares about
whether this will make money,

804
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:18,398
and how much money it'll make.

805
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:20,025
That's what matters to me.

806
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:22,736
Why would you talk yourself down?

807
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,279
He's being too modest.

808
00:55:24,363 --> 00:55:26,114
A movie just on its own

809
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:28,617
is not enough anymore these days.

810
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,453
You know what I'm saying, right?

811
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:40,879
I'm curious, what did you think
of the original <i>Love in White</i>?

812
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,382
Never seen it.

813
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:46,927
Then…

814
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:50,264
Have you seen my adaptation plan?

815
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,682
Well,

816
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:53,850
I heard the gist.

817
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:00,274
I'm not copying some dusty old film.

818
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,818
It'll be something completely new.

819
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:04,695
I wanted to be up-front about that.

820
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,781
I see, but do I really need to know that?

821
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,826
Do you think that's important to me?

822
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:14,788
You're only investing because…

823
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:17,666
I'm Lee Duyoung's son, right?

824
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:20,294
That's all that matters to you.

825
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:23,422
Ah. Our director here sure is candid.

826
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:24,923
Says it like it is.

827
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:28,468
Most people wouldn't agree to do this.

828
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:33,432
My father made the film
a year after my mother passed

829
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:37,227
with the very actress he was rumored
to be having an affair with.

830
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:41,607
They shamelessly pour out this ode to love
as if they were finally free.

831
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,067
People think…

832
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:48,905
it's a heartfelt tribute to the dead wife
that he made in grief,

833
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:52,075
and they praise it
like it's something noble.

834
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:54,161
Forget the film.

835
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,288
It's the story behind the film.

836
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:58,915
That's where the real fun is.

837
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:05,339
I know this film and what needs fixing
better than anyone.

838
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,299
And I promise,

839
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:09,426
you won't lose a cent.

841
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:28,445
It's me, Daeum!

842
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:31,823
Could you wake her up?

843
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,787
Leave her. She must've come in
in the morning again.

844
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:40,332
Take some of this food when you go later.

845
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:41,500
About time for a refill.

846
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,002
Aren't these elephant bush stems?

847
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:46,296
Are you marinating them in perilla oil?

848
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,925
I'll stir-fry them
with a ton of perilla oil.

849
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,302
Thank you.

850
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,055
Instead of me…

851
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:58,392
Instead of me…

852
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:02,312
Oh, she's driving me nuts.
Can you just go and wake her up?

853
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,152
Gyo.

854
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,782
What happened to you?

855
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,283
- Huh? Daeum.
- Yeah?

856
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:18,829
I told you not to wake me up like this.

857
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,416
Why are your eyes so puffy?

858
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,543
I dumped him.

859
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:28,839
You're such a sucker for cute faces.
What did I tell you?

860
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:31,758
You have to get to know them first
before dating them.

861
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,510
Who asked for your two cents?

862
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:37,097
I'll have you know,
that's a hereditary trait.

863
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,516
My mom fell for my dad's face too.

864
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:45,564
Oh, right.

865
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:48,066
- Did you go back home?
- Yeah.

866
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:49,151
How's your dad?

867
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,277
Fine.

868
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:53,405
I told him everything, you know.

869
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,574
How you said we're both

870
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:58,243
riddled with "cool syndrome."

871
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,037
What?

872
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:03,999
Jeez! Why would you tell him that?

873
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,333
Seriously!

874
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:07,085
I can't even slap you.

875
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,380
Well, anyway.

876
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,925
Just make sure
your next relationship goes well.

877
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:15,260
What?

878
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:17,345
Hmm?

879
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:22,934
Spit it out. Something happened, right?

880
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:28,690
- The clinical trial?
- My audition!

881
00:59:28,774 --> 00:59:29,775
What did you say?

882
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:32,444
I auditioned for a movie.

883
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,448
How did you do that?

884
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:39,075
I just barged in and did it.

885
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:40,202
You know what happened?

886
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:44,456
CONGRATULATIONS ON PASSING ROUND

What is it?

888
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:52,923
What happened? What is it?

889
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,758
Is it a cockroach?

890
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:57,969
- Mom.
- Let me see.

891
00:59:58,512 --> 00:59:59,471
CONGRATULATIONS ON PASSING ROUND
1 OF "WHITE IN LOVE" AUDITIONS

892
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:05,018
Congratulations!

893
01:00:07,479 --> 01:00:09,189
I'm so happy for you.

894
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:15,070
Please tell me two things.

895
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,405
"Well done."

896
01:00:18,907 --> 01:00:20,283
and "Good luck."

897
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:24,329
Well done.

898
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:25,831
Good luck.

899
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:29,042
Well done! Good luck!

900
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:39,845
I see you've mostly worked on short films.

901
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:41,304
- Yes.
- Right.

902
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:44,891
What do you do in your free time
when you're not acting?

903
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,103
I work as a freelance translator.

904
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:50,564
How have you been after the first round?

905
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,274
I've been well, thank you.

906
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:53,650
What have you been up to?

907
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:57,946
I went to some university hospitals
to do research on Gyuwon.

908
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:59,072
University hospitals?

909
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:01,032
Okay, Taerin.

910
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:03,368
That's enough for today. Thank you.

911
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:04,911
Okay, thank you.

912
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:10,000
- Take care, Mr. Lee.
- Goodbye.

913
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:27,017
Oh, no.

914
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,185
I'm sorry, Dr. Lee.

915
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:32,689
Why? What happened?

916
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:36,985
Daeum is gone.

917
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,788
Lee Daeum is coming in.

918
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:52,876
- Thank you.
- You got this.

919
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:53,960
I got this.

920
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:11,061
Hello!

921
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:12,854
Yes, hello.

922
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,148
Take a seat.

923
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,115
So I've analyzed the character.

924
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:31,998
You're not here to act
or analyze the character today.

925
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:33,708
Instead,

926
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:35,043
let's have a chat.

927
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:36,586
Just the two of us.

928
01:02:38,338 --> 01:02:39,506
Just the two of us?

929
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:40,590
Yes.

930
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:42,342
You know,

931
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:45,428
just chat like you normally do.

932
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:48,348
Okay, Mr. Lee.

933
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:53,144
Don't let the camera bother you.

934
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:55,188
We won't use this footage for anything.

935
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:59,025
Relax, and talk how you normally do to me.

936
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:07,784
Don't you think this character
and this film are too cliché?

937
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:09,577
I do.

938
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:14,833
You do?

939
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:17,335
Some people might even find it boring.

940
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:19,754
Seems like you find it boring too.

941
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:23,550
But it'll never be boring to me.

942
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:26,678
When that "terminal illness" cliché
is your life,

943
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:29,597
every day feels like
the climax of a movie.

944
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:34,227
This will be real method acting.

945
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:40,316
It sounds like you're okay
with this movie using your illness.

946
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,360
But you already did.

947
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:45,572
You used my words in your script.

948
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:48,616
I'll change the lines then.

949
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:52,996
Have you found someone better than me?

950
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:55,081
We're searching.

951
01:03:57,167 --> 01:03:59,127
Don't waste your time like that.

952
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:02,172
I just don't see this happening.

953
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:07,177
I want to forget about my illness
and live as an actress.

954
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:10,055
There's a difference between forgetting

955
01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:11,681
and overlooking.

956
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:19,939
I'm attending an audition right now,

957
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:23,777
so please see me as an actress,
not a sick person.

958
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:44,631
There were over 200 videos
of you doing monologues.

959
01:04:45,507 --> 01:04:46,883
I wanted to ask…

960
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:52,305
what drove you to come this far

961
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,433
even while you were sick?

962
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:58,019
When I was eight,

963
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,815
I asked my mom lying in the hospital bed

964
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:04,359
what her dream was.

965
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:07,028
I still remember the face she made.

966
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:11,491
If she ever got to leave the hospital,

967
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:14,119
she said she wanted to find
the dream that she had forgotten.

968
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:17,080
I don't know what her dream was,

969
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:18,873
but it sure wasn't being a patient.

970
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:21,501
Same goes for me.

971
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:26,506
That's the kind of thinking
that brought me here.

972
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,175
I don't know if that makes sense.

973
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:42,689
Are you hungry?

974
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:45,316
Give me 10 minutes.

975
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:51,239
Mr. Lee,

976
01:05:52,532 --> 01:05:53,658
even though I'm sick,

977
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:56,703
I can still watch movies,
go to auditions, and even love.

978
01:05:57,453 --> 01:05:59,247
So I can make movies too.

979
01:05:59,998 --> 01:06:02,417
I can do everything. I really can.

980
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,085
Just let me prove that to you.

981
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:09,132
That's enough for today.

982
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:10,383
You may leave now.

983
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:12,635
We'll let you know the results.

984
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:26,524
Thank you.

985
01:06:36,034 --> 01:06:37,160
Mr. Lee.

986
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:39,746
Yes?

987
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:43,041
Put your faith in me.

988
01:06:46,878 --> 01:06:49,172
What exactly do you have
that I can put my faith in?

989
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:51,174
A plan…

990
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,051
and guts.

991
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:01,267
Looks flimsy to me.

992
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:04,187
But I like your spirit.

993
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:40,223
I have one condition.

994
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:47,021
Don't die.

995
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:35,737
<i>Everyone knows</i>
<i>Chae Seoyoung should get the part.</i>

996
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:38,614
<i>Why are you so stuck on Lee Daeum?</i>

997
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:40,992
<i>What is it about her?</i>

998
01:08:41,576 --> 01:08:42,702
A rookie?

999
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:44,162
You just need to do it.

1000
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:45,997
<i>I'll make it happen.</i>

1001
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:48,541
<i>What's this?</i>

1002
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:50,376
<i>We're deciding if the role of Gyuwon</i>

1003
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,253
<i>should go to Chae Seoyoung</i>
<i>or you, a rookie.</i>

1004
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:54,839
<i>Did you read the script?</i>

1005
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:56,716
<i>Are you interested?</i>

1006
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:58,760
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

1007
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:07,060
