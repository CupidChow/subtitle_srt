Ms. Lee Daeum.

9
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,420
Is Ms. Lee Daeum here?

10
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,260
Lee Daeum?

11
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,340
Hey.

12
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,840
Isn't Lee Daeum
the one Mr. Lee had his eye on?

13
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,010
Exactly.

14
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,850
We even confirmed she was coming.
What's up with her?

15
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,700
- I'll just move on.
- Hmm.

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,200
Next up, Chae Seoyoung.

17
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,790
- Yes?
- You can head in.

18
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,580
Okay.

19
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,170
Just relax.

20
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,250
I took a look around,

21
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,800
and you're the only one fit for the lead.

22
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,670
Okay. Good luck.

23
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,510
Hello.

DIRECTOR LEE JEHA

28
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,770
Yes, Mr. Lee!

29
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,890
Where do you live? I mean,

30
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,400
what's your hospital room number?

31
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,150
I'm out of the hospital now.

32
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,360
Didn't you say
you had to stay at the hospital?

33
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,530
I switched to outpatient treatment.
I'll explain later.

34
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,910
So where are you staying now?
Give me your address.

35
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,660
Why?

36
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,330
So I can send you the script.

37
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,880
DIRECTOR LEE JEHA

38
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,510
Mr. Lee?

39
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,890
Yes. Why did you hang up?

40
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,510
What do you mean by that?

41
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,350
What would it mean when a director
sends his script to an actress?

42
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,520
I'll see you later.

43
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,120
Thank you!

44
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,000
TIME FOR MEDS

45
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,270
Hello, Dr. Lee.

46
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,980
Okay, don't worry.

47
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:10,360
She can run all she wants,
but she's still in the palm of our hands.

48
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,450
So you're really dead set on this, huh?

49
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,040
- What's this? Is it for me?
- Mm-mmm.

50
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,370
Did you have a fight with your father?

51
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,920
Did something happen?

52
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,500
- She ran away.
- How could you?

53
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,630
She's in her teen rebellion phase
in her 20s.

54
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,090
BONE HEALTH SUPPLEMENT

55
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,470
So these are bribes.

56
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,550
Not bribes. They're gifts.

57
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,810
Auntie.

58
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:40,230
Well, look at our Daeum
acting completely out of the norm.

59
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,690
These look great.

60
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,900
Makes sense. You've been
juggling the café and the house.

61
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,190
Can I take some too?

62
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,030
Don't you dare.

63
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,450
I've been bumping into things,
getting sore all over lately,

64
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,620
so this is perfect.

65
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,330
It's important to stay proactive
with this stuff.

66
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,120
Sure.

67
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,000
Mmm. So thoughtful.

68
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,010
You offered Seoyoung the role of Junghwa?

69
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,930
Everyone knows
Chae Seoyoung should get the lead.

70
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,760
It's an old melodrama,
so why not try some new casting?

71
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,680
New? Who?

72
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,560
You mean Lee Daeum?

73
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,940
Come on, this isn't Hollywood!

74
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,230
Weren't you the one swooning over
how this was like <i>La La Land</i>?

75
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,730
But that film's lead, Emma Watson,
was an A-list actress

76
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,440
that everyone in the world knew!

77
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,400
Here in Korea, only Chae Seoyoung
is on the level of Emma Watson--

78
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,280
Not Watson, Stone. Emma Stone.

79
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,610
What?

80
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,990
…son.

81
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,290
Hey, stop nitpicking.

82
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,120
Why are you so stuck on Lee Daeum?

83
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,620
What is it about her?

84
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,290
She's got something. Something we don't.

85
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,670
Anyway, you promised to support me
over soju and cold noodles.

86
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,590
You haven't forgotten already, right?

87
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,130
I'm off.

88
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,480
- Have a nice day.
- Have a nice day.

89
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,100
Crazy bastard.
Acting like he's making some art.

90
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,570
What about the female lead?

91
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,860
Word's been out for a while
that Seoyoung's got the part.

92
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,990
You two costarring would be great for us.

93
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,330
As long as you both
stay away from a scandal.

94
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,620
Great for who exactly?

95
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,840
No…
…that wouldn't be great for anyone.

96
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,670
Should be coming any minute now.

97
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,220
- Hello.
- Hello.

98
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,350
She's so pretty.

99
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,730
Seoyoung!
What are you doing here?

100
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,730
Mr. Bu.

101
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,690
Jeha doesn't know
you sent this script to me, does he?

102
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,110
He doesn't.

103
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:58,740
It seems like Jeha
doesn't want to cast me,

104
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,530
but you want to because of the investors.

105
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,990
How did you know?

106
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,540
How can an actress be in a project
if the director doesn't want her?

107
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,000
It's funny, though.
Why doesn't he want me?

108
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:16,050
He's fixated on some rookie
from the audition.

109
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,300
A rookie?

110
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,100
Don't worry. You're Chae Seoyoung.

111
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,060
You just need to do it.
I'll make it happen.

112
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,810
You haven't even told him about this.
What can you do?

113
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,150
Don't worry about how it looks.

114
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,320
Seoyoung,

115
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,360
just leave Jeha to me.

116
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,110
I think you got the order wrong.

117
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,200
I should speak to Jeha first.

118
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,280
We'll meet

119
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,160
and decide it for ourselves.

120
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,790
Goodness. You shouldn't trouble yourself.

121
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,580
- See you!
- Take care.

122
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,380
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

123
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,000
Of course,

124
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,590
you should go to him directly
and decide if for yourselves, hmm?

125
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,760
That's how it should go.

126
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,180
Hey, do you want a scoop for an article?

127
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
Mr. Lee!

128
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,540
What's this?

129
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,330
What about it?

130
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,300
I've never been dumped before,

131
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,130
but this sure feels
like being dumped for no reason.

132
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,680
It's like it says here. She's "in talks."

133
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,260
We're deciding if the role of Gyuwon

134
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,470
should go to Chae Seoyoung
or you, a rookie.

135
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,430
Casts change all the time,
even in the middle of filming.

136
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,900
And there are literally
hundreds of reasons for that.

137
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,230
Hundreds? Really?

138
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,860
I'm saying…

139
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,530
The lead was originally

140
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,820
offered to Chae Seoyoung, but she passed.

141
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,580
Then you aced the audition
and became next in line.

142
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,620
That's my side of the story,
as the director.

143
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,080
The studio has its own take.

144
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,170
But why her, of all people?

145
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,300
"Of all people"?

146
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,960
I just really like her.

147
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,930
So that's what this is about.

148
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,890
In that case, I like you best
for the role of Gyuwon.

149
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,270
Anyway,
I'm not giving up this time.

150
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,270
"This time"?

151
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,150
Yes.

152
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,070
We should've signed an agreement
or something first.

153
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,410
- Let's go.
- Go where?

154
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,830
You said we should sign an agreement.

155
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,760
THE WIDOW
A WOMAN JUDGE

156
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,390
Wow.

157
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,300
What would you like?

158
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,350
The worst thing on the menu.

159
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,190
Everything's pretty bad here,

160
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,060
so just pick anything.

161
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,650
KIWI BASIL PESTO,
TANGERINE RAMYEON,

162
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,730
TANGERINE CURRY NOODLES,
CUCUMBER RICE

163
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,320
What can I get you?

164
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,820
Yeah, the worst thing on the menu.

165
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,820
I was just kidding.

166
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,200
The best thing on the menu, please.

167
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,410
Okay, then give us
the best-looking bad dish.

168
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,540
Of course. Got it.

169
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,050
Is he a friend?

170
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,130
Yes.

171
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,010
I didn't know you had friends.

172
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,600
Wow, that's unexpected. Hmm.

173
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,370
Don't people usually take meds
after eating?

174
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,870
Yes, I have to take more meds
after eating too.

175
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,750
Don't be so surprised.

176
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,800
You swallowed everything at once.

177
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,090
You're not good
at swallowing pills, are you?

178
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,550
I'm so proud of myself now.

179
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,430
There's something I'm better at than you.

180
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:38,650
Like you said, we do need an agreement.

181
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,900
All you've got are some clips of you
doing monologues against a wall.

182
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,110
So why do you think I want to cast you?

183
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,610
For realism?

184
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,740
That's right. I'm casting someone
with a terminal illness

185
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,160
to play a terminally ill character.

186
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,080
If the world hears about this,

187
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,870
people will call me
unethical and exploitative

188
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,830
and I'll be completely ruined.

189
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,170
I think you're overreacting a bit.

190
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,300
If you can't take this risk seriously,
then there's no agreement.

191
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,390
No.

192
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,350
Who could be more serious than someone
who's risking her life just to be here?

193
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,730
I'm also serious enough
to risk getting my life

194
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,390
ruined for this.

195
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,190
First condition of this agreement:

196
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,860
no one on the outside
can find out about your illness.

197
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,530
And for that,
since I'm the only one who knows,

198
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:31,200
I need to know you inside and out,
more than anyone else.

199
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,570
The second condition is…

200
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,450
you can't die until the film is finished.

201
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,420
Let's sign a confidentiality agreement
for both our sakes.

202
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,710
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

203
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,420
I have a condition too.

204
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,130
Okay, go on.

205
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,920
I won't die.

206
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,260
So you'd better not ruin the movie.

207
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,720
Let's end today's meeting here.

208
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,480
Mr. Han.

209
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,690
Do you really think <i>Love in White</i>
is worth investing in?

210
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:08,940
People think that the Youngjin Group
only cares about turning a profit.

211
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,900
If we show them we're trying our best

212
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,450
to protect the ecosystem
of our creative industries,

213
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:17,330
it sends a message
that we're the ones who stay

214
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:18,790
when everyone backs out.

215
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:22,460
I do trust Mr. Bu,
since he has the Midas touch.

216
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,420
No, that's not it.

217
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,500
This film's not about him.

218
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,210
It entirely depends on Lee Jeha.

219
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,880
It feels like he'll do anything

220
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,430
to make this movie.

221
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,680
But I'm the director.

222
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,850
Why do you think I'd ruin my own film?

223
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,190
This is a romance film.

224
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,770
How can its theme be "Love doesn't exist"?

225
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,980
Precisely. This isn't a romance film.

226
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,740
Love is the last thing this film needs.

227
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:58,280
But even when Hyunsang
leaves Gyuwon behind to go back to Seoul,

228
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,660
that's all love.

229
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,540
Hyunsang must've wanted
to prove something to Gyuwon.

230
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,540
I'm sorry. It's an important shoot
that I just couldn't postpone.

231
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,000
I'll be back soon.

232
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,770
Can you really call it "love"
when the man leaves,

233
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,980
knowing the woman is going to die?

234
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,690
The man was selfish.

235
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:29,900
And the woman…

236
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,650
was hopelessly foolish.

237
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,700
Here's your tangerine <i>ramyeon</i>.

238
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,950
Oh.

239
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,000
- Thank you!
- Sure.

240
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,830
Tangerine <i>ramyeon</i>…

241
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,230
Hmm?

242
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,530
Is it good?

243
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,740
Mmm.

244
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,630
Thank you.

245
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,180
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

246
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,470
I know this is your script,

247
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,850
but I'll still give it my best too.

248
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,230
Just you wait.

249
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,940
I will put love into this film,
no matter what.

250
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,650
You know this is only
between the two of us, right?

251
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,360
Yes. Understood.

252
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,450
I can do it!

253
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,030
I won't let you down.

254
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,410
CHAE SEOYOUNG: MR. LEE,
WHERE ARE YOU? LET'S TALK.

255
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,630
SEOYOUNG IN TALKS FOR REMAKE
OF DUYOUNG'S LOVE IN WHITE

256
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:16,050
Mr. Bu. So you're just going
to keep dodging my calls, huh?

257
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,050
Ma'am, please try to stay calm.

258
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:19,930
Where is she right now?

259
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,180
I'm not sure. She won't answer my calls.

260
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:28,980
Do you really think
she'd pick up the phone right now?

261
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,390
Go find her!

262
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,480
Yes, ma'am!

263
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,120
The press got to it
before we even got to meet.

264
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,960
Mr. Bu's good at spinning a narrative.

265
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,420
Did you read the script?

266
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,800
- I did.
- Which role do you want to play?

267
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,260
So I'm not automatically the lead, am I?

268
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,260
Did you find someone better?

269
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,390
Yes, I did.

270
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,690
Does that mean

271
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,060
you've already made up your mind?

272
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,310
I have.

273
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,690
Why?

274
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:17,860
Are you interested?

275
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,820
Yes, I am.

276
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,990
I found someone perfect at the audition

277
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,950
and I've already decided.

278
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,950
I'll convince Mr. Bu however I can.

279
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,200
I meant a different kind of interest.

280
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,420
That main character was just too sad.

281
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,790
And you know how much I hate sad.

282
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,250
I'd rather play Junghwa.

283
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,920
She was totally me.

284
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,590
She's driven by desire,

285
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,470
she's honest, insufferable,

286
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,720
and self-absorbed.

287
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,060
I wonder if you wrote her with me in mind.

288
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,810
I did think you'd be a good fit.

289
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,650
No need to correct the article, right?

290
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,030
I am in talks for the movie, after all.

291
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,370
Ms. Go might feel differently.

292
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:11,500
Of all the hurdles you'll have to clear,
that's probably one of the easier ones.

293
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,620
I can handle her.

294
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,250
So?

295
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,540
Who's playing the lead?

296
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,380
Lee Daeum.

297
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,550
I guess I'm a little jealous.

298
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,850
She must have something I don't.

299
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:41,730
Yes,
this is Noh Huitae from Npatch.

300
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,820
<i>Mr. Noh, this is Chae Seoyoung.</i>

301
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,070
Why, hello.

302
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,200
FROM LEAD TO SUPPORTING?
CHAE SEOYOUNG SHIFTS GEARS

303
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,080
Everyone!

304
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,790
Get out there right now and find Seoyoung.

305
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,710
FROM LEAD TO SUPPORTING?
CHAE SEOYOUNG SHIFTS GEARS

306
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,050
So that's how it played out.

307
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,590
Seems like they got to meet safely.

308
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:11,850
That's how it is? You'd take a side role
just to be in Lee Jeha's movie?

309
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,390
Absolutely ridiculous.

310
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,060
Hey, Jeha.

311
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,520
I think it's
about time we talked.

312
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,150
I think if something clearly won't
get resolved through talking,

313
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,030
it's better to skip it and save the time.

314
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,710
Fine. Then I'll skip
all the "what do you think,"

315
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,720
"can we talk about this,"
and "maybe we reconsider" nonsense.

316
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,470
Just change the casting.

317
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,640
I can't do that.

318
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,520
Then can you explain why you can't?

319
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,640
Lee Daeum's acting.

320
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,860
You've seen it too.
You know it's hard to deny.

321
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,110
You're better than anyone
at spotting star power.

322
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:06,240
There's a bit of a spark,
I'll give you that.

323
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,950
Then what's with the script?

324
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,410
You want to deface the original?

325
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,200
A romance film without love?
What even is that?

326
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,910
Is love really so great?

327
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:21,710
It's the first thing people throw out
if it gets in the way of survival.

328
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,790
Fine.

329
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,500
Love isn't everything.

330
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,130
But it should be in a movie at least.

331
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,720
Why would people pay that much

332
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,510
to watch a story
that's exactly like their own lives?

333
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,060
What's the point
if there's no hope or fantasy?

334
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,100
<i>What if I die during filming?</i>
<i>It'll go viral.</i>

335
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,440
A terminal patient
playing a terminal role?

336
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,110
Even I'd want to watch that.

337
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,780
People will come

338
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,990
if there's something to watch
that can replace

339
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,240
hope and fantasy.

340
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,160
Going somewhere?

341
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,490
To practice.

342
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,960
Why? To practice what?

343
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,880
I got a script.

344
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,790
Do you even know

345
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,920
what it means when a director
gives an actor a script?

346
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,470
What does it mean?

347
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,640
It means

348
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,390
"I want to cast you
for a role on this project."

349
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,850
Did you really get cast in a movie?

350
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,690
That's why I have to practice like crazy.

351
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,690
- I'm heading out.
- Hang on.

352
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,070
You practice here.

353
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,740
- I'll leave.
- No.

354
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,490
I don't want to be a bother.

355
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:41,250
What's really a bother is you
pushing yourself too hard out there.

356
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,500
Just hurry up, then.

357
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,500
I'm leaving without you if you don't!

358
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,880
- Okay.
- Heading somewhere?

359
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,300
Yes, we won't take too long.

360
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,050
Hang on, let me get my jacket!

361
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,300
DAEUM'S DAD: GYOYEONG,
DO YOU KNOW WHERE DAEUM IS?

362
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:59,560
Gyo!
You can just stand over there.

363
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,390
So? Do I look okay?

364
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,560
No, you look yellow.

365
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,900
Director Gyo,
please go all the way up there.

366
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,490
Does my jawline look nice?

367
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,360
- How do I look?
- Yes, great.

368
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:18,160
Don't drop your arms
because you get tired.

369
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,450
Don't worry, focus on the emotion.

370
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,870
I believe in you.

371
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,160
Focus!

372
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,920
You didn't press "record"!

373
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,590
Okay, then.

374
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,680
"I'm also breaking apart

375
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,390
and coming together."

376
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,690
GYOYEONG: AT SEODAEMUN PARK.

377
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,150
JUST SAW FROM AFAR. LEAVING NOW.

378
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,030
Daeum.

379
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,320
Daeum!

380
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,120
Hurry and call an ambulance! Daeum!

381
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,780
- D-Dad!
- An ambulance!

382
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,540
- I'm here.
- I-I'm sorry.

383
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,040
- It's okay.
- I-I'm really sorry.

384
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,580
Sorry about what? It's okay.
We'll go to the hospital.

385
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,290
I'm just acting for the camera right now.

386
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:09,000
- What?
- For the camera.

387
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,300
The character I play is sick.

388
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,550
Are you really all right?

389
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,100
What the heck were you thinking?

390
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,940
Dad…

391
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,940
I'm preparing for something.

392
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,400
- For what?
- For a film shoot.

393
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,820
What's she saying?

394
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:40,990
Well, she actually passed an audition

395
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,790
and became the lead.

396
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:46,120
I got the lead!

397
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,540
Aren't you proud of me?

398
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,880
Why are you indulging her, Gyoyeong? Huh?

399
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,350
You know she's sick.

400
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,310
Just go back inside.

401
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,810
Enough with the crazy talk.
Go inside. It's cold.

402
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,520
- No!
- Get a grip, Daeum!

403
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,940
How can I get a grip?

404
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,320
I passed an audition.

405
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,530
Dad… aren't you proud?

406
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,740
I'm going to be in a movie.

407
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,830
I'm not proud.

408
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,710
What can you even do in that condition?

409
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,290
Please, just stop! Please!

410
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:34,420
At this rate, you might not even make it
through half the time you've got left.

411
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,760
Making movies?

412
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,630
Come to your senses.

413
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,340
Just stop.

414
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,600
I'd rather live half my time like this
than a full year in a hospital bed.

415
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,900
Dad… I'm sorry.

416
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,570
That was a bit harsh.

417
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:29,480
I'm not sure how you expect me
to react to this.

418
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,980
It's like thinking outside the box.

419
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,440
Okay, and why should we do that?

420
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,150
- For the story, of course.
- The story?

421
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:41,650
You said the story around the film
is more important than the film itself.

422
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,820
Something that grabs people's interest.

423
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:48,830
All right, then let's hear it.
What's the story here?

424
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:52,330
A rookie strong enough
to knock a top star out of the lead.

425
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,710
That's going to be…

426
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,000
where we start.

427
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:58,960
And that start is
knocking off Chae Seoyoung?

428
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:01,510
The media will take care of the framing.

429
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:05,300
You're more ambitious
than I thought, Mr. Lee.

430
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:09,810
But there are a lot of
stakeholders in this investment deal.

431
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:13,520
A few headlines aren't enough for me

432
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,940
to convince those old guards.

433
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,570
I'll show you. With just one scene.

434
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,490
Let me show you what a desperate actor
and a hungry director…

435
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,360
…can pull off together.

436
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,450
If that story doesn't sell it,

437
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,790
pull the funding.

438
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,330
Hey, Director Lee!

439
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,460
Jeha.

440
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,460
What got into you today?

441
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,960
Call it desperation.

442
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,170
Never seen that from you before.
Sure, I'll take it.

443
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,300
I like it.

444
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,510
But this is a gamble,
and you didn't run it by me.

445
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:48,140
If you spin Seoyoung that way,
we could lose the Junghwa role too.

446
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,760
No, she'll do it.

447
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:52,720
If she cared about that stuff,
she wouldn't have come to me.

448
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,270
I'm counting on you to handle Ms. Go.

449
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,560
So you make the mess, and I clean it up.

450
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,820
Let's say Seoyoung's in.

451
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,150
But what are you planning to do
in that one scene?

452
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,990
You'd have to trust me on that

453
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:07,870
while you start assembling
the crew.

454
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,410
Ji Cheolmin has to take the camera.

455
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,950
So Wonyeong for editing.

456
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,330
Cheon Seeun for music.

457
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,660
Oh, and Choi Eunsu for art.

458
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:20,420
Wow, you're just listing
the busiest people in the business.

459
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,670
One week. No later than that.

460
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:26,380
This coming from the guy
who always dragged his feet?

461
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,430
I can't tell what he's thinking at all.

462
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,720
Doing whatever he wants.

463
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,560
Think I'm some miracle worker?

464
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,390
Well, I am.

465
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,650
Sorry I came unannounced. I was in a rush.

466
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:42,320
It's fine.
There are a lot of eyes out there anyway.

467
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,360
As long as you're okay with this.

468
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:48,200
- So this is the scene for the test shoot.
- Yes.

469
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,740
Where's this confidence coming from that
the one scene is enough for the investors?

470
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,870
From the two leads, Lee Daeum and you.

471
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:58,290
When did you start trusting
some rookie from an audition like that?

472
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,630
From the first time I met her.

473
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,340
You'll get it when you see her.

474
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,170
What if this doesn't work?

475
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,670
You don't have to worry about that.

476
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,260
A film that can't even convince
its investors shouldn't be made at all.

477
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:16,100
What made you come back from hiding
and start making this film?

478
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:20,230
Who is this actress who made you do that?
Now you've got me curious.

479
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,860
Do you want to meet her with me?

480
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,530
No,

481
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,150
I don't want to.

482
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,450
I want to meet her without you.

483
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,240
Let the two of us meet first.

484
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,040
I want to do it right.

485
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,710
All right, then.

486
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,750
But don't tell Lee Daeum

487
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:44,170
that this test shoot
decides the fate of this film.

488
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,590
Shouldn't she know?

489
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,420
No, it'll put too much pressure on her.

490
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,800
Jeha is insisting
that it has to be you, Cheolmin.

491
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,560
I swear, I almost teared up.

492
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,770
I'd love to work
with a director like Mr. Lee.

493
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,020
I know how talented he is.

494
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:05,610
That's why it was sad to watch
him disappear for years.

495
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,240
But then, why?

496
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,200
Honestly?
You can't call this <i>Love in White</i>.

497
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,120
More like <i>Love in Black</i>.

498
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:18,950
It just felt way too dark.

499
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,540
I have to head out first
to do something for Mr. Lee.

500
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,420
Mr. Ji says he can't do it.

501
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,720
Okay, I'll call him myself.

502
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,380
I should at least meet him.

503
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:36,430
- Mr. Lee.
- Hmm?

504
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,970
Whether it's <i>Love in White</i>, <i>Black</i>, or <i>Red</i>,

505
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:42,060
don't let it get to you. Stay strong.

506
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,190
<i>Take care.</i>

507
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,490
You still don't drink these days, right?

508
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:52,570
I don't.

509
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:56,580
- I know it's late, but is coffee okay?
- Coffee's great.

510
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,450
Look, don't take it the wrong way.

511
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,500
You mean when you called it <i>Love in Black</i>?
And that's why you passed on it?

512
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,210
What I mean is…

513
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:07,380
Could you take a look at this?

514
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,760
It ends with the camera on her back?

515
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,180
Yes, and it's shot handheld.
You know, what you do best.

516
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,680
Right, I did think the ending
for the terminally ill lead

517
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,390
should actually feel dynamic and alive.

518
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:23,560
Ah. I mean, it was just a thought.

519
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,980
Mr. Ji,

520
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,940
I really want to make this film

521
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,150
with you.

522
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:35,990
Ah, screw it. I'm in.

523
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,740
Okay, you've convinced me.

524
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:40,450
But I'm all tied up right after winter,

525
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,370
so my schedule's tight.

526
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:45,120
Well, I want to shoot this film quickly.

527
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,290
Literally, very fast.

528
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,090
Okay, but…

529
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:51,670
why do you need it to be so fast?

530
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,840
I don't have much time.

531
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,970
- Take care, then.
- Good night.

532
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:09,900
<i>I really want</i>

533
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,190
to make this movie

534
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,610
with you.

535
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,660
It really does work.

536
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,870
Hello?

537
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:36,630
- Are you Lee Daeum?
- Hello, Ms. Chae.

538
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,260
I've seen you before.

539
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,810
The sandwich. That was you, right?

540
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:44,470
Do you remember me?

541
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,730
Wow, this is such a funny coincidence.

542
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:48,650
Or is it destiny?

543
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,570
Should we head in?

544
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:56,400
I take it you didn't like anything
from the list I sent you?

545
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:59,950
Mr. Lee's trying to avoid anywhere
that feels too artificial.

546
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:03,830
You said this is for a test shoot, right?

547
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,700
Yes, it's a test,

548
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:08,620
but we'll carry it through
to the main shoot.

549
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,080
I hope you don't mind the trouble.

550
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,880
Oh, it's no trouble.
This is my job, after all.

551
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,800
You asked for a secluded rural house

552
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:22,220
with the sun falling beautifully
from east to west

553
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,720
in the late afternoon.

554
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,560
I'll come back with more options.

555
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,230
Uh, also,

556
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:32,060
I want the space and lighting
to be as naturally beautiful as possible

557
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,650
so it contrasts
with the lead character's looming death.

558
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,940
That'll feel even more heartbreaking.

559
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,660
Thank you, Ms. Chae.

560
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:50,500
Can I ask why you brought me here?

561
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,250
Mmm.

562
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:55,840
Let's rehearse together here
until production begins.

563
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,880
I'll be here whenever you want.

564
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,880
That's how I'll repay you
for the sandwich.

565
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:04,430
Me? Rehearsing here? With you?

566
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,310
Is it too much for you?

567
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,230
No, I absolutely love it!

568
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,020
Make yourself at home.

569
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,900
- Should we do some scenes?
- Yes!

570
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,110
Oh!

571
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,530
Hmm?

572
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,240
Actually,

573
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:27,160
could I get something to eat first?

574
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,200
Oh, of course.

575
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:32,420
I was so nervous at the thought
of coming to meet you

576
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,210
that I couldn't eat anything.

577
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:36,710
I don't think my voice
will come out right.

578
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,720
Ma'am, please. They're rehearsing.

579
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,890
Hello.

580
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:53,060
You must be her.

581
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,480
This is the CEO of our agency.

582
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,900
Great to meet you, ma'am.

583
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,860
I heard a lot about you from Seoyoung.
Make yourself comfortable.

584
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:03,490
Seoyoung.

585
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,620
- A minute?
- As you can see, I'm busy.

586
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,370
Can I talk to you here, then?
I'm fine with that.

587
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:32,640
What were you thinking
when you brought her here?

588
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:35,310
Figured I'd get to know my costar

589
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,360
and get some practice in too.

590
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,980
It's a win-win, really. No harm to that.

591
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,280
Shut the hell up!

592
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,580
You've got 11 lead roles and more
just waiting to hear from you.

593
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,710
Oh you're driving me insane.

594
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,630
What,

595
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,170
you want her to act better?

596
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,710
Make her successful?

597
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,300
Worry about yourself.

598
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,300
But I am doing well.

599
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,390
Am I not?

600
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,970
Seriously…

601
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:13,140
Doesn't it sting your pride even a little
to work with Lee Jeha again?

602
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,850
I'm so sick of this.

603
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,610
- What?
- I'm just running lines with my costar.

604
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:23,780
If you pull this petty crap one more time
and try to interfere…

605
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,910
Minhee,

606
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,780
how long do we have left?

607
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,870
Six months.

608
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:34,250
Yes, then I'm walking out of here
with Minhee in six months.

609
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,840
I'm sorry, ma'am.

610
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,980
Daeum?

611
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:06,990
Daeum!

612
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,200
Are you okay?

613
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,280
I'll call an ambulance.

614
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:12,870
P-People can't see…

615
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,620
People can't see me like this.

616
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,250
- What--
- Hankuk National…

617
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,500
Hankuk National University Hospital,
please.

618
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,790
Hankuk National University Hospital.

619
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,590
Daeum.

620
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,840
Are you okay, Daeum?

621
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,300
Oh, dear.

622
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,860
Daeum!

623
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,070
- Please wait here.
- Okay.

624
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,950
Daeum!

625
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:59,460
DIRECTOR LEE JEHA

626
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:08,340
DIRECTOR LEE JEHA

627
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:19,020
You're here for Ms. Lee Daeum, right?

628
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,690
Well, I'm not her family.

629
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:23,060
I'm just here for today.

630
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,980
I see.

631
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:28,190
We've given her a sedative,
but her condition isn't good.

632
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,280
She'll likely have to be admitted.

633
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:32,320
Admitted?

634
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:35,070
Does she need surgery or something?

635
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,660
Surgery isn't really an option right now.

636
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,750
Even admission is just my recommendation.

637
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,460
I doubt she would agree to it.

638
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,290
Why's that?

639
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:45,420
Sorry, she asked me not to say more.

640
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,300
I think you should head home for today.

641
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,960
I can't leave her here like this.

642
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,340
You don't need to worry.

643
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,280
So even Mr. Ji decided to join in.

644
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:19,080
And all the other crew too.

645
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,620
Can't believe we got
all these people in one place.

646
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,290
It's not even the main shoot
and they're still doing this.

647
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:26,920
It feels kind of like fate.

648
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,670
Well, our fate is riding on this shoot.

649
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,840
Mr. Bu is also a miracle worker.

650
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,590
From the look on his face lately,
I could tell things have been intense.

651
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,260
That guy is always intense.

652
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:44,270
By the way, what kind of
assistant director can't drive?

653
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,020
I'm good at everything else, though.

654
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,940
Let's just
make sure the test shoot goes well.

655
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,570
If anything comes up,
notify Chae Seoyoung's side.

656
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,370
I'll handle Lee Daeum's side.

657
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:58,910
I can handle her too, you know.

658
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,200
I prefer doing it myself.

659
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:02,950
Understood.

660
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,040
- Have a safe ride back!
- Okay.

661
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,130
LEE DAEUM

662
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:17,010
DAEUM: I'M AT THE HOSPITAL

663
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:19,970
<i>The person you are trying</i>
<i>to reach is unable to take your call…</i>

664
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,770
I figured you'd be here.

665
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,240
Is my dad okay?

666
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:41,700
Worry about yourself, you brat.

667
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,080
If you're out and about like today

668
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,580
and a seizure hits when no one's around,

669
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,380
you could really die.

670
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,460
I'm not kidding.

671
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,210
I mean…

672
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,630
I know.

673
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,550
Don't you think I know that? Geez.

674
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,180
But still,

675
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:01,930
if you're going to say something scary,
at least smile while you say it.

676
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,770
Huh?

677
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,690
- Hang on.
- What is it?

678
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,350
That's Mr. Lee.

679
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,730
Hold on.

680
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,280
Hello?

681
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,530
Mr. Lee. Over here.

682
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:26,660
Over here! Can't you see me up here?

683
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,370
No, don't turn around.
Turn back, I'm right here.

684
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,670
<i>Yep, the hospital.</i>

685
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,630
The skybridge in front of you.

686
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,510
<i>Can't you see me?</i>

687
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,720
Right here!

688
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,930
Mr. Lee!

689
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,390
Someone's having a blast.

690
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,470
Okay!

691
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,240
- Doc.
- What?

692
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:02,070
I'm heading out.

693
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,160
Do whatever you want.

694
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,080
Off I go, then!

695
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,130
Did you have a routine checkup?

696
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,430
Oh, yes. Routine checkup.

697
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,510
Hmm.

698
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:29,930
Grape juice!
Just what I wanted.

699
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,900
I got two for the price of one
on a "buy one, get one free" deal,

700
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,320
but I'll let you have it.

701
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,320
Look at you

702
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:44,530
trying to sound noble.

703
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,950
I need you to rehearse
a scene for a test shoot.

704
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:52,460
Okay.

705
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,420
Normally,
test shoots are just to make sure

706
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,340
the setup works
before we do the real thing.

707
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,130
But you should think of it
as the real thing.

708
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,300
You have to show everyone
you're the right person for this movie.

709
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:07,350
I'll give it my all.

710
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,560
I can do it.

711
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,600
And this is a different issue, but…

712
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,230
The number of people we'll have to lie to

713
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,900
will grow by the dozens

714
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,190
or even hundreds.

715
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,360
I'll make sure to be careful.

716
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:24,780
I'm just going back and forth

717
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,200
between home
and the rehearsal studio anyway.

718
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,870
Rehearsal studio?

719
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:31,250
Uh, at Ms. Chae's agency.

720
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,670
What for?

721
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:39,460
She's been really kind
to let me use the space at her agency,

722
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,010
so we can rehearse
before production begins.

723
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:45,050
All right. She's a good actress,
so watch and learn.

724
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:46,890
Okay.

725
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:48,760
Just be careful

726
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,970
no one finds out you're sick.

727
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:01,650
You're here early.

728
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:03,240
Hello, Ms. Chae.

729
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,950
So, about last time…

730
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,210
Oh, I'm not that curious to know.

731
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:16,040
- Pardon?
- When you're ready.

732
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,380
I'll be here to listen
when you're ready to tell me later.

733
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:22,510
Thank you for understanding.

734
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:23,800
Shall we begin?

735
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,930
Okay, Gyuwon slaps Junghwa.

736
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:29,220
And when I try to slap you back,

737
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,640
- you have to avoid it.
- Uh-huh.

738
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,850
You see my hand in your peripheral vision?
When it's almost at your face…

739
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:35,390
- Slap.
- Just like that.

740
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,770
- We have to trust each other.
- Ah.

741
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:38,270
Can't you just slap me, though?

742
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:41,360
Then I'd feel so bad.

743
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:56,790
Hey, you're here.

744
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:59,250
Oh! Are those new shoes?

745
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,750
They look nice and comfy.

746
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,090
Can you make me some breakfast?

747
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,380
Coming together.

748
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:07,130
Breaking apart.

749
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:11,100
Coming together.
I want to come together. Ta-da.

750
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,440
Is he very busy in Seoul?

751
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,980
<i>How is he, mentally and physically?</i>

752
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:27,070
Is he very busy in Seoul?

753
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:29,030
How is he, mentally and physically?

754
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:31,200
This space is too big.

755
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,580
Is he very busy in Seoul?

756
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,750
Is he very busy in Seoul?

757
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:45,550
Looks good.

758
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:47,760
Thank you.

759
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:56,020
DR. LEE JUNGHYO

760
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:10,150
<i>Please, just stop! Please!</i>

761
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,620
I'd rather live half my time like this
than a full year in a hospital bed.

762
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,830
So, Seoyoung hasn't had any new ad offers

763
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,540
since that article
about her in <i>Love in White</i> came out.

764
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:24,630
Okay.

765
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,090
- Looks like a rising star, no?
- Should I schedule a meeting?

766
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:31,800
No?

767
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,890
Let's go back

768
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,390
to our roots for a change.

769
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:39,020
So adorable.

770
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:45,650
LOVE - FUNERAL SERVICES

771
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:50,900
FUNERAL DIRECTOR, KIM JIHO

772
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:52,200
Hey, Gyo!

773
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,620
Let's go, your mom says it's time to eat.

774
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,200
You start shooting tomorrow.
Are you nervous?

775
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:00,580
Actually, I'm so nervous I'm freaking out.

776
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:03,870
I'm worried if I'll have an episode again.

777
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:06,790
Here.

778
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,340
Shoulders up.

779
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:10,800
Stand tall.

780
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,010
You go crush this. Forget everything else
and focus on acting.

781
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,850
The one thing you want to do.

782
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:20,020
Ready.

783
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:22,060
- Action.
- Come on.

784
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,400
- We can do anything.
- Then what should we do now?

785
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,440
- Go and eat dinner!
- Turn around.

786
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,610
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

787
00:46:34,610 --> 00:46:37,530
Wow, it looks
like a completely different place.

788
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,490
- For the full shot…
- Incredible.

789
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:41,410
…I was thinking something like this.

790
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,170
I like it,
but a little wider in the first cut.

791
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:45,540
- I got it.
- Okay.

792
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:48,460
Thank you, Mr. Lee.

793
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:50,880
You did a great job, sir.

794
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,180
This must be an important test shoot.

795
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:57,350
I've never had a test this tough
in my life.

796
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:58,850
Our fate depends on this.

797
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:01,930
This has to go well
for you to keep working too.

798
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:05,230
Hey! Daeum.

799
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:07,650
- Hello.
- Daeum, you're here.

800
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,670
Hello, Mr. Lee.

801
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:34,420
This has to go well

802
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:36,130
since this movie's fate rides on it.

803
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,260
Tell me if it's too much pressure.

804
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:41,430
Yeah, it is.

805
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:43,640
Hmm.

806
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:49,520
I heard you're letting Daeum
use your rehearsal studio.

807
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,520
Yeah.

808
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:53,940
I had to repay her for something.

809
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:56,740
What's that?

810
00:47:58,410 --> 00:47:59,410
Just something.

811
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,240
Why? What's with all the questions?

812
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,410
Use the production studio's space
from now on, where I can also be.

813
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:08,460
Why?

814
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,880
You don't like me being alone with Daeum?

815
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:15,010
Why would you think that?

816
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,800
Well, I mean…

817
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:21,600
Okay, then. If that's what you'd prefer.

818
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:30,270
P-People can't see…

819
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:31,980
People can't see me like this.

820
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,780
Just one more thing, Director Lee.

821
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:36,860
You know…

822
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,070
Yes? Tell me.

823
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:45,620
Uh…

824
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:46,700
Maybe later.

825
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:49,250
It's nothing.

826
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,130
Let's head in.

827
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:57,880
Don't be nervous.

828
00:48:57,970 --> 00:48:59,260
Just like we practiced.

829
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,140
Okay, Ms. Chae.

830
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,550
Break a leg.

831
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:05,560
Break a leg.

832
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:06,720
I'll see you later.

833
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:28,250
CAN I MAKE MOVIES AGAIN?

834
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,130
CAN I ACT AGAIN?

835
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:43,340
CAN WE MAKE THIS MOVIE TOGETHER?

836
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:02,030
- Speed!
- Test shoot, take one.

837
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:07,410
Rolling.

838
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:12,870
Ready.

839
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:16,500
Action!

840
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,420
Cut! Okay. That's good.

841
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,050
She's good.

842
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:05,260
That's a cut. Great job.

843
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:12,520
I got the camera.

844
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,390
Mr. Ji, how was it?

845
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,610
It was great.

846
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,700
Let's go check the playback.

847
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:27,160
Oh… Am I allowed to see it too?

848
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,620
Of course. We all did it together.

849
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,000
Let's just send it in now.

850
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,920
When they see this,

851
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:46,720
they're not gonna talk
about pulling investment

852
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,300
just because of a rookie actor.

853
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:57,270
Enough with the side comments and go home.

854
00:51:57,350 --> 00:52:00,440
I'll bring a cut with proper editing,

855
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,900
not just a rough cut.

856
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,610
- Maybe some color grading too.
- Okay.

857
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,570
Great work, everyone.

858
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,370
Great work!

859
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:11,450
Okay.

860
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:13,370
- Good job.
- Well done.

861
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:15,160
- Good work, sir.
- You did well today.

862
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:19,920
Mr. Lee.

863
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:23,130
You're still here. What is it?

864
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,630
Is there a chance…

865
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:28,630
this movie might not happen because of me?

866
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:32,050
No. If the movie doesn't happen,

867
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,680
that's because…

868
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,720
of both you and me.

869
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:37,310
Sorry?

870
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:40,400
What investor would trust a director
who's been out of the game for five years?

871
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:44,020
That flashy test shoot we just did

872
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:47,610
is a test for both Lee Daeum and Lee Jeha.

873
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:54,620
I'm sorry.
I should've done better.

874
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:59,790
What happened to the cocky Lee Daeum
who said she could do it?

875
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:02,710
Don't worry about it and go home.

876
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:04,250
Just trust me.

877
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:17,270
<i>You found her at an audition?</i>

878
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:20,810
Yes. What do you think?

879
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,400
It's fascinating

880
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,320
how new talents like this

881
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,400
pop up out of nowhere every year.

882
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,240
She really makes Seoyoung shine too.

883
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,820
They really are great talents.

884
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:35,120
Did I dial down the red too much?

885
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,290
Ah, it's just Daeum's skin
that's very pale.

886
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:40,290
She actually does look sick.

887
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:44,460
And with the way she performs,
it's hard not to believe it.

888
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,170
Where on earth
did you find a rookie like that?

889
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:52,840
<i>Stop!</i>

890
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:54,140
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

891
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:56,720
<i>Let me go!</i>

892
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:59,020
<i>Who are you to tell me what to do?</i>

893
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:03,770
<i>I…</i>

894
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:06,440
<i>have every right to destroy myself!</i>

895
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,280
KIM JINYEO, MOVIE ACTOR

896
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,830
DO YOU KNOW JINYEO,
THE LEGEND OF 90S KOREAN CINEMA?

897
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:25,420
KIM JINYEO'S PROFILE

898
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,590
FROM EXTRA TO
THE CENTER OF CHUNGMURO,

899
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:27,790
HOW SHE BECAME
"THE FACE OF A GENERATION"

900
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:32,010
<i>Is he very busy in Seoul?</i>

901
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:34,680
Spare me the pity party.
I'm done watching this.

902
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:36,890
You know where Hyunsang is, don't you?

903
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:39,100
Aren't you dying soon?

904
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,390
Honestly, that's low.

905
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,440
Even for you.

906
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:09,130
Just one scene.

907
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:11,920
This one scene explains everything.

908
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:13,170
Lee Daeum?

909
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,550
Mm-hmm. Where did you manage
to find an actress like that?

910
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:21,140
This is more than enough
to convince our old guards.

911
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,770
But, you know,

912
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:27,020
the actress who played Gyuwon
in the original.

913
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,150
She's been retired for a while, right?

914
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:32,110
Yes. What about her?

915
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:35,030
Just curious what she's been up to lately.

916
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,490
What kind of lives

917
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:40,080
do these female leads live
after the movie ends?

918
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,830
Makes you wonder, no?

919
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:46,580
You got the DP who wasn't available,

920
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,790
cast a top actress in a supporting role,

921
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,800
pulled out a superstar rookie,

922
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,420
and even convinced the investors.

923
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:56,010
You were right
when you said I wouldn't regret this.

924
00:55:57,550 --> 00:55:59,850
You should head back.
I have somewhere to be.

925
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:01,140
Sure, you pulled an all-nighter.

926
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:02,310
Seungwon.

927
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:04,270
What is it?

928
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,480
Thanks.

929
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:11,320
Well, now…

930
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:22,370
Where are you? Are you free right now?

931
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:27,080
<i>I'm on my way to the hospital</i>
<i>to get the results from my checkup.</i>

932
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,830
I'll head to the hospital.
Let's talk for a second.

933
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:39,300
Uh…

934
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:41,090
So, here's the thing…

935
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:43,430
Mr. Lee,

936
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:46,270
is there something wrong?

937
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,890
You're going to be

938
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:51,770
this movie's lead for real.

939
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:53,820
What?

940
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:55,530
We got the investment.

941
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:58,280
Thanks to that one scene you did.

942
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:02,530
You accomplished it yourself.

943
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,040
Thank you.

944
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:09,250
Are you serious?

945
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,010
I can't believe it!

946
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:32,600
That was the Hollywood way

947
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,480
of saying thank you.

948
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:39,360
Great job.

949
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:44,030
Uh…

950
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,120
Also…

951
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,830
I didn't see a set location

952
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:50,660
for the scene
where Gyuwon gives up on life

953
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:53,040
but ends up finding hope.

954
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:55,130
That's because I couldn't find one for it.

955
00:57:57,710 --> 00:57:58,760
Can I make a recommendation?

956
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,760
- No. Just use that time to rehearse.
- Mmm.

957
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,680
Rehearsal is rehearsal.
Recommendation is recommendation.

958
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:08,890
Follow me.

959
00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:12,140
Follow, follow me!

960
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,520
Mr. Lee!

961
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:17,570
Follow, follow me!

962
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:29,790
Ta-da!

963
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:32,870
This is the place.

964
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:41,420
Well, it'd be perfect
for a hospital promo video.

965
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:44,010
Not here.

966
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:50,270
Down there.

967
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:02,070
Um…

968
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:23,840
When you're in the hospital long enough,

969
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:26,340
there are days that feel unbearable.

970
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:30,810
Whenever that happened,
I'd stand right here and look outside.

971
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:35,270
I thought about
how this is just a glass window,

972
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:37,690
but life could be so different beyond it.

973
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:47,360
If Gyuwon were to stand here
and look out like this,

974
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:49,370
she'd actually want to live.

975
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:55,040
Just a few days ago,

976
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:58,580
I was going around
making funeral plans for myself.

977
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:02,460
But then suddenly,
I found myself way outside over there.

978
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:05,840
This film

979
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:08,890
has that kind of power, at least for me.

980
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:15,770
While Gyuwon is looking down
at the world like this in the movie,

981
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,940
she spots someone outside.

982
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:22,110
Someone who's on that side of the world

983
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:25,900
walks by, happens to look up,

984
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:29,570
and smiles at Gyuwon.

985
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,370
Do you know what would happen to her then?

986
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,040
What would happen?

987
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:40,710
She'd fall apart

988
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,590
because she wants to live so badly.

989
01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:47,970
But death just keeps chasing her.

990
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:52,180
And she'd go, "Okay, fine.
If this is my fate, I get it."

991
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:54,890
"But let me just live a little first!"

992
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:58,180
Then try to outrun death
with everything she's got.

993
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:01,690
Even if it only buys her a second.

994
01:01:20,370 --> 01:01:21,960
I quite like this spot.

995
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:25,460
Really?

996
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:27,380
In that case,

997
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:31,050
shouldn't I get paid
for scouting the best location?

998
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:34,390
Calm down. You have to book it,
or it doesn't count.

999
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:38,020
What? Of course
I was going to book it for you too!

1000
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:41,140
This is my turf, you know.

1001
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:44,110
Booking this spot
would be a piece of cake.

1002
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,070
No problem at all.

1003
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:13,220
Good morning, Daeum!

1004
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:14,470
Remember me?

1005
01:02:14,550 --> 01:02:16,470
Uh, hello.

1006
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:18,680
I've been waiting for you.

1007
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:21,430
- Sorry?
- I know you're here for a meeting,

1008
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,600
but how about a cup of tea with me first?

1009
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:28,980
It's been a while
since my agency brought on a new face.

1010
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:32,110
There's no one
who feels genuine these days.

1011
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,910
I don't sign just anybody, you know.

1012
01:02:38,410 --> 01:02:40,870
I'm not planning to sign
with an agency, ma'am.

1013
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:42,410
Why not?

1014
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,330
You don't like us?

1015
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:46,840
You didn't even hear the offer.

1016
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:50,170
Any offer doesn't matter, actually.

1017
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,970
This movie is enough for me, that's all.

1018
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:55,300
I honestly have no goals after this.

1019
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:59,010
You land a role that everybody wants,

1020
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,520
and you have no goal?

1021
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:02,730
You know,

1022
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:05,690
that's very insulting
to actors who are desperate for a chance.

1023
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:09,820
I'm sorry.

1024
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,570
Let's just say it's personal reasons.

1025
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:15,110
No need to apologize to me.

1026
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:19,030
Did the director
tell you not to sign anything?

1027
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:21,540
No, he's not the type to do that.

1028
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:24,580
Around here, there's no "type"
who'd do or not do anything.

1029
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,080
That's just how this industry is.

1030
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:28,880
Director Lee is…

1031
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:32,670
Well…

1032
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:35,470
You can trust him as a director,

1033
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:39,100
but don't trust him too much as a person.

1034
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,850
I'm going to trust him more than anyone.

1035
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:50,150
Looks like it's time for my meeting.

1036
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:52,400
I have to run.

1037
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,110
I'm sorry.

1038
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:10,980
<i>This is a secret, but I'm making</i>
<i>this film because I don't really know.</i>

1039
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:12,440
<i>Don't know what?</i>

1040
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:16,530
What it's like to love someone.

1041
01:05:21,070 --> 01:05:23,830
What is Seoyoung to you?

1042
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:28,660
She's a great actress who taught me
something I didn't know very well.

1043
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:35,630
- <i>Are you happy now?</i>
- <i>So happy I could die.</i>

1044
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:39,010
<i>You listen to me.</i>
<i>I'm not letting you end up like that.</i>

1045
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:40,720
Dad…

1046
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:44,640
I'm dying.

1047
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:53,150
<i>Why are you asking if Daeum is sick?</i>

1048
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:56,730
<i>You really care about Daeum, huh?</i>

1049
01:05:58,860 --> 01:05:59,900
<i>I just need her.</i>

1050
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:02,320
<i>That's all.</i>

1051
