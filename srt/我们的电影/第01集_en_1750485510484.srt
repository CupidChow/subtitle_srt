ANY RESEMBLANCE
TO ACTUAL PEOPLE, PLACES,

3
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,620
OR MEDICAL CONDITIONS
IS COINCIDENTAL.

4
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,790
CHILD ACTORS
WERE ALWAYS SUPERVISED

5
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:05,950
AND SAFELY FILMED
UNDER GUIDELINES.

6
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,230
There’s a warm moment
at the end of every film

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,360
where it reads the names
of everyone involved.

8
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,820
Until that final moment arrives,

9
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,820
movies, like life,

10
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,120
race tirelessly toward the ending.

11
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,090
Ready.

12
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,760
Action!

13
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,860
And sometimes…

14
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:11,160
just when we think the ending is here…

15
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,630
that's when life begins.

OUR MOVIE

17
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,720
EPISODE 1

18
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,600
The two lead actors
of The Lonely People,

19
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,810
who delivered outstanding performances

20
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,480
with a wide range of emotions,

21
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,610
Chae Seoyoung and Kim Sungwoo.

22
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,280
Please say hello.

23
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,190
Great.

24
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,820
Please look toward your right.

25
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,160
Now please look toward your bottom right.

26
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,790
Could you look toward your left now?

27
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,500
A lot of photographers are here today.

28
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,710
And back to center, please.

29
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,960
Could we ask the two of you
for a charming pose?

30
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,180
You both look so lovely.

31
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,220
THE LONELY PEOPLE

32
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,140
We just received some very sad news.

33
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,890
Jeha.
One of Korea's greatest directors,

34
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,560
Mr. Lee Duyoung,

35
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,150
has passed away at the age of 70.

36
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,190
The press event
will now take a brief pause

37
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,860
per the production company's request.

38
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,450
5 YEARS LATER

39
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,790
It's at 2:00 p.m., okay? Don't forget.

40
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,290
Have some decency, will you?

41
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,750
This is Chae Seoyoung's big return

42
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,340
and everyone except for camera, from art
and music to editing and color grading,

43
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,380
they're all from The Lonely People team!
On top of it all, I'm the producer again.

44
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,470
Every single person here
got their start with you.

45
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,970
If you don't show up,
you're no better than an animal, man.

46
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,020
So please,
come out into the world again, okay?

47
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,690
And as for Seoyoung…

48
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,690
Well, I'll make sure
you don't run into her.

49
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:07,360
Why are you bringing her up?
There's nothing between us now.

50
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,150
Look at that, he's alive.

51
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,660
Also, there's the thing
I mentioned a while ago.

52
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,330
Are you really not doing Love in White--

53
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,380
LOVE IN WHITE

54
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,420
"White"? What a joke.

55
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,930
THE CHASE

56
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,260
"Sophomore slump."

57
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,010
Do you know that phrase?

58
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,060
It's also known as the second-year slump.

59
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,810
It's when an athlete or artist

60
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,810
has a great first season or debut project,

61
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,360
but then takes quite a while
to get to the next one.

62
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,200
It's not so different
from our own lives, is it?

63
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,160
Even in romance.
Getting to that first kiss is one thing,

64
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,500
but figuring out how to land the second?
That's the real challenge.

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,500
It's Tuesday, the second day of the week,
and I'm your host Joo Hyunyoung.

66
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,810
Are you all right?

67
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,940
Yes, I'm completely fine.

68
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,730
I'm fine!

69
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,110
Thank you.

70
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,190
Thank you. Thank you.

71
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,030
Thank you!

72
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,270
Skip to the 2:40 and 20:18 marks.

73
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,850
For what?

74
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,230
You know, the stuff
Park's only good at directing.

75
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,480
I don't know why,

76
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,070
but Chae Seoyoung being a divorcée

77
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,280
just makes it hotter, doesn't it?

78
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,990
Well, being divorced is hip now.
But are there only two scenes of that?

79
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,240
Quality over quantity, my friend.
It's Director Park.

80
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,710
I bet those love scenes are killer.

81
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,830
You're all disgusting.

82
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,130
Excuse me, were you talking to me?

83
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,380
Yes.

84
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,470
Get out of my way.

85
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,010
I'm trying to get off.

86
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:49,060
Hey. Isn't that bastard Lee Jeha?

87
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,230
Lee Jeha?

88
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,900
Oh, Lee Duyoung's son.

89
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,150
What, has he been in mourning
for three years?

90
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,490
No, it's been way more than three years.

91
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,530
Why is he here all of a sudden?

92
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,750
"THE DISCOVERY OF ROMANCE"
PRESS AND INDUSTRY SCREENING

93
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,300
Hello, everyone.

94
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,630
I'm the producer, Bu Seungwon.

95
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,220
Thank you so much for coming.

96
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,520
Hello! I'm Park Byeongsik,
director of Discovery of Romance.

97
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,440
Honestly, I was fueled by anger.

98
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,400
The rumors were nonstop after my divorce,

99
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,400
so I thought I'd just show them
what I could do.

100
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,700
See?

101
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,820
Isn't it nice
to be out like this for once?

102
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,870
I only came because you asked me
to fill a seat, but this place is packed.

103
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,950
I've shown my face, so I'm leaving.

104
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,620
Come on, where are you going?

105
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,670
We still have stuff to talk about.
Not interested.

106
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,500
Seriously, man?
I'll keep trying until you are.

107
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,130
I can't even write my own stuff,
and you want me to do a remake?

108
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,640
You talk about Love in White
like it's some film by a stranger.

109
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,220
This is your father's film.

110
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,640
Your father wasn't a stranger.

111
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,020
We're only connected biologically.
I cut ties with him a long time ago.

112
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,650
And who even likes
that kind of melodrama anymore?

113
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,900
Just stick to what you know,
the stuff that makes money.

114
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,450
Like that.

115
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,610
Melodrama or not,

116
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,580
if I lay my finger on it,
it rakes in the money.

117
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,620
I tried to portray the character

118
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,870
with more subtlety and depth.

119
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,540
I think I was too sensitive
throughout the shoot.

120
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,960
Right, Mr. Park?
No!

121
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,380
Of course not.

122
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,630
Seoyoung's still stunning, right?

123
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:41,010
She's still got it even after her divorce.

124
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,800
Wait, that look.

125
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,720
The stuff of romance films.

126
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,400
Looks like you're not done
with that story.

127
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,030
What's left to tell, after all this time?

128
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,690
Look, you can take
what you've been writing for five years

129
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,450
and shop it around, but it won't work.

130
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,320
You've got to learn to let things go.

131
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,040
I haven't made the movie
I want to make either.

132
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,410
But I feel like it could happen
if you help me, man.

133
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,080
I'm not asking you to make anything weird.

134
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,300
This was your father's--
Seungwon.

135
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,840
I'm not doing it.

136
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
I just…

137
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,590
despise that film.

138
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,440
You know,

139
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,650
what if we surround these alliums
with baby's breath?

140
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,520
Would that be weird?

141
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,280
If I did it, it might work.

142
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,900
If you did it, it might be a disaster.

143
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,120
Got it.

144
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,990
Why do you never
take your nice arrangements home?

145
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,240
This is all money, you know.

146
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,410
I know! It does seem like such a waste.

147
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,210
Then just take them.

148
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I can't.

149
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,210
I'll get in trouble if I do.

150
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,260
Did you all enjoy the movie?

151
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,760
Here's Director Lee.
I had to drag him over here.

152
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,550
Director Lee.

153
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,470
This is Director Joo Inyoung.

154
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,230
She went to film school
and won an award at Mise-en-scène.

155
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,980
I'm a big fan.

156
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,310
The Lonely People was sensational.

157
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,570
Thank you for the kind words.

158
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:22,860
Ah. Jeha, Chae Seoyoung and I
all had our debut with that one.

159
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,530
Honestly, Seoyoung wouldn't have
come this far if it wasn't for that film.

160
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,620
Same goes for me.

161
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,410
I'll never get used to that.

162
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,120
Oh! Speak of the devil.
It's always tough.

163
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,620
Great job putting yourself out there!

164
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,210
Congratulations.
Good work, everyone.

165
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,460
Congrats.
What? Mr. Lee?

166
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,210
You're really here.

167
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,300
Yes.

168
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,840
Oh, I've heard a lot about you.

169
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,590
I appreciate you coming. My goodness.

170
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,720
Here.

171
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,100
I never thought you'd show up, Jeha.

172
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,850
What did you think of the film?

173
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,150
Well, time just flew by.

174
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:04,110
Right, because you get totally sucked in.

175
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,950
Who would've thought
it would turn out this good? No one.

176
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,410
You've won a ton of awards,
so you'd probably know.

177
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,410
Do you think we've got a shot
at winning anything?

178
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,630
We have to win. Absolutely.

179
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:22,210
But you know, no one's ever won
both Best Screenplay and Best Director

180
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,670
for their debut since Lee here.

181
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,720
It was a romance
and it pulled five million people.

182
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,300
Whether you're an actor or a director,
your first project is everything.

183
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,640
It's the start that matters.

184
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,270
It's what comes after that matters,
whether you're an actor or a director.

185
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,770
Sorry, but I have to head out now.

186
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,320
Excuse me.

187
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,650
Mr. Lee.

188
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,160
You're not busy, are you?

189
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,490
If you are, ditch it.

190
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,790
It's been a while. Let's talk.

191
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,830
Hello!

192
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,920
Hi!

193
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,420
Hello.

194
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,710
Have you eaten yet?

195
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,050
Hello!
Hello.

196
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,340
Good to see you!

197
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,640
How's it going, everyone?

198
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,010
I'll just write this quickly
and go change.

199
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,390
Lee Daeum, the busiest person alive.
Are you seeing someone these days?

200
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,230
Why must you rub salt

201
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,610
in my very open wound?

202
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,230
I had dreams too, you know.

203
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,990
In movies and TV,
everyone falls in love in hospitals.

204
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:33,450
So why is someone
as gorgeous as me still single?

205
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,240
Can't speak for your love life,
but Dr. Kim was looking for you.

206
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,410
Give him a call.
Eh.

207
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,910
Looking for me again?

208
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,590
Hello.

209
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,670
Hello.

210
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,760
TASTY RAMYEON

211
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,380
Come in.

212
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,470
Why, it's Da-da-da Daeum.

213
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,850
Wow, that must've been heavy.

214
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,860
I feel bad for always taking from you.

215
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,780
What kind of doctor lives on cup noodles
and instant coffee every day?

216
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,450
You're gonna end up with diabetes.

217
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,450
What the heck is this?

218
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,530
You know I don't like trying new stuff.

219
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:18,790
Exactly why I brought something
a little healthier this time.

220
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,040
Healthier, you say?

221
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,330
What, does it
contain protein or something?

222
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,340
Well, thank you then.

223
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,760
All right.

224
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,060
Mmm.

225
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,640
It tastes better too, hmm?

226
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,440
So you've been
leaving the hospital a lot lately.

227
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,520
It's a secret.

228
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,610
I'm just curious, that's all.

229
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:00,040
What, is there anything fun
going on out in the world?

230
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,700
Shh.

231
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:10,130
I know Mr. Park
likes to mix soju and beer.

232
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,210
Now…

233
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,340
Ready, action.

234
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,510
That's perfect.

235
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,390
What are you up to these days?

236
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,770
Uh, me?

237
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,900
What does a director always do?
Prepare for his next movie.

238
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,120
Now I'm really curious
about what kind of movie you're planning.

239
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,580
What kind of masterpiece would it be?

240
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,870
Aren't you curious, Seoyoung?
Pass me some napkins.

241
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,040
Napkins, behind you.

242
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,250
Oh, yes. Here they are.

243
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
Here you go, Mr. Park.

244
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,510
All right.

245
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,890
Why don't you drink up?

246
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,400
Looks refreshing.

247
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,110
It's a romance film.

248
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,440
You know, what Lee is best at.

249
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,700
He's making one with me.

250
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,660
You ask any director on a break,

251
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,290
and they always say
they're preparing the next one.

252
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,450
They make one hit,

253
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,620
and then poof,
they're gone without a trace.

254
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,380
But you said Mr. Lee's different.

255
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:37,220
And you really are different,
seeing how you showed up here.

256
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,140
What's so different? I'm the same.

257
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,430
But it seems like you've taken
quite an interest in me. It's a bit much.

258
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,560
Well, sorry if I made you uncomfortable.

259
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:52,020
What was it like
when you two were together?

260
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:57,570
Must have been a pretty tough shoot.

261
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,570
Your knack for rudeness
really mirrors your directing style.

262
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,780
I'm going to get some air.

263
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,050
You do know
humility isn't your thing, right?

264
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:23,220
I honestly have no idea
where that ego of yours comes from.

265
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,220
Hey now, come on.

266
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,310
Would you both cut it out?
Please.

267
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,480
At least I'm still making movies
one after another.

268
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,270
Isn't that what a director's
supposed to do?

269
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,240
Movies full of out-of-context
love scenes and nudity?

270
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,070
The kind people only skip
to whatever the "good part" is?

271
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,120
Don't you feel sorry
for those poor actors?

272
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,960
I don't know how you can laugh
after wasting such talent.

273
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,170
Go easy

274
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,460
on the soju bombs.

275
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,090
And those box office bombs too.

276
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:04,100
If this one flops too,
that's what, three? No…

277
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,640
four in a row, is it?

278
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,720
Hey!

279
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,060
What the hell did you just say to me?

280
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,600
"If it flops"?

281
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,900
It's only the premiere
and you say that crap?

282
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,110
You rat!
Let's not do this.

283
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,320
Mouthing off to someone
who's done this longer than you.

284
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,820
Let's take a smoke break, Mr. Park.
This little…

285
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,110
Get some air, okay?

286
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,410
Look what this industry has become!

287
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,250
Did you have to go that far?

288
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,830
That was seriously out of line.

289
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,830
You can't deny his movie was good.

290
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,130
The Lonely People?

291
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,460
Sure, it was solid.

292
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,050
But was it really a film
five million people needed to see?

293
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,300
Will you keep it down?
The big debut from the master's son!

294
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,300
You're embarrassing yourself.

295
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,930
We were all just curious
what the late Lee Duyoung

296
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,980
would have thought about it.
We get it. You can stop now.

297
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,810
That's the only reason
five million people went to see it!

298
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,650
Unbelievable. Please calm down.

299
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,610
Seriously, who does he think he is?

300
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,410
He's just jealous of you.

301
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,660
It's inferiority complex.

302
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:10,330
I'll bring him over,
so let's clear the air, okay?

303
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,330
What misunderstanding?
They were purely facts.

304
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,460
That's low, beating me down
with stone-cold facts.

305
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,960
Congratulations. And sorry too,
for killing the vibe.

306
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,720
Come on, don't leave yet.

307
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,640
No, I'll stay buried a little longer.

308
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,760
Not as Lee Jeha,

309
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,680
but as "Lee Duyoung's son."

310
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,480
Fine, get outta here.

311
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,810
We'll talk later.

312
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,190
CHOIDAEPO BBQ

313
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,980
Sure, there were some pointless nudity
and love scenes.

314
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,360
But I did it
because I liked the character.

315
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,660
So, I don't hate the film.

316
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,780
Though I don't like the director.

317
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm sorry.

318
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,500
I know it doesn't mean much now…

319
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,720
But you were great.
I could tell how hard you must've worked.

320
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,060
You know,
my acting got better after the divorce.

321
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,430
Like how breaking up with you
finally set things in motion.

322
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,600
Maybe things only work well for me
when I end it with someone.

323
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,230
Should I just keep dating, break up,

324
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,480
get remarried, break up again, and repeat?

325
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,860
Want to make me a better actor
and date me for a bit?

326
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,950
You're drunk. That's enough for tonight.

327
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,290
Director Lee.

328
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,800
Do you still love me?

329
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,510
If you don't, stop getting upset over me.

330
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,680
Don't act like you regret it.

331
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,230
It's not because of you. It's just…

332
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,480
After five years of being stuck,

333
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,940
it feels like I'm rotting away. That's it.

334
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,960
NO SMOKING ZONE

335
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,960
Oh.

336
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,880
Oh, was that your seat?

337
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,680
No, I'm leaving. You can stay.

338
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,760
No, wait.

339
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:57,430
Please sit.
It's fine, really.

340
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,520
I guess I'll stay then.

341
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,610
GRAPE 100

342
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,330
I wasn't looking because I wanted one.

343
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,590
Here.

344
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,220
Take one.

345
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,020
I don't want it.

346
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,900
Come on, just take one.

347
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,860
It's really okay. Please take it.

348
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,030
You didn't film me, right?
I feel like you did.

349
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,910
No, I didn't.
I saw the red light turn on.

350
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,710
No. I really didn't film you.

351
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,380
All right, then. Thanks for this.

352
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,510
Actually, I got that
from a "buy two, get one free" deal,

353
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:20,680
so this makes it like I just got two
for the price of two now.

354
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,810
Hmm…

355
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,970
But it's really okay.

356
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,730
It's my gift to you.

357
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,280
Okay.

358
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,960
Thank you!

359
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,170
I just wanted to thank you,

360
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:51,710
that's all.

361
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:55,840
Gosh, that's hot.

362
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,180
Who was that guy?

363
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,310
Someone you know?

364
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:22,410
I'm not sure if
I could say I know him or not.

365
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:24,870
What does that mean?

366
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,080
Is he hot?

367
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,290
He's not bad-looking.

368
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,710
Are you serious?

369
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,170
Like you would know.

370
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,590
You've never even dated.

371
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:37,970
Hey now,

372
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:41,300
there's a difference between
"not doing" and "not getting to."

373
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,760
Of course, there is.
Mmm.

374
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,930
So what's it like
to have never "gotten to" date anyone?

375
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,270
Freaking fantastic. Satisfied?

376
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:55,900
Hilarious.

377
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,030
Hey, what's this?

378
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,160
Where have you been running around lately?

379
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,370
Did you have a fall?

380
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,490
Ah.

381
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,710
This was just a plain old fall. That's it.

382
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,370
You know,
you've been acting strange lately.

383
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,250
Wait, wait, hang on.
I had something to ask you.

384
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,090
Look at this right here.

385
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,220
What do you think?

386
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,840
It looks tacky.

387
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,390
What about this?

388
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,180
Gives me grandma vibes.

389
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,680
"Grandma vibes"?

390
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:30,890
What's the occasion?

391
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,060
Fashion's all about when and where
you're going to wear it.

392
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,610
It's for an important day.

393
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,190
The most important day for me.

394
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,960
GRAPE 100

395
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,230
LOVE IN WHITE
SCREENPLAY BY LEE DUYOUNG

396
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,590
Stop!

397
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,920
Are you crazy?

398
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,090
Let me go!

399
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,300
Who are you to tell me what to do?

400
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,060
I…

401
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,810
have every right to destroy myself!

402
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,400
No one…

403
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,900
has the right to destroy themselves.

404
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,280
The only right we have is to love.

405
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,120
It's cold. Let's get out of here.

406
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,510
The door?

407
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,470
I closed it.

408
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,840
How's your health nowadays?

409
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,890
It'd be strange
if I was healthy at this age.

410
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,220
Don't worry about it.

411
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,810
Maybe it's time you took a step back.

412
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:37,060
There have been a lot of
young people coming in lately.

413
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,270
Even younger than you.

414
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,940
I told you,
young people don't watch this stuff.

415
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,690
Who even likes melodrama anymore?

416
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,660
Looks like there is one.

417
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,340
Oh.

418
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,630
No.

419
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,470
You don't know me.

420
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,510
No, no.

421
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,870
I found him.

422
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,330
KIM HYUNCHEOL

423
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:39,120
KIM JINYEO

424
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:41,040
LOVE IN WHITE

425
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,100
You came to see Love in White.

426
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,390
It's a great film, isn't it?

427
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,980
Maybe for people like you
who want to remember it that way.

428
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,400
Do you have something to say to me?

429
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,940
Yes. About Love in White.

430
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,910
You really want
to talk about that film with me?

431
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:15,200
I just thought
maybe you didn't understand it.

432
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:18,080
Love in White,

433
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,080
it's a truly beautiful love story.

434
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,920
I'm sure it's tear-jerkingly beautiful,
since it's all fake.

435
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,840
The second my mom passed,

436
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,510
you two went right ahead and made it
like nothing was in your way.

437
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:32,630
I guess you really don't understand

438
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,590
what the writer was feeling.

439
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,260
The viewer's feelings matter too.

440
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,480
For some people,
this film could be a filthy memory.

441
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,310
You still don't get that, do you?

442
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,400
I just hoped you'd understand
what this film really means.

443
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,900
And why would I need to?

444
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:53,530
You've only seen Love in White
as a finished production.

445
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,280
When you have time,
try reading the first draft.

446
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:00,040
As a writer yourself,
maybe if you read it--

447
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,330
We're not in any position
to be talking like this.

448
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I'm sorry.

449
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,800
You're sorry? After all this time?

450
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,430
Well, that's funny.

451
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,840
Enjoy soaking up what's left of
dear Mr. Lee Duyoung.

452
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,600
The legendary director's masterpiece,

453
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,810
reimagined by his son for the modern era.

454
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,690
That's a movie in itself, isn't it?

455
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:27,810
Right.

456
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,610
He's not the type to say yes easily.

457
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,230
We'd have to set it up right.

458
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,820
We've already got Kim Jungwoo as the lead.

459
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,450
That's right, Korea's boyfriend.

460
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,370
So if we can just
get Chae Seoyoung on board--

461
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,120
Okay, sir.
I'll explain everything in person.

462
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:51,630
Isn't it about time you took those?

463
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:52,840
I told you to keep them.

464
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,880
They literally say "Lee Jeha".
How long am I supposed to hold on to them?

465
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:57,090
BEST DIRECTOR BEST SCREENPLAY

466
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,390
Next year,

467
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:01,680
Cannes is holding a special retrospective
for your father, Director Lee.

468
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,520
I'm getting the Love in White remake
into that lineup.

469
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,900
I'll get it in,
and you're going to make it.

470
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:11,860
Easy for you to say.

471
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:16,400
I think this could be your chance
to face everything head-on.

472
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,370
I'm not interested in going head-on.

473
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:21,910
I want to make something that's mine,
in my own name.

474
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:24,370
Do you even have any money?

475
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:27,620
Inheritance? Come on.
Everyone except Director Park knows

476
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:30,590
that your dad couldn't make
another film after Love in White

477
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:32,550
and just racked up debt.

478
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:34,590
You dumped all your money
into paying it off!

479
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,350
You know, this project…

480
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:41,970
LOVE IN WHITE

481
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,640
…actually went to Park first.

482
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,940
What did you just say?
So answer carefully.

483
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,360
If you keep refusing it,

484
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,730
it'll have to go back to Park.

485
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,480
Seungwon…

486
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:57,490
Exactly! This film
shouldn't be handled that way.

487
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,160
That's why I called you.

488
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,370
That's why I can't let it go.

489
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,700
Because I know
you're the best one for this job.

490
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:07,160
I don't think I have it in me
to do this right.

491
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,210
HOSPITAL
SHUTTLE BUS

492
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,050
TIME TO EAT

493
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,850
♪ Man, I was so close ♪

494
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,480
♪ Could've been on that bus ♪

495
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,650
Everything hurts
and falls apart at this age.

496
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:33,980
Why are you making a fuss?

497
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,360
Enough now!

498
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,820
Hospital stay?

499
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,240
You think money grows on trees?

500
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,910
I'm hanging up.

501
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,960
Excuse me.

502
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,130
Would you like some of this?

503
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:01,130
I'm fine.

504
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,550
Aren't you sweet? You go ahead.

505
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,260
I'm fasting right now anyway.

506
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,640
Ah. Okay.

507
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,120
Is there something on my face?

508
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,030
You're just pretty.

509
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,200
But you're way prettier than I am.

510
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,500
Oh, come on.

511
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,130
What's pretty about an old,
shriveled-up granny?

512
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,500
That's what makes you beautiful.

513
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:40,880
You really are much prettier.

514
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:46,720
You reached the end
of your savings plan!

515
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:47,810
Congratulations.

516
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,680
Yes, thank you.

517
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:50,980
How would you like to proceed?

518
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,230
Could you transfer the funds
to this account?

519
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,650
Of course, I can do that.

520
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,400
So that clears all the debt
tied to the house, right?

521
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,530
Must've been tough,
covering it month by month.

522
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:02,740
I'm happy for you.

523
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,910
Here's the key.

524
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,120
Five years was too long to pay it off.

525
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,000
I'm sorry.

526
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,080
I'm the one
who owes your father an apology.

527
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,540
Times got tough, you know.

528
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,880
It's okay. You didn't sell the house.

529
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,090
That's enough for me.

530
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,930
Take care.
You too.

531
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:12,430
That's that.
Keep up the good work, everyone.

532
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,600
Cheers!
Cheers!

533
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,810
Great work.

534
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,190
Let's dig in.

535
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:20,400
Mom.
Oh, my baby!

536
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,820
When did you get here?

537
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,820
Do you want a slice of apple? Here.

538
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,420
Don't forget to eat.

539
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,130
Try reading the first draft.

540
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:08,760
As a writer yourself,
maybe if you read it,

541
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,720
you'd understand the writer's feelings.

542
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:29,380
YU EUNAE

543
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,900
COMPLETED SEPTEMBER 17, 1996

544
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,570
SCREENPLAY BY YU EUNAE

545
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,080
LOVE IN WHITE

546
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:42,370
How could it be?

547
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:47,460
LOVE IN WHITE
SCREENPLAY BY YU EUNAE

548
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:24,740
I HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO DESTROY MYSELF

549
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,050
Scene 31 feels a bit flat to me.

550
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:41,800
What do you think, Nam?
You know, in Love in White.

551
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,470
The scene where they meet again.

552
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,980
Even when I was writing it,

553
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,690
I kept second-guessing myself, you know?

554
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:52,230
"Is this right?"

555
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:54,400
So I rewrote it again and again.

556
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,030
But you're telling me
it all came together?

557
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,450
That's the stuff
I need you all to look out for.

558
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:40,950
How's Seung…

559
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:44,570
No. How is Mr. Bu doing?

560
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,950
He never checks in since he went solo.

561
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,500
He's the same as always.

562
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,910
Seems to be doing well.

563
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:56,250
THE CHASE

564
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,210
BLACK SUN

565
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,300
You know how it is these days.
The market's tough.

566
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,850
You'll at least read it, right?
I think with a few tweaks--

567
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:13,230
Director Park sat on this one
for two years.

568
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:16,270
It didn't work out,
but the premise is solid.

569
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,480
Take a look.

570
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:21,360
Maybe you could give it a spin
in your own style, you know?

571
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:23,990
I'll pass.

572
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:26,820
Well, give me a call
if you change your mind.

573
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,910
Hello, Mr. Jeong!

574
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:30,410
Oh, Mr. Park.
Gosh.

575
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,580
Fancy seeing you here.

576
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:36,210
Right.

577
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:39,000
It would've been nice
to grab a meal together,

578
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,210
but I've got plans.

579
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:47,720
Sorry, I feel like I wasted your time.

580
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,510
No, please. Carry on.

581
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,980
I guess he knows
how to be polite to a producer.

582
00:42:56,730 --> 00:43:00,270
I should get going.
Seems like you have plans with Mr. Park.

583
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,650
Yes, it's about the project
he's doing after Love in White.

584
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,400
Pardon?

585
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,910
Love… Love is White?

586
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:10,660
Oh, of course.
I heard you were at the top of the list,

587
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,830
but you turned it down for good.

588
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:15,500
Park said he's doing it in his usual,

589
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,170
you know, very sexual style.

590
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,340
At this rate, Love in White

591
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,670
might as well be Love in Red.

592
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,470
Hey, Lee!

593
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,110
If this one tanks,
how many in a row is that for you?

594
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:42,690
Are you really doing it?

595
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,570
You mean, Love in White?

596
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:47,280
I'm considering the offer.

597
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,410
I know you've only done one film,

598
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:52,540
but you're still a director.
You know how tacky that film is.

599
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:54,700
Of course, I know.

600
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:57,250
What, do I need
your permission or something?

601
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:59,000
To direct Love in White?

602
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:02,090
Would you back out if I said no?

603
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,550
You're still close with Seoyoung, right?

604
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:10,260
I've got her in mind
for another spicy role.

605
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:12,350
Can you put in a good word?

606
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,770
Don't want to?

607
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,480
No, I don't.

608
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:20,810
What the--

609
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:25,360
Why so scared?

610
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,570
You out of your mind? I'm your senior!

611
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:29,200
You're right.

612
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,330
Maybe I am losing my mind.

613
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:54,930
LOVE IN WHITE
SCREENPLAY BY YU EUNAE

614
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,980
We need some serious
stripping for this genre to work.

615
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:09,990
Yeah, sure.
We've got to make it work.

616
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:13,620
Speaking of which,
can't we get Chae Seoyoung?

617
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,240
Not like last time.

618
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:19,710
This time, we explicitly state
the level of nudity in her contract…

619
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:21,460
GIVE ME TIME TO REWORK IT.
COLD NOODLES. YOUR TREAT.

620
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:22,920
…so she can't back out of it.

621
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,750
Why are you so obsessed
with stripping people down?

622
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,710
They'd catch a cold in this warm weather.

623
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:31,680
Our investor's starting drama again.

624
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,720
I'll call you, okay?

625
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:36,640
Wait, you're leaving?

626
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,930
Aren't we eating?

627
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,930
I'm heading out for the day.

628
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,140
Yes, sir.

629
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,310
PYEONGYANG COLD NOODLES

630
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,030
This was your plan all along, right?

631
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:50,190
I don't have plans.

632
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,530
I didn't have a reason to do it,
but now I do.

633
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,030
Let's make it better than your father's.

634
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,500
Whatever you want to do,

635
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,790
I'm here to support you 100%.

636
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,380
Okay, so we got the director.

637
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:09,010
And for actors, let's see…

638
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:11,880
How about Chae Seoyoung?

639
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,970
She absolutely lit up

640
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:17,510
when she heard you were directing again.

641
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,600
Maybe she still has a thing for you?

642
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,770
Go on at your own risk.

643
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:24,190
Can't you see it?

644
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:25,600
Back in the day,

645
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:29,150
she was just a rookie who'd cry all night
from one note you gave her…

646
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:32,030
…and now she's a heavyweight
in the industry.

647
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,570
She was married but is now single.

648
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:38,120
So you want me
to reel in the great Chae Seoyoung?

649
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,540
If you don't lock her in now,
you never will.

650
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:43,410
The timing's perfect.
She's loyal, you know.

651
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,830
I don't want to make a film
out of loyalty.

652
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,750
This is all about investment, man.

653
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,500
If Seoyoung signs on, the money follows.

654
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:52,630
I'd have to write the script first.

655
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:55,260
I'm not writing with anyone in mind.

656
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,800
Oh, and like I told you,

657
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:01,640
I need at least two months
for the rewrite.

658
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:05,730
Is there a way you can do it in one?

659
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:07,770
The original's from the '90s.

660
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:12,070
Updating it to the present day
changes more than you think.

661
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:17,700
What we need is realism.

662
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:21,990
I need a consultant
for depression and terminal illness.

663
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,000
You have to connect me to one ASAP.

664
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,290
I got chills.

665
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:27,540
So brazen,

666
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:30,630
barging in
and shamelessly asking for everything.

667
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:32,760
You haven't changed one bit!

668
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:37,090
Jeha.

669
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,430
Can I get a hug?

670
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:42,640
Come on, man.

671
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,720
Wait, my drink…

672
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:45,940
Got it. Come here.

673
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:18,510
What are they filming?

674
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:20,140
Who is that?

675
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:22,560
Please step back.
That's pretty cool.

676
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,810
What is it?

677
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:26,730
Isn't that Chae Seoyoung?

678
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:29,600
Excuse me. Sorry. Pardon me.

679
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:30,980
Sorry.

680
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:33,480
Chae Seoyoung is here.
Can we take a picture?

681
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:35,530
I don't know.
For some movie, I guess.

682
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:38,530
What? Of course, you're way prettier.

683
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,370
She's not that pretty at all.

684
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:46,410
Hang on a second.

685
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:51,880
Wow, she's gorgeous.

686
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,290
I've never seen her in real life.

687
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,880
The dolly shot is gonna come right to you.

688
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,470
Can't I just take one picture?

689
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:00,050
No filming.

690
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,930
Why not?
No photos, please.

691
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:05,560
Sorry.
Can't I just take one?

692
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,140
Scene 67, take 1.
Action!

693
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,020
Cut!

694
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:14,150
Action!

695
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:17,280
Take 7!

696
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:21,490
Let me wipe my sweat first.

697
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,410
Cut!

698
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:30,620
Let's try one more time.
Take 15.

699
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:32,540
Take 17.

700
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:34,290
This better be the last take.

701
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,460
TIME TO EAT

702
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,280
Cut! Okay!

703
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,950
That last take was fantastic!

704
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:48,530
I never thought it'd be this exhausting.

705
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,870
I'm only doing this
because you're directing.

706
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:52,960
Geez, I'm sorry.

707
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,750
Speaking of, let's take a break
and do the next scene.

708
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,670
The water might be a bit cold.

709
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:00,750
I checked, and it was all right.

710
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:03,800
We got five outfits,
so you just need to go in five times.

711
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:12,270
Yeah.

712
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:15,100
The car was stuffy…

713
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:16,560
…so I'm taking a breather.

714
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:20,360
No, I'm fine. Don't come.
You guys go ahead and eat.

715
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,650
I'll be back after getting some air.

716
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,530
I'm hungry.

717
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:32,040
Look, that's Chae Seoyoung.

718
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,330
What? For real?

719
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:35,620
Chae Seoyoung.
Is that really her?

720
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:37,000
Why is she here?

721
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:40,590
What do I do…

722
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,130
Um, excuse me.

723
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:46,470
Take this if you need.

724
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:49,220
Uh…

725
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,850
I can't ruin my hair.

726
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:51,930
But thank you.

727
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,680
Oh, okay.

728
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:22,340
Well, would you like a sandwich?

729
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:25,090
I'm okay.

730
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:27,760
Sorry to keep bothering you
while you're resting.

731
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:34,720
Oh, this is rye bread.

732
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:47,900
Are you Chae Seoyoung?
Could we take a picture with you?

733
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:49,150
I'm such a huge fan.

734
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:52,740
I'm sorry.

735
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:54,990
She's eating right now.

736
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,500
Sorry. My apologies.
Okay.

737
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:04,090
Thank you.

738
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,670
I just thought you needed some peace
for your break.

739
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:10,760
Am I being too nosy?

740
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,520
Can I ask why you're filming with that?

741
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,150
The scenery's pretty.

742
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:26,980
I want to watch this later
in case I don't get to be here again.

743
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:29,990
Why won't you be here?
You can always come back.

744
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,820
I have to dive in there later.

745
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:33,910
Why?

746
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:36,870
I'm being chased with a bag full of money,

747
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:39,080
then I fight over it with the bag's owner

748
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,660
until it drops in there.

749
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:43,750
That's so awesome.

750
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:45,210
It sounds really exciting.

751
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:46,460
It's actually not.

752
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:48,840
I'm afraid of water.

753
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:51,760
It feels like dying when I'm underwater.

754
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:57,970
Sorry about that.

755
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:01,520
But why, then?

756
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,350
Because it's my job.

757
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,610
I have to endure it.

758
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:09,860
Thanks for the food.

759
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,240
I'm a big fan.

760
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:15,870
Ever since The Lonely People.

761
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,620
Ah, want an autograph?

762
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:21,210
Or a photo, if you don't have a pen?

763
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:26,130
If you don't mind, could we use this?
It has a selfie mode.

764
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:28,000
Sure.
Give me a second.

765
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,970
I love you, Seoyoung!

766
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,260
Thank you for the food.

767
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:42,060
Wait, I forgot to press the button.

768
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:43,190
Hang on, sorry.

769
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:44,730
There we go.

770
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:47,650
I love you, Seoyoung!

771
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:49,400
Thanks for the food.

772
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:51,900
Thank you so much.

773
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:53,820
Thank you.

774
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,740
I need to pay you back for the sandwich.

775
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,910
It's okay. Go ahead.

776
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:02,120
Thanks. If we ever meet again,

777
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,000
I'll pay you back for the sandwich.

778
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:09,210
Break a leg, Seoyoung!

779
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,880
Good luck on the shoot!

780
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:13,720
Break a leg!

781
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,430
I love you!

782
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:18,140
My gosh. Unbelievable.

783
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,450
"LOVE IN WHITE" 6TH DRAFT
TERMINAL ILLNESS…

784
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:04,980
BU SEUNGWON

785
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,530
I don't like the consultant you got me.
They didn't even read the synopsis.

786
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:16,740
Can you at least say hello first?

787
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:18,860
How's it going? It's been a month.

788
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:21,120
I told you two months.

789
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,660
Was it the third draft last time?

790
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,490
Now, that one was good.

791
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:27,580
Was it the fifth?
It looks modern and ready to go.

792
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,880
How can a female character
just be so submissive?

793
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:35,010
What would've happened
if the male protagonist didn't find her?

794
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:37,470
No dream, no ambition.

795
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:40,390
I don't know what the writer was thinking.

796
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,350
Well, it's what your father was thinking.

797
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:47,480
I don't know.

798
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:49,140
What?

799
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:52,360
I mean, it's way too old-fashioned
even for something from the 90s.

800
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:53,940
Old-fashioned?

801
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:56,990
Anyway, I got a new consultant for you.

802
00:56:57,070 --> 00:56:58,150
You'll like this one.

803
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,320
He's a very busy man, you know.

804
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:02,160
I worked really hard to fit you in.

805
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:05,410
Okay, I'll humor you one more time.
Can I see him today?

806
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:08,120
Maybe the assistant director
wants to join?

807
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:11,460
I'll just go alone.
I'll send you the address.

808
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:13,210
Oh, and that doctor…

809
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:16,090
How should I put it?

810
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:17,340
Well, he's a bit…

811
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:19,300
Never mind, you'll know when you see him.

812
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:20,880
All right.

813
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:28,430
You're only 29,

814
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,690
and you did Squid Game

815
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:31,900
and even I, the Executioner?

816
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,480
Your résumé is seriously…

817
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:37,320
Thank you so much.

818
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:40,860
Are you okay, not getting any rest
after your last project?

819
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:43,700
Well, this will be my last job as an AD.

820
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:44,910
Of course!

821
00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:48,080
Producers are lining up
for your directorial debut.

822
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,000
Why would I direct? It's such a hassle.

823
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:53,080
It's exhausting. It's stressful.
Everyone wants everything from you.

824
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:56,380
You work in the cold when it's freezing,
in the heat when it's hot. Mm-mmm.

825
00:57:57,130 --> 00:57:58,380
I hate it.

826
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:01,760
What? Then why are you still an AD?

827
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:04,590
I wanted to work on Director Lee's film.

828
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:12,640
That Bu Seungwon must be insane.

829
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:14,810
How dare he try to throw her into that?

830
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:18,480
Should I still run it by Seoyoung?

831
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:19,780
Are you insane too?

832
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:23,530
Just thinking about Lee Jeha
still makes my blood boil.

833
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:26,740
All that time, money, and roles
Seoyoung lost because of him!

834
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:27,950
I'm sorry, ma'am.

835
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:31,500
Don't even say a word to Seoyoung.

836
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:35,290
Keep this project away from her
no matter what.

837
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:36,540
Yes, ma'am.

838
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:39,380
Just shred it to pieces!
I will.

839
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,270
BE AS HAPPY AS YOU CHOOSE TO BE

840
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,230
Here's your coffee.

841
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:00,780
Have you ever been sick?

842
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:04,530
I had a check-up a few years back.
Nothing extraordinary.

843
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:06,820
What about your family, your parents?

844
00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:11,870
Both of my parents passed.

845
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:14,870
Well, my mother…

846
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:17,170
She was ill before she passed.

847
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:18,380
Hmm.

848
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,380
So your mother was ill.

849
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:25,340
For now,

850
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:28,010
you asked about terminal cases
on your questionnaire.

851
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:30,890
Those can't be confirmed
through basic check-ups.

852
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:33,730
It just doesn't show up there. Never does.

853
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,100
Then how do people
find out that they're sick?

854
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:40,320
Well,

855
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,860
they're usually carried in
when it's already too late.

856
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:48,320
Oh. Usually.

857
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:49,830
Mmm.

858
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:55,120
You know,
this whole "terminal illness" premise…

859
00:59:55,210 --> 00:59:57,670
It's a bit cliché, I know. Way overused.

860
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:00,130
Nah. It should be used more.

861
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:03,000
Do you know how many terminal patients
there are in Korea?

862
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,090
A lot of them, and they're all different.

863
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:09,470
It's a melodrama,
so we just need a simple terminal case.

864
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:18,690
Now that's a cliché way of thinking.

865
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:21,190
My man,

866
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:23,980
terminal cases are never simple.

867
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:26,320
Right. Poor choice of words.

868
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,280
I'm sorry.

869
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:31,700
No need to apologize to me.

870
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:35,200
How long does the patient have?

871
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:37,620
You know, in your movie.

872
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:42,420
I'm a doctor who actually understands
dramatic license.

873
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:45,670
How long would be appropriate?
That's what I came to ask.

874
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:51,510
I think…

875
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:56,220
I want to be a director in my next life
instead of a doctor.

876
01:00:57,390 --> 01:00:59,140
You guys make up whatever you want.

877
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:01,690
Love, death…

878
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,690
Well, yeah.

879
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,570
How about a year?

880
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:13,870
Is that too long? Six months?

881
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:17,000
A year or six months,
which is it?

882
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,460
You've got to make a choice.

883
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,790
That's a massive difference.

884
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,080
Six months.

885
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:24,210
Six months?

886
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:29,510
Hmm.

887
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:34,140
Hang on. Let's see…

888
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,230
Hey, where are you?
You're still here, right?

889
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:45,690
Want to do some consulting?

890
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:47,860
Is that so?

891
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:50,030
Oh, I see.

892
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:53,990
Mmm.

893
01:01:55,330 --> 01:01:57,540
Dr. Lee probably doesn't know yet either.

894
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:58,830
I should head down too.

895
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:01,370
All right.

896
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:05,380
Follow me.

897
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:18,100
Cause of death was shock.

898
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,020
It happened just once,

899
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:25,230
but for this patient, that once was fatal.

900
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:28,610
Excuse me.

901
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:33,990
That's why it ended so suddenly.

902
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:37,740
That's why

903
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:40,120
illnesses are so scary.

904
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:42,330
You can't stop them,

905
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,250
you can't reverse them.
They happen so fast.

906
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:49,670
The shock episodes become more frequent
as the condition worsens.

907
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:53,090
And yes, they're painful.

908
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:54,630
Almost like getting shot.

909
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:58,260
Like your whole body is torn apart.

910
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:03,020
Yes?

911
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:06,860
Ah. I'll head back up.

912
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:09,360
They're calling for me.

913
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,440
Wait here,
and she'll be right over.

914
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:14,990
Sorry? Who?

915
01:03:15,070 --> 01:03:16,360
The one you're looking for.

916
01:03:17,070 --> 01:03:18,070
Carry on.

917
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:28,670
OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES

918
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:15,340
THE LATE KIM MINJEONG

919
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,190
Minjeong…

920
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,050
TIME TO EAT

921
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:30,680
Hey.
Is there another doctor I can consult?

922
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:32,600
This one's just a bit weird.

923
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:33,810
Yes.

924
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:35,060
Is that so?

925
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:38,110
Yes. All right.
Hang on. I have to go.

926
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:40,190
Yes, I understand.

927
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:42,070
What is it?

928
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:43,910
Hello.

929
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:47,120
I'm not really sure how this works…

930
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:51,790
I just wanted to ask if we can
use flowers other than chrysanthemums.

931
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:55,210
Maybe something like ranunculus or lilies?

932
01:06:55,290 --> 01:06:57,130
You know, like…

933
01:06:57,210 --> 01:07:00,090
Something a bit more colorful and bright.

934
01:07:00,170 --> 01:07:01,550
I don't know how to put it.

935
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:05,050
Kind of like wedding decorations, I guess?

936
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,470
And for the portrait area,

937
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:09,970
I was thinking
maybe alliums or baby's breath?

938
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:11,520
In the funeral hall?

939
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:14,140
Yes, the funeral hall.

940
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:17,060
Actually, can we
change the location entirely?

941
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:19,320
I'd prefer it not be at a funeral home.

942
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,360
Nothing too formal or traditional.

943
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:23,700
Is that even allowed?

944
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:26,240
That's what I'm asking. Is it?

945
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:30,410
Honestly, it's my first week on the job.
But I'll find out for you.

946
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,160
Thank you.

947
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:34,410
Could I just get your card?

948
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:39,380
FUNERAL DIRECTOR, KIM JIHO

949
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:48,340
HANKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
FUNERAL HOME

950
01:08:20,590 --> 01:08:22,340
Thank you.

951
01:09:01,630 --> 01:09:03,130
Where have you been?

952
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:08,420
Me?

953
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:11,090
Yes, you.

954
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:17,230
You were looking for me.

955
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:20,020
I was?

956
01:09:25,650 --> 01:09:28,780
Are you the one
from the convenience store?

957
01:09:30,490 --> 01:09:31,660
And also…

958
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,450
at Cinema Jongno, right?

959
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:39,620
We meet again.

960
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:47,090
Are you--

961
01:09:47,170 --> 01:09:48,170
Yes.

962
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:50,010
That's me too.

963
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:59,020
I heard you needed a consultant.

964
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:05,020
Are you a doctor? Or a nurse?

965
01:10:08,570 --> 01:10:09,570
Neither.

966
01:10:32,090 --> 01:10:33,470
I'm your consultant,

967
01:10:34,050 --> 01:10:36,970
the terminal patient, Lee Daeum.

968
01:11:19,970 --> 01:11:22,520
I'm not looking to cast someone
in a documentary.

969
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:24,310
Hello!

970
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,560
My name is Lee Daeum, and I'm an actress.

971
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,440
Try persuading Seoyoung
until production begins,

972
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:35,860
and if she says yes,
then the rookie can go.

973
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,700
I want to do that movie.

974
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:41,990
I really want

975
01:11:43,370 --> 01:11:45,330
to make this movie with you.
