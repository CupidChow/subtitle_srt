OUR MOVIE

00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,199
ANY RESEMBLANCE
TO ACTUAL PEOPLE, PLACES,

3
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,450
OR MEDICAL CONDITIONS
IS COINCIDENTAL.

4
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:34,701
CHILD ACTORS WERE
ALWAYS SUPERVISED

5
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:35,953
AND SAFELY FILMED
UNDER GUIDELINES.

6
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,471
Why do you keep denying it?

7
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,598
I know I messed up.

8
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,226
Just have a bite.

9
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:03,146
You yourself know it best.

10
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,900
Every cell in your body knows.

11
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,487
That it's love.

12
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,366
No, I'm not so sure.

13
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,750
Something is stirring in me,

14
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,962
but I don't know if I can call that love.

15
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,883
Or if I'm even someone worthy of it.

16
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:41,393
EPISODE 7

17
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:44,521
I said, is it true?

18
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:46,982
Are you really dying?

19
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,618
Yes.

20
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,662
I'm dying soon.

21
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,833
It won't take long.

22
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,795
Oh.

23
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:11,840
This is how actors joke around.

24
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:17,387
You nailed it.
Lines should come out just like that.

25
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,225
I practiced so much,
I could recite them in my sleep.

26
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,911
- What's wrong?
- Huh?

27
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,079
Did you drink?

28
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,123
- No.
- I didn't drink either.

29
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:48,001
I saw your manager
drinking earlier though.

30
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,836
How are you getting home?

31
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,673
I can just grab a taxi.

32
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,384
Come with me, I'll take you home.

33
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:58,845
No, I can go on my own.
You don't even know where I live.

34
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,305
Doesn't matter.

35
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,598
What?

36
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:02,933
Nothing.

37
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,768
It's cold, let's go inside.

38
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:06,561
Yeah.

39
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,816
Are you two into each other,

40
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:15,404
or are you just slapping a cliché scandal
on top of an already cliché film?

41
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:19,991
But you know,

42
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,245
I think clichés actually work these days.

43
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,081
Remember Jungin's film?

44
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,251
It broke even ages ago and became a hit.

45
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:33,672
Everyone said it would flop
because of that messy scandal.

46
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:37,259
But surprise, that kind of thing
could be a strategy these days.

47
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:42,055
If that's what you wanted,
you should've gone with Director Park.

48
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,641
I was going to drop an article,

49
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:48,728
and there just happened to be
a lot of photos where you and Daeum

50
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,565
were glued together.

51
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,527
What, you expect the director
to stay apart from the lead?

52
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,038
Oh. You two heading out?

53
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,331
Yes, we're calling it.

54
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,543
Mr. Lee.

55
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,711
Yes?

56
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,129
See you soon. I'll be in touch.

57
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,298
Okay.

58
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:18,967
Okay, bye.

59
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,599
- Oh.
- Ah.

60
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,145
Uh, we went to college together.

61
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,400
Where are you going, Daeum?

62
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:37,944
I'm going home.

63
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,530
Right. Where's Junbyung?

64
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:44,117
He was drinking.
I told him I'd take a cab by myself.

65
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,454
Don't worry, Mr. Lee.

66
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,790
I'll make sure she gets home safe.

67
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,417
Okay, then. I'll see you on set.

68
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,753
Yes, take good care of her.

69
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,547
Have a good night.

70
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,610
TAXI
RESERVED

71
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,112
Thanks. I'll just go on my own.

72
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,989
You're really keeping your distance.

73
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,075
You get home safe too, okay?

74
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,952
Can I call you?

75
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,747
I'll just see you on set.

76
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:04,447
<i>Are you wondering</i>
<i>whether this is love or not?</i>

77
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,507
I saw Eunho.

78
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,136
Jeong Eunho?

79
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,763
- Yeah.
- Your first love?

80
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,599
Where?

81
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:33,059
He's working on our film's
camera crew for a bit.

82
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,269
Camera crew?

83
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,396
Hang on.

84
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,692
That means you saw
your first love again after five years.

85
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:44,988
Wait,

86
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,574
so you're working with your first love?

87
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:48,700
Exactly.

88
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,452
You know…

89
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,164
I used to wonder

90
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,875
what I'd feel if I ever saw him again.

91
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,293
Yeah, and?

92
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,546
I was glad to see him. Bit surprised.

93
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,381
That's it.

94
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,425
That's it? Not even a tiny spark?

95
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,177
That's what I'm saying.

96
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,262
Oh, boy.

97
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,184
Seeing your first love again
and feeling nothing…

98
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,853
Maybe it's because of him.

99
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,898
- Huh?
- You know, the guy

100
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,692
you said hurt you so badly
you almost cried.

101
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,195
Hey, I told you that wasn't me.

102
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,446
Wait, hold up.

103
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,408
That means your first love and that guy
are working together too.

104
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,745
- Are you looking at the time? Go to work!
- Oh, man.

105
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,413
All right, I'm going.

106
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:38,667
- Ah, you're the center of a love triangle.
- Just go!

107
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,085
Hurry up and go!

108
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,594
DIRECTOR LEE JEHA

109
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,521
LEE DAEUM

110
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,605
Mr. Lee.

111
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:04,693
Mr. Lee!

112
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:10,990
Well,
there's no way you're hungover.

113
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,410
- You didn't drink at all.
- Right.

114
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,996
Just need your okay
on the shooting schedule.

115
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:28,258
I meant to mention this.
Could we bunch up Daeum's scenes…

116
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,678
a little more?

117
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:35,056
Cut down her shooting days if possible.

118
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,142
Even more than this?

119
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,354
But that means she'll wrap up
a month before the other actors.

120
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:46,317
Wouldn't the rest of the cast complain
if we go too far?

121
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,777
Compared to Daeum, everyone's more--

122
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,571
She's a rookie, you know?

123
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,699
I just want to help her stay focused.

124
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,493
Sure, people might
hate us for it, but I agree.

125
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,079
She's an unproven rookie.

126
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:01,624
We'll have to think about replacing her
if it doesn't work out.

127
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,502
Frontloading her scenes
lets us decide early.

128
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:08,256
You shouldn't say something
that ominous like it's nothing.

129
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:12,719
A good producer prepares
for every kind of scenario.

130
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,304
Okay, Assistant Director?

131
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,515
Yes, Mr. Bu is right.

132
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:20,935
Let's go with that
and wrap up here for today.

133
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:22,812
Shall we?

134
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,439
We should talk, Director Lee.

135
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,403
Cold-blooded,
the both of them.

136
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,493
Mr. Han will be there on the first day.

137
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,453
Mr. Han? Why?

138
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,413
Why do you think? Lee Daeum.

139
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,918
Didn't we settle all that
with the test shoot?

140
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,921
When is anything in this world
ever that simple?

141
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,964
I tried to talk him out of it.

142
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,883
But the reason's even more absurd.

143
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,469
Apparently, he's bored and curious.

144
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,142
Let's give what we can give,
and take what we can take, Director.

145
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,867
LEE DAEUM
CELL PHONE

146
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,123
LEE DAEUM

147
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,210
MR. LEE, I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY.
CAN YOU SPARE A MOMENT?

148
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:35,051
Are you feeling okay, Ms. Chae?
Should I cancel your afternoon interview?

149
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,972
You throw "cancel" around too easily.

150
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:42,016
I'm fine.
I just didn't sleep well, that's all.

151
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,477
You don't look fine at all.

152
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,480
My team was just too slow.

153
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,232
I need help from a pro.

154
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,777
Of course, leave the digging
to the journalist.

155
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:53,862
You can count on me.

156
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:56,239
I'll pay however you want.

157
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,241
Money, information, anything.

158
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,617
I accept credit too.

159
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:03,997
Hello.

160
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:08,501
- What brings you here, Mr. Noh?
- Wow. Long time no see, Seoyoung.

161
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,587
You two know each other, right?

162
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,674
Noh Huitae, the reporter you once made
a request to behind the company's back.

163
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,718
Not a request, a press release.

164
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,387
Looks like you're the one
making a request.

165
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,974
Mmm, press release, request, whatever.
It's none of your business.

166
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,517
Go on, get her out of here.

167
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,603
Yes. Let's head out, Ms. Chae.

168
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,770
Ms. Go.

169
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,773
Are you digging into Lee Daeum?

170
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:31,983
Why?

171
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,319
I said, get her out of here.

172
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,486
Ms. Chae.

173
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,822
If you're trying to win someone over,

174
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,074
you should know this isn't the way.

175
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,535
Your playbook never changes.

176
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,505
Oh. Well, that was intense.

177
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,758
She's just touchy.
Contract renewal's coming up.

178
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,093
So what will you do with Chae Seoyoung--

179
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,681
Look into Lee Daeum for me.

180
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,141
Thoroughly.

181
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:19,864
Daeum!

182
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,243
Oh? Eunho.

183
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:24,911
What brings you here?

184
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,079
Signing my contract.

185
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,998
Hello, Mr. Lee. We meet again.

186
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,000
Yes, hello.

187
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,380
Why didn't you text me back?

188
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,840
Oh, I didn't?

189
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,051
Perfect timing. Let's grab a bite.

190
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,803
- Are you free?
- Right now?

191
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,972
Oh, food?

192
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,724
Right now is a bit…

193
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,188
Mr. Lee.

194
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,856
Come eat with us.

195
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,317
The three of us
eating together sounds great.

196
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,987
My manager actually owns a restaurant,

197
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,488
and the food is amazing.

198
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,074
Hey, this is perfect.

199
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,535
I'll lead the way.

200
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:09,122
LIMCINE RESTAURANT

201
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,924
There.

202
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,927
Enjoy.

203
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,730
What's with the alarm?

204
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,773
Yours went off at the same time.

205
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,401
Yeah, that's strange.

206
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:44,866
No, let me.

207
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,038
- Daeum.
- Yeah?

208
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,914
Slow down.

209
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,250
Right. I must've been hungry.

210
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,088
This is a new mix of people.

211
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,590
You two seem pretty close.

212
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,300
Still a bit awkward.

213
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,260
We're getting to know each other.

214
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:06,304
Getting to know what?

215
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,556
Each other.

216
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,564
It's not every day
that schoolmates meet again on set.

217
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,192
I hope you two can help each other out.

218
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,070
Sure.

219
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:25,990
<i>How was your audition?</i>

220
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,867
I didn't go.

221
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,744
Next time.

222
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,455
I want to go when I'm more prepared.

223
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,459
Funny how things work out.

224
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,169
Hmm?

225
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,420
What did you say?

226
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,049
It's nothing.

227
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,930
It's good, try it.

228
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,348
Thank you.

229
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:11,285
Me asking you to eat all of a sudden,
was that too much?

230
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,581
Not at all. It was nice,
eating together again after so long.

231
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,503
It still feels unreal.

232
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,587
What does?

233
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,507
That we're working together,

234
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:26,926
even if it's only for two weeks.

235
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,678
And…

236
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,847
that you made it.

237
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,976
You told me back then

238
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,561
you'd audition

239
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,147
when you were more prepared.

240
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,023
And now,

241
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:43,776
you made it here.

242
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,487
On the same director's film too.

243
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,031
You remember all that?

244
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,116
Of course.

245
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,452
It still feels unreal that I get to be
right next to you while it happens.

246
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:54,912
I'm just happy for you.

247
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,667
Thanks, that means a lot.

248
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,045
If you're free after this--

249
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,505
Sorry, Eunho.

250
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,716
I have somewhere to be. Get home safe.

251
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,800
I'll be off now.

252
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,869
Oh? Daeum, you're back.

253
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,414
Why did you come back?

254
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:47,173
Mr. Lee, could you look at me?

255
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,847
You knew I'd be back, didn't you?

256
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:56,807
No, I didn't.

257
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,434
Oh, hmm.

258
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,937
Anyway, I'm back.
I've got something to say.

259
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:04,982
And what's that?

260
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,110
Want to go see a movie with me?

261
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,385
I just wanted you to forget for a bit.

262
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,055
Forget what?

263
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,934
You're always thinking,

264
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,563
planning, and calculating.

265
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,857
I wanted you to forget all that
while you're here

266
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,943
and lose yourself in the movie.

267
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,407
Thank you.

268
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,867
I did manage to forget for a little while.

269
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:03,374
Do you think I…

270
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:07,878
No, we can finish our movie?

271
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,797
Like this one.

272
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,301
We have to.

273
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,595
We will.

274
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,100
And once our movie's finished,
how will it be remembered?

275
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,736
I don't know how it'll turn out
or how it'll be remembered either.

276
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,946
Hmm.

277
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:35,865
What if

278
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,284
it totally bombs,

279
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,329
you fall into another long slump,

280
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,790
and I'll be there to pretend
to cheer you up but actually bug you.

281
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,920
Well, that sounds highly plausible.

282
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,298
Or maybe

283
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,051
we'll get invited to film festivals
around the world

284
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,969
and win award after award.

285
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,680
We go to France, we go to America…

286
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,641
That would be awesome.

287
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,518
Going global is
the trend these days, right?

288
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:07,688
Let's find out together.

289
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,690
Sorry?

290
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:13,653
I'm not sure how our movie
will turn out or be remembered…

291
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,156
so let's you and I

292
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,325
find out together.

293
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,625
Okay, I've bothered you enough today.

294
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,130
Let's keep on like this.

295
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,007
Sometimes forgetting,

296
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,009
and often laughing.

297
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,512
That's more than enough for me.

298
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,308
I'm going to head out first.

299
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,812
I'll see you on set in Gangwon-do.

300
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,356
No need to walk me out.

301
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,680

<i>You really want</i>
<i>to talk about that film with me?</i>

305
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,905
I just thought…
Maybe you didn't understand it.

306
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,165
As you can see,
the writers' names are all different.

307
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:52,710
This one's mine,

308
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,547
so of course the script
is slightly different.

309
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:58,632
So then…

310
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:01,927
why are these two the same in content
but have different writers?

SCREENPLAY BY YU EUNAE

313
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,853
Please explain.

314
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,902
There must be a reason
why you gave me those clues.

315
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,320
I need to know now.

316
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:22,865
Why do you think

317
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:25,701
Director Lee Duyoung

318
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,662
stopped making films after <i>Love in White</i>?

319
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,832
I don't know.

320
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,418
Maybe he got sick of it.

321
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:38,130
Or maybe a thread of guilt got to him.
I wouldn't know.

322
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,219
I…

323
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:48,057
wasn't his mistress, as people say.

324
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,185
His muse?

325
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,230
Not that either.

326
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,399
Will you

327
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,653
believe what I'm telling you?

328
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,366
Yes.

329
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,326

331
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:58,085
Mr. Lim, how do you feel
about going to work today?

332
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,629
Well, I don't know how to put it.

333
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,298
Nervous, I guess.

334
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,344
Whoa.

335
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:10,723
Oh.

336
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,474
I think that's the sea.

337
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,977
It's the sea!

338
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,274
It's beautiful.

339
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:24,612
It's the sea!

340
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:28,616
Mr. Lee!

341
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:32,119
Mr. Lee!

342
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,163
Mr. Lee!

343
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:35,998
Say hi to the camera!

344
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,250
Say hi!

345
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,714
Hi!

346
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,174
- Daeum!
- Huh?

347
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,597
<i>Say hi!</i>

348
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,099
<i>Hi!</i>

349
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,018
<i>Hi!</i>

350
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,647
Only ten minutes left, Daeum.

351
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,148
Exciting, isn't it?

352
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,233
Um, yes.

353
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:07,112
I think I'm a bit nervous too.

354
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:08,739
Why do I feel more nervous now?

355
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:10,741
I can't be jittery on set.

356
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:16,455
Actors are human too.
It's natural to be nervous. Oh.

357
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:18,832
Want some?

358
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,337
Did you take that many?

359
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,923
They were tasty, so I lost track.
How many did I take?

360
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:28,258
Mr. Lim, I'll just

361
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:31,053
- take two of these, okay?
- Okay.

362
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,460
Hmm?

363
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:05,796
What's he doing?

364
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,382
Why is he retying them? They looked fine.

365
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,892
Okay! Cut!

366
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,604
The director in full freak-out mode.

367
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,024
Can't believe I caught such a rare sight.

368
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:26,900
Ta-da!

369
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:32,489
Here you go.

370
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:34,908
What's this?

371
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:38,037
Your friend took four of those.

372
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,413
One should be enough for…

373
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,707
No, maybe two.

374
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,002
I'm fine.

375
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:48,422
So were your laces,
but you redid them anyway.

376
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,215
You're nervous, right?

377
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,104
Doesn't taste great.

378
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,625
This is all I need.

379
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,295
I was really nervous,

380
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,297
but thanks to you,

381
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,174
I'll manage with meds.

382
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,594
Now that…

383
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,306
we've caught each other being nervous,

384
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:43,227
let's keep that between us.
No one else has to know.

385
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,537
- Hello.
- Hello.

386
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:06,125
I wasn't sure back at that crew dinner,

387
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07,793
but it's really you, Eunho.

388
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:11,296
Oh. Hey, Jaein. It's been a while.

389
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,549
I heard you were working on films,

390
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,135
so I figured we'd cross paths eventually.

391
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:19,513
But I didn't expect it to be this set
with Lee Daeum as the lead.

392
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,056
Me neither.

393
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,851
So you didn't know either?

394
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:25,978
Know what?

395
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,605
Nothing.

396
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,150
Let's talk more next time, as alumni.

397
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,957
HANKUK UNIVERSITY OF ARTS
THEATER & FILM, TA OFFICE

398
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,293
- Hello, nice to meet you.
- How can I help you?

399
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,753
My name is Noh Huitae. I'm from Npatch.

400
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,839
Would you happen to know these people?

401
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,675
They're graduates here.
Starting class of '19.

402
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,552
What's this about?

403
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:01,471
Chasing a lead for an article.

404
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:03,640
You're here!
Welcome!

405
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:05,934
You must be busy.

406
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,394
Are you sure it's okay to be here?

407
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:11,815
I invested about 6 billion won here,
so I should be busy here too.

408
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:13,025
Oh, of course.

409
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,902
- Am I making you uncomfortable?
- Not at all.

410
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:16,904
I'll be here until tomorrow.

411
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,238
Until tomorrow, you say?

412
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:19,323
Is that a problem?

413
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,909
No, of course not. We're just grateful.

414
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,660
I'm not here to spy on you,

415
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,829
- so don't worry about that.
- Right.

416
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:28,749
"This guy is clueless about films
and just invested in one."

417
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,250
Pardon?

418
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:33,503
- I don't want people to say that about me…
- Ah.

419
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:35,505
…so I figured it's time to start learning.

420
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:38,508
Of course, Mr. Han.

421
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:43,305
The light on this side is softer
so it needs some cleaning up.

422
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,308
- Hello.
- Hello.

423
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,102
- Hello. Hello.
- Hello.

424
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,398
Let's put this in you.

425
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:55,525
All right.

426
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,235
Did it go like this?

427
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,072
The needle should

428
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,740
go this way, like this.

429
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,702
The IV line should be like this.

430
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,663
Oh. Oh, of course.

431
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,498
Could you make the tape a bit longer?

432
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,583
Okay. Like this?

433
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:14,544
Were you a nurse or something?

434
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:19,591
Uh… Someone in my family used to be sick.

435
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,176
- That's why I know this stuff.
- Ah.

436
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:23,011
Thank you.

437
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:28,225
You're here.

438
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:31,561
Are you running lines together?
Good luck!

439
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,691
Finally, it's our first day of shooting.

440
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,526
Must be cozy.

441
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,362
What?

442
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,114
Just lying there to act.

443
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,701
You lie there,
frown a bit like you're in pain,

444
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,869
and a movie
with your name on it gets released.

445
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,582
I don't know how this seems to you,

446
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,793
but that's not the whole story.

447
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:56,586
Sure.

448
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,674
Let's get to know each other one by one.

449
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,678
Smile.

450
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,179
From now on,

451
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:08,390
we're the best of friends, you know?

452
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:13,729
We were something
like friends once, weren't we?

453
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,650
Let's not do this, Jaein.

454
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:21,445
See you later.

455
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,416
- Hello.
- Hello.

456
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,128
Never used blush
for a patient look before.

457
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:42,340
But you're just so pale
that it looks fake if I don't use blush.

458
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:51,433
How does it look?

459
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,229
- Good luck on your first shoot!
- Thank you!

460
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,455
Makeup looks good.

461
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,000
Mm-hmm.

462
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:18,543
LOVE IN WHITE

463
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,588
Do you remember Lee Gyuwon Bookstore?

464
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,511
Gyuwon has lived

465
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,932
her whole life there
and treated it as her home.

466
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,600
Hmm.

467
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:37,938
Gyuwon is someone who treasures books,

468
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,147
and that kind of person…

469
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:44,236
would treasure scripts too.

470
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,741
Try to relax.

471
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,993
Focus on this situation and your emotions.

472
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,079
You can do it, right?

473
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:56,748
Yes.

474
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:08,612
Wow.

475
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,036
I'm really in it now.

476
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,121
I'm in

477
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,207
this movie.

478
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,440
<i>Even though I'm sick,</i>

479
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:49,319
I can still watch movies,
go to auditions, and even love.

480
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,155
<i>So I can make movies too.</i>

481
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:57,244
I can do everything. I really can.

482
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,162
Just let me prove that to you.

483
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,418
All right, this is our first real take!

484
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,212
Watch your footsteps, everyone!

485
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,630
Let's begin shooting.

486
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,548
Camera rolling.

487
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,300
<i>Love in White</i>, scene 1, shot 1, take 1.

488
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,680
Ready…

489
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,734
Action!

490
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:48,169
<i>Thank you.</i>

491
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:50,922
<i>And I'm sorry.</i>

492
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:56,011
<i>If anything feels even a little off,</i>
<i>call me right away.</i>

493
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,078
Cut.

494
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:36,801
Hang on.

495
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:47,812
That's some insanely realistic acting.

496
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:52,108
She actually looks like a real patient.

497
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,945
You mean she's acting really well, right?

498
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:57,697
Well,

499
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,117
she's not actually
sick or anything, is she?

500
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:25,725
Mr. Lee, how was I?

501
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:30,563
You followed the script well, but…

502
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,359
Something feels missing.

503
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:39,447
You don't have to stick
to the action lines that strictly.

504
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,783
Gyuwon is

505
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:45,745
leaving to use her remaining time
for herself, not to give up.

506
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:47,956
She feels she can

507
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,958
do anything even if she's sick.

508
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:53,837
You know that feeling, right?

509
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,963
I do.

510
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:57,424
Better than anyone.

511
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,927
The Lee Daeum I know
wouldn't have been just scared.

512
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:03,263
You're right.

513
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:08,143
I was bursting with excitement,

514
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:09,811
but scared,

515
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:14,607
and also a bit heartbroken
at the same time.

516
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,446
Yes, that's it.
Just show that feeling to the camera.

517
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:22,323
Okay.

518
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:23,992
I'm ready.

519
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,248
All right, let's try this again.

520
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,126
Ready…

521
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:35,170
Action!

522
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,976
BECOMING THE COOLEST ACTRESS
IN THE WORLD

523
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,395
TEST SHOOT

524
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,601
I'm leaving now.

525
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:34,354
Thanks for everything.

526
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,663
Cut! Okay.

527
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,874
Good job, let's move on.

528
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:59,462
That was great, Daeum.

529
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:00,547
Thank you!

530
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,216
All right, let's move on
to the next location!

531
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,134
Great work.

532
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,071
Great work!

533
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:27,115
See you soon!

534
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,743
Mr. Lee.

535
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,705
Well done. It couldn't have been easy.

536
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,543
And you did a great job.

537
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,170
Did you just compliment me?

538
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:43,506
Did I really do a good job?

539
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:46,175
Yes, you did. Don't get too excited.

540
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:49,429
You know, I imagined this scene

541
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,598
hundreds and thousands of times.

542
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:54,726
And now that I'm actually
inside the world I pictured…

543
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:58,771
it's incredible.

544
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,609
Making a movie…

545
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:05,904
it's a killer job.

546
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,825
- Of all the ways to say it…
- No!

547
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,413
I just really love it!

548
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:19,292
I'll see you later!

549
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,504
Great work!

550
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,715
- See you soon!
- See you soon.

551
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,926
- Great work!
- Great work.

552
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,976
Both the actress and the director
are really something.

553
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,730
I'll just head out now.

554
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,107
You're not going to watch more?

555
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,401
From the looks of those two,

556
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:48,071
the story will practically write itself.

557
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:51,741
If you can just give things
a little push, Mr. Bu,

558
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,493
it'll all be perfect.

559
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,329
No need to worry about that.

560
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,873
I'm a pro at lighting the match
at the right time.

561
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:02,502
Then I'll leave it to you.

562
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,212
Yes, sir.

563
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,844
Come preach
when you've dropped 10 billion.

564
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:14,222
Where is that bastard?

565
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,600
Either call the cops
or throw him in a psych ward.

566
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:19,227
Kick him out.

567
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,980
No, I'll just go myself and--

568
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:23,064
Father.

569
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,484
You know,

570
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:30,822
try to be more irritated from the start.

571
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,991
And call me "Dad," not "Father."

572
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,200
From the start?

573
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:36,160
How should I do that?

574
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:40,289
Are you usually all polite
to your own father at home?

575
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:43,251
Just "Father" this, "Father" that,
and never snapping back?

576
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,879
I call him "Dad,"

577
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,798
I get snappy and even mean.

578
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:49,924
Exactly.

579
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,219
And Gyuwon only has her dad.

580
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:57,598
They love and cherish
and trust each other,

581
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:00,727
which means
they can snap at each other too.

582
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,355
He's not some weird guy!

583
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:07,984
That's it.

584
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,819
You got it right away.

585
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,904
Let's go with that.

586
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,161
Why are you crying?

587
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:20,246
Oh?

588
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,290
Is it because of me?

589
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,419
Did you get scolded?

590
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:29,255
No, these are happy tears.

591
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,506
Sorry?

592
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:33,051
Happy tears!

593
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:39,057
All right, then.

594
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:41,392
Let's start shooting.

595
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:43,519
Okay!

596
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:47,899
<i>If he wants to die that badly,</i>
<i>tell him I'll kill him myself!</i>

597
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:50,109
<i>Just one month.</i>

598
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:54,530
I'll turn him around by then.

599
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:04,791
Cut! Okay. That's good.

600
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:06,250
All good here!

601
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:08,586
We've got an hour for lunch now.

602
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:09,837
- Please go and eat!
- Enjoy!

603
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,923
- Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy your meal.

604
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:14,884
Mr. Lee!

605
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:20,723
I have a lot of questions for you.
I'll grab us a spot over there!

606
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,562
- Bon appétit.
- Enjoy your meal.

607
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,233
- Enjoy your meal.
- Chow down.

608
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,986
Where are you going?

609
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:35,613
Uh…

610
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:37,990
Daeum's a friend of mine.

611
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,826
I'll go eat over there.

612
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:48,042
The food here's better than most places.

613
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,087
Oh. Yeah.

614
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,136
You said you had questions?

615
00:43:58,219 --> 00:43:59,303
Oh…

616
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:01,806
Yes, but why don't we eat first?
Take a seat.

617
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:02,890
Hmm.

618
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:07,478
Should I come back later?

619
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,106
No, it's fine. Let's eat together.

620
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:11,941
Okay.

621
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:14,735
Enjoy your food. Enjoy.

622
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,463
It's tea time.

623
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:36,299
Thanks.

624
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,676
I thought you didn't drink instant coffee?

625
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:41,721
This one's got protein in it,
so I heard it's good for you.

626
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,514
Thank you for this.

627
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:45,808
It smells nice.

628
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,229
Ah.

629
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,570
Huh?

630
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,698
What's wrong with this?

631
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:02,992
Let me take a look.

632
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:08,164
Wow.

633
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,583
I heard old camcorders are trendy again,

634
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:12,585
but this thing's ancient.

635
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:13,961
Hmm.

636
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:15,671
You drink your coffee, I'll take a look.

637
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,256
Thanks.

638
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,054
- Mr. Lee.
- Yes?

639
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:24,847
It's good, isn't it?

640
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,017
Yes, it's good.

641
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,646
Is that what you wanted to ask me?

642
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:34,273
Come on, of course not.

643
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:39,904
JUST EVEN BEING TOGETHER
MAKES ME HAPPY

644
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:53,668
It's working fine again.

645
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:56,254
Hmm?

646
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:57,338
Thanks.

647
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,007
Hey, Daeum?

648
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:03,010
After I'm done covering for this shoot,

649
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:06,055
I'm heading to Southeast Asia
for another one for about three months.

650
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,099
You'll be done filming by then too, right?

651
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:10,726
Yeah. Why?

652
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:12,520
Can I call you more often then?

653
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:14,563
Yeah.

654
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:16,107
That's a promise, then.

655
00:46:16,816 --> 00:46:18,401
Okay.

656
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:23,406
I'll get going. Thanks for the coffee.

657
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:39,213
LEE GYUWON BOOKSTORE

658
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:40,298
Mr. Kim.

659
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:42,174
Yeah.

660
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:44,677
- You must be cold.
- No, I'm fine.

661
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,556
That's warm.

662
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,058
That's nice, thanks.

663
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:55,771
I heard you were the one
who found Lee Daeum.

664
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:58,941
Yes, through an audition. We got lucky.

665
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:03,612
Looks like you got
your father's eye for actors.

666
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:04,864
Great job.

667
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:09,535
What kind of person
was Kim Jinyeo?

668
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:12,955
Did you meet her?

669
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:20,713
Hmm. Jinyeo asked me

670
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:23,591
about you quite often.

671
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:25,926
She wanted to meet you.

672
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:27,887
Jinyeo…

673
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:32,433
She wasn't the kind of person
who deserved to be judged

674
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:35,144
so harshly by the world.

675
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,647
By any chance,

676
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,692
do you know anything about my mother?

677
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:43,903
Not much, really.

678
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:47,114
Your father never introduced her to me.

679
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:53,162
But he did say this one time
while we were drinking,

680
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:58,125
"Thank goodness Eunae is with me."

681
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:03,130
Said that out of nowhere
while we were breaking down the script.

682
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:05,508
That's why it stayed in my head.

683
00:48:09,345 --> 00:48:10,638
LOVE IN WHITE FIRST SHOOT,
BUFILM'S TREAT!

684
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:11,722
ENJOY, CAST AND CREW!

685
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:13,182
These will go well together.

686
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:17,186
Mr. Ji.

687
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,562
Did you have any fruit?

688
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:20,064
No.

689
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:22,024
- Uh…
- Goodness.

690
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:23,442
Why, thank you.

691
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,909
You know, I'm not usually
that type of person,

692
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,328
but I was a bit tipsy and got too excited.

693
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:35,871
I'll get you a new one.

694
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:38,666
This one's my favorite.

695
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,295
Give me your bank account number.

696
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:46,549
Hang on a second.

697
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:50,803
Huh? My number's already…

698
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:55,724
You're the DP.
Of course I have your number.

699
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:58,227
Now, give me your account number
so I can reimburse you.

700
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:02,356
I actually don't mind it like this.

701
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,859
It'll look bad on you
if you keep it like that.

702
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,277
Think of your status as the DP.

703
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,116
Okay, then.
Let's go buy it on our off day.

704
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:15,786
Off days are for our own breaks.

705
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,081
Wait, he didn't have my number?

706
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:30,551
Hello.
You're Ms. Gwak Gyoyeong, right?

707
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,219
Who are you?

708
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:35,306
I'm Noh Huitae, a reporter at Npatch.

709
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,726
I'm not dangerous.
You're Lee Daeum's friend, right?

710
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,436
Why are you asking?

711
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,521
I went by your place
and heard you worked here.

712
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:44,440
Could I ask for a short interview?

713
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:46,984
Hey, wait.

714
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,320
- Hold on.
- Mom, did you open the door to a weirdo?

715
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,739
From now on, ignore everyone!

716
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,407
Hang on, I'm not a weirdo.

717
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:55,159
- I'm a reporter.
- No interview.

718
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:56,785
I don't care what it's for.

719
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:59,079
I won't answer anything you ask. Got it?

720
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:01,457
- Wait, please.
- Don't follow me!

721
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,625
I will call the cops.

722
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,634
GO HYEYOUNG,
BEYOND ENTERTAINMENT CEO

723
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:17,014
It's as you said, Ms. Go.

724
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:19,058
Everyone around her is very defensive.

725
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,811
Her father's a doctor
at Hankuk National University Hospital.

726
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:24,230
I'll look into that too.

727
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,565
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

728
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:28,317
- Great work today!
- Well done today.

729
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,196
What are you doing after this film?

730
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,948
Got another shoot lined up.

731
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,534
It's all overseas,
so I'll be flying out right afterwards.

732
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:39,495
Wow, I'm jealous. Can I take your place?

733
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:42,581
Honestly, I'd rather switch with you
and stay here

734
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:43,832
until this movie wraps.

735
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:48,504
Hello, everyone!

736
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:49,964
Say hello to the camera.

737
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:51,632
Hi!

738
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,594
I heard this is where all the fun is.

739
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:57,054
Do you mind if I film this?

740
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:58,389
Sure, anything you want.

741
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:01,016
I love this kind of stuff.

742
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,768
Behind-the-scenes vibes.

743
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,272
It's okay if I post this, right?

744
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:09,149
Yeah, sure. It'll be good promo, I guess.

745
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:10,442
Okay.

746
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:12,194
I have 300,000 followers after all.

747
00:51:13,362 --> 00:51:14,530
You know that, Eunho. Right?

748
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:16,240
Oh? You're on a first-name basis?

749
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:19,076
We went to college together.
Theater and Film at Hankuk Arts.

750
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,327
Ah…

751
00:51:20,953 --> 00:51:21,954
And Daeum too.

752
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,623
You must've been very popular, Eunho.

753
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:26,417
I wasn't popular at all.

754
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,919
Daeum was the popular one, wasn't she?

755
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:30,796
That's true.

756
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:34,091
- She was popular then, she's popular now.
- Mmm.

757
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:36,844
Now? Is there something going on with her?

758
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:43,726
Oh, I get it.

759
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:46,353
Do you mean

760
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:49,064
Daeum and the director?

761
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,483
Can I talk to you for a second?

762
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:53,652
- Let's have a drink.
- Sure.

763
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:23,223
I'D LIKE TO TALK THROUGH
TOMORROW'S SCENE.

764
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:24,975
ARE YOU UP FOR THAT?

765
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,232
Hey! Ms. Yu!

766
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,236
Everyone's off drinking.
What are you doing here alone?

767
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,072
Just had a few things to wrap up.

768
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:40,032
Alone, quietly.

769
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:41,950
You never clock out, do you?

770
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,162
You might want to head in soon, though.

771
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,330
Why?

772
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:48,248
I think it's going to rain soon.

773
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:50,376
Oh? There's no rain in the forecast.

774
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,795
Look, not a cloud in the sky.

775
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:01,679
Come on! No way!

776
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:04,807
The weather service can't do me like this!

777
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:21,407
Wait, how did you know?

778
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:22,533
Huh?

779
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:23,701
The rain.

780
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:26,704
Not even my paid weather app
saw this coming.

781
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:27,788
How did you?

782
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,249
Whenever it's about to rain,

783
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:33,085
the knee I messed up
back in my athlete days starts acting up.

784
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:36,213
You'll be the first one I call

785
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,215
the next time it does this.

786
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:46,223
- Should we go in?
- Yes, let's go. Careful.

787
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,100
It better not rain tomorrow.

788
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:50,102
- It won't rain tomorrow.
- How do you know?

789
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:52,020
- I just have that feeling.
- What?

790
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:04,575
Hey, Hong. Do you know if this rain--

791
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,326
<i>Don't worry.</i>
<i>I heard it'll stop soon.</i>

792
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:08,162
Is that so? That's good.

793
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,082
Seoyoung and Jungwoo
are coming tomorrow, right?

794
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,834
<i>Yes, they've got things today</i>

795
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,754
<i>so they'll come first thing</i>
<i>in the morning. Why?</i>

796
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:18,130
No reason, just asking.

797
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:22,009
I'll be on the 9th floor
talking to an actor.

798
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,802
If you need me, come find me there.

799
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:25,596
Okay.

800
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,962
Did something happen
between you and Daeum?

801
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:00,631
What do you mean?

802
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,301
I saw you two on set earlier today.

803
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:06,887
What, are costars not allowed to talk?

804
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,222
What about just now?

805
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:11,892
You started going on
about how popular she is,

806
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:14,520
and even brought up the director.

807
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:16,855
You don't think that's weird?

808
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:20,192
Why would it be weird
if there's nothing between them?

809
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,402
No one's safe from gossip.

810
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:25,656
Isn't it especially risky
for you or Daeum?

811
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:29,368
You know very well
how fast rumors spread on set.

812
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:30,494
You and Daeum

813
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:32,704
used to be friends.

814
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:36,833
Friends?

815
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,753
How do you know if they're just rumors?

816
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:44,258
Nobody here knows
how Lee Daeum became the lead.

817
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,553
Stop pretending like you do.

818
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:50,639
Do you still have feelings for her?

819
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,101
Yeah.

820
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:56,520
I still have feelings for Daeum.

821
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,898
So I'd appreciate it
if you treat her well.

822
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,609
I'm always the problem, aren't I?

823
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:21,920
<i>Doors are closing.</i>

824
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:33,974
<i>Doors are closing.</i>

825
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,102
<i>Do you still have feelings for her?</i>

826
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:38,854
<i>Yeah.</i>

827
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:40,856
<i>I still have feelings for Daeum.</i>

828
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:43,984
<i>So I'd appreciate it</i>
<i>if you treat her well.</i>

829
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:48,405
You really care about Daeum, huh?

830
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,038
I just need her.

831
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:57,164
That's all.

832
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,665
Is it you that likes her,

833
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:00,500
or her that likes you?

834
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,044
What are you talking about?

835
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:03,670
Are you running out of article ideas?

836
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,797
<i>What about Lee Jeha as a person?</i>

837
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,967
Could you love someone
knowing how it ends?

838
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:31,573
DIRECTOR LEE JEHA

839
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:33,659
I'D LIKE TO TALK THROUGH
TOMORROW'S SCENE.

840
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:35,077
ARE YOU UP FOR THAT?

841
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:49,800
You don't even know
if it's life or death you don't want.

842
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:53,261
Everyone dies in the end…

843
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:01,436
Hi.

844
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:03,605
Uh…

845
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:05,065
Hello, Ms. Chae.

846
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:08,694
Everyone's been raving
about how well you did today.

847
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:12,739
I just got here, and this might be
our only chance to run lines.

848
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,200
Mind if I come in for a bit?

849
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:18,704
Sure. Come in.

850
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:21,748
I see you were reading the script.

851
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:24,918
Yes.

852
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:27,504
What are these meds?

853
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:28,839
They're nothing.

854
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:31,216
Oh, it's a prop.

855
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:35,470
Yes, I just put supplements in there.
You know, vitamins.

856
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:36,638
Vitamins?

857
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,015
Then can I take one?

858
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:40,225
No!

859
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:48,775
How long were you in the hospital
that you don't know how the world works?

860
00:58:49,735 --> 00:58:51,278
You can't even lie properly.

861
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,390
Are you all right?

862
00:59:20,474 --> 00:59:21,475
I said, are you okay?

863
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,270
Yes. I'm all right.

864
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,362
You…

865
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,407
Why are you here?

866
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,285
That's what I should ask you.

867
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:43,580
And what else?

868
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,626
Isn't there more you want to ask?

869
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:51,463
And if I ask,
can you give me a straight answer?

870
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,014
Look at each other, the two of you.

871
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:06,436
Let's just lay it all out now.

872
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:10,315
The first time
I asked Daeum to come rehearse,

873
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:12,526
she had a seizure and was screaming.

874
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,069
I took her to the hospital.

875
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:18,323
I waited at the ER,
and her doctor told me not to worry.

876
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:21,117
Didn't explain what was wrong.
Just told me to go home.

877
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,036
Isn't that ridiculous?

878
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,288
When I was the one
who brought her to the hospital.

879
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:28,416
- Uh, Ms. Chae, that's…
- Yeah.

880
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,336
I put that behind me a while ago.
And then,

881
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,797
the next time we met,

882
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,675
you were in an elevator
wearing a stolen doctor's coat.

883
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:39,344
A nurse was looking for you,

884
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:42,305
and I pretended to be your sister
to get you out of there.

885
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:46,893
I brought you home with me,
then Mr. Lee came and took you back.

886
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:50,981
Now you really need to explain.

887
01:00:51,857 --> 01:00:52,899
Tell me why.

888
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:56,862
What on earth is going on?

889
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:36,651
I probably have about four months now.

890
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:38,737
Daeum.

891
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:40,822
Four months?

892
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:50,916
I thought I could finish filming
within that time.

893
01:01:53,168 --> 01:01:54,502
No, I have to finish.

894
01:01:54,586 --> 01:01:55,587
That's enough.

895
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:57,964
I'll explain.

896
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:02,177
You asked if I'm really dying, right?

897
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,678
Yes,

898
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:04,888
I really am dying.

899
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:15,982
Ms. Chae…

900
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:19,819
I'm terminally ill.

901
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:24,115
This isn't acting, it's not for show.

902
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:27,285
I'm actually a dying terminal patient.

903
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:24,092
<i>Can't you tell cheap pity from love?</i>

904
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:26,970
<i>How could you even think to fall in love</i>
<i>when you're dying?</i>

905
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:31,433
<i>You're seriously filming with a girl</i>
<i>who could die at any moment?</i>

906
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,185
<i>What if she really dies?</i>

907
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:36,563
That's why I needed Daeum.

908
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,864
NOH HUITAE:
DID YOU KNOW THIS TOO, MR. BU?

909
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:48,450
Give me a moment.

910
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:50,744
<i>I really want to be in this movie.</i>

911
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:54,039
<i>I want to ask you</i>
<i>to pretend like you don't know.</i>

912
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:57,667
Let me be honest with you too, then.

913
01:03:57,751 --> 01:03:59,878
If you're only thinking about yourself,

914
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:01,713
then so will I.
