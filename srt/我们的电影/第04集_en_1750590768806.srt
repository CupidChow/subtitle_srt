00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:30,948
OUR MOVIE

2
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,199
ANY RESEMBLANCE
TO ACTUAL PEOPLE, PLACES,

3
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,450
OR MEDICAL CONDITIONS
IS COINCIDENTAL.

4
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:34,701
CHILD ACTORS WERE
ALWAYS SUPERVISED

5
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:35,953
AND SAFELY FILMED
UNDER GUIDELINES.

6
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,165
Jeez, tell me about it.

7
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:48,799
Sir, I think you should speak to her.

8
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,009
How's it looking? Is she okay?

9
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:52,844
No, she's going all like this.

10
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:24,876
Let's keep it calm.

11
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,549
You say "cut" when I cry,

12
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:34,553
when I smile, when I look blank,
when I look nervous. You keep saying no.

13
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,557
Why don't you just say what you want?

14
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:43,895
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,982
For six months,
I've been getting love letters

16
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,484
from the guy
who's been cleaning this place.

17
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,654
I've never even seen his face,
but now I'm in love with him?

18
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,323
How am I supposed to believe that?

19
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,616
That's just totally creepy!

20
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,162
How am I supposed to act like I'm in love?

21
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,789
You're right.

22
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:09,629
That's true.
A person wouldn't fall in love like that

23
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,591
when you've never seen him.

24
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,301
What kind of…

25
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,720
What kind of director says that?

26
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:26,647
This is a secret, but I'm making this film
because I don't really know.

27
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,816
Don't know what?

28
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,779
What it's like to love someone.

29
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,082
Let's go.

30
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:52,964
I'm ready now.

31
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,886
I think I understand the feeling.

32
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,638
EMMA

33
00:03:56,611 --> 00:04:01,116
EPISODE 4

34
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,245
Jungwoo's running a bit late.

35
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:06,955
So is Daeum.

36
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,084
Ms. Go's already making moves.

37
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,377
She pulled Daeum for a chat.

38
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:14,838
Probably about signing her.

39
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,467
Who wouldn't want a star rookie like that?

40
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,803
Daeum doesn't need representation.

41
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,973
How could a rookie
not need representation?

42
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,559
If I wanted an agency involved,

43
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,228
I wouldn't have cast a rookie.

44
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,981
But this isn't going to be her last film.

45
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,568
An agency like ours
could really help her take off.

46
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,782
Don't you want to know how I've been?

47
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,244
It's all shoptalk with you.

48
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,538
I hoped you were doing well.

49
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:51,500
That's it?

50
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,585
Yes, that's it.

51
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,590
That kind of hurts.

52
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,343
Yes, I actually feel hurt.

53
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,554
I guess I can still feel hurt
when it comes to you.

54
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,808
We're not in a place where
we tell each other everything anymore.

55
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,771
I was hoping you'd ask me

56
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,315
how my marriage was,

57
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,609
after the way we ended.

58
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,779
But all you can say is
you hoped I was well?

59
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,281
You're like a grease stain

60
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:26,326
that I can't scrub off
from the bottom of my heart.

61
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,248
Let's talk later.

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,001
What about you?

63
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,097
Am I still at the bottom of your heart?

64
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,233
What are you doing?

65
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:03,154
I found many great replacements,
but they're never enough.

66
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:06,658
I had to know if going back
to the original would finally satisfy me.

67
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,713
Let's just focus on our movie.

68
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,594
That's all there is between us now.

69
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,441
<i>Doors are opening.</i>

70
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,712
Excuse me. You're Lee Daeum, right?

71
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,006
Hello, Mr. Kim.

72
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,674
Nice to meet you.

73
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:05,759
Yes.

74
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,929
Where are you heading?
We have matters to attend to.

75
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,014
Ah.

76
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,601
Let's go upstairs.

77
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,314
<i>Doors are opening.</i>

78
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,280
Ah.

79
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,075
I see you've come together.

80
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,660
Hello, Ms. Chae.

81
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:32,994
<i>Doors are closing.</i>

82
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,455
Mr. Lee said something came up.

83
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,416
Sorry, but we'll have to do this
another time.

84
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,628
Why are you apologizing
when he's the one who left?

85
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:46,257
Daeum?

86
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,635
Yes, another time.

87
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,844
Yes, another time.

88
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,805
We'll talk later too, Jungwoo.

89
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,849
Take care.

90
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,779
Mr. Lee? This is Daeum.

91
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,989
I have something to tell you.

92
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:11,866
<i>I'll come to you.</i>

93
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:19,833
Mr. Lee.

94
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,962
- Hello.
- Hello.

95
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,383
What did you want to talk about?

96
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,802
Sorry about canceling last minute.

97
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,513
Something just… came up.

98
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,599
Something important enough
to blow off three people?

99
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,311
I had an important meeting here.

100
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,689
Oh.

101
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,773
I see.

102
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,527
So, what did you want to talk about?

103
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:50,739
Oh.

104
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:52,741
TIME TO EAT

105
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,370
I'm hungry. How about we eat first?

106
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,456
That again. What is it?

107
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,625
- Pardon?
- That alarm. What's it for?

108
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,420
Why set one just to eat?
It's not like it's meds.

109
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,506
Food is just as important as meds for me.

110
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,134
Uh…

111
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,347
To put it simply,
I heard that if I skip a meal,

112
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,058
I could die.

113
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,728
What does that mean?

114
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:23,563
The thing is…

115
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:27,067
my body can't absorb nutrients
like most people's,

116
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,445
so I need to eat a lot, often,
and at regular times

117
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,030
to get more nutrients.

118
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,950
If I go too long without food,
I could go into shock,

119
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:38,411
or if it's bad enough, I could die.

120
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,121
Can you get us something to eat, Junbyung?

121
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,794
Okay.

122
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,170
KIM JUNGWOO

123
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,922
MISSED CALL: KIM JUNGWOO
MISSED CALL: KIM JUNGWOO

124
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,143
Why are we at the playground?

125
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,195
I don't think that'll help your digestion.

126
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,571
Hmm?

127
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,035
Something you want to say?

128
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,876
Well…

129
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:32,006
I really hope you don't get angry
with what I'm about to say,

130
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,845
but it was my fault, so I totally
understand if you do.

131
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,014
It's okay, just tell me.

132
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,154
I went to Seoyoung's rehearsal studio
and had a seizure,

133
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,489
so she kept people from seeing me

134
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,366
and took me to the hospital.

135
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,534
I'm sorry!

136
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,036
Seizure? You had a seizure?

137
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,497
- Yes.
- Are you all right now?

138
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,582
Look at me.

139
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,802
You seem all right.

140
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:24,559
Of course, I am!
That's why I went through the test shoot…

141
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,817
and all, yes.

142
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,321
As long as you're okay.

143
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:41,910
What?

144
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,246
Are you surprised I didn't yell at you?

145
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,581
Feeling relieved now?

146
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:52,629
You just broke the first clause
of our confidentiality agreement.

147
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:58,176
Actually, Seoyoung doesn't know
what my condition is or how serious it is.

148
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,346
So I didn't exactly break the rule…

149
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:05,850
I'm really sorry.

150
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,145
Thanks for being honest with me.

151
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,984
You should always ask for help
in that kind of situation.

152
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,946
It's actually a good thing
Seoyoung was there.

153
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,327
Mr. Lee.

154
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:34,045
You launched Seoyoung's career, right?

155
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,970
What was she like back then?

156
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,598
Well…

157
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:52,438
She's a great actress who taught me
something I didn't know very well.

158
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,023
Mmm.

159
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,904
Then, what kind of person
is Seoyoung to you?

160
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,866
To a director, it doesn't matter
what kind of person an actor is.

161
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,332
But you're working together.
How can that not matter?

162
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,503
I mean, who they are as an actor matters
more than who they are as a person.

163
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,342
You make things sound so complicated.

164
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,182
To me, though,

165
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,853
you're a good person.

166
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:33,771
I'm not sure about that.

167
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,942
I'm very good at reading people.

168
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:39,777
Trust me.

169
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,949
Her name is Lee Daeum.
It's still under embargo.

170
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,744
We get promo material
for a rookie actress,

171
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,788
and you get Chae Seoyoung and Kim Jungwoo.

172
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,790
You can't deny that's an amazing deal.

173
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,835
Okay. I'll call you back.

174
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,884
Why'd you bail on the actor meeting
and double my workload?

175
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,012
I told you, something came up.

176
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,513
What's up with you?

177
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:08,681
LOVE IN WHITE
PHOTO SHOOT & INTERVIEW PLAN

178
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:09,766
A photo shoot.

179
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,060
With the three leads.

180
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:20,234
Isn't this too soon?
They've barely even met.

181
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,696
We can do it after we wrap up filming.

182
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,824
We've got to get things done while we can.

183
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,661
Who knows how much time we'll have
after the movie's done?

184
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:37,335
Even getting ready for the table read
is a lot for Daeum right now.

185
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,837
Everything's new to her.

186
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:43,132
She's new for the audience, too, huh?

187
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,134
Don't you think
we should introduce her first?

188
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,719
Otherwise, who's going to care?

189
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,596
We can't do that.

190
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,767
Take her off all non-filming engagements.

191
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:55,978
Director Lee.

192
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,649
You forget I'm not exactly someone
who needs permission for this.

193
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,775
In that case…

194
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:06,239
could you push the schedule a little, sir?

195
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,994
The reason being?

196
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,871
Well…

197
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:18,084
You know, to work the mystery angle.

198
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,627
Build intrigue.

199
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,504
You said it yourself,
she's new to the audience.

200
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,131
Keep her hidden for a bit longer.

201
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:27,677
We make people curious about who she is

202
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:31,430
then make a bombshell reveal
for a bigger impact.

203
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:34,934
Go on.

204
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,895
Let's not kill the hype now.

205
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:41,899
We wait and drop a beautiful photo shoot

206
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,111
at the perfect moment.

207
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:48,447
Bam.

208
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:52,285
Then, the crowd will go…

209
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,911
Bam. They'll erupt.

210
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,372
Hmm. You might be onto something.

211
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,082
How about we add to that?

212
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:02,503
A photo shoot with all three leads
plus the director.

213
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:06,048
And I decide when it'll be
the perfect time for that.

214
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,592
Why me?

215
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,846
I hate to say it,

216
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,097
but you're good-looking.

217
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,603
Or we can just shoot it tomorrow.

218
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,064
No, no. I think it's a fine idea.

219
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:28,404
So we roll with the mystery angle
for Lee Daeum starting tomorrow.

220
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,449
Okay.

221
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,533
I'm off.

222
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,877
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

223
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,754
- Take care.
- Thanks.

224
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,385
Oh, I like this headline.

225
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,012
- The one below that too.
- Okay.

226
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:56,098
We should plaster
some question marks there.

227
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:59,060
You know how people
read quickly on their phones nowadays?

228
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,770
How could they write something like this?

229
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,105
Why? It's not like they're wrong.

230
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,607
The headline's pretty good.

231
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,025
Aren't you angry?

232
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,527
It's not worth getting angry over.

233
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,325
Daeum's going to be the lead
instead of Chae Seoyoung.

234
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,494
She's the lead! The lead!

235
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,163
She's supposed to keep a low profile
so her face stays hidden.

236
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,248
Okay.

237
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:25,044
Hey, you can't post
Daeum's photos online, okay?

238
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,464
ROOKIE SENSATION LEE DAEUM
OUSTS CHAE SEOYOUNG

239
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:34,512
Jeez, this is a huge honor for our family.

240
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,681
I'm not from this family, though.

241
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,562
ROOKIE SENSATION LEE DAEUM
OUSTS CHAE SEOYOUNG

242
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,998
Overly experimental.

243
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,458
Who asked you for a review?

244
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,088
Why are you always trying
to invent new dishes?

245
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,675
Because this is my restaurant,

246
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,719
and I'm the chef?

247
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,183
What's with the weird look?

248
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,102
You know…

249
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,229
Are you…

250
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,775
No, never mind.
You've got your life together now.

251
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,279
Actually,
I haven't sorted out my life yet.

252
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,489
Why? What is it?

253
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,575
Let me ask you a favor.

254
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,705
You're asking me for a favor?

255
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,088
Your patient is here.

256
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,402
Dad.

257
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,908
Dad?

258
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,040
Dad, do you know what a table read is?

259
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,501
It's like rehearsing.

260
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:33,589
It's when everyone in the movie meets up
to read through the script, act together,

261
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,967
and look into each other's eyes
like this. See?

262
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:38,636
Something like that.

263
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,473
And it just so happens to be tomorrow!

264
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,935
So now I'm all jittery and excited
and everything.

265
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,687
I'm seriously freaking out.

266
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,523
So are you happy now?

267
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,108
Yes.

268
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,443
So happy I could die.

269
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:01,409
Sorry.

270
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,577
So you know you should be sorry.

271
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,840
- I know.
- If you do know,

272
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,967
then how could you be so reckless?

273
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:20,553
I'm scared, too,

274
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,389
that I'll have another seizure

275
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,350
in a room full of people
who are there to watch me.

276
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,604
That I'll ruin everything
and lose myself in the process.

277
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:34,108
You listen to me.
I'm not letting you end up like that.

278
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:35,943
Do you understand?

279
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,446
- If you won't stop on your own--
- Dad…

280
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,865
You're taking your life way too lightly!

281
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:46,662
What kind of father would stand by
while his daughter walks off a cliff?

282
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,004
Daeum.

283
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:57,590
Daeum.

284
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,720
The clinical trial
we're preparing right now

285
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,973
is worth getting our hopes up.

286
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:09,435
So if you can just
hang on a little longer…

287
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,479
Is that really for me, though?

288
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,275
- Daeum.
- Yeah?

289
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,110
What if I hang on and on and on,

290
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,656
but it fails like everything else before?

291
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,663
You know this.

292
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,542
Dad…

293
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,213
I'm dying.

294
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,383
But you keep denying that.

295
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:47,598
Do you know how scared and hurt I feel
every time you do?

296
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,742
Let's just do a full checkup first, okay?

297
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:11,914
Okay.

298
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,073
Just as you're running out of time,

299
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,868
so is your dad. You know that, right?

300
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,496
Doc,

301
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:57,334
I asked you to smile
when you say stuff like that.

302
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,385
Right. So, the shoot will be
about three months long?

303
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,179
Yes.

304
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,223
I'm upping your dose.

305
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,726
You might feel a bit more foggy,

306
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:16,520
but it'll help you
function better out there.

307
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:18,981
Foggy?

308
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,775
That's not good.

309
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:27,072
But seriously, how does a kid like you

310
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,617
end up with the lead role, just like that?

311
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,791
You'll have to watch your own movie
in a theater, no?

312
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:39,960
Whether it's a year

313
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,129
or a month from now…

314
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,217
hang in there and try to live
no matter what.

315
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,431
I'll think of other plans, too.

316
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,520
Thank you, Doc.

317
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,323
BU SEUNGWON

318
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,951
YOU WERE RIGHT

319
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:14,411
THAT OLD-SCHOOL MYSTERY ANGLE
TOTALLY STIRRED THINGS UP

320
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:17,957
PEOPLE ARE DYING
TO FIND OUT WHO SHE IS

321
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,212
WHO IS LEE DAEUM?
THE BIRTH OF A ROOKIE

322
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,964
THE ENTRANCE OF A ROOKIE
WHO OUTSHONE CHAE SEOYOUNG

323
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:33,722
A table read means
all the actors and crew will be there.

324
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,432
My baby's got to steal the show.

325
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:38,394
- Can't I just do it?
- No way!

326
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,312
Oh, I love it.

327
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,940
- Good!
- Good!

328
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,484
Ta-da!

329
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,820
The finishing touch is the most important.

330
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:52,866
- Isn't this cute?
- It's so adorable!

331
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,996
- It's not sticky, right?
- No.

332
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,455
It feels super smooth.

333
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,040
Give me that.

334
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,251
Keep reapplying it.

335
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,129
You need to do it regularly
to really block UV rays.

336
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:09,508
- Can I take this with me?
- Of course, you can!

337
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,718
Hooray!

338
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,262
Now, hold still while I do your eyebrows.

339
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,014
Wait, I have a question.

340
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,724
Yes, ask away, milady.

341
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:20,060
Remember in high school
when you kissed someone on the roof here?

342
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,271
Keep it down! My mom can hear us!

343
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,440
You're busted!

344
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,234
She's kidding!

345
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,529
It wasn't even a kiss, okay?
It was like lips bumping.

346
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:34,324
Whatever, your lips touched.
A kiss is still a kiss.

347
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:36,910
What's your deal? So what?

348
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:40,205
Did you do it because you wanted to?

349
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:44,418
Or did you just do it without knowing
what was going on?

350
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:47,671
So there's no guy,
but you want to kiss someone?

351
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:53,677
Or wait, maybe you're feeling curious
because there is someone?

352
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:54,762
Is that it, huh?

353
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:58,098
- You got a guy you want to kiss?
- No, it's not like that!

354
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:01,435
There's a kiss scene
in the script, that's all.

355
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,270
You don't even know
what you're talking about.

356
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,024
Your first kiss
is going to be for a movie?

357
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:12,529
Is there something you can do before that?

358
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,823
- See you later!
- Okay!

359
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,284
Feels like I'm sending a baby
out into the world.

360
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,869
Oh.

361
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,662
Hello? This is Lee Daeum.

362
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:23,332
Hi, I've sent a gift over to your place.

363
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,000
A gift?

364
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,211
What did you send me?

365
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:29,546
<i>Yes, it's him.</i>

366
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:33,801
He'll be working as your manager
until the movie's released.

367
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:37,137
Let him drive you from now on.
And today, of course.

368
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:38,305
See you later.

369
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:43,102
Hello.

370
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,480
So you're my gift?

371
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,150
Yes, I'm Lim Junbyung.
And I'm your gift personified.

372
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:51,735
What about your restaurant?

373
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,780
I'm on a kind of sabbatical.

374
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,865
I wanted to take on a new challenge.

375
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:57,950
Please, get in.

376
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:00,744
You can't be late for your first read.

377
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,209
Take care out there!

378
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:12,840
If you're thirsty,
please open the cooler next to you.

379
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:14,216
Ah…

380
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,344
I didn't know what you'd like,
so I brought everything, ma'am.

381
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,680
You don't have to be so formal with me.

382
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,683
Everything feels uncomfortable right now,

383
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,102
so if you could at least
talk to me casually,

384
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,437
I think I'd feel better.

385
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:30,607
Well, we can't have our superstar
feeling uncomfortable.

386
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,904
I wanted to ask.

387
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,742
Is it normal for a director
to go out of his way like this

388
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,203
for an actress that
doesn't even have a manager?

389
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,248
I'm not sure. This is my first time too,

390
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,667
and Jeha's the only director I know.

391
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,919
Man, why am I so nervous?

392
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:54,548
There's a calming pill in there.
Could you please pass me one?

393
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:55,883
I mean, can you get me one?

394
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,467
Oh, yes, of course.

395
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,598
- Here you go, sir.
- Great, thank you.

396
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:10,063
Jeha never asks for favors,
but he did this time, ma'am.

397
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:12,232
I mean, not ma'am.

398
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,528
So you're doing him a favor now?

399
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:19,406
It was always my dream
to be a movie star's manager.

400
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,659
A movie star?

401
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,579
I hate to break it to you,
but I'm not a movie star.

402
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,831
But to me, Ms. Daeum,

403
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:30,792
you're my first actress
and my first movie star.

404
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,986
LOVE IN WHITE
TABLE READ

405
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,196
LEE DAEUM, LEE JEHA

406
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,701
- Director.
- Hello.

407
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,662
Are we all going out to eat after this?

408
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,830
- Good morning.
- Hi.

409
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,381
- Hello, sir!
- Hello, sir!

410
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,549
How's the bookstore set looking?

411
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,843
- We've just started building it.
- Okay.

412
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,144
JUST EVEN BEING TOGETHER
MAKES ME HAPPY

413
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:35,107
Your seat's over there, Daeum.

414
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,608
There's a pencil case in here.

415
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:39,903
I saw a lot of actors taking notes
and highlighting stuff.

416
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:42,906
There's also water and some cough drops.

417
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,617
Hello, I'm Lim Junbyung,
Lee Daeum's manager.

418
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,703
Great to meet you.

419
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,163
Junbyung. Can we talk for a second?

420
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,709
Who told you to be a real manager?

421
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,045
What, you want me to be a fake one?

422
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:59,089
Yes, be a fake one.

423
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,926
I asked you to keep the press
and agencies away,

424
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,387
since everyone's curious
about this mysterious rookie,

425
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,889
not for you to be an actual manager.

426
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,307
Don't worry about that.

427
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:11,810
No one's laying a finger on her
as long as I'm there.

428
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,478
That's all?

429
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,439
Man, you really need to chill.

430
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:18,734
You've been a jerk since forever.

431
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:22,821
That's not what I meant.

432
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:25,782
- Hello.
- Hello.

433
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:27,200
- Hello.
- Hello.

434
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:31,663
I'm Lee Daeum, playing the role of Gyuwon.

435
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:32,998
So you're my daughter.

436
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,876
I look forward to working with you.

437
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,627
I look forward to working with you.

438
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:38,837
- Hello!
- Hello.

439
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,172
- Hello.
- Hello.

440
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,354
So it's really you.

441
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,692
It's been a while, Jaein.
Great to see you again.

442
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,404
You took a leave from school
and just disappeared.

443
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,364
Now you show up like this?

444
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:09,409
As the lead? Out of nowhere?

445
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:13,997
It's crazy, right?

446
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:15,749
I just got lucky.

447
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,294
- Hello.
- Hello.

448
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,004
Hello, Mr. Kim.

449
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,255
You look nice today, Daeum.

450
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,342
- Hi, Jaein.
- Hello.

451
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,512
We're counting on you, Seoyoung.

452
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,013
Who else can I count on?

453
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:32,724
Certainly not Lee Jeha
or a complete rookie.

454
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:36,061
- You should trust them.
- What?

455
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:39,439
I do respect
that you came all the way here

456
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:41,024
by not trusting anyone,

457
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,237
but how about you trust those two
for just this movie?

458
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,116
You should try being a producer sometime.

459
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:50,992
Then you'd understand.

460
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:53,078
I feel so alone.

461
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,412
Me too.

462
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:57,791
I feel so alone too.

463
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,627
Everyone's alone in this world.

464
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:07,425
"Hyunsang browses through the bookstore
then pulls out a book."

465
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,302
"Hello!

466
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,139
Is there a book you're looking for?"

467
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:22,649
Hyunsang is two steps in front of you,
not across the street.

468
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:28,196
I thought I had to speak up
so everyone in the room could hear me.

469
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,240
Okay, let's try again.

470
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:34,202
"Hello.
Is there a book you're looking for?"

471
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:37,455
"Are you…

472
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,875
still waiting?

473
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:42,794
Gyuwon.

474
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,631
Let's not wait anymore."

475
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,468
I guess that kind of acting
only comes with time, huh?

476
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:51,970
Who are you, anyway?

477
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,972
- Shh.
- Oh, right.

478
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:55,724
"And if I tell you?

479
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:59,019
Are you going to run up there like that

480
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,229
to cry and beg?

481
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,107
Aren't you dying soon?

482
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,110
Honestly, that's low even for you."

483
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:10,530
"Gyuwon impulsively slaps Junghwa.

484
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:12,532
Junghwa is baffled."

485
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,409
"Never mind.

486
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,871
You're so miserable,
it's not worth the fuss."

487
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:26,880
Thank you.

488
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,259
Let's move on to the next scene.

489
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,803
"Don't say things
you don't mean, Hyunsang.

490
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:35,722
Just be honest.

491
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,015
You're…

492
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,851
You're fed up…

493
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,895
You're fed up… with me being sick, right?

494
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,814
Y-You're fed up
with me being sick, right?"

495
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,235
I'm sorry, Mr. Lee.

496
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:50,570
It's fine, go on.

497
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:54,783
"You're f-fed up
with me being sick, right?

498
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,368
Then just leave!

499
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,995
Get the hell out! Go!"

500
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,289
Let's move on from this scene.

501
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:02,999
Let's move on.

502
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,297
Daeum?

503
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,008
Yes, Ms. Chae?

504
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:13,093
Good job today.

505
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,845
No, I should've been better.

506
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:17,055
You were fine, really.

507
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:19,766
Thank you.

508
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,103
I wanted to ask…

509
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,188
did you see that day?

510
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:26,481
Sorry?

511
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,067
Oh.

512
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,070
If you didn't see, never mind.

513
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,614
If you're pretending you didn't,
thank you.

514
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,866
If you're really curious…

515
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,411
No, I'm not curious.

516
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:41,538
Ah.

517
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,707
Great work today, Ms. Chae.

518
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:55,176
Thank you for today. That was great.

519
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,725
It must've been tough writing this script.

520
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,059
No, it was fine.

521
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:04,728
How's your health?

522
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,896
Are you done with chemo?

523
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,316
It's like I've never been sick.

524
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:12,360
Funny how life works.

525
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:15,113
I didn't think I'd be in this movie again.

526
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:16,906
Right.

527
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,325
I'm counting on your help.

528
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,954
I keep thinking
about Director Lee Duyoung.

529
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,208
Thank you.

530
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,753
I should be thanking you.

531
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,504
I really wanted you to be in this.

532
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,716
Are you…

533
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,093
really all right with this?

534
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:40,013
With what?

535
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,810
Nothing, I should get going.

536
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:48,688
Okay. I'll see you on set, then.

537
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:52,359
Jeha.

538
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:55,278
You don't…

539
00:35:56,571 --> 00:36:00,325
have to push yourself too hard, you know?

540
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,202
Even if you just let it be,

541
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,120
Lee Duyoung is just Lee Duyoung,

542
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:06,289
and Lee Jeha is still Lee Jeha.

543
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,002
Okay, I'm really going now.

544
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,053
I've been looking for you.
Where have you been?

545
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,393
I was worried that my manager
was waiting for too long,

546
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:28,770
so I went down
to tell him to take a break.

547
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:32,440
You were great.

548
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:38,446
I've been practicing as much as I could,
but I was too nervous.

549
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:43,743
You were entirely surrounded
by respected veteran actors in this room.

550
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,287
It'd be strange not to be nervous.

551
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:48,623
Still, I messed up.

552
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:50,542
Messed up or held back?

553
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:55,255
- Pardon?
- That's how it looked to me.

554
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:58,216
You wanted to do it so perfectly

555
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:02,512
you couldn't bear to fake
even a single line

556
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,680
from what I saw.

557
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,142
I guess I didn't analyze
my character enough.

558
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,102
I can help you with that.

559
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:14,274
We're about to fall in love, hate,
and regret each other on-screen,

560
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,734
so let's help each other out.

561
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,027
Thank you, Mr. Kim.

562
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,571
You're still here.

563
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:25,160
Uh, I thought we should
talk to each other a bit more.

564
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:26,745
Ah.

565
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:28,788
Please, sit.

566
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,043
Actually,

567
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:37,589
I'd prefer it if you two
didn't talk to each other too much.

568
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,966
Well, of course.
I know your directing style.

569
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,719
I prefer emotions that
come out naturally on set

570
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,096
over anything too rehearsed or practiced.

571
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,558
I understand what you mean.

572
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:50,810
I'll get going now.

573
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,481
Bye, Daeum.

574
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,484
Good night, Mr. Kim.

575
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,962
Where do you think you're going?

576
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:19,881
Sorry?

577
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,382
And this too.

578
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:24,552
She's in shock and barely breathing.

579
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,930
She can't just shed
one perfect little tear.

580
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:28,890
I'll have to fix this.

581
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,770
Can you try Scene 109 again?

582
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,192
"You're tired of me being sick, right?"

583
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,402
Let me try again.

584
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,948
"You're tired of me being sick, right?"

585
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,616
Why are you saying it like that?

586
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,162
Why do you keep trailing off at the end?

587
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,790
Because I don't understand.

588
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,626
Mmm, Gyuwon's in so much pain,

589
00:38:56,709 --> 00:39:00,213
not because she's sick, but more so
because she can't see him anymore.

590
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,799
But the direction says
"like it's no big deal,"

591
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:04,926
and I can't understand it.

592
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:09,597
Why should Gyuwon love Hyunsang?
There's no reason for her to love him.

593
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,808
"Like it's no big deal" is correct here.

594
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:14,894
The man talked big,
like he'd always be there,

595
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,396
but ended up betraying her.

596
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,356
And Gyuwon is sick

597
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,692
and all alone.

598
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,028
That doesn't feel real at all.

599
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,698
Everything just feels cold and cruel.

600
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:29,826
Didn't you say you wanted realism?

601
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,452
Are you sure this is realism?

602
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,288
Like I told you last time,

603
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,666
this may look like a romance,

604
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,459
but love is the last thing
this film needs.

605
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:41,296
I don't know why you'd say "need"
when it comes to love.

606
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,299
The world isn't all hearts and roses.

607
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,634
Hearts and roses?

608
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,932
Some people chase the fantasy of love,
only to get stabbed in the back

609
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,519
and end up completely alone.

610
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:21,586
Hello?

611
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,588
Yes, I forgot to say something earlier.

612
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,256
Mr. Lee, it's 11 p.m.

613
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:28,009
Don't you think it's too harsh
to tell me off this late?

614
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,469
I'm not going to tell you off.

615
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,889
Just telling you to only rehearse
in our scheduled readings.

616
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:35,433
<i>Don't meet anyone separately,</i>
<i>except Seoyoung.</i>

617
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:41,230
Uh, but I have
the most scenes with Jungwoo.

618
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,691
And what if he finds out you're sick?

619
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,193
Oh.

620
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,028
Okay.

621
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,947
Okay, then. Good night.

622
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:02,460
How about Park Seungyeon
for the Steadicam?

623
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,381
Oh, you haven't heard?

624
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:10,259
Seungyeon passed away two years ago.
The cancer came back.

625
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:15,723
You've been hiding away
from the scene for too long.

626
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:20,728
Well, important people like him
only work when it really matters.

627
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,232
Oh, of course.

628
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:28,277
ANDONG - THE CENTER
OF KOREA'S SPIRITUAL CULTURE

629
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:29,487
WOLYEONG-GYO BRIDGE

630
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,614
What a view.

631
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,451
It's nice during the day, but the lighting
is on another level at night.

632
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:39,455
Wow. I'll check in
with our director and get back to you.

633
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:52,427
Thank goodness we found a good place
for the bookstore early.

634
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:56,305
We'll be able to
build everything on schedule.

635
00:41:58,808 --> 00:41:59,892
Mr. Lee?

636
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,063
Yes, I like it. It's nice.

637
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:26,210
CINEMA JONGNO

638
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:33,968
KIM JINYEO

639
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:37,930
Hey, you're here.

640
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,517
You know Ms. Kim Jinyeo quite well, right?

641
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,408
You have to really watch out for this one.

642
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:06,292
- Who are you?
- I'm Lim Junbyung.

643
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:09,045
- Pardon?
- I'm Ms. Lee's manager, Lim Junbyung.

644
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,756
Ah.

645
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,758
If you're family,
you shouldn't do business together.

646
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,718
- Daeum's in there, right?
- Yes.

647
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:18,846
I'm actually the CEO
of Beyond Entertainment.

648
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,807
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes.

649
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,684
Ms. Lee's resting right now.

650
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,189
Everything here is to help with that.

651
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,566
Move if you're not going to help.

652
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,651
You can't go in.

653
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,782
- You can't. No.
- Come on! I said move!

654
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,867
- For crying out loud!
- You can't go in.

655
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,994
Goodness! Daeum!

656
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:43,704
Hello.

657
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:45,414
It's so great to see you.

658
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,918
Would you mind letting me in?

659
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:53,673
AT THE END OF US

660
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:57,009
What's all this, Ms. Go?

661
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:58,719
After this movie,

662
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:02,181
they're all scripts you should look at
for your next project!

663
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,143
As I told you last time--

664
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:08,771
I figured I should at least
show you what I can do.

665
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:12,316
I appreciate the gesture, but I can't.

666
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:17,822
I can make you the next Chae Seoyoung.

667
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:22,201
No, even a bigger star than her.

668
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:24,662
I already

669
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:28,416
have a great manager over there, actually.

670
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:30,918
Daeum!

671
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:37,592
It's hard out there
for an actress to survive on her own.

672
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,843
Wow, talk about clingy.

673
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:39,927
That little…

674
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:41,679
He means the rice cake.

675
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:44,223
Yes, this honey rice cake
is really clinging to my mouth.

676
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,810
It must've been out too long and gone bad.

677
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:48,936
Why those…

678
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,859
- Take care now.
- Goodbye.

679
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,652
This book looks a little weird.

680
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:59,405
Check these out. And these…

681
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,242
There are all kinds of genres here.

682
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:05,077
And all the big directors and writers.

683
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,206
I'm not interested.

684
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:11,459
Not even a little?

685
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:15,588
Even if I were, I couldn't do any of it.

686
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:18,132
Right. I'm sorry.

687
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:21,886
I got ahead of myself.

688
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,434
I'm going to head out for a bit.

689
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,560
Where to?

690
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:33,231
There's someone I really want to meet.

691
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,906
I'm sorry for showing up like this.

692
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,621
About <i>Love in White</i>…

693
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:51,374
My father didn't write it, did he?

694
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,169
You knew, didn't you?

695
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:57,838
Why don't you take a seat?

696
00:45:57,922 --> 00:45:59,298
Why tell me this now

697
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:02,468
after all this time?

698
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:04,804
Hold on.

699
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,433
- Gosh.
- I'm so sorry.

700
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:11,185
- Come here.
- No, I'm fine.

701
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:15,231
I have a first aid kit somewhere.

702
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:23,406
She was the lead in the original,

703
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:26,909
so I just came by to meet her, that's all.

704
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,664
Mr. Lee.

705
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,625
Mr. Lee.

706
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:36,335
Let go.

707
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,760
Why are you here?

708
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,387
Why are you being like this?

709
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:49,432
Why are you so rude to Ms. Kim?

710
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:51,475
You heard everything.

711
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,647
You said you looked me up.

712
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,609
All the information you need
would've been there.

713
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:06,282
Why were you even eavesdropping?

714
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:07,867
I wasn't trying to!

715
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:09,869
I couldn't help overhearing it.

716
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:16,625
Are you leaving without apologizing?

717
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,297
More like I'm leaving
without getting an apology.

718
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:32,641
Daeum!

719
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,191
Don't go in there.

720
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,445
I left in such a rush.
I should at least say goodbye.

721
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:48,199
Sorry to put you in an awkward spot,
but I don't want you to go back in there.

722
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:28,864
This is driving me insane.

723
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,242
I…

724
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:35,496
I don't even know what I heard back there…

725
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:40,167
so please don't go insane over it.

726
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:46,966
Since I know your secret,
could you keep one of mine?

727
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:53,097
Your secret?

728
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,767
Everyone thinks
Lee Duyoung wrote <i>Love in White</i>…

729
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:03,190
but I don't think he wrote it.

730
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:06,485
What?

731
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:13,617
I don't even know what I'm feeling.
Ashamed, foolish…

732
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:18,789
That's why I'm making this film.

733
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:21,917
To return <i>Love in White</i>
to its real writer…

734
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,337
in a way that…

735
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:30,050
as many people as possible
will know the truth.

736
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:41,520
PAINKILLER

737
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:52,990
Our brains

738
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:54,909
can't tell the difference…

739
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,413
between emotional pain and physical pain.

740
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:03,959
So please take this today, okay?

741
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,422
Good night.

742
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,425
Ah…

743
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:15,262
You should take this with warm water.

744
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:17,306
And…

745
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:21,560
you need to sleep well, okay?

746
00:50:21,644 --> 00:50:22,811
Got it?

747
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:26,315
Promise?

748
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:27,399
Hmm?

749
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:29,068
Okay.

750
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,981
LOCATION PROPOSAL
FOR LOVE IN WHITE

751
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,149
What's this?

752
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:11,277
That spot looked great.

753
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:13,946
They're even offering funding too.

754
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,322
WOLYEONG-GYO BRIDGE

755
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,283
I don't think we're low on budget.

756
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:19,743
We're always low on budget, man.

757
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:23,205
Good spot or not,
I don't want to add unnecessary travel.

758
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:25,666
It'll just stretch the schedule.

759
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,044
That's strange.

760
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:32,506
Extra shoot days are my problem,
as the producer.

761
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:34,883
Anyway, fine.

762
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:36,343
Nice weather we have today.

763
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:39,221
Now, let us proceed with a bow

764
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:42,182
to the spirits of heaven and earth,

765
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:45,227
praying for the safe shoot
as well as the health and well-being

766
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:47,104
of our cast and crew.

767
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:48,647
We'd like to invite Mr. Kim Hyuncheol,

768
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:50,858
who was a part of
this movie's original history.

769
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,502
LOVE IN WHITE

770
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:17,134
Closer together, please!

771
00:52:20,012 --> 00:52:22,222
Get ready. One, two, three.

772
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,311
You don't have to see me out.

773
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:28,479
- Go back in.
- Goodbye.

774
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:29,730
Keep it up!

775
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,902
Don't you think this is cute?

776
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:38,072
Isn't this pig just too cute?

777
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,532
- Isn't it?
- Yes, it's so cute.

778
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:42,743
- We can't have it hurting people.
- Is it over?

779
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:47,164
I think it's over. Right?

780
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,334
- I brought it here yesterday.
- Really?

781
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:51,752
I prepared everything.

782
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,629
- Wow.
- How did you manage that?

783
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:56,048
- It was nothing.
- No way.

784
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:58,592
Were you two able to greet the others?

785
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,519
- We're eating pork today.
- Isn't that a bit cruel?

786
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:16,443
You canceled last time,
so it's on you to reschedule.

787
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:19,780
- We'll be seeing each other a lot, so…
- Why not today?

788
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:22,491
It's a chance to make it up to us.

789
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,373
Mr. Lee doesn't drink.

790
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:35,045
That's rare for a director.

791
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:40,467
He said that in our last film together,
don't you remember?

792
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:44,221
I was too scared
to even go near him back then.

793
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,016
Daeum doesn't drink either.

794
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:53,147
Ah.

795
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:56,108
I noticed you two seem pretty close.

796
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,571
Like you know each other very well.

797
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:01,947
- No--
- We are close.

798
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:08,078
He cast me when I was a total nobody,
so I've been trying hard to get close.

799
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:09,455
Rookie energy and all!

800
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:11,290
Okay. Cheers.

801
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:14,877
Mr. Lee.

802
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:17,337
Don't you think
Gyuwon's story is too tragic?

803
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:19,673
She's young and beautiful

804
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:23,469
but has to die
after losing the man she loves.

805
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:32,311
Everyone dies eventually.

806
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:37,900
I don't think it's such a tragedy if
you live the life you have meaningfully.

807
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:41,278
Even the love we think will last forever…

808
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,781
eventually fades, doesn't it?

809
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:51,997
Got any other wine? This one's too dry.

810
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,376
I don't know.
Someone drank all the sweet ones recently.

811
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,504
Are you sure you don't want some, Daeum?

812
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:02,174
I'm fine. Just this is enough.

813
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:11,934
Are you sick or something?

814
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,187
Sorry?

815
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,313
I was just wondering.

816
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:19,191
One glass should be fine, no?

817
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:25,113
Daeum,
have you seen the original film?

818
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:26,698
Of course.

819
00:55:26,782 --> 00:55:28,992
I cry every single time I watch it.

820
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:31,537
Oh. Hey, you're just like me.

821
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,705
So do I. It gets me every time.

822
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:35,165
You two seem to click.

823
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:38,043
Mr. Lee, how do they look in a two-shot?

824
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:42,339
They look good together.

825
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:49,555
Seoyoung and I…

826
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,059
we're actually seeing each other.

827
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:58,272
Oh.

828
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:01,108
Wow!

829
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,568
Congratulations.

830
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:04,611
Yes, that's something to celebrate.

831
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:08,073
It's stuffy in here,
I need some fresh air.

832
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:10,617
The terrace is over there.

833
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:32,472
Well, that killed the mood fast.

834
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,274
When did it start?

835
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,484
Right after the divorce.

836
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:47,613
Why are you asking if Daeum is sick?

837
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:52,451
I just thought it was odd for someone
her age not to drink a single drop.

838
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:56,496
It's even weirder if you think
I had some ulterior motive asking that.

839
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:00,876
- I heard you took her to the hospital.
- Yeah.

840
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:04,880
I didn't think she'd tell you.

841
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,132
That's surprising.

842
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:09,968
I guess she tells you everything.

843
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,929
She said she wasn't feeling well that day.

844
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:14,556
She's a bit anemic too.

845
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:16,433
Just…

846
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,894
Nothing you need to worry about.

847
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:23,815
You really care about Daeum, huh?

848
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:26,568
I just need her.

849
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:28,320
That's all.

850
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:38,455
Have a good night.

851
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:08,026
Mr. Lee.

852
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:09,861
Yes?

853
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,282
You know…

854
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:18,328
Is it possible

855
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,914
to kiss someone…

856
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,959
when you don't love them?

857
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,212
Or rather, when you're not even sure…

858
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,049
if what you're feeling

859
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,677
is love?

860
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:41,017
That's what Hyunsang does to Gyuwon.

861
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:42,728
Oh.

862
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:47,441
Write down whatever you don't get.
I'll explain it to you later.

863
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:49,443
It's a good question.

864
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:52,863
You should use me, mmm,

865
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,489
as much as you need like this.

866
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:56,116
Wow.

867
00:58:58,285 --> 00:58:59,286
Mmm.

868
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:03,248
What?

869
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,917
Why are you looking at me like that?

870
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:08,503
Have a good night.

871
00:59:11,173 --> 00:59:12,174
Okay.

872
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:42,287
Why didn't you just punch Jeha?

873
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:45,665
It's pouring outside. Stay the night.

874
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:49,127
Why not invite the press, too?

875
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:51,004
Saying that to your costar

876
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,673
and the director we're stuck with
for the next three months?

877
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:56,134
Do you have any common sense?

878
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:57,928
Or basic decency?

879
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,639
They were going to find out anyway.
No big deal. Work's work.

880
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:03,099
It's a big deal because
it interferes with my work!

881
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:05,268
You keep looking at him.

882
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:14,528
That's why I said it.
I wanted you to know I was upset.

883
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,699
I thought we were done talking about that
when I joined this movie.

884
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:22,744
I guess not.

885
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:25,205
I wasn't.

886
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:28,959
I'm sorry.

887
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,294
This won't happen again.

888
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:16,840
<i>Ding-dong!</i>

889
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,093
Stay there, I'll head down.

890
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:25,765
Daeum.

891
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:29,936
How did you know I lived here?

892
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,772
Your friend is my manager after all.

893
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,524
Did you forget?

894
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:36,985
Are you okay?

895
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,529
Want to step outside?

896
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:41,781
Just for a moment.

897
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:43,909
Are you out of your mind?

898
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,953
Don't you know what'll happen
if you catch a cold?

899
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:50,665
I'll be fine if I shower right away!

900
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:55,503
This feels amazing!

901
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:58,214
Why do you keep going out in the rain?

902
01:01:58,798 --> 01:01:59,799
Stop it.

903
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:05,221
I figured

904
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:08,516
you'd never join me…

905
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:12,437
but you really are uptight.

906
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:16,608
This feels so good, though.

907
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,530
Did you walk from home in the rain?

908
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:26,993
No. I had an umbrella, too.

909
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:30,455
I was only in the rain
for about 10 seconds.

910
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:35,710
What, you think I've been out here
soaking wet for an hour?

911
01:02:38,338 --> 01:02:40,423
Let's go. I'll take you home.

912
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:48,556
So this is what it felt like.

913
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:52,894
My mom showed me

914
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:55,563
how to play in the rain

915
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:59,192
when I was terrified,
like you are right now.

916
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:04,781
What a low blow, bringing up your mom.

917
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:10,495
You're like a person made of concrete.

918
01:03:12,372 --> 01:03:16,209
Let's forget all the pressure
for just a minute.

919
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,337
Just one minute.

920
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:20,797
Trust me.

921
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:23,383
It really does feel amazing.

922
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:27,762
It better be.

923
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:42,045
One minute's up.

924
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,382
That was too short.

925
01:04:47,801 --> 01:04:48,885
Such a shame.

926
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:53,056
You really counted to the second, huh?

927
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:02,482
You know what? It just feels too unfair.

928
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:04,859
Scene 30.

929
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:08,029
"The two share a soft kiss."

930
01:05:28,675 --> 01:05:29,926
You told me to use you.

931
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:49,797
That's it. Daeum's not leaving
the hospital anymore. Got it?

932
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:53,301
Wow, Ms. Go.
You're full of energy this morning--

933
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:55,261
Help me sign Lee Daeum.

934
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:58,806
<i>It's better for you not to sign Daeum.</i>

935
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:00,141
Who are you?

936
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:01,684
<i>What exactly is wrong with Daeum?</i>

937
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:03,186
CAN YOU LEAVE ME SOME TIME?
I WANT TO CHOOSE MY OWN ENDING.

938
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:06,606
<i>I honestly don't know how to do that.</i>

939
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:09,025
<i>I understand how my dad feels,</i>

940
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:12,028
<i>but I can't live how he wants me to.</i>

941
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:16,324
Is it fun making a terminal
patient play a terminal character?

942
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:19,202
Is this how all movies are?

943
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,962
