12
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,546

13
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,548
- Just go! Now!
- You're a darn fox!

14
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,008
I won't forgive you!

15
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,177
She's a devilish fox!

16
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,718
I WAS AFRAID

17
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:59,096
THAT I SHARED
SOMETHING IN COMMON

18
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,473
WITH SOMEONE
I NEVER WANTED TO BE LIKE.

19
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,524
No, stop the press.

20
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,360
Yes, we're friendly.
But we've never crossed the line.

21
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,654
I'd like to apologize.

22
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,116
I NEEDED TO PROVE

23
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,827
THAT I WASN'T HIM.

24
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,499
You're just leaving like this?

25
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,292
You're really leaving?

26
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,837
Uh…

27
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,590
I didn't think it through.
I didn't think how you'd feel.

28
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,510
Do I feel like a burden? Is that why?

29
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,388
- Seoyoung…
- Hmm.

30
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,348
…our movie's over.

31
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:45,851
What do you mean?

32
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,353
I was just using you.

33
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,315
I used your feelings for me
during the shoot.

34
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,486
That's all.

35
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,282
I simply led you on.

36
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,951
And now,

37
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,911
I have to make it right.

38
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,466
I NEEDED TO PROVE

39
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,927
I WOULD NEVER MAKE
THE SAME CHOICES

40
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:24,264
AS MY FATHER DID.

41
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,901
Was that enough?

42
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,698
Not bad for a rehearsal,

43
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,075
but your left shoulder
tends to shake a bit.

44
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,537
It'll probably be worse
when we start filming.

45
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,834
It'll be noticeable on camera.

46
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:53,919
It'll look…

47
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,005
like you're bobbing.

48
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:58,882
Ah.

49
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,765
My shoulder?

50
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,642
What's wrong with that?

51
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,645
It's not right to use me this way.

52
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,104
I'm not an actor, you know.

53
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,274
Y-yes, of course.

54
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,402
I guess that didn't really help.

55
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:22,697
I'm sorry

56
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,908
that I wasn't much help.

57
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,001
Still…

58
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:36,837
it wasn't that bad.

59
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:07,742
EPISODE 5

60
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,458
Hello!

61
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:21,673
Wow, Ms. Go.
You're full of energy this morning--

62
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,925
Help me sign Lee Daeum.

63
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,970
Straight to the point, as always.

64
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,847
I saw she's got a manager now.

65
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,432
Who is he? He wasn't family.

66
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,975
Oh, just some guy Director Lee knows.

67
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,853
So he's the one who set it up?

68
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,440
What did he say to make her turn me down?

69
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,774
Daeum turned you down?

70
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,109
She shut me out completely.

71
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,861
And that only made me want her more.

72
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,739
Give me her info. Background,
experience, education, everything.

73
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:49,618
You should hire a private investigator
if you want all that.

74
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,536
Mmm. Mmm.

75
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:55,957
Come on,

76
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,834
let's help each other like the old days.

77
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,754
I'm dying to sign Lee Daeum, okay?

78
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,339
Ms. Go,

79
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,966
I'm only saying this for your sake.

80
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,011
It's better for you
not to sign with Daeum.

81
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,013
Seriously? Even you?

82
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,807
I just said it's for your own sake.

83
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,976
I wouldn't sign her if I were you.

84
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,062
Forget it! I'll find another way.

85
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,735
I'm late. Hey, Daeum!

86
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:27,656
How long are you going to sleep?
Get up! I need to be at work soon.

87
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,866
You told me to wake you.

88
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,410
Daeum?

89
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,622
Mom! Mom!

90
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,753
Daeum was out in the rain
for a bit yesterday.

91
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:42,962
That explains it.

92
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,756
No wonder this happened.

93
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,301
What were you doing
while she ended up like this?

94
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:51,346
Let her sleep another hour,
then wake her up and get her to eat.

95
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,598
Doctor, don't mention this to Daeum's…

96
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:57,977
Hey.

97
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,607
- Hello again.
- Hello.

98
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,360
Is her fever down?

99
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,113
Yes. I'm sorry, Dr. Lee.
I take responsibility for--

100
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,280
Why are you sorry?

101
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,242
- Let's admit her.
- Pardon?

102
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,451
- Oh my. Sir…
- But…

103
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:14,577
Gyoyeong.

104
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,663
That's it.

105
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,374
Daeum's not leaving
the hospital anymore. Got it?

106
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,625
Ah…

107
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,879
DIRECTOR LEE JEHA

108
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,632
- Dr. Kim.
- Yes?

109
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,759
Send me this director guy's number
right away.

110
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:31,720
Yes, sir.

111
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:36,641
Goodness.

112
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:40,311
Dr. Lee, please calm down
and just listen to her side of the story.

113
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:44,691
Ah. Patient Lee Daeum in Room 1205
is no longer allowed to leave.

114
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,401
- Dr. Lee, wait…
- Oh.

115
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,904
Send me the director's number
so I can check it as I go downstairs.

116
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,990
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

117
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,714
LEE DAEUM

118
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,799
WHERE ARE YOU?

119
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,724
CALL

120
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,559
LIM JUNBYUNG

121
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,025
Hey, Junbyung. Let me ask you a favor.

122
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,570
I'm here, but nobody's home.

123
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,032
- <i>She's not answering your calls?</i>
- No. Did something happen yesterday?

124
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,366
No, nothing happened.

125
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:40,246
She came to ask something about the script
and left not long after.

126
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,627
Hang on.

127
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,507
Yes, hello?

128
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,106
ROOM 511, KIM MINSEOK
SPECIALTY: NEUROSURGERY

129
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,233
Surgery isn't really an option right now.

130
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,861
Even admission is just my recommendation.
I doubt she would agree to it.

131
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:12,987
NEUROSURGERY
KIM MINSEOK

132
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,430
Hey…

133
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,642
Where are you going?

134
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,686
You know where.

135
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,770
Gyoyeong…

136
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,024
I don't want to be here.

137
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,485
You're not okay.

138
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:53,570
You can't go.

139
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,822
But I have to go.

140
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,657
Director Lee's waiting for me.

141
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,910
Your father's going to meet
with that director right now.

142
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:01,995
Exactly.

143
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,872
That's why I have to be there.

144
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,711
Hey.

145
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,255
How can you be so selfish?

146
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,258
You know I have to go make that movie.

147
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,761
You're the one
who was the happiest for me.

148
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:20,722
I'm happy for you.

149
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:21,806
I was happy.

150
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,018
But you shouldn't have fainted, then.

151
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,478
Gyoyeong.

152
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,112
Listen to me.

153
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,908
Do you think I enjoy doing this
when my friend wants to do what she likes?

154
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:42,619
I'm scared.

155
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,456
I'm scared something might happen to you.

156
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:48,875
Just this morning,

157
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,712
do you know how scared I was
when you wouldn't wake up?

158
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,305
I'm sorry.

159
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,183
I'm sorry, Gyoyeong.

160
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,523
But, Gyoyeong…

161
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,525
look at me.

162
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,904
Don't I look different?

163
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,990
Being in this movie
means so much to me right now.

164
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,618
So call me selfish all you want…

165
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,207
but becoming Gyuwon
makes me happier than ever.

166
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,462
I'm sorry.

167
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,846
Help me out.

168
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,736
Yes, Manager?

169
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,781
I took the morning off.

170
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:03,825
Yes.

171
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,290
Yes?

172
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:12,959
Hello, Doctor.

173
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:14,961
- Who are you?
- Ah.

174
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,173
Ah. Aha.

175
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,092
Nice to see you again.

176
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:24,304
Yes, I heard a lot about you
from Director Lee.

177
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,680
So you're our consultant?

178
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:29,600
I thought your character
didn't need consulting.

179
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,144
What exactly is wrong with Daeum?

180
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:36,399
Ah. I'm not the type
to beat around the bush.

181
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,651
I know Daeum is sick.

182
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,196
I can't tell you
a patient's personal information.

183
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,532
That line appears often in movies too.

184
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,243
In movies, they dig it up some other way.

185
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,495
Why do you want to know this?

186
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:50,621
Hmm.

187
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,416
Daeum…

188
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,585
is trying to make a movie,

189
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,087
and I want to help her.

190
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,048
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

191
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,301
But even so,

192
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,512
there's nothing I can tell you here.

193
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,222
I have to ask you to leave.

194
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,898
CINEMA JONGNO

195
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:20,068
I couldn't think of a quiet place to talk.

196
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,446
This is nice and quiet enough.

197
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,532
I'm sorry.

198
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,618
I know it's out of line,

199
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,746
but I got your contact info
from Dr. Kim Minseok.

200
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,791
No, that's fine. What did you want to say?

201
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,501
Well…

202
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,753
Was it a "table read"?

203
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:42,256
The day before her table read,
Daeum told me that she was…

204
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,676
so happy she could die.

205
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,347
For her to say those words,

206
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,890
she must've really wanted…

207
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,726
to do this acting thing.

208
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,937
Yes, she's doing very well.

209
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:01,442
I should be happy to hear
my daughter is doing well,

210
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,194
but it's hard for me.

211
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:08,991
I'm sure you've had a lot on your mind
after hearing of Daeum's condition.

212
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,787
I heard you're keeping it a secret
from everyone else.

213
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,622
Yes, for her sake,

214
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,958
I plan to keep it a secret
until filming is over.

215
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,042
Is that so?

216
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,712
But if you really do care about her,

217
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:23,756
instead of keeping secrets,

218
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,259
shouldn't you be letting her
go to the hospital

219
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,386
to help her live longer?

220
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,224
I'm trying to honor her wishes.

221
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:36,102
I'll keep communicating with her
about her condition

222
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:39,355
and try my best to care for her.

223
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,942
But Daeum's not well enough
to finish this movie.

224
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:46,154
She can barely get through the day.

225
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:49,991
We'll arrange the schedule for her
and finish as quickly as possible.

226
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,160
And what if she has a seizure on set?

227
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,997
If she misses a single dose,
or a single meal,

228
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:59,041
that could be it for her.

229
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,587
Does filming a movie matter more
than someone's life?

230
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,632
You'll try your best?

231
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,676
My daughter's life is on the line,

232
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,387
and the best is all you can do?

233
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,976
That's truly irresponsible of you.

234
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:25,526
Is it fun making a terminal patient
play a terminal character?

235
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,113
Is this how all movies are?

236
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,924
There's nothing I can tell you here.

237
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,175
I have to ask you to leave.

238
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,971
1205, LEE DAEUM, CHECK REGULARLY

239
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,061
<i>Twelfth floor.</i>

240
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,281
Make a choice, Daeum.

241
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,492
Option one,

242
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,577
walking out of here,

243
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:20,289
doing everything you've only
ever dreamed of, and then dying.

244
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:22,416
Option two,

245
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,127
staying here

246
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:27,505
and living longer.

247
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,677
But you won't be able to do anything.

248
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,137
It'll be miserable.

249
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,018
That's a tough choice.

250
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:44,772
Is it?

251
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,109
It's easy for me.

252
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,654
Daeum!

253
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,448
The doctor was looking for you.

254
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:56,284
Oh! I forgot.

255
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,452
- Let's talk later, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

256
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,090
THE LATE KIM MINJEONG

257
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,878
<i>Every day in the hospital,</i>

258
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,880
<i>I couldn't stop picturing it.</i>

259
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,596
<i>What kind of life…</i>

260
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,058
<i>would I have led if I left this place?</i>

261
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,232
I know I need to go--

262
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,401
<i>I asked if Daeum got any better!</i>

263
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,572
Mom, I'll explain everything later.

264
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,533
<i>Why do you keep rambling</i>
<i>about the weirdest--</i>

265
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,747
<i>The heroine of a movie,</i>

266
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,707
<i>a fairy-tale romance,</i>

267
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,502
<i>and a "happily ever after" in the end.</i>

268
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:34,173
<i>Real life was always out there,</i>
<i>beyond the hospital.</i>

269
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,233
- Hello.
- Hi.

270
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,909
<i>First floor.</i>

271
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:26,726
Yes, Doctor?

272
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,353
Ms. Lee Daeum?

273
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,313
What?

274
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,732
She's not in her room?

275
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,859
She was there a minute ago.

276
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,820
Gyuwon.

277
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,573
When was the last time you slept?

278
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,075
You're on call today again, right?

279
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:46,287
I never get to eat with my own sister.

280
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,455
Aren't you hungry?

281
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,250
How about a sandwich?

282
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:54,462
I'll head back up there. Okay.

283
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:03,345
If we want sandwiches,
how about a little drive to Forestin?

284
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:04,889
<i>Basement level two.</i>

285
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,448
It's been a while, Dr. Lee.

286
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:24,450
Yes, hello.

287
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:38,297
<i>The outside world turned out</i>
<i>to be tougher than I thought.</i>

288
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,218
<i>But I don't want to give up.</i>

289
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:56,732
<i>Dad.</i>

290
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:00,986
<i>Can you leave the rest of our time to me?</i>

291
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,656
<i>I want to choose my own ending.</i>

292
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,502
Where should I take you?

293
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:29,515
I don't really have anywhere
I can go right now.

294
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:32,935
Give me a minute.

295
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,358
Anywhere safe is good enough, right?

296
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,444
I'll figure it out. Just rest.

297
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,481
Don't get up. Make yourself comfortable.

298
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:20,774
Oh. Okay.

299
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,651
Well…

300
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,779
You can take the room upstairs.

301
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,532
Want to go up and rest?

302
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,327
Or do you want something to eat?

303
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,120
Wait, I guess you can't just eat anything.

304
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,872
M-Ms. Chae.

305
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,957
I'll just be upstairs.

306
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,545
Of course. You should get some rest first.

307
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,631
Ms. Chae,

308
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:45,007
thank you so much.

LEE DAEUM

316
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:49,780
Why weren't you answering?

317
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:50,948
Where are you?

318
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,076
I wasn't really in a situation
where I could pick up.

319
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,537
I'm sorry I made you worry.

320
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,247
What kind of situation?

321
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:00,332
<i>I was at the hospital…</i>

322
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,378
but I ran away
because I was scared I'd have to stay.

323
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,839
So where are you now?

324
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,465
<i>Uh…</i>

325
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,260
I'm at Ms. Seoyoung's.

326
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,679
I ran into her at the hospital

327
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:17,516
- <i>and asked her to help me out.</i>
- Where did you say you were?

328
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,060
Do you mind if I explain more tomorrow?

329
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:21,854
I promise I'll tell you everything.

330
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,022
Stay there, I'm on my way.

331
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:24,732
Pardon?

332
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:26,191
I said, wait there for me.

333
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,282
Thank you for the meal.

334
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:36,660
But why aren't you eating anything?

335
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,954
I gave up rice three years ago.

336
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,248
Oh.

337
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,590
Can I ask why you were at the hospital?

338
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:52,718
Ah.

339
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,970
Prescriptions from psych.

340
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,680
I have a lot of stress and anxiety.

341
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:58,724
Has it been that rough?

342
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,643
Yes. I've been going for a while.

343
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:05,314
I didn't expect to see you there, though.

344
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,233
Like what happened before…

345
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,277
Can you tell me about that now?

346
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,654
I'm just worried about you.

347
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:15,115
I-It just…

348
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,659
It just happens sometimes, not very often.

349
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,828
You don't have to worry about that.

350
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,663
It's really nothing.

351
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:22,748
DIRECTOR LEE JEHA

352
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,293
Sorry, I need to take this.

353
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,421
Yeah, what's up?

354
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,508
<i>I'll be at your place soon.</i>

355
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,301
Why would you come to my place?

356
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,887
To get Daeum.

357
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,598
How did you know she was here?

358
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,310
She told me she was there.

359
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:50,317
But why are you coming to get her?

360
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,612
I don't think
I need to explain myself to you.

361
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,055
Come in.

362
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,401
Mr. Lee.

363
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,071
Let's go.

364
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,534
You'll make things weird
if you go like this, you know.

365
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,787
Shouldn't you at least
explain what's going on?

366
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,544
Do you need help like you did earlier?

367
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,713
It's not like that, Ms. Chae.

368
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:55,966
Go downstairs and wait in the car.
I'll be right down.

369
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,970
- Mr. Lee…
- Go downstairs.

370
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,362
See you.

371
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:18,447
What?

372
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,617
You didn't explain anything.

373
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:24,411
What are you hiding?

374
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:27,456
I can't pretend not to notice anymore.
Explain before you go.

375
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,710
Why were you at the hospital?
How did you run into Daeum?

376
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,378
And why did you bring her here?

377
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,510
I don't understand
why you get so worked up about Daeum.

378
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,513
I saw something and wanted to know why.

379
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:44,973
You two are hiding something from me.

380
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,185
It doesn't concern you.

381
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,978
Why are you acting so weird?

382
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,105
Why are you so unpredictable?

383
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:58,028
I was excited and nervous
to work with you again.

384
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:01,490
Honestly, it felt like the old days
and I started acting on impulse.

385
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:05,661
But you keep acting in strange ways
like someone I don't even recognize.

386
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,081
Why are you doing this? What's the reason?

387
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:13,543
Because I'm not someone who exists
to act the way you want or predict.

388
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,674
That's something you should expect
from someone who loves you.

389
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,133
Not me.

390
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:41,738
Why do I keep running into Seoyoung?

391
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,281
Is it destiny?

392
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:45,784
I heard you were unwell.

393
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:47,536
Are you okay now?

394
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,162
I'm fine.

395
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:51,164
I'll tell you if I'm really not okay.

396
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:52,499
You don't need to worry.

397
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:56,044
Let's go to the hospital.

398
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:58,672
No, I can't go there.

399
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,135
Why are you so reckless
when you know you can't handle it?

400
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:04,928
We're about to start shooting.

401
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:08,015
If your condition worsens, 70 or 80 people
will have to stop everything.

402
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,058
Even if you're new,

403
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:13,645
a lead actor should at least have some
basic sense of professionalism.

404
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,397
If I go back to the hospital now,

405
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:18,066
I'll just lie there until I die.

406
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,110
That's my reality.

407
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,070
I don't care if you yell at me.

408
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:24,990
It's a million times better
for me to be out in the world.

409
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,867
Keep yelling, I can take it all.

410
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,327
And I'm not being reckless right now.

411
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:31,288
I got out because I'm desperate.

412
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,999
Mr. Lee, can you please give me this?

413
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,754
I'll take you to your friend's.

414
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,797
I can't go there today.

415
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:44,760
Where, then?

416
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,431
Somewhere you'd never want to go.

417
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,849
What?

418
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,601
A place that's your version
of my hospital.

419
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,687
Don't you have a place like that?

420
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,630
Is this the place you never want to go?

421
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:24,883
Yeah.

422
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,845
I've been wondering this since last time.

423
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,224
Why do you ask about the worst food

424
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,267
and the worst places?

425
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:39,314
I'm just curious.

426
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,486
I want to know what you like, don't like,

427
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,030
everything.

428
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,707
Come in.

429
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:28,405
Take this room.

430
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,158
What is this place?

431
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,785
My childhood home.

432
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:37,080
Ah. No wonder.

433
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:39,541
I looks like it hasn't been
maintained in a while,

434
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:43,378
but it feels grand and cozy
at the same time.

435
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,755
A little eerie, but feels antique.

436
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,299
It suits you, actually.

437
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,550
Suits me? Please.

438
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,846
But why don't you like this place?

439
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,307
Use this room, okay?

440
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,058
Bathroom's over there.

441
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,476
Just stay here for the night,

442
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,686
and after that…

443
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,481
Let's figure that out later.

444
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,317
Where are you going?

445
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,152
I have my own place.

446
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:10,822
What? This isn't some guesthouse.

447
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:15,368
You can't just throw me some guidelines
and walk away.

448
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:29,049
Did you tell your father you're here?

449
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:32,802
You should tell him.

450
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:35,722
You're not a kid.

451
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:42,395
He doesn't want you
to do this movie, right?

452
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,399
I guess you met my dad.

453
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:51,529
I won't tell you to do
whatever your father says.

454
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,281
I never did with mine.

455
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,366
Was your father…

456
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,953
against you making films too?

457
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,038
Not sure.

458
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:03,625
He would've at least been against me
remaking <i>Love in White</i>.

459
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,834
Hmm.

460
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:09,005
Can I ask, if you don't mind?

461
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:10,548
You said that…

462
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:16,638
you didn't think your father was actually
the one who wrote <i>Love in White</i>.

463
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,931
Let's change the subject.

464
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,057
Oh.

465
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,854
I honestly don't know what to do.

466
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,275
I understand how my dad feels…

467
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,321
but I can't live how he wants me to.

468
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:39,536
But your father's a doctor who understands
your condition better than anyone.

469
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,121
Exactly.

470
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,082
That's what makes me so scared.

471
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,627
He can't accept it because he's a doctor.

472
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:49,879
Can we change the subject?

473
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,012
I'll head out now.

474
00:34:58,471 --> 00:34:59,889
Mr. Lee!

475
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:04,519
I'm sorry.

476
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,855
I'm terribly sorry.

477
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,316
About what?

478
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:11,026
You know, last time…

479
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:14,195
When I forced you to…

480
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,489
You know.

481
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,243
I'm sorry.

482
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,706
Who apologizes that seriously for a kiss?

483
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:28,752
Wouldn't acting like it didn't happen
be even weirder?

484
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:30,629
You don't have to apologize.

485
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:33,798
If anything,
I should be the one to be sorry.

486
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:37,302
Even if it was practice, you had to kiss
someone you don't even like.

487
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:40,889
Mmm.

488
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,436
How many times have you apologized today?

489
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,812
H-How many times?

490
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,649
Mmm…

491
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:55,737
Hmm?

492
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:59,074
Think you can finish this film
if you keep apologizing like that?

493
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,619
Open your hand again.

494
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:14,297
I know your heart's in the right place,
but stop apologizing so much.

495
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:16,174
If you want to do
what you've always wanted,

496
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,634
you'll have to…

497
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,886
learn how to deal with feelings like that.

498
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:27,102
You said you're a terminal patient
who could do anything.

499
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:33,024
You're someone
who can do anything, aren't you?

500
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:35,026
So stop belittling yourself.

501
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,503
Don't touch anything in this house.

502
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,923
Not a thing.

503
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,376
WATER, GRAPE 100,
SEAWEED SNACK, COOKIES

504
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:12,499
"GRANDMA'S TABLE" NEARBY
IS REALLY GOOD.

505
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:15,376
LEFT THE STUFF YOU NEED
BY THE DOOR.

506
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:47,826
GRAPE 100

507
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:19,399
Hmm.

508
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,112
Hmm?

509
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,324
Is that Mr. Lee? He's so cute…

510
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:30,535
<i>Don't touch anything in this house.</i>

511
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,579
Uh…

512
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:34,706
<i>Not a thing.</i>

513
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:41,713
<i>Not a thing.</i>

514
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:02,817
You're coming along?

515
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,153
Why not? It'll save gas.

516
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,531
It's uncomfortable sharing a car.

517
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:14,579
Director Park's looking for a new lead
for his next project.

518
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:15,663
So what?

519
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:17,624
Let's do it.

520
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:20,668
You made a strong comeback
with him last time.

521
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,420
The divorce got buried too.

522
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:26,382
Ms. Go,
didn't we already sign for <i>Love in White</i>?

523
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:28,927
You don't even have
much screen time in that.

524
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,637
Just shoot all your scenes at once.

525
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,847
You'll be credited
as a special appearance.

526
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,391
I want to focus on being Junghwa.

527
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:38,686
You're not the kind of actress
who can't handle two roles.

528
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,107
Don't drink when you get there.

529
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,360
You want me to tough it out sober?

530
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,071
The hospital called.
They said meds alone won't help.

531
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,159
Yes, Mr. Kim?

532
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:56,287
Ms. Go and Seoyoung just went in.

533
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:57,747
The timing's perfect, then.

534
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,957
I'll be there to get her.

535
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,625
How is she feeling?

536
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,835
Uh… What are the vibes there?

537
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:04,504
I don't think it'll take long.

538
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,923
She said she's not even drinking.

539
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:27,151
I think she might drink a little.

540
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,404
Here is this week's status.

541
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,864
The bookstore will likely
be completed this week.

542
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:33,533
HAVE YOU EATEN

543
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:34,951
The sea breeze gave us a hard time,

544
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,412
but we expect
to finish construction this week.

545
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,001
Mr. Lee.

546
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:48,339
You seem tired, Mr. Lee.
Shall we wrap up for today?

547
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:52,051
We have a lot of scenes
tracking the leads' eyes,

548
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:54,012
so the DP may have a tough time.

549
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,097
Since it's not a set,

550
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,391
I'll need to check
the locations in person.

551
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:00,435
I'll add that to the scouting schedule.

552
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:06,315
Are we running a bit short on time?

553
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:09,694
Well, I expected this and prepped ahead.

554
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,238
If you can just confirm
the remaining locations,

555
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,489
we'll have enough time.

556
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,783
Gosh. Sorry, I'm late.

557
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,285
- Hello.
- Welcome.

558
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,703
What kept you so long?

559
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,165
Got stuck listening
to <i>Terms of Jealousy</i>'s producer vent.

560
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,250
Isn't that coming out soon?

561
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,002
It's chaos over there.

562
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,378
What? Why?

563
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:28,588
There was a scandal.

564
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,798
The director and the lead.

565
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:36,054
Didn't Director Jungin spend six months
in auditions and cast a rookie?

566
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:38,514
Is dating that big a deal?

567
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:40,016
Happens all the time.

568
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,769
Yeah, if they're dating quietly.

569
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,105
But he was two-timing…

570
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,775
both of the female leads.

571
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,450
HAVE YOU EATEN ANYTHING?

572
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,079
<i>The call cannot be connected</i>

573
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:02,580
<i>and will be forwarded to voicemail--</i>

574
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:03,664
LEE DAEUM

575
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:14,175
What?

576
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:17,637
You've been staring. Got something to say?

577
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,348
Bit rude, aren't you?

578
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:22,266
I'll go if it's nothing.

579
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:25,103
That kind of mess can't happen on our set,

580
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:26,687
and obviously won't, right?

581
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:30,024
What kind of mess?

582
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:32,360
A disaster caused by one stupid decision.

583
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,781
That's not happening on my set, okay?

584
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:39,200
It won't.

585
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,910
Don't waste your energy worrying.

586
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,872
There's no fixing it
if we end up like <i>Terms of Jealousy</i>.

587
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:46,082
Okay?

588
00:43:57,844 --> 00:44:01,389
At this point, Seoyoung is practically
your muse, isn't she?

589
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,682
Of course, she is.

590
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:05,560
Sorry.

591
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,978
I'm just thirsty.

592
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,151
This is strong stuff.

593
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:17,613
Hey, I like the vibes today.

594
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:20,116
You're very gutsy, Seoyoung.
That's why I like you.

595
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,702
The script's solid,
and the character is fantastic.

596
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,662
And it's Director Park's film, after all.

597
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,289
Seoyoung has to do it.

598
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:29,292
Since you like gutsy, I'll show you gutsy.

599
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:32,545
I'm the one who's acting.

600
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:37,341
Not Ms. Go, not the director,
not the producer, but me.

601
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:42,847
I haven't even seen the script,

602
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,141
but I'm supposed to step in
for an actress who bailed

603
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,977
because the director was a nightmare?
It makes no sense.

604
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,689
Odds are he'll act the same
toward me. Right?

605
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,608
That's enough.

606
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,486
I come first.

607
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:00,990
My feelings come first.

608
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,460
Do you have anything else to say to me?

609
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,172
Then say it behind my back.

610
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,183
One moment, Mr. Park.

611
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:34,273
You're nuts.

612
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:36,776
If I'm nuts,

613
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:39,028
then you're just heartless.

614
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,112
Know your place.

615
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:42,365
You're a divorcée
about to hit your mid-30s.

616
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,659
You want to throw away the lead?

617
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:45,910
Go back and apologize.

618
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:47,954
Divorcée?

619
00:45:49,622 --> 00:45:51,999
A 30-something desperate for a lead role?

620
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:57,380
So that's how the person
I thought knew me best sees me.

621
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,756
You want to hit rock bottom?

622
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,675
Director Park…

623
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,844
always rewrites scenes last minute
just to get actresses naked.

624
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,221
Don't you know that?

625
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,640
I'm still on meds because of that.

626
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,809
And you want me to work with him again?

627
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,228
Isn't that too cruel? I'm human too!

628
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,854
Just focus on the results.

629
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:16,232
- Don't think about--
- How can I not think about that?

630
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,067
I feel like I'm about to explode--

631
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:27,326
Do you think
I enjoy sucking up to those pricks?

632
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,120
Go back in there.

633
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,414
Go back and apologize.

634
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:36,419
This is why I came here.

635
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:39,797
To make sure Director Park
never asks for me again.

636
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:41,757
And that blasted lead?

637
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:46,220
Find someone else
who'll do whatever you say.

638
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,540
Stop that, it hurts.

639
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:17,043
You drank a lot, huh?

640
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,046
I wasn't planning to,

641
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:21,714
but I did a bit.

642
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:24,842
I didn't want to,

643
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,803
but I had to do it, like it or not.

644
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:31,932
Let's go to the car first.

645
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,394
I…

646
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,066
I burned my bridges with Ms. Go today.

647
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:45,154
I have no idea what kind of crap
I'll have to deal with now.

648
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,281
Stop. Let's just go.

649
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,034
I was awesome back in there.

650
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:51,994
Don't you want to know?

651
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:55,623
I'd rather know if you need
to throw up or pass out.

652
00:47:58,084 --> 00:47:59,126
I'll just go.

653
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,138
Get me everything on Lee Daeum.

654
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:13,682
Hire a private eye, get a reporter on her,
I don't care.

655
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:16,936
Get any information on her
so we can get her to join us.

656
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:26,904
LEE DAEUM

657
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:30,157
Why aren't you answering?

658
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,713
What are you doing?

659
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,258
Welcome back.

660
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:49,677
Are you going to keep breaking promises?

661
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:53,973
I only broke half the promise.

662
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,100
I didn't touch anything.

663
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:58,853
I just wiped off the dust.
You know how hard that was?

664
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:07,862
Did anyone ask you to clean?

665
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:11,282
And why didn't you pick up your phone?
I was worried.

666
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,369
Must've missed it while I was cleaning.

667
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:17,621
Should I mess it all up again, then?

668
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:20,749
A patient breathing in dust sounds great.

669
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:23,711
You're only a patient when it suits you.

670
00:49:27,548 --> 00:49:28,549
TIME TO EAT

671
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:29,842
I have to eat.

672
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:30,968
What did you have for lunch?

673
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:33,137
I ate at Grandma's Table.
It was delicious.

674
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,055
Hmm.

675
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:38,309
Good to hear.
Hand me your phone, unlocked.

676
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:46,775
ALARM

677
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:53,574
What are you doing?

678
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,076
7:00 A.M.

679
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,579
I need to know this too.

680
00:49:58,662 --> 00:49:59,997
Just double-checking.

681
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,795
ALARM

682
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,089
Here you go.

683
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,091
Let's go eat.

684
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:12,885
Ah.

685
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:15,471
Are you okay with Grandma's Table again?

686
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,640
Yes, I can eat there
every day of the week.

687
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:18,933
Even a month.

688
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,606
GRANDMA'S TABLE

689
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,950
Go back to your friend's after we eat.

690
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,117
I guess I should.

691
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,120
Dig in.

692
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,170
Can I stay?

693
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:51,257
No.

694
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:54,093
Okay.

695
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,224
I'm heading to Gangwon-do
after I drop you off.

696
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:03,519
Are you going on a trip?

697
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:04,853
A trip? I wish.

698
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,606
It's for location scouting.

699
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:11,277
Can't you take me too?

700
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:13,612
Why?

701
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:15,447
Gyuwon lives in Gangwon-do.

702
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:17,366
I want to get to know her better.

703
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,663
You'll take me, right?

704
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:26,166
No.

705
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:31,797
I figured you'd say no.

706
00:51:32,381 --> 00:51:34,341
Man, I'm getting shut down a lot today.

707
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:40,139
Because you keep asking for things
I have to shut down.

708
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:43,601
Daeum, let me ask you again.

709
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:48,272
If you want to do this movie,
can you be a bit smarter about it?

710
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:52,359
Have you forgotten what you are?

711
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,698
You're not just an ordinary actress.

712
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:01,952
Don't you forget that.

713

Cut! Okay, that's good.

718
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:55,464
"Going without food may cause seizures."

719
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,550
<i>That again. What is it?</i>

720
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:00,886
What's it for? Why set one just to eat?

721
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:04,765
The thing is, my body can't
absorb nutrients like most people's,

722
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:07,768
<i>so I need to eat a lot, often,</i>
<i>and at regular times</i>

723
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,561
<i>to get more nutrients.</i>

724
00:53:09,645 --> 00:53:11,563
If I go too long without food,

725
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:13,399
I could go into shock,

726
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:15,818
or if it's bad enough, I could die.

727
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:27,454
HYLENOL

728
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:50,602
Yes, here it is!

729
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,312
Looks great.

730
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,747
RESTRICTED AREA

731
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,669
<i>When you're in the hospital long enough,</i>

732
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,005
<i>there are days that feel unbearable.</i>

733
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:21,008
This is just a glass window,

734
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:24,178
but life could be so different beyond it.

735
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,781
Filming from in here would be nice.

736
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:46,950
What do you think?

737
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:48,952
- I like it.
- Got it.

738
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:52,831
Sir, the director would like to film
from inside here.

739
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:54,541
You're not allowed in that area.

740
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:56,627
Mr. Lee.

741
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,588
He says we can't
because that's a restricted area.

742
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:05,928
Not here, then.

743
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:20,609
Mr. Lee,

744
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:22,152
did you put your phone on silent?

745
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,198
YU HONG: COULD YOU CALL ME,
MR. LEE? - MISSED CALLS

746
00:55:26,782 --> 00:55:28,033
My alarms kept going off.

747
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:30,494
Please turn it on and pick up my calls.

748
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:32,538
The key to the bookstore.

749
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:35,165
We're going out for a drink,

750
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:36,792
but I'm guessing you can't go?

751
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,210
I have some work to do.

752
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:40,128
Need to check out the bookstore too.

753
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:42,005
It's nighttime. Can't you go tomorrow?

754
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:44,258
We film at night too.

755
00:55:45,384 --> 00:55:48,595
Hmm? I'll go look on my own.

756
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,556
Go on, but don't drink too much.

757
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:51,807
BOOK

758
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:09,283
Welcome! This is Lee Gyuwon's bookstore.

759
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,244
Is there a book you're looking for?

760
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,413
Ms. Lee Daeum.

761
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:16,623
What are you doing here?

762
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:20,794
How did you get here?

763
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,504
I got here by car.

764
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:30,679
- Mmm!
- I thought you were Mr. Lee's friend.

765
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,472
Are you sure you can abandon him
and be here?

766
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,933
He'll manage on his own.

767
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:42,858
Do you like somaek?

768
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,276
Of course I do.

769
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,030
This is called Gen MZ's somaek.

770
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:53,744
- Here. Let's have a glass.
- Sure.

771
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:57,414
Why are you here, though?

772
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,459
Actors don't usually come
for location scouting.

773
00:57:01,043 --> 00:57:02,044
Well,

774
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,671
the shoot's coming up soon,

775
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:07,466
and I heard
checking out the location in advance

776
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:09,509
helps actors get into character.

777
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:15,807
Says who?

778
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:18,977
Well, I brought all my meds.

779
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:22,105
I stopped by the hospital
to get my checkup results

780
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:24,024
and got the all-clear from my doctor.

781
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:28,779
It's not like I'm running a marathon
or doing anything strenuous here.

782
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:32,866
I even stuck on a bunch of heat packs
so I wouldn't catch a cold.

783
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,284
So if I still get sick?

784
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:36,536
Then I don't deserve to be in this film.

785
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:40,374
At least you came prepared.

786
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:46,088
I really wanted to come here
at least once before the shoot.

787
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:53,011
Gyuwon's lived her whole life
in this neighborhood, right?

788
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:56,348
Mmm.

789
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:59,559
I thought seeing her bookstore in person

790
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:03,105
would help me understand
her loneliness and her sense of isolation.

791
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:09,027
I thought I'd be able
to feel these things better.

792
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:11,780
For Gyuwon, the bookstore.

793
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,407
For me, the hospital.

794
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,909
For Gyuwon, there's Hyunsang.

795
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,327
For me…

796
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:27,254
Gyuwon and I are very much alike.

797
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:30,882
The overwhelming loneliness I felt…

798
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,219
and the sudden ray of hope
that came to me.

799
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:59,369
I'm not sure if it would be right for me
to call that love,

800
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,748
so I came here to find answers.

801
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:05,417
Since you keep telling me it's not.

802
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:09,838
Since you came all this way,

803
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,257
do you want to go inside?

804
00:59:14,593 --> 00:59:17,596
LEE GYUWON BOOKSTORE

805
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:19,723
<i>Hmm.</i>

806
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:21,641
Hmm?

807
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:24,144
So Mr. Lee's the one who said that.

808
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:26,062
Exactly.

809
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:29,775
I didn't even ask,
and he kept ranting on and on.

810
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:32,944
As a manager,

811
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:34,613
if something helps my actress,

812
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:36,490
it's not like

813
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,658
I can't come here, you know?

814
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:47,042
Oh.

815
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:50,212
But I'm glad I came.

816
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:52,214
I got to see you.

817
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:01,139
I need a smoke.

818
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,016
- I have one.
- Where's the restroom?

819
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:08,647
Just drink this!

820
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,106
Oh? Okay.

821
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:17,864
What the…

822
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:30,335
It's so dark in here.

823
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:32,671
Uh, wait here for a minute.

824
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:42,347
LEE GYUWON BOOKSTORE

825
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:48,854
The art team did a great job.

826
01:00:56,695 --> 01:00:57,904
It's beautiful.

827
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:01,908
Mmm.

828
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:05,912
I'm jealous of Gyuwon.

829
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:09,124
No, wait. I'm not, since I am Gyuwon.

830
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:12,961
Take a seat.

831
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:21,011
It's funny, isn't it?

832
01:01:21,553 --> 01:01:24,014
I don't think you told my manager,

833
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:27,684
so how did he know to bring me here?

834
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:31,354
Are you warm?

835
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:33,273
I'm just fine.

836
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:35,650
I'm a bit cold.

837
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:45,118
Sometimes,
people say one thing and do another.

838
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:47,329
So what do you think?

839
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:51,416
Do you feel something,
seeing where Gyuwon lives?

840
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:52,959
Hmm…

841
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:20,695
EVERY CELL IN YOUR BODY KNOWS.
THAT IT'S LOVE.

842
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:23,365
What's with this sappy melodrama?

843
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:26,201
It came to me
while I was reading the script.

844
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:30,538
And…

845
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,874
I haven't been able to shake it.

846
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:39,339
The scene where Hyunsang kisses Gyuwon.

847
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,509
Can't Gyuwon kiss him first instead?

848
01:02:43,218 --> 01:02:44,469
Why?

849
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:46,179
I realized, now that I've tried it,

850
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:50,016
that Gyuwon and Hyunsang
wouldn't just kiss on a whim.

851
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:52,310
They kiss because they know.

852
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,354
Because they know?

853
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:58,191
Their feelings are just impulsive
at that point.

854
01:02:58,274 --> 01:02:59,693
It's only a week since they've met.

855
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:00,860
It's not love.

856
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:04,364
But Gyuwon wants him to know.

857
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:07,784
She's telling this man,

858
01:03:08,368 --> 01:03:10,537
who doesn't believe in love or hope

859
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,248
and thinks they're just useless…

860
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:18,003
"Look.

861
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:19,629
Don't you feel it too?

862
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:22,382
It's already begun."

863
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:33,143
One week is…

864
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,728
I CAN GET HEALTHY IN A WEEK TOO

865
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,771
…more than enough time to fall in love.

866
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:40,692
One week…

867
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:47,032
is more than enough time

868
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,035
to destroy love as well.

869
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:13,224
Actually…

870
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,936
I have one more secret.

871
01:04:19,147 --> 01:04:20,315
A secret?

872
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:22,650
The first time I met you

873
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,445
wasn't at the hospital.

874
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:29,115
I know. It was at the convenience store.

875
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:31,367
We saw each other.

876
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:35,163
It was way before that.

877
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:41,252
Five years ago,

878
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:45,840
I passed the first round of auditions
for your movie,

879
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:48,426
<i>The Lonely People</i>.

880
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:50,845
The one Seoyoung got.

881
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:56,810
You probably don't remember me,

882
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,561
since there were so many people.

883
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:01,064
I didn't even make the second round.

884
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:04,192
But I still remembered…

885
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:06,194
your name,

886
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,948
Lee Jeha.

887
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:15,286
So,

888
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:17,747
when I saw your name on the proposal

889
01:05:18,248 --> 01:05:20,291
on Dr. Minseok's desk,

890
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:23,378
my heart started pounding.

891
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:26,381
So I planned it all.

892
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:29,717
I deliberately came looking for you.

893
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:34,305
I don't even know where I got the courage.

894
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:38,059
Funny, right?

895
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:39,144
Me, of all people?

896
01:05:39,853 --> 01:05:40,854
What was I planning?

897
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:43,731
When I can't even do anything…

898
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:45,984
When I'm going to die soon…

899
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:01,541
Who says you can't do anything?

900
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:08,381
I told you,
you're someone who can do everything.

901
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:19,142
It's a pretty lame secret.

902
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:24,647
Do you want me
to tell you a bigger one, then?

903
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:39,204
Is it weird if someone like me…

904
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,044
likes someone like you?

905
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:59,724
LEE GYUWON BOOKSTORE

906
01:07:26,793 --> 01:07:28,586
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN BORN THE SEA

907
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:31,172
MOONLIGHT RIPPLES ENDLESSLY
ACROSS THE OCEAN'S SURFACE

908
01:07:31,256 --> 01:07:33,716
IS IT THE NIGHT, THE TIDE,
MY HEART? I KEEP WAVERING.

909
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,469
LIKE TODAY, IF EVERY DAY WERE
FILLED WITH ONLY WHAT I LOVE

910
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:38,721
WITH THINGS LIKE YOU,
THE MOONLIGHT, AND THE SEA

911
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:40,640
- EVERY SEASON
A FAREWELL NOTE.

912
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:04,247
<i>There's something</i>
<i>going on between Mr. Lee and Daeum, right?</i>

913
01:08:04,956 --> 01:08:07,959
<i>Is it you that likes her,</i>
<i>or her that likes you?</i>

914
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:11,379
I'm very interested in Daeum,

915
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:12,797
so I wanted some information.

916
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,048
<i>What are you doing?</i>

917
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:16,634
Why drop an article like that
out of nowhere?

918
01:08:16,718 --> 01:08:18,594
Has your face always been this pale?

919
01:08:20,138 --> 01:08:22,098
This hospital is actually…

920
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:28,855
I'll personally make sure

921
01:08:30,398 --> 01:08:31,899
Daeum is pulled from the film.

922
01:08:32,859 --> 01:08:33,860
Then what about your film?

923
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,571
Isn't the movie
what's most important to you?

924
01:08:37,405 --> 01:08:39,574
Yes. Even if I have to give up this movie…

925
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:45,121
I'll return Daeum to this hospital.
