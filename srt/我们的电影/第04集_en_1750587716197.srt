00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,950
OUR MOVIE

2
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,200
ANY RESEMBLANCE
TO ACTUAL PEOPLE, PLACES,

3
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,450
OR MEDICAL CONDITIONS
IS COINCIDENTAL.

4
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:04,700
CHILD ACTORS WERE
ALWAYS SUPERVISED

5
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:05,950
AND SAFELY FILMED
UNDER GUIDELINES.

6
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,170
Jeez, tell me about it.

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,800
Sir, I think you should speak to her.

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,010
How's it looking? Is she okay?

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,840
No, she's going all like this.

10
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,880
Let's keep it calm.

11
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,550
You say "cut" when I cry,

12
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,550
when I smile, when I look blank,
when I look nervous. You keep saying no.

13
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,560
Why don't you just say what you want?

14
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:13,900
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,980
For six months,
I've been getting love letters

16
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,480
from the guy
who's been cleaning this place.

17
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,650
I've never even seen his face,
but now I'm in love with him?

18
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,320
How am I supposed to believe that?

19
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,620
That's just totally creepy!

20
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,160
How am I supposed to act like I'm in love?

21
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:32,790
You're right.

22
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,630
That's true.
A person wouldn't fall in love like that

23
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,590
when you've never seen him.

24
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,300
What kind of…

25
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,720
What kind of director says that?

26
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,650
This is a secret, but I'm making this film
because I don't really know.

27
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,820
Don't know what?

28
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,780
What it's like to love someone.

29
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,080
Let's go.

30
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,960
I'm ready now.

31
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,890
I think I understand the feeling.

32
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,640
EMMA

33
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:31,120
EPISODE 4

34
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,250
Jungwoo's running a bit late.

35
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:36,960
So is Daeum.

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,080
Ms. Go's already making moves.

37
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,380
She pulled Daeum for a chat.

38
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,840
Probably about signing her.

39
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,470
Who wouldn't want a star rookie like that?

40
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Daeum doesn't need representation.

41
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,970
How could a rookie
not need representation?

42
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,560
If I wanted an agency involved,

43
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,230
I wouldn't have cast a rookie.

44
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,980
But this isn't going to be her last film.

45
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,570
An agency like ours
could really help her take off.

46
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,780
Don't you want to know how I've been?

47
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,240
It's all shoptalk with you.

48
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,540
I hoped you were doing well.

49
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,500
That's it?

50
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,590
Yes, that's it.

51
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,590
That kind of hurts.

52
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,340
Yes, I actually feel hurt.

53
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,550
I guess I can still feel hurt
when it comes to you.

54
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,810
We're not in a place where
we tell each other everything anymore.

55
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,770
I was hoping you'd ask me

56
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,320
how my marriage was,

57
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,610
after the way we ended.

58
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,780
But all you can say is
you hoped I was well?

59
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,280
You're like a grease stain

60
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,330
that I can't scrub off
from the bottom of my heart.

61
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,250
Let's talk later.

62
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What about you?

63
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,100
Am I still at the bottom of your heart?

64
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,230
What are you doing?

65
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,150
I found many great replacements,
but they're never enough.

66
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,660
I had to know if going back
to the original would finally satisfy me.

67
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,710
Let's just focus on our movie.

68
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,590
That's all there is between us now.

69
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,440
<i>Doors are opening.</i>

70
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,710
Excuse me. You're Lee Daeum, right?

71
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,010
Hello, Mr. Kim.

72
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,670
Nice to meet you.

73
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,760
Yes.

74
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,930
Where are you heading?
We have matters to attend to.

75
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,010
Ah.

76
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Let's go upstairs.

77
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,310
<i>Doors are opening.</i>

78
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,280
Ah.

79
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,080
I see you've come together.

80
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,660
Hello, Ms. Chae.

81
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,990
<i>Doors are closing.</i>

82
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,460
Mr. Lee said something came up.

83
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,420
Sorry, but we'll have to do this
another time.

84
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,630
Why are you apologizing
when he's the one who left?

85
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,260
Daeum?

86
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,640
Yes, another time.

87
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,840
Yes, another time.

88
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,810
We'll talk later too, Jungwoo.

89
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,850
Take care.

90
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,780
Mr. Lee? This is Daeum.

91
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,990
I have something to tell you.

92
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,870
<i>I'll come to you.</i>

93
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,830
Mr. Lee.

94
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,960
- Hello.
- Hello.

95
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,380
What did you want to talk about?

96
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,800
Sorry about canceling last minute.

97
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,510
Something just… came up.

98
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,600
Something important enough
to blow off three people?

99
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,310
I had an important meeting here.

100
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,690
Oh.

101
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,770
I see.

102
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,530
So, what did you want to talk about?

103
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,740
Oh.

104
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,740
TIME TO EAT

105
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,370
I'm hungry. How about we eat first?

106
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,460
That again. What is it?

107
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,630
- Pardon?
- That alarm. What's it for?

108
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,420
Why set one just to eat?
It's not like it's meds.

109
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,510
Food is just as important as meds for me.

110
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,130
Uh…

111
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,350
To put it simply,
I heard that if I skip a meal,

112
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,060
I could die.

113
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,730
What does that mean?

114
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,560
The thing is…

115
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,070
my body can't absorb nutrients
like most people's,

116
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:00,450
so I need to eat a lot, often,
and at regular times

117
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,030
to get more nutrients.

118
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,950
If I go too long without food,
I could go into shock,

119
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,410
or if it's bad enough, I could die.

120
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,120
Can you get us something to eat, Junbyung?

121
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,790
Okay.

122
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,170
KIM JUNGWOO

123
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,920
MISSED CALL: KIM JUNGWOO
MISSED CALL: KIM JUNGWOO

124
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,140
Why are we at the playground?

125
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,200
I don't think that'll help your digestion.

126
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,570
Hmm?

127
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,040
Something you want to say?

128
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,880
Well…

129
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:02,010
I really hope you don't get angry
with what I'm about to say,

130
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,850
but it was my fault, so I totally
understand if you do.

131
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,010
It's okay, just tell me.

132
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,150
I went to Seoyoung's rehearsal studio
and had a seizure,

133
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,490
so she kept people from seeing me

134
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,370
and took me to the hospital.

135
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,530
I'm sorry!

136
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,040
Seizure? You had a seizure?

137
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,500
- Yes.
- Are you all right now?

138
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,580
Look at me.

139
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,800
You seem all right.

140
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:54,560
Of course, I am!
That's why I went through the test shoot…

141
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,820
and all, yes.

142
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,320
As long as you're okay.

143
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,910
What?

144
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,250
Are you surprised I didn't yell at you?

145
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,580
Feeling relieved now?

146
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:22,630
You just broke the first clause
of our confidentiality agreement.

147
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:28,180
Actually, Seoyoung doesn't know
what my condition is or how serious it is.

148
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,350
So I didn't exactly break the rule…

149
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,850
I'm really sorry.

150
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,150
Thanks for being honest with me.

151
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,980
You should always ask for help
in that kind of situation.

152
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,950
It's actually a good thing
Seoyoung was there.

153
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,330
Mr. Lee.

154
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,050
You launched Seoyoung's career, right?

155
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,970
What was she like back then?

156
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Well…

157
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,440
She's a great actress who taught me
something I didn't know very well.

158
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,020
Mmm.

159
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,900
Then, what kind of person
is Seoyoung to you?

160
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,870
To a director, it doesn't matter
what kind of person an actor is.

161
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,330
But you're working together.
How can that not matter?

162
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,500
I mean, who they are as an actor matters
more than who they are as a person.

163
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,340
You make things sound so complicated.

164
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,180
To me, though,

165
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,850
you're a good person.

166
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,770
I'm not sure about that.

167
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,940
I'm very good at reading people.

168
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:09,780
Trust me.

169
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,950
Her name is Lee Daeum.
It's still under embargo.

170
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,740
We get promo material
for a rookie actress,

171
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,790
and you get Chae Seoyoung and Kim Jungwoo.

172
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,790
You can't deny that's an amazing deal.

173
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,840
Okay. I'll call you back.

174
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,880
Why'd you bail on the actor meeting
and double my workload?

175
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,010
I told you, something came up.

176
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,510
What's up with you?

177
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,680
LOVE IN WHITE
PHOTO SHOOT & INTERVIEW PLAN

178
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:39,770
A photo shoot.

179
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,060
With the three leads.

180
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,230
Isn't this too soon?
They've barely even met.

181
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,700
We can do it after we wrap up filming.

182
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,820
We've got to get things done while we can.

183
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:00,660
Who knows how much time we'll have
after the movie's done?

184
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:07,340
Even getting ready for the table read
is a lot for Daeum right now.

185
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,840
Everything's new to her.

186
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,130
She's new for the audience, too, huh?

187
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,130
Don't you think
we should introduce her first?

188
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,720
Otherwise, who's going to care?

189
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,600
We can't do that.

190
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,770
Take her off all non-filming engagements.

191
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:25,980
Director Lee.

192
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,650
You forget I'm not exactly someone
who needs permission for this.

193
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,780
In that case…

194
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,240
could you push the schedule a little, sir?

195
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,990
The reason being?

196
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,870
Well…

197
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:48,080
You know, to work the mystery angle.

198
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,630
Build intrigue.

199
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,500
You said it yourself,
she's new to the audience.

200
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,130
Keep her hidden for a bit longer.

201
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,680
We make people curious about who she is

202
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,430
then make a bombshell reveal
for a bigger impact.

203
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:04,930
Go on.

204
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,900
Let's not kill the hype now.

205
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,900
We wait and drop a beautiful photo shoot

206
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,110
at the perfect moment.

207
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,450
Bam.

208
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,290
Then, the crowd will go…

209
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,910
Bam. They'll erupt.

210
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,370
Hmm. You might be onto something.

211
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,080
How about we add to that?

212
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:32,500
A photo shoot with all three leads
plus the director.

213
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:36,050
And I decide when it'll be
the perfect time for that.

214
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,590
Why me?

215
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,850
I hate to say it,

216
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,100
but you're good-looking.

217
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,600
Or we can just shoot it tomorrow.

218
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,060
No, no. I think it's a fine idea.

219
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:58,400
So we roll with the mystery angle
for Lee Daeum starting tomorrow.

220
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,450
Okay.

221
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,530
I'm off.

222
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,880
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

223
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,750
- Take care.
- Thanks.

224
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,390
Oh, I like this headline.

225
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,010
- The one below that too.
- Okay.

226
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,100
We should plaster
some question marks there.

227
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,060
You know how people
read quickly on their phones nowadays?

228
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,770
How could they write something like this?

229
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,110
Why? It's not like they're wrong.

230
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,610
The headline's pretty good.

231
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,030
Aren't you angry?

232
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,530
It's not worth getting angry over.

233
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,330
Daeum's going to be the lead
instead of Chae Seoyoung.

234
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,490
She's the lead! The lead!

235
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,160
She's supposed to keep a low profile
so her face stays hidden.

236
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,250
Okay.

237
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:55,040
Hey, you can't post
Daeum's photos online, okay?

238
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,460
ROOKIE SENSATION LEE DAEUM
OUSTS CHAE SEOYOUNG

239
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:04,510
Jeez, this is a huge honor for our family.

240
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,680
I'm not from this family, though.

241
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,560
ROOKIE SENSATION LEE DAEUM
OUSTS CHAE SEOYOUNG

242
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,000
Overly experimental.

243
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,460
Who asked you for a review?

244
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,090
Why are you always trying
to invent new dishes?

245
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,680
Because this is my restaurant,

246
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,720
and I'm the chef?

247
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,180
What's with the weird look?

248
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,100
You know…

249
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,230
Are you…

250
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,780
No, never mind.
You've got your life together now.

251
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,280
Actually,
I haven't sorted out my life yet.

252
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,490
Why? What is it?

253
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,580
Let me ask you a favor.

254
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,710
You're asking me for a favor?

255
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,090
Your patient is here.

256
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,400
Dad.

257
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,910
Dad?

258
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,040
Dad, do you know what a table read is?

259
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,500
It's like rehearsing.

260
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:03,590
It's when everyone in the movie meets up
to read through the script, act together,

261
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:06,970
and look into each other's eyes
like this. See?

262
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,640
Something like that.

263
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,470
And it just so happens to be tomorrow!

264
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,940
So now I'm all jittery and excited
and everything.

265
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,690
I'm seriously freaking out.

266
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,520
So are you happy now?

267
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,110
Yes.

268
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,440
So happy I could die.

269
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,410
Sorry.

270
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,580
So you know you should be sorry.

271
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,840
- I know.
- If you do know,

272
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,970
then how could you be so reckless?

273
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,550
I'm scared, too,

274
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,390
that I'll have another seizure

275
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,350
in a room full of people
who are there to watch me.

276
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,600
That I'll ruin everything
and lose myself in the process.

277
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,110
You listen to me.
I'm not letting you end up like that.

278
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,940
Do you understand?

279
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,450
- If you won't stop on your own--
- Dad…

280
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,870
You're taking your life way too lightly!

281
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:16,660
What kind of father would stand by
while his daughter walks off a cliff?

282
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,000
Daeum.

283
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,590
Daeum.

284
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,720
The clinical trial
we're preparing right now

285
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,970
is worth getting our hopes up.

286
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,440
So if you can just
hang on a little longer…

287
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,480
Is that really for me, though?

288
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,280
- Daeum.
- Yeah?

289
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,110
What if I hang on and on and on,

290
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,660
but it fails like everything else before?

291
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,660
You know this.

292
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,540
Dad…

293
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,210
I'm dying.

294
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,380
But you keep denying that.

295
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,600
Do you know how scared and hurt I feel
every time you do?

296
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,740
Let's just do a full checkup first, okay?

297
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:41,910
Okay.

298
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,070
Just as you're running out of time,

299
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,870
so is your dad. You know that, right?

300
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,500
Doc,

301
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:27,330
I asked you to smile
when you say stuff like that.

302
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,390
Right. So, the shoot will be
about three months long?

303
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,180
Yes.

304
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,220
I'm upping your dose.

305
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,730
You might feel a bit more foggy,

306
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,520
but it'll help you
function better out there.

307
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:48,980
Foggy?

308
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,780
That's not good.

309
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,070
But seriously, how does a kid like you

310
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,620
end up with the lead role, just like that?

311
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,790
You'll have to watch your own movie
in a theater, no?

312
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,960
Whether it's a year

313
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,130
or a month from now…

314
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:17,220
hang in there and try to live
no matter what.

315
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,430
I'll think of other plans, too.

316
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,520
Thank you, Doc.

317
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,320
BU SEUNGWON

318
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,950
YOU WERE RIGHT

319
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,410
THAT OLD-SCHOOL MYSTERY ANGLE
TOTALLY STIRRED THINGS UP

320
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,960
PEOPLE ARE DYING
TO FIND OUT WHO SHE IS

321
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,210
WHO IS LEE DAEUM?
THE BIRTH OF A ROOKIE

322
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,960
THE ENTRANCE OF A ROOKIE
WHO OUTSHONE CHAE SEOYOUNG

323
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:03,720
A table read means
all the actors and crew will be there.

324
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,430
My baby's got to steal the show.

325
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,390
- Can't I just do it?
- No way!

326
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,310
Oh, I love it.

327
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,940
- Good!
- Good!

328
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,480
Ta-da!

329
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,820
The finishing touch is the most important.

330
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,870
- Isn't this cute?
- It's so adorable!

331
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,000
- It's not sticky, right?
- No.

332
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,460
It feels super smooth.

333
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,040
Give me that.

334
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,250
Keep reapplying it.

335
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:35,130
You need to do it regularly
to really block UV rays.

336
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,510
- Can I take this with me?
- Of course, you can!

337
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,720
Hooray!

338
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,260
Now, hold still while I do your eyebrows.

339
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,010
Wait, I have a question.

340
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,720
Yes, ask away, milady.

341
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:50,060
Remember in high school
when you kissed someone on the roof here?

342
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,270
Keep it down! My mom can hear us!

343
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,440
You're busted!

344
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,230
She's kidding!

345
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,530
It wasn't even a kiss, okay?
It was like lips bumping.

346
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:04,320
Whatever, your lips touched.
A kiss is still a kiss.

347
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,910
What's your deal? So what?

348
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:10,210
Did you do it because you wanted to?

349
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:14,420
Or did you just do it without knowing
what was going on?

350
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:17,670
So there's no guy,
but you want to kiss someone?

351
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:23,680
Or wait, maybe you're feeling curious
because there is someone?

352
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,760
Is that it, huh?

353
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:28,100
- You got a guy you want to kiss?
- No, it's not like that!

354
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,440
There's a kiss scene
in the script, that's all.

355
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,270
You don't even know
what you're talking about.

356
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:37,020
Your first kiss
is going to be for a movie?

357
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:42,530
Is there something you can do before that?

358
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,820
- See you later!
- Okay!

359
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,280
Feels like I'm sending a baby
out into the world.

360
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,870
Oh.

361
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,660
Hello? This is Lee Daeum.

362
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,330
Hi, I've sent a gift over to your place.

363
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,000
A gift?

364
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,210
What did you send me?

365
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,550
<i>Yes, it's him.</i>

366
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:03,800
He'll be working as your manager
until the movie's released.

367
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,140
Let him drive you from now on.
And today, of course.

368
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,310
See you later.

369
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,100
Hello.

370
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,480
So you're my gift?

371
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,150
Yes, I'm Lim Junbyung.
And I'm your gift personified.

372
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,740
What about your restaurant?

373
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,780
I'm on a kind of sabbatical.

374
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,870
I wanted to take on a new challenge.

375
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:27,950
Please, get in.

376
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,740
You can't be late for your first read.

377
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,210
Take care out there!

378
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,840
If you're thirsty,
please open the cooler next to you.

379
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,220
Ah…

380
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,340
I didn't know what you'd like,
so I brought everything, ma'am.

381
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,680
You don't have to be so formal with me.

382
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,680
Everything feels uncomfortable right now,

383
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,100
so if you could at least
talk to me casually,

384
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,440
I think I'd feel better.

385
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,610
Well, we can't have our superstar
feeling uncomfortable.

386
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:05,900
I wanted to ask.

387
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:10,740
Is it normal for a director
to go out of his way like this

388
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,200
for an actress that
doesn't even have a manager?

389
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:16,250
I'm not sure. This is my first time too,

390
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,670
and Jeha's the only director I know.

391
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,920
Man, why am I so nervous?

392
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,550
There's a calming pill in there.
Could you please pass me one?

393
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,880
I mean, can you get me one?

394
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,470
Oh, yes, of course.

395
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,600
- Here you go, sir.
- Great, thank you.

396
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:40,060
Jeha never asks for favors,
but he did this time, ma'am.

397
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,230
I mean, not ma'am.

398
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,530
So you're doing him a favor now?

399
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:49,410
It was always my dream
to be a movie star's manager.

400
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,660
A movie star?

401
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,580
I hate to break it to you,
but I'm not a movie star.

402
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,830
But to me, Ms. Daeum,

403
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,790
you're my first actress
and my first movie star.

404
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,990
LOVE IN WHITE
TABLE READ

405
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,200
LEE DAEUM, LEE JEHA

406
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:34,700
- Director.
- Hello.

407
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,660
Are we all going out to eat after this?

408
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,830
- Good morning.
- Hi.

409
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:47,380
- Hello, sir!
- Hello, sir!

410
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,550
How's the bookstore set looking?

411
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,840
- We've just started building it.
- Okay.

412
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:01,140
JUST EVEN BEING TOGETHER
MAKES ME HAPPY

413
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,110
Your seat's over there, Daeum.

414
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,610
There's a pencil case in here.

415
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:09,900
I saw a lot of actors taking notes
and highlighting stuff.

416
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:12,910
There's also water and some cough drops.

417
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,620
Hello, I'm Lim Junbyung,
Lee Daeum's manager.

418
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,700
Great to meet you.

419
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,160
Junbyung. Can we talk for a second?

420
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,710
Who told you to be a real manager?

421
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,050
What, you want me to be a fake one?

422
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:29,090
Yes, be a fake one.

423
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:32,930
I asked you to keep the press
and agencies away,

424
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:35,390
since everyone's curious
about this mysterious rookie,

425
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,890
not for you to be an actual manager.

426
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,310
Don't worry about that.

427
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,810
No one's laying a finger on her
as long as I'm there.

428
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,480
That's all?

429
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,440
Man, you really need to chill.

430
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,730
You've been a jerk since forever.

431
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,820
That's not what I meant.

432
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,780
- Hello.
- Hello.

433
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,200
- Hello.
- Hello.

434
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:01,660
I'm Lee Daeum, playing the role of Gyuwon.

435
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,000
So you're my daughter.

436
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,880
I look forward to working with you.

437
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,630
I look forward to working with you.

438
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,840
- Hello!
- Hello.

439
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,170
- Hello.
- Hello.

440
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,350
So it's really you.

441
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,690
It's been a while, Jaein.
Great to see you again.

442
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,400
You took a leave from school
and just disappeared.

443
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,360
Now you show up like this?

444
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,410
As the lead? Out of nowhere?

445
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,000
It's crazy, right?

446
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,750
I just got lucky.

447
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,290
- Hello.
- Hello.

448
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,000
Hello, Mr. Kim.

449
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:52,260
You look nice today, Daeum.

450
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,340
- Hi, Jaein.
- Hello.

451
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,510
We're counting on you, Seoyoung.

452
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,010
Who else can I count on?

453
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,720
Certainly not Lee Jeha
or a complete rookie.

454
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,060
- You should trust them.
- What?

455
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,440
I do respect
that you came all the way here

456
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,020
by not trusting anyone,

457
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,240
but how about you trust those two
for just this movie?

458
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,120
You should try being a producer sometime.

459
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,990
Then you'd understand.

460
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,080
I feel so alone.

461
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,410
Me too.

462
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,790
I feel so alone too.

463
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,630
Everyone's alone in this world.

464
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:37,430
"Hyunsang browses through the bookstore
then pulls out a book."

465
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,300
"Hello!

466
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,140
Is there a book you're looking for?"

467
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,650
Hyunsang is two steps in front of you,
not across the street.

468
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,200
I thought I had to speak up
so everyone in the room could hear me.

469
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,240
Okay, let's try again.

470
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,200
"Hello.
Is there a book you're looking for?"

471
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,460
"Are you…

472
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,880
still waiting?

473
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,790
Gyuwon.

474
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,630
Let's not wait anymore."

475
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,470
I guess that kind of acting
only comes with time, huh?

476
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,970
Who are you, anyway?

477
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,970
- Shh.
- Oh, right.

478
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,720
"And if I tell you?

479
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:29,020
Are you going to run up there like that

480
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,230
to cry and beg?

481
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,110
Aren't you dying soon?

482
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,110
Honestly, that's low even for you."

483
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:40,530
"Gyuwon impulsively slaps Junghwa.

484
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,530
Junghwa is baffled."

485
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,410
"Never mind.

486
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,870
You're so miserable,
it's not worth the fuss."

487
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,880
Thank you.

488
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,260
Let's move on to the next scene.

489
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,800
"Don't say things
you don't mean, Hyunsang.

490
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,720
Just be honest.

491
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,020
You're…

492
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,850
You're fed up…

493
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,900
You're fed up… with me being sick, right?

494
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,810
Y-You're fed up
with me being sick, right?"

495
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,240
I'm sorry, Mr. Lee.

496
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,570
It's fine, go on.

497
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:24,780
"You're f-fed up
with me being sick, right?

498
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,370
Then just leave!

499
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,000
Get the hell out! Go!"

500
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,290
Let's move on from this scene.

501
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,000
Let's move on.

502
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,300
Daeum?

503
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,010
Yes, Ms. Chae?

504
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:43,090
Good job today.

505
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,850
No, I should've been better.

506
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,060
You were fine, really.

507
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,770
Thank you.

508
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,100
I wanted to ask…

509
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,190
did you see that day?

510
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,480
Sorry?

511
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,070
Oh.

512
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,070
If you didn't see, never mind.

513
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,610
If you're pretending you didn't,
thank you.

514
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,870
If you're really curious…

515
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:09,410
No, I'm not curious.

516
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,540
Ah.

517
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,710
Great work today, Ms. Chae.

518
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,180
Thank you for today. That was great.

519
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,730
It must've been tough writing this script.

520
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,060
No, it was fine.

521
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,730
How's your health?

522
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,900
Are you done with chemo?

523
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,320
It's like I've never been sick.

524
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,360
Funny how life works.

525
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,110
I didn't think I'd be in this movie again.

526
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,910
Right.

527
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,330
I'm counting on your help.

528
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,950
I keep thinking
about Director Lee Duyoung.

529
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,210
Thank you.

530
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:59,750
I should be thanking you.

531
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,500
I really wanted you to be in this.

532
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,720
Are you…

533
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,090
really all right with this?

534
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,010
With what?

535
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,810
Nothing, I should get going.

536
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,690
Okay. I'll see you on set, then.

537
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,360
Jeha.

538
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,280
You don't…

539
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:30,330
have to push yourself too hard, you know?

540
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:32,200
Even if you just let it be,

541
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:34,120
Lee Duyoung is just Lee Duyoung,

542
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,290
and Lee Jeha is still Lee Jeha.

543
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,000
Okay, I'm really going now.

544
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,050
I've been looking for you.
Where have you been?

545
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:56,390
I was worried that my manager
was waiting for too long,

546
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,770
so I went down
to tell him to take a break.

547
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,440
You were great.

548
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:08,450
I've been practicing as much as I could,
but I was too nervous.

549
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:13,740
You were entirely surrounded
by respected veteran actors in this room.

550
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,290
It'd be strange not to be nervous.

551
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,620
Still, I messed up.

552
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,540
Messed up or held back?

553
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:25,260
- Pardon?
- That's how it looked to me.

554
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,220
You wanted to do it so perfectly

555
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:32,510
you couldn't bear to fake
even a single line

556
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,680
from what I saw.

557
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,140
I guess I didn't analyze
my character enough.

558
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,100
I can help you with that.

559
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:44,270
We're about to fall in love, hate,
and regret each other on-screen,

560
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,730
so let's help each other out.

561
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,030
Thank you, Mr. Kim.

562
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:49,570
You're still here.

563
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:55,160
Uh, I thought we should
talk to each other a bit more.

564
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,750
Ah.

565
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:58,790
Please, sit.

566
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,040
Actually,

567
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,590
I'd prefer it if you two
didn't talk to each other too much.

568
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,970
Well, of course.
I know your directing style.

569
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:12,720
I prefer emotions that
come out naturally on set

570
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,100
over anything too rehearsed or practiced.

571
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,560
I understand what you mean.

572
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:20,810
I'll get going now.

573
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,480
Bye, Daeum.

574
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,480
Good night, Mr. Kim.

575
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,960
Where do you think you're going?

576
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,880
Sorry?

577
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,380
And this too.

578
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:54,550
She's in shock and barely breathing.

579
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,930
She can't just shed
one perfect little tear.

580
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,890
I'll have to fix this.

581
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,770
Can you try Scene 109 again?

582
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,190
"You're tired of me being sick, right?"

583
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,400
Let me try again.

584
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,950
"You're tired of me being sick, right?"

585
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,620
Why are you saying it like that?

586
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,160
Why do you keep trailing off at the end?

587
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,790
Because I don't understand.

588
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,630
Mmm, Gyuwon's in so much pain,

589
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:30,210
not because she's sick, but more so
because she can't see him anymore.

590
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,800
But the direction says
"like it's no big deal,"

591
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,930
and I can't understand it.

592
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:39,600
Why should Gyuwon love Hyunsang?
There's no reason for her to love him.

593
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,810
"Like it's no big deal" is correct here.

594
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:44,890
The man talked big,
like he'd always be there,

595
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,400
but ended up betraying her.

596
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,360
And Gyuwon is sick

597
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,690
and all alone.

598
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,030
That doesn't feel real at all.

599
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,700
Everything just feels cold and cruel.

600
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,830
Didn't you say you wanted realism?

601
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,450
Are you sure this is realism?

602
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,290
Like I told you last time,

603
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,670
this may look like a romance,

604
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,460
but love is the last thing
this film needs.

605
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,300
I don't know why you'd say "need"
when it comes to love.

606
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,300
The world isn't all hearts and roses.

607
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,630
Hearts and roses?

608
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:22,930
Some people chase the fantasy of love,
only to get stabbed in the back

609
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,520
and end up completely alone.

610
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,590
Hello?

611
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,590
Yes, I forgot to say something earlier.

612
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,260
Mr. Lee, it's 11 p.m.

613
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:58,010
Don't you think it's too harsh
to tell me off this late?

614
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,470
I'm not going to tell you off.

615
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:02,890
Just telling you to only rehearse
in our scheduled readings.

616
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:05,430
<i>Don't meet anyone separately,</i>
<i>except Seoyoung.</i>

617
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:11,230
Uh, but I have
the most scenes with Jungwoo.

618
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,690
And what if he finds out you're sick?

619
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,190
Oh.

620
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,030
Okay.

621
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,950
Okay, then. Good night.

622
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,460
How about Park Seungyeon
for the Steadicam?

623
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,380
Oh, you haven't heard?

624
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:40,260
Seungyeon passed away two years ago.
The cancer came back.

625
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,720
You've been hiding away
from the scene for too long.

626
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:50,730
Well, important people like him
only work when it really matters.

627
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,230
Oh, of course.

628
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,280
ANDONG - THE CENTER
OF KOREA'S SPIRITUAL CULTURE

629
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,490
WOLYEONG-GYO BRIDGE

630
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:01,610
What a view.

631
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,450
It's nice during the day, but the lighting
is on another level at night.

632
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:09,460
Wow. I'll check in
with our director and get back to you.

633
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:22,430
Thank goodness we found a good place
for the bookstore early.

634
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:26,310
We'll be able to
build everything on schedule.

635
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:29,890
Mr. Lee?

636
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,060
Yes, I like it. It's nice.

637
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:56,210
CINEMA JONGNO

638
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:03,970
KIM JINYEO

639
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,930
Hey, you're here.

640
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:11,520
You know Ms. Kim Jinyeo quite well, right?

641
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:27,410
You have to really watch out for this one.

642
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,290
- Who are you?
- I'm Lim Junbyung.

643
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,050
- Pardon?
- I'm Ms. Lee's manager, Lim Junbyung.

644
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,760
Ah.

645
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,760
If you're family,
you shouldn't do business together.

646
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,720
- Daeum's in there, right?
- Yes.

647
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,850
I'm actually the CEO
of Beyond Entertainment.

648
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:50,810
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes.

649
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,680
Ms. Lee's resting right now.

650
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:58,190
Everything here is to help with that.

651
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,570
Move if you're not going to help.

652
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:01,650
You can't go in.

653
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,780
- You can't. No.
- Come on! I said move!

654
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:09,870
- For crying out loud!
- You can't go in.

655
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:11,990
Goodness! Daeum!

656
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,700
Hello.

657
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:15,410
It's so great to see you.

658
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,920
Would you mind letting me in?

659
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:23,670
AT THE END OF US

660
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:27,010
What's all this, Ms. Go?

661
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:28,720
After this movie,

662
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,180
they're all scripts you should look at
for your next project!

663
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:35,140
As I told you last time--

664
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:38,770
I figured I should at least
show you what I can do.

665
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:42,320
I appreciate the gesture, but I can't.

666
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:47,820
I can make you the next Chae Seoyoung.

667
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:52,200
No, even a bigger star than her.

668
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:54,660
I already

669
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:58,420
have a great manager over there, actually.

670
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:00,920
Daeum!

671
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,590
It's hard out there
for an actress to survive on her own.

672
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,840
Wow, talk about clingy.

673
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:09,930
That little…

674
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:11,680
He means the rice cake.

675
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,220
Yes, this honey rice cake
is really clinging to my mouth.

676
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,810
It must've been out too long and gone bad.

677
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:18,940
Why those…

678
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:24,860
- Take care now.
- Goodbye.

679
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,650
This book looks a little weird.

680
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:29,410
Check these out. And these…

681
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:33,240
There are all kinds of genres here.

682
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:35,080
And all the big directors and writers.

683
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,210
I'm not interested.

684
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,460
Not even a little?

685
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:45,590
Even if I were, I couldn't do any of it.

686
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:48,130
Right. I'm sorry.

687
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,890
I got ahead of myself.

688
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:58,430
I'm going to head out for a bit.

689
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,560
Where to?

690
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:03,230
There's someone I really want to meet.

691
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,910
I'm sorry for showing up like this.

692
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,620
About <i>Love in White</i>…

693
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,370
My father didn't write it, did he?

694
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:25,170
You knew, didn't you?

695
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:27,840
Why don't you take a seat?

696
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,300
Why tell me this now

697
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:32,470
after all this time?

698
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,800
Hold on.

699
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,430
- Gosh.
- I'm so sorry.

700
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,190
- Come here.
- No, I'm fine.

701
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:45,230
I have a first aid kit somewhere.

702
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,410
She was the lead in the original,

703
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:56,910
so I just came by to meet her, that's all.

704
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:01,660
Mr. Lee.

705
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,630
Mr. Lee.

706
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:06,340
Let go.

707
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,760
Why are you here?

708
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,390
Why are you being like this?

709
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:19,430
Why are you so rude to Ms. Kim?

710
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:21,480
You heard everything.

711
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:26,650
You said you looked me up.

712
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:30,610
All the information you need
would've been there.

713
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,280
Why were you even eavesdropping?

714
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:37,870
I wasn't trying to!

715
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:39,870
I couldn't help overhearing it.

716
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:46,630
Are you leaving without apologizing?

717
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:51,300
More like I'm leaving
without getting an apology.

718
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,640
Daeum!

719
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:10,190
Don't go in there.

720
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,450
I left in such a rush.
I should at least say goodbye.

721
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:18,200
Sorry to put you in an awkward spot,
but I don't want you to go back in there.

722
00:47:57,530 --> 00:47:58,860
This is driving me insane.

723
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,240
I…

724
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:05,500
I don't even know what I heard back there…

725
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:10,170
so please don't go insane over it.

726
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:16,970
Since I know your secret,
could you keep one of mine?

727
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,100
Your secret?

728
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:26,770
Everyone thinks
Lee Duyoung wrote <i>Love in White</i>…

729
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,190
but I don't think he wrote it.

730
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,490
What?

731
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:43,620
I don't even know what I'm feeling.
Ashamed, foolish…

732
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,790
That's why I'm making this film.

733
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:51,920
To return <i>Love in White</i>
to its real writer…

734
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,340
in a way that…

735
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:00,050
as many people as possible
will know the truth.

736
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:11,520
PAINKILLER

737
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:22,990
Our brains

738
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:24,910
can't tell the difference…

739
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,410
between emotional pain and physical pain.

740
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:33,960
So please take this today, okay?

741
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:38,420
Good night.

742
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,430
Ah…

743
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,260
You should take this with warm water.

744
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:47,310
And…

745
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,560
you need to sleep well, okay?

746
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,810
Got it?

747
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:56,320
Promise?

748
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,400
Hmm?

749
00:49:58,070 --> 00:49:59,070
Okay.

750
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:36,980
LOCATION PROPOSAL
FOR LOVE IN WHITE

751
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:39,150
What's this?

752
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:41,280
That spot looked great.

753
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,950
They're even offering funding too.

754
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:45,320
WOLYEONG-GYO BRIDGE

755
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:47,280
I don't think we're low on budget.

756
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:49,740
We're always low on budget, man.

757
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:53,210
Good spot or not,
I don't want to add unnecessary travel.

758
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:55,670
It'll just stretch the schedule.

759
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,040
That's strange.

760
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:02,510
Extra shoot days are my problem,
as the producer.

761
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:04,880
Anyway, fine.

762
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:06,340
Nice weather we have today.

763
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:09,220
Now, let us proceed with a bow

764
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:12,180
to the spirits of heaven and earth,

765
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:15,230
praying for the safe shoot
as well as the health and well-being

766
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:17,100
of our cast and crew.

767
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:18,650
We'd like to invite Mr. Kim Hyuncheol,

768
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:20,860
who was a part of
this movie's original history.

769
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,500
LOVE IN WHITE

770
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:47,130
Closer together, please!

771
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:52,220
Get ready. One, two, three.

772
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,310
You don't have to see me out.

773
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:58,480
- Go back in.
- Goodbye.

774
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,730
Keep it up!

775
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,900
Don't you think this is cute?

776
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:08,070
Isn't this pig just too cute?

777
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,530
- Isn't it?
- Yes, it's so cute.

778
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:12,740
- We can't have it hurting people.
- Is it over?

779
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:17,160
I think it's over. Right?

780
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:20,330
- I brought it here yesterday.
- Really?

781
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:21,750
I prepared everything.

782
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,630
- Wow.
- How did you manage that?

783
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:26,050
- It was nothing.
- No way.

784
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:28,590
Were you two able to greet the others?

785
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:38,520
- We're eating pork today.
- Isn't that a bit cruel?

786
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:46,440
You canceled last time,
so it's on you to reschedule.

787
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:49,780
- We'll be seeing each other a lot, so…
- Why not today?

788
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:52,490
It's a chance to make it up to us.

789
00:52:57,910 --> 00:52:59,370
Mr. Lee doesn't drink.

790
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:05,050
That's rare for a director.

791
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,470
He said that in our last film together,
don't you remember?

792
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:14,220
I was too scared
to even go near him back then.

793
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:18,020
Daeum doesn't drink either.

794
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,150
Ah.

795
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:26,110
I noticed you two seem pretty close.

796
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:30,570
Like you know each other very well.

797
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:31,950
- No--
- We are close.

798
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:38,080
He cast me when I was a total nobody,
so I've been trying hard to get close.

799
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,460
Rookie energy and all!

800
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,290
Okay. Cheers.

801
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:44,880
Mr. Lee.

802
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:47,340
Don't you think
Gyuwon's story is too tragic?

803
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:49,670
She's young and beautiful

804
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:53,470
but has to die
after losing the man she loves.

805
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:02,310
Everyone dies eventually.

806
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:07,900
I don't think it's such a tragedy if
you live the life you have meaningfully.

807
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:11,280
Even the love we think will last forever…

808
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,780
eventually fades, doesn't it?

809
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:22,000
Got any other wine? This one's too dry.

810
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:26,380
I don't know.
Someone drank all the sweet ones recently.

811
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,500
Are you sure you don't want some, Daeum?

812
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:32,170
I'm fine. Just this is enough.

813
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:41,930
Are you sick or something?

814
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:45,190
Sorry?

815
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:46,310
I was just wondering.

816
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,190
One glass should be fine, no?

817
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,110
Daeum,
have you seen the original film?

818
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,700
Of course.

819
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:58,990
I cry every single time I watch it.

820
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,540
Oh. Hey, you're just like me.

821
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:03,710
So do I. It gets me every time.

822
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:05,170
You two seem to click.

823
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:08,040
Mr. Lee, how do they look in a two-shot?

824
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:12,340
They look good together.

825
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:19,560
Seoyoung and I…

826
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,060
we're actually seeing each other.

827
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:28,270
Oh.

828
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:31,110
Wow!

829
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:32,570
Congratulations.

830
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:34,610
Yes, that's something to celebrate.

831
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:38,070
It's stuffy in here,
I need some fresh air.

832
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:40,620
The terrace is over there.

833
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:02,470
Well, that killed the mood fast.

834
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:12,270
When did it start?

835
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:14,480
Right after the divorce.

836
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,610
Why are you asking if Daeum is sick?

837
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:22,450
I just thought it was odd for someone
her age not to drink a single drop.

838
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:26,500
It's even weirder if you think
I had some ulterior motive asking that.

839
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:30,880
- I heard you took her to the hospital.
- Yeah.

840
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,880
I didn't think she'd tell you.

841
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,130
That's surprising.

842
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:39,970
I guess she tells you everything.

843
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:42,930
She said she wasn't feeling well that day.

844
00:56:43,010 --> 00:56:44,560
She's a bit anemic too.

845
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:46,430
Just…

846
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:48,890
Nothing you need to worry about.

847
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,820
You really care about Daeum, huh?

848
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:56,570
I just need her.

849
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:58,320
That's all.

850
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,460
Have a good night.

851
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:38,030
Mr. Lee.

852
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:39,860
Yes?

853
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,280
You know…

854
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:48,330
Is it possible

855
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,910
to kiss someone…

856
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:53,960
when you don't love them?

857
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:57,210
Or rather, when you're not even sure…

858
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,050
if what you're feeling

859
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:03,680
is love?

860
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:11,020
That's what Hyunsang does to Gyuwon.

861
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,730
Oh.

862
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:17,440
Write down whatever you don't get.
I'll explain it to you later.

863
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:19,440
It's a good question.

864
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:22,860
You should use me, mmm,

865
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:24,490
as much as you need like this.

866
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,120
Wow.

867
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:29,290
Mmm.

868
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:33,250
What?

869
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,920
Why are you looking at me like that?

870
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:38,500
Have a good night.

871
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:42,170
Okay.

872
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:12,290
Why didn't you just punch Jeha?

873
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:15,670
It's pouring outside. Stay the night.

874
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:19,130
Why not invite the press, too?

875
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,000
Saying that to your costar

876
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:23,670
and the director we're stuck with
for the next three months?

877
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,130
Do you have any common sense?

878
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:27,930
Or basic decency?

879
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:30,640
They were going to find out anyway.
No big deal. Work's work.

880
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,100
It's a big deal because
it interferes with my work!

881
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:35,270
You keep looking at him.

882
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:44,530
That's why I said it.
I wanted you to know I was upset.

883
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:49,700
I thought we were done talking about that
when I joined this movie.

884
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:52,740
I guess not.

885
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,210
I wasn't.

886
00:59:57,710 --> 00:59:58,960
I'm sorry.

887
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,290
This won't happen again.

888
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:46,840
<i>Ding-dong!</i>

889
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:50,090
Stay there, I'll head down.

890
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:55,770
Daeum.

891
01:00:58,640 --> 01:00:59,940
How did you know I lived here?

892
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:02,770
Your friend is my manager after all.

893
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,520
Did you forget?

894
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:06,990
Are you okay?

895
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,530
Want to step outside?

896
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:11,780
Just for a moment.

897
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:13,910
Are you out of your mind?

898
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:16,950
Don't you know what'll happen
if you catch a cold?

899
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,670
I'll be fine if I shower right away!

900
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,500
This feels amazing!

901
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:28,210
Why do you keep going out in the rain?

902
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:29,800
Stop it.

903
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:35,220
I figured

904
01:01:35,850 --> 01:01:38,520
you'd never join me…

905
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,440
but you really are uptight.

906
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:46,610
This feels so good, though.

907
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:52,530
Did you walk from home in the rain?

908
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,990
No. I had an umbrella, too.

909
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,460
I was only in the rain
for about 10 seconds.

910
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:05,710
What, you think I've been out here
soaking wet for an hour?

911
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:10,420
Let's go. I'll take you home.

912
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:18,560
So this is what it felt like.

913
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:22,890
My mom showed me

914
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:25,560
how to play in the rain

915
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:29,190
when I was terrified,
like you are right now.

916
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:34,780
What a low blow, bringing up your mom.

917
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:40,500
You're like a person made of concrete.

918
01:02:42,370 --> 01:02:46,210
Let's forget all the pressure
for just a minute.

919
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:49,340
Just one minute.

920
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:50,800
Trust me.

921
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:53,380
It really does feel amazing.

922
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:57,760
It better be.

923
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:12,050
One minute's up.

924
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:16,380
That was too short.

925
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:18,890
Such a shame.

926
01:04:20,850 --> 01:04:23,060
You really counted to the second, huh?

927
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:32,480
You know what? It just feels too unfair.

928
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:34,860
Scene 30.

929
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,030
"The two share a soft kiss."

930
01:04:58,680 --> 01:04:59,930
You told me to use you.

931
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,800
That's it. Daeum's not leaving
the hospital anymore. Got it?

932
01:06:20,670 --> 01:06:23,300
Wow, Ms. Go.
You're full of energy this morning--

933
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:25,260
Help me sign Lee Daeum.

934
01:06:25,970 --> 01:06:28,810
<i>It's better for you not to sign Daeum.</i>

935
01:06:28,890 --> 01:06:30,140
Who are you?

936
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:31,680
<i>What exactly is wrong with Daeum?</i>

937
01:06:31,770 --> 01:06:33,190
CAN YOU LEAVE ME SOME TIME?
I WANT TO CHOOSE MY OWN ENDING.

938
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:36,610
<i>I honestly don't know how to do that.</i>

939
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:39,030
<i>I understand how my dad feels,</i>

940
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:42,030
<i>but I can't live how he wants me to.</i>

941
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:46,320
Is it fun making a terminal
patient play a terminal character?

942
01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:49,200
Is this how all movies are?

943
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,960
