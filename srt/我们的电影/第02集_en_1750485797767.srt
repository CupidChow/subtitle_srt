Don't move if you want to live.

Sorry…

8
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,050
…but I'm just too tired.

9
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,100
You'll have to die quickly.

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,560
What the?

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,400
Wasn't I supposed to be the one to faint?

12
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,150
Gosh, she's driving me nuts.

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,280
Hey, you there.

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,370
You're not the one who got shot.

15
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,120
Hang on. Something's not right.

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,580
We should call an ambulance.

17
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,040
Are you all right?

18
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,210
Yes, we're in Sangam-dong…

20

EPISODE 2

23
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,180
Can you see the ocean?

24
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,810
There's no ocean here.

25
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,400
Oh?

26
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,440
That's strange.

27
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,070
I definitely see an ocean here.

28
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,030
What? Where did you get this thing?

29
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,570
I told you to rest
since you have a lot of tests tomorrow.

30
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,370
It's okay. I'll take her downstairs later.

31
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,250
Wow, the weather is so nice by the sea!

32
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,960
How is it this nice?

33
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,710
It's a perfect day for a tan.

34
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,340
Ta-da!

35
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,550
Come closer.

36
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,460
Are you in?

37
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,670
Give it to me. I'll do it.

38
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,630
Here, now. Say cheese.

39
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,680
We're on vacation at the beach.

40
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,470
<i>My mom was sick.</i>

41
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,190
<i>Not any normal patient,</i>
<i>but a strange one at that.</i>

42
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,190
It's all right.

43
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,960
It's only us here because of the rain.

44
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,920
I know! It's so fun!

45
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,130
Then do you want to do something
even more fun?

46
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,940
♪ <i>La, la, la, la.</i> ♪

47
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,230
♪ <i>La, la.</i> ♪

48
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,910
Is that the medicine
that makes you feel better?

49
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,910
- That's not medicine.
- What?

50
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,170
It's grape juice.

51
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,500
That's grape juice?

52
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,170
Sure.

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,260
Mom.

54
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,470
Grapes are purple.

55
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,510
And bananas are yellow.

56
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,850
But when they're peeled?

57
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:14,980
Hmm.

58
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,060
White.

59
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,190
That's right.

60
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,980
Grapes are purple,

61
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,530
but they're that color when you peel them.

62
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,030
You're always trying to trick me, Mom.

63
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,830
What, you're too grown
to fall for it anymore?

64
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,710
It's so hard to make my daughter laugh.

65
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,750
It's not funny.

66
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,500
You shouldn't laugh either.

67
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,130
It hurts you when you laugh.

68
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,300
Daeum.

69
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,810
I read somewhere

70
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:59,270
that the DNA that makes you cry
when you're sad

71
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:03,610
is the same as the one
that makes you smile

72
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,150
when you're happy.

73
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,450
You have to eat, Mom.

74
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,540
Daeum.

75
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,300
It's going to be okay,

76
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,180
for you

77
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,470
and for Dad.

78
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,830
Dad.

79
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,370
Yes?

80
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,550
What's "genetics"?

81
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,180
Lie down now.

82
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,020
I hoped she'd get
the best of her mom, not this.

83
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,780
<i>My mom still lives inside me,</i>

84
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,950
<i>and that's the one special thing</i>
<i>that only I get to have.</i>

85
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,950
<i>That's how my doctor father</i>
<i>taught eight-year-old me</i>

86
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,830
<i>about genetics.</i>

92
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,550
<i>For a moment,</i>

93
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,430
<i>I felt like I had become Frida Kahlo.</i>

94
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,640
<i>No,</i>

95
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,730
<i>I actually did become Frida Kahlo.</i>

96
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,900
You're awesome, Daeum!

97
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,200
You're the best, Daeum!

98
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,820
<i>In a life too short to live my own story…</i>

99

<i>…the chance to perform</i>
<i>many different lives</i>

101
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,290
<i>is exactly what I wanted to do.</i>

102
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,210
I'll run with everything I've got!

103
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,960
Great. Good luck. Let's do it!

104
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,170
- Let's do it!
- Yeah!

105
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,300
Don't move if you want to live.

106
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,050
<i>And so…</i>

107
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,810

108
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,560
<i>…I've known this was going to happen…</i>

<i>In the end,</i>

111
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,830
<i>I couldn't escape that grape juice either.</i>

112
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,660
Drip.

00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,710

<i>and had it by the time I turned 20.</i>

122
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,460
Okay.

123

One, two, three.

<i>And yet, the thing that keeps me going…</i>

00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,640

What's this, Doc?

145
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,270
Oh, just a movie
I was asked to consult for.

146
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,400
Put it down.

147
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,440
- Put it down.
- Can I meet him instead?

148
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,730
- Meet him? No. You take this back.
- No thank you.

149
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,490
Why are you being like this?

150
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,740
Please, just once.

151
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,320
Once or twice, I don't care.
I told you no!

152
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,780
I'm your consultant,

153
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,620
the terminal patient, Lee Daeum.

154
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,010
Your name,

155
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,800
it means "next"?

156
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:52,810
Yes.

158
00:10:58,810 --> 00:10:59,810
Ah.

GRAPE 100

160
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,740
Oh, grape juice. That's why.

161
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,580
You must really like grapes.

162
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,990
Dr. Kim said I should bring this for you.

163
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,460
Not grapes. Grape juice.

164
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,000
Especially when it's
on a "buy two, get one free" deal.

165
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,420
But someone happened to take it from me.

166
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,090
I actually told you I didn't need it.

167
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,520
Why didn't you say hi in the funeral home?

168
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,690
I wanted to focus on my sadness.

169
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:46,150
Focus on your… Okay.

170
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,610
Actually,

171
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,780
would you mind if I record this session?

172
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,540
I'd need to listen again
while I'm writing.

173
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,000
Actually,

174
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,920
do you mind if I film this?

175
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,790
It's a little hobby of mine.

176
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,300
All right.

177
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,260
Okay.

178
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,270
I heard from Dr. Kim
that you're very sick.

179
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,780
Do I look sick to you right now?

180
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,410
No.

181
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,700
I feel okay right now,

182
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,710
but when I'm really sick, it shows a lot.

183
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,170
That's why I can't do
everything I want to do.

184
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,260
What is it you want to do?

185
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,840
Adultery.

186
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,130
Premeditated serial murder.

187
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,090
- Sorry?
- I'd like to die sometime.

188
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,680
Maybe even become a ghost.

189
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,270
And then be reborn again.

190
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,980
Why do I have so many things
I want to do?

191
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,610
There is one job
where you can do all of that.

192
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,320
Yes, and that is my dream job.

193
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,150
Ah.

194
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,950
So you want to be an actress.

195
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,200
What do you do now?

196
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,620
Now? Well…

197
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,080
not much, as you can see.

198
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,460
I don't see a big film career
coming anytime soon,

199
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,000
unless I star in a hospice documentary.

200
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,130
Or if I'm playing a terminal patient.

201
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,550
The film, <i>Love in White</i>…

202
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,930
Well, you've seen it
at Cinema Jongno that time.

203
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,260
Not just that time.

204
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:40,930
It's my favorite movie that I regularly
go back to whenever I need to.

205
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,850
Every time I watch it, I bawl my eyes out.

206
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,190
It's my go-to tearjerker flick.

207
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,110
That's what melodramas are for.

208
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:52,030
Crying your heart out like that

209
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,660
makes you feel
like you had some epic love.

210
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,580
It's an illusion, I guess.

211
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,620
It tricks you into that illusion.

212
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,250
It's not an illusion.

213
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,540
Falling in love, and sharing that love…

214
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,050
Even if someone leaves
and someone gets left behind,

215
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,050
it'll all be okay

216
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,340
as long as there's love.

217
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,470
Watching that

218
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,720
gives me the strength to go on.

219
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,890
If that kind of love really does exist,

220
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,850
I want to experience it too.

221
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,270
And to do that, I have to stay alive.

222
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,030
So basically, <i>Love in White</i> is my chemo

223
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,740
and my radiation therapy and so on.

224
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,700
Is that really something to cry over?

225
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,910
My eyes are teary just talking about it.

226
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,960
I don't get it at all.

227
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,840
Aren't you leaving?

228
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,890
I'm bored, so I thought I'd walk you back.

229
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,260
- I'm okay.
- I'm okay too.

230
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,720
I said I'm fine.

231
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,810
I said I'm fine too.

232
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,910
If you really don't want to go,
how about a walk with me?

233
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,880
It wasn't even my funeral,

234
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,800
but I found myself taking in every detail.

235
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,930
What kind of face the family was making,

236
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,300
who was grieving.

237
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:44,810
I took the funeral director's card…

238
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,270
…and I started getting scared right then.

239
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,900
I'm not even dead yet,

240
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,740
but the thought of dying
felt like death itself.

241
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,200
Once you get sick,

242
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,540
your life is completely different
from before your illness.

243
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,210
There's a reason why
they say ignorance is bliss.

244
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,760
Slowly sinking into death,

245
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,600
being suffocated by fear…

246
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,440
You don't know what that is, do you?

247
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,420
I do know that not knowing is bliss.

248
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,310
Can I ask you something too?

249
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,520
Yes, go on.

250
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,400
In your version of <i>Love in White</i>…

251
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,240
does the ending…

252
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,660
stay the same?

253
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:28,910
No.

254
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,330
In the end…

255
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,790
In the end, she'll probably die.

256
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,180
<i>That was the moment I realized…</i>

257
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:58,820
<i>maybe I can be the star of my own story,</i>

258
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,280
<i>as long as I</i>

259
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,320
<i>cast Lee Jeha into my life.</i>

260
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,410
This voice-over
is hogging too many scenes.

261
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,000
I need to trim it down.

262
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,960
Director Lee?

263
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,210
Yes?

264
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,630
I like it.

265
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,420
- You do?
- Yes.

266
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,720
Especially the scene

267
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,090
where the terminal Gyuwon
stops Hyunsang from dying.

268
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,850
You reversed it from the original.
Why the change?

269
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,260
After meeting terminally ill people,

270
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:34,190
I realized nothing
is as strong as their will to live.

271
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,190
I wanted that to come through.

272
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,780
Seoyoung's hot right now,
so now's the time to take her to Cannes.

273
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,400
This film has a clear purpose,

274
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,030
and it doesn't work at all without her.

275
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,030
Let's talk in person, Ms. Go.

276
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,920
This script better turn out well.

277
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,210
Ms. Go is a bit off.

278
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,500
You read the same draft, right?

279
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:04,760
Wouldn't Seoyoung be
a better Junghwa than Gyuwon?

280
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,140
Though I bet Ms. Go will shut that down.

281
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,390
Let's forget Ms. Go's obsession
with lead roles

282
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:14,140
and say the fairy tale of a superstar
taking a supporting role comes true.

283
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,940
Our main problem? The investors will walk.

284
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,600
They're going to leave us.

285
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,650
Then why bother holding auditions
if the role has been cast?

286
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,150
It's all about the optics, man.

287
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,030
An unknown actor lands the lead
after a tough audition?

288
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,660
It's a romantic story. Like <i>La La Land</i>.

289
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,160
Of course, that never happens here
or in Hollywood.

290
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,500
LOVE IN WHITE
AUDITION

291
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,710
Hello, my name is Kang Seoha.

292
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,830
Okay, Seoha.

293
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,630
Go to the last page
of the audition script.

294
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,170
You'll see your sides there.

295
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,460
"Hyunsang."

296
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,010
"Hyunsang!"

297
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,510
"There is no such right!"

298
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,220
"You've got to try living,
even if it kills you."

299
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,850
"Only then"…

300
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,600
"Only then your tomorrow will come."

301
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,690
"Do as I say

302
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,110
for just one month."

303
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,940
"If you still want to die after that,

304
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,320
then go ahead. Do whatever you want."

305
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,410
Okay, thank you.

306
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,410
My brain is about to shut down.

307
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,040
How many do we have left?

308
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,700
The next one is our last one today.

309
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,080
Hey, even her name means "next."

310
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,790
LEE DAEUM, 25 YEARS OLD

311
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,590
Yes, come in.

312
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,680
Hello!

313
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,100
My name is Lee Daeum, and I'm an actress.

314
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,240
What's that camcorder for?

315
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,910
Could I just point it at me
and keep it on?

316
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,580
You can't for security reasons.

317
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,040
Okay.

318
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,170
That darn camcorder.

319
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,760
Do you know her?

320
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,060
Do you know Director Lee?

321
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,770
No, I've never met him.

322
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,230
Nice to meet you, Director.

323
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,150
I'm not looking to cast
for a documentary film.

324
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,030
Yes, I know that very well.

325
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,580
I'm just desperate
to take on this terminal patient role.

326
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,250
Shall we start with the sides?

327
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,750
"Ms. Gyuwon,

328
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,960
just calm down."

329
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,840
"It wasn't even my funeral,

330
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,970
but I found myself
taking in every detail."

331
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,970
"I wanted my funeral to be different."

332
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,140
"So I took the funeral director's card"…

333
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,140
That's enough for that.

334
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,770
Let's go to the last page.

335
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,270
Read the part where Gyuwon
stops Hyunsang's suicide.

336
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,460
"Hyunsang."

337
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,090
"I won't…"

338
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,930
"I won't say a single word."

339
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,300
"Just…"

340
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,930
"Just stay for a moment."

341
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,190
Okay, that's great.

342
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,940
I like your reinterpretation of the lines.

343
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,910
Yes, well, I think that's enough.

344
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,200
You can leave now.

345
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,080
Thank you!

346
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,340
She's incredible.

347
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,130
She wasn't forcing it. Just pure feeling.

348
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:21,350
Shame the role is already cast, no?

349
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:36,530
Director Lee,
is there anything left to discuss?

350
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,860
The perfect lead just came to us.

351
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,430
<i>Doors are opening.</i>

352
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,270
Mr. Bu!

353
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:11,690
What's all this?
I told you to just come hang out!

354
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:13,900
You must be exhausted from the auditions.

355
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,730
Thought you might be hungry.

356
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,150
- What's this?
- Oh, wow! What is it?

357
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,610
A handwritten letter?

358
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,740
I know we've only just met,

359
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:28,080
but you're just as praiseworthy
as they say you are.

360
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,000
Can you tell the whole world that?

361
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:32,960
Jungwoo.

362
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:36,420
Thank you so much for doing this with me.

363
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:39,300
Don't even say that.
We go way back since <i>The Lonely People</i>.

364
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,390
He's so loyal, isn't he?

365
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,150
WAIT THERE FOR A MINUTE

366
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,500
<i>I want to live.</i>

367
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,710
<i>I want to live right now.</i>

368
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,800
<i>I want to live right now.</i>

369
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,850
Are you a patient or an actress?

370
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,810
I'm just Lee Daeum.

371
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,020
Why did you come here?
What were you thinking?

372
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,530
Are you serious about this?

373
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,200
Yes, I'm very serious.

374
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,280
You said that you were dying.

375
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,740
You said you only have a year left.

376
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:00,170
This is a film, not a hospice documentary.
And it's an audition.

377
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,420
You knew all that when you came in, right?

378
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,510
Yes.

379
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:07,050
You debuted with <i>The Lonely People</i>.
You've won a lot of awards.

380
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,350
You're obsessed with realism.

381
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,270
Infamous for having
a difficult personality.

382
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,100
Was involved in a scandal.

383
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,600
More famous as Lee Duyoung's son
than for your own work.

384
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,480
I looked it all up online.

385
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,610
Honestly, I didn't have to prepare much
in terms of acting.

386
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:23,950
I am that character.

387
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,450
What if you die?

388
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,410
What if you die during production?

389
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Who'll die?

390
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,340
You.

391
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,560
Guess I was also desperate,
showing up here.

392
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,640
I'm sorry.

393
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,060
Let's pretend the audition didn't happen.

394
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,100
Wait!

395
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:00,730
Let's look at this
from a broader perspective.

396
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,070
What if I die during filming?
It'll go viral.

397
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,410
A terminal patient
playing a terminal role?

398
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,200
Even I'd want to watch that.

399
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,700
That's a big win for the investors.
Big win for you too.

400
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,370
Yeah. As long as I'm okay with it,

401
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:15,910
you or anyone involved
shouldn't have a problem, no?

402
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:19,500
How is it not a problem?
This is your life on the line.

403
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,250
Yes, and I'm fine with it.

404
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,420
I want to do this. Even if I die.

405
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,260
That's reckless and also selfish.

406
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:31,760
Not true. The film becomes a hit,

407
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,390
I get to have closure before I die,

408
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,560
and you'd make a comeback,

409
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,560
ride the success train to eternity.

410
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,400
Wow, look at that. Everyone wins, right?

411
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,190
It's also a bit…

412
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,490
bittersweet, I guess.

413
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,870
I don't know how you're so confident.

414
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,620
I get that you're sick,

415
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,960
but this is where I draw the line.

416
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,050
Find another way to get closure.
It can't be my movie, sorry.

417
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,630
I saw your face earlier.

418
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,640
To put it bluntly,
it felt like you totally fell for me.

419
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,260
Okay, I'll give you that.
You were good, but--

420
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,770
I can't really run,
so I can't really do action scenes.

421
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:19,730
Actually, even normal, everyday life
would be tough for me.

422
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,980
But this character is a terminal patient.

423
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,530
This is something I can really act well.

424
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:35,290
I want to do it,
even if it costs me everything.

425
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,790
Even if that's your life?

426
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,960
I don't have much time left anyway.

427
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,300
Would you rather die trying
or die full of regret?

428
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,300
If the roles were reversed,

429
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,430
would you answer differently?

430
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,800
So tell me…

431
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,520
How long do you think you have left?

432
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,360
How long do I need to live?

433
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,760
Were there any new scripts that came in?

434
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,600
Well, actually…

435
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,480
I heard Kim Jungin's script
is going around,

436
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,650
but it didn't reach us.

437
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,440
Anything from Lee Jeha?

438
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,570
I'm not sure.

439
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,990
I think I heard
he's doing a <i>Love in White</i> remake,

440
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,910
but it's not going so well.

441
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,620
I guess no one wants me anymore.

442
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,000
What do you mean? You've still got it.

443
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,920
You're the first one who got his script!

444
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,420
I knew it. It must've come to me first.

445
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:15,260
I'm sorry. I knew I should've come to you.

446
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,390
Forget it. What did you tell the studio?

447
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,770
What do you mean,
she's going to Hollywood?

448
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,480
It's what Ms. Go said.

449
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,100
She can't even speak English
and she's working abroad?

450
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,810
- Is it a silent film?
- A Korean character.

451
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,650
Oh, man.

452
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,150
Who's the director?

453
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,740
Damien Chazelle.

454
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,320
What? Cha-what?

455
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,120
Damien Chazelle.

456
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,240
Are you sure?

457
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,330
I couldn't push her

458
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:44,120
to go for Lee Jeha's film
when she's working with Damien Chaz…

459
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:47,330
- <i>The receiver is not available…</i>
- Oh, come on.

460
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,210
What should we do?

461
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:53,050
The investors think both Kim Jungwoo
and Chae Seoyoung have been confirmed.

462
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:55,180
Don't tell this to Jeha yet,

463
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,260
but let's focus more on the male lead
since Jungwoo is the star.

464
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:02,390
I guess the female lead
could be the one we saw at the audition.

465
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,770
That's the worst-case scenario.

466
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:06,350
Try persuading Seoyoung
right until production begins,

467
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,440
and if she's in, then the rookie is out.

468
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,400
Yes, I'll make it happen.

469
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,280
- What about Ms. Go?
- She can't be in the picture.

470
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,830
We have to get Jeha
to talk directly to Seoyoung.

471
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:20,910
Okay?

472
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:36,510
Something wrong? You seem down.

473
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,890
I just came from the agency,
and now I have to go back.

474
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:42,010
I guess Ms. Go pulled something again?

475
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,640
Something like that.

476
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,060
I'll tell you when I get back.

477
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:48,310
Oh, I heard you went to see
the <i>Love in White </i>auditions.

478
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,860
Yes, they made a big thing out of it.

479
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,190
Should I do that too?

480
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:00,450
Why the face?

481
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:02,080
You wanted to do it with me.

482
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,200
Of course.

483
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,040
Let's just go.

484
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,720
HOW LONG

485
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:24,310
DO I NEED TO LIVE?

486
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,020
<i>Lee Daeum.</i>

487
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,320
<i>Adultery. Premeditated serial murder.</i>

488
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,240
<i>Maybe even become a ghost.</i>

489
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,280
How long do I need to live?

490
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,040
Six months?

491
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,880
A year?

492
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,340
Can you please tell me?

493
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,220
Well…

494
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,390
I guess…

495
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:06,890
Sorry, could you pass me that ball?

496
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,060
Oh, of course.

497
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,880
So how long do I need to live already?

498
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,930
What, you think
you're in <i>Autumn in My Heart</i>?

499
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,480
Here's your Americano.

500
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,890
Yes, thank you.

501
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,490
Mr. Lee.

502
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,240
I heard you want to be a writer.

503
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,910
What do you think is wrong with my script?

504
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,210
You can be straight with me.

505
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:15,880
Well…

506
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,000
Can I be frank then?

507
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,920
I'm not sure why you're doing a remake.

508
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:24,680
<i>Love in White </i>came out

509
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,260
right in the middle of the '90s
melodrama boom in the industry.

510
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,390
I think that classic sentiment
transcends both time and age.

511
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,690
I've never even been in love,
and even I get giddy.

512
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,270
Go on.

513
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:43,860
The way you've twisted Gyuwon's character
is really fascinating, but…

514
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,110
it feels hollow.

515
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:49,620
Like something essential is missing.

516
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:52,830
Let me guess. Love?

517
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,120
Of course, it's love.

518
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:58,880
Take away love,
and you lose the foundation

519
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,960
and the reason to remake the film
in the first place.

520
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,800
Oh, one more.

521
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,300
I want to know what Gyuwon wants to do

522
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,300
besides saving Hyunsang.

523
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,510
What were her dreams before she got sick?

524
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,480
It'd be even sadder
if she has a lot she wants to accomplish.

525
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,270
You scared me.

526
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:24,030
What are you doing here?
What about your shoot?

527
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,780
Obviously, I didn't go.

528
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,410
That darn Ms. Park.

529
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,910
Did you read the pitch?

530
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,160
Do I have to read it?

531
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,920
I know the original.

532
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,090
Of course you didn't.

533
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:43,800
Did you forget that I choose the scripts
that come to me?

534
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,420
Now that's a bit harsh.

535
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,970
We've been doing that all along.

536
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,970
<i>Love in White</i> was just an exception.

537
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,390
I want to do that movie.

538
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,560
You have no good reason to do that

539
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,440
when there are better directors
with better scripts who want you.

540
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,770
Better directors?

541
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,230
Better scripts?

542
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,570
What exactly makes them better?

543
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:05,900
Something worthy
of the actress Chae Seoyoung.

544
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,150
Yes, I'm an actress.

545
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,620
So I need a movie that I want to do.

546
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,490
Let's do that. Next time.

547
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,160
No, this time.

548
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:19,250
There's no good reason?
I want to do it, and that's reason enough.

549
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:21,670
That's how I work as an actress, Ms. Go.

550
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,340
<i>Once you get sick,</i>

551
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,720
<i>your life is completely different</i>
<i>from before your illness.</i>

552
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,640
<i>There's a reason why</i>
<i>they say ignorance is bliss.</i>

553
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,560
<i>What is it you want to do?</i>

554
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,470
<i>Why do I have so many things I want to do?</i>

555
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,560
<i>Yes, and that is my dream job.</i>

556
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,450
LEE DAEUM

557
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,950
THIS IS LEE JEHA

558
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,380
THIS IS LEE JEHA

559
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,550
Hello?

560
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,720
<i>Mr. Lee, this is Ms. Go.</i>
<i>Can I see you tomorrow?</i>

561
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,690
You work in places like this?

562
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,410
Yes, I need
some background noise to focus.

563
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,450
That's good.

564
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:37,700
This situation we're in
is getting a lot of noise, so focus.

565
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,750
I don't have any personal feelings
for or against you.

566
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:44,670
You know that, right?

567
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:47,300
I know what you're talking about,

568
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,550
but the script has…

569
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,840
been changed these past few weeks.

570
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,550
Especially the character.

571
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,550
I'm sorry to tell you that these changes

572
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,220
don't make Seoyoung
suitable for the role anymore.

573
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,640
That's good.

574
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,230
I didn't need to come at all.

575
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:10,490
Sorry I can't give her the lead role,
but I want to suggest

576
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,320
the role of Junghwa.

577
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,490
I think…

578
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,280
Seoyoung would want to do it.

579
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,040
Are you kidding?

580
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:23,250
I'm saying this
with my sincerest apologies to you.

581
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,630
Director Lee…

582
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,210
have you forgotten everything
or are you just pretending to?

583
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:36,220
You're the one who abandoned Seoyoung.

584
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,300
The nerve.

585
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,310
<i>Mr. Lee,</i>

586
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:45,440
you know how this industry works.
Why are you doing this?

587
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,650
You know if a scandal hits Seoyoung now,

588
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:51,190
it would tank her career
before it even takes off.

589
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,400
Ms. Go.

590
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,360
Why are you leaving me out?

591
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,990
Let me hear it too.

592
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,950
You've got to be kidding me.

593
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:03,830
You've already got four ad deals signed
and over five more lined up.

594
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:08,250
So what's the problem?
It's not like dating him will ruin me.

595
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:09,340
Just acknowledge it.

596
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:11,670
No, stop the press.

597
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,840
Director.

598
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:20,180
Yes, we're friendly.
But we've never crossed the line.

599
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,640
I'd like to apologize if I did anything

600
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,100
to make her think otherwise.

601
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,110
<i>That was the first time</i>

602
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:32,780
<i>that Seoyoung got completely wrecked.</i>

603
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,570
She should've been the one to dump you.

604
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,870
I won't…

605
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:42,620
be fooled by you a second time.

606
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:57,430
LOVE IN WHITE

607
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,390
<i>Love in White</i>.

608
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,930
Do as I say for just one month.

609
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,900
DIRECTOR LEE JEHA

610
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:19,200
THIS IS LEE JEHA. I KNOW
IT'S LATE, BUT CAN WE MEET?

611
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,670
Hey there, little girl.

612
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,000
Want to see something cool?

613
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:57,780
SEAWEED SNACK

614
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,700
That act is a bit too much,
don't you think?

615
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,780
What act?

616
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,870
That's the snack they normally eat

617
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,080
at funeral homes.

618
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:14,880
I tried these there last time

619
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,800
and got totally hooked.

620
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,840
Do you stay at the hospital,
or your own place?

621
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:28,600
I don't give my address to men.

622
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,140
You see me as a man?

623
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,570
Well, you're not a woman.

624
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,570
You're not even offering me those?

625
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,930
Mmm.

626
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:04,720
How should I put it?

627
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,550
A subtle taste…

628
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,560
that really hooks you.

629
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,890
A subtle taste that hooks you.

630
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,690
How did you do
that drinking thing earlier?

631
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:21,570
Want me to show you?

632
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,240
No, it's fine.

633
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,320
I wanted to consult…

634
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:31,950
…you…

635
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,250
There's something I wanted to ask you.

636
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:42,470
I failed the audition,
but you still want to consult me?

637
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:53,520
Go on, ask me anything.

638
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:58,110
Was there something you wanted to do?

639
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:00,400
I told you last time, didn't I?

640
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,570
Adultery, murder, ghost.

641
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:05,200
No, not what you'd do in movies.

642
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,080
You know, a normal dream you've had.

643
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:10,830
Dream?

644
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:17,790
I want to tell you
something ambitious, but…

645
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,630
I want to leave something
for the people I love.

646
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,760
Like what?

647
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:32,220
Memories of me they can always bring up.

648
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,690
Ah.

649
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:38,770
So now we're in…

650
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:42,360
the "dream" phase
of that closure you wanted?

651
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:47,030
There's just so much left undone.

652
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:51,450
That kind of regret
makes you go a little too crazy.

653
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,830
There's so much I haven't done,

654
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:56,910
but it's not like I can do it "later."

655
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,250
So that's why you want to be in movies.

656
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:01,250
Because I can do everything in there.

657
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:04,920
The love I never had.
Goodbyes I don't want to say.

658
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:09,970
And I want myself to live free
and go wild like this…

659
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:13,430
in those movies

660
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,140
so people can see that whenever they want.

661
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,730
- Like who?
- My dad.

662
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,110
My mom passed a long time ago,

663
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,530
so if I leave, too,

664
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:27,700
then my dad is really alone.

665
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:33,490
You can consult me, too, if you want.
I'm also alone.

666
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:37,790
Hey, now.

667
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:40,210
This is getting too dark.

668
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:42,080
Let's not talk about my dad, okay?

669
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:44,670
I didn't.
You were the one who brought him up.

670
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:49,130
Hang on.

671
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:15,080
That was the first audition I passed
for a role with a name and lines.

672
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,500
It was just the first round,

673
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,580
but I felt good about the second.

674
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,460
I had prepared so hard…

675
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,460
That's when you first got sick?

676
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,510
The day I was admitted
was the day of the second round.

677
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,390
But I'm pretty realistic
for a terminal patient.

678
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:40,020
I knew I had to live first.

679
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:42,940
So I told myself,

680
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:46,730
"I'll survive and come back
for another audition."

681
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:49,530
So I walked away, swallowing my tears.

682
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,320
Is that so?

683
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,530
Yes, it was so.

684
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:00,960
That must've been hard.
I know hospital life isn't easy.

685
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,290
Not at all.

686
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:03,870
I was super busy.

687
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,290
I kept acting.

688
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,340
I had nothing but time.

689
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:13,380
I mean, sure, it wasn't
in front of those big cameras on set,

690
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,180
but a tiny one the size of my palm,

691
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,310
but I tried
every kind of character I wanted.

692
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,560
You live so hard.

693
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,020
I guess I shouldn't assume things,

694
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,810
since you keep proving me wrong.

695
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,400
Mr. Lee…

696
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:34,570
Knowing your time is running out,

697
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,070
it's a strange kind of rush.

698
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:46,380
Everyone!

699
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:49,630
You think you have a lot of days to live?

700
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:52,590
You think you'll live forever?

701
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:57,050
You think you'll stay healthy

702
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:00,180
until you're 40, 70, 80,

703
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:02,220
and even 100, right?

704
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,640
Who's she shouting at?

705
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:07,560
But life works in mysterious ways!

706
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:10,190
You always forget, don't you?

707
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:13,320
But I never forget!

708
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:17,240
I've been preparing for this
since I was eight years old,

709
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,330
so every second of every minute
is so precious

710
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:22,080
and so valuable to me

711
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,710
that they're all masterpieces!

712
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:28,540
All the moments you just let slip away

713
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:31,340
are like romance or fantasy films to me!

714
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:35,590
But you'll keep on living
without knowing that!

715
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:39,510
You idiots!

716
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:57,450
That kind of rush.

717
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:00,570
What are you doing?

718
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:02,580
Honestly,

719
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:06,160
it'd make more sense
to cast me as an actress,

720
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:09,420
instead of using me for consulting.

721
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,250
It'd make more sense
for you to head back in.

722
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:13,920
It's cold.

723
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:27,940
Good night then.

724
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,610
You know,

725
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:42,990
I really want

726
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:46,120
to make this movie with you.

727
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:50,670
Can't I be a part of it?

728
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:00,340
Wait!

729
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,720
Why…

730
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,600
does it have to be me?

731
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:11,060
- Sorry?
- Why do you want to make a film

732
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:13,480
with me?

733
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:20,320
I don't know.

734
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:26,700
I just…

735
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:30,540
had the feeling

736
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:34,380
you might give me a chance!

Hey, Hong.

743
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:47,120
Sorry to call you this late.

744
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:53,960
- Dad.
- Yeah?

745
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,620
- I'm home.
- Hey.

746
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:59,130
Hey, Mom.

747
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:01,880
Mom.

748
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,170
How have you been?

749
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,680
What's all this?

750
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:12,810
Vietnamese spring rolls.

751
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,190
Not exactly traditional for a memorial.

752
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:18,610
I want us to eat some trendy stuff
instead of the usual.

753
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:21,280
I like it.

754
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:27,030
You know, Gyoyeong says
you and I have "cool syndrome."

755
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,200
What's that?

756
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,330
Well…

757
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:33,750
Pretending to be too cool with each other,
and overdoing it.

758
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:37,920
How can I be cool
when my daughter is about to die?

759
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Cool?

760
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,540
Freeze me to death, will ya?

761
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,840
Hey, I want to be cool, too, you know.

762
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:50,970
So then, in the spirit of being cool,

763
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:54,480
could you make me an outpatient
and let me act again?

764
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,690
What are you saying?

765
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,310
I want to act.

766
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,320
I want to act again.

767
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:05,570
No.

768
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,490
- Dad, please.
- I said no.

769
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:10,870
- Just once, please.
- No.

770
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:14,500
What if you pass out like last time?

771
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:16,750
How could I

772
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:20,080
face your mom again
if I go easy on your treatment--

773
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:22,210
That's just your perspective, Dad.

774
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:23,340
I won't allow it.

775
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:24,840
Dad.

776
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,590
Your view is different
from mine and Mom's.

777
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:29,930
You still don't get that?

778
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,600
Mom always wanted to come home.

779
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,680
But…

780
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:39,310
She couldn't.

781
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,110
She wanted to die here at home,

782
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:45,150
but she passed away at the hospital

783
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:47,860
while you were in surgery
and I was at school.

784
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:50,490
She died all alone with no one there.

785
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,330
Dad.

786
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:56,580
I'm her daughter.

787
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,620
Maybe that's why

788
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,420
I don't want to die in a hospital either.

789
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,380
No.

790
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,430
I said no.

791
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,560
CONGRATULATIONS ON PASSING ROUND
1 OF "WHITE IN LOVE" AUDITIONS

792
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:07,820
My goodness!

793
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:12,910
Yes! Yes!

794
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:19,750
Great, you're here.

795
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:22,790
Say hello.

796
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:24,960
- Hello.
- Yes.

797
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,170
Great to see you.
I've been hoping to meet you,

798
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:30,880
so I've been pestering Mr. Bu for a while.

799
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,260
HAN SUNGHO

800
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,680
<i>Actually,</i>

801
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,470
I don't know much about movies,
to be honest.

802
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:41,980
I leave that part to the artists.

803
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:46,310
I'm just a businessman who cares about
whether this will make money,

804
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,400
and how much money it'll make.

805
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,030
That's what matters to me.

806
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:52,740
Why would you talk yourself down?

807
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:54,280
He's being too modest.

808
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,110
A movie just on its own

809
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,620
is not enough anymore these days.

810
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:01,450
You know what I'm saying, right?

811
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:10,880
I'm curious, what did you think
of the original <i>Love in White</i>?

812
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:13,380
Never seen it.

813
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:16,930
Then…

814
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:20,260
Have you seen my adaptation plan?

815
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:21,680
Well,

816
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,850
I heard the gist.

817
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:30,270
I'm not copying some dusty old film.

818
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,820
It'll be something completely new.

819
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:34,700
I wanted to be up-front about that.

820
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:37,780
I see, but do I really need to know that?

821
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:40,830
Do you think that's important to me?

822
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,790
You're only investing because…

823
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,670
I'm Lee Duyoung's son, right?

824
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:50,290
That's all that matters to you.

825
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:53,420
Ah. Our director here sure is candid.

826
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:54,920
Says it like it is.

827
00:55:56,170 --> 00:55:58,470
Most people wouldn't agree to do this.

828
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:03,430
My father made the film
a year after my mother passed

829
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:07,230
with the very actress he was rumored
to be having an affair with.

830
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:11,610
They shamelessly pour out this ode to love
as if they were finally free.

831
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,070
People think…

832
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:18,910
it's a heartfelt tribute to the dead wife
that he made in grief,

833
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:22,080
and they praise it
like it's something noble.

834
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:24,160
Forget the film.

835
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:26,290
It's the story behind the film.

836
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:28,920
That's where the real fun is.

837
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:35,340
I know this film and what needs fixing
better than anyone.

838
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:37,300
And I promise,

839
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,430
you won't lose a cent.

00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:58,450
It's me, Daeum!

842
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:01,820
Could you wake her up?

843
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:06,790
Leave her. She must've come in
in the morning again.

844
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:10,330
Take some of this food when you go later.

845
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:11,500
About time for a refill.

846
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:14,000
Aren't these elephant bush stems?

847
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:16,300
Are you marinating them in perilla oil?

848
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:19,930
I'll stir-fry them
with a ton of perilla oil.

849
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:22,300
Thank you.

850
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:25,060
Instead of me…

851
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,390
Instead of me…

852
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:32,310
Oh, she's driving me nuts.
Can you just go and wake her up?

853
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:39,150
Gyo.

854
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,780
What happened to you?

855
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:45,280
- Huh? Daeum.
- Yeah?

856
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:48,830
I told you not to wake me up like this.

857
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:52,420
Why are your eyes so puffy?

858
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:54,540
I dumped him.

859
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,840
You're such a sucker for cute faces.
What did I tell you?

860
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:01,760
You have to get to know them first
before dating them.

861
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,510
Who asked for your two cents?

862
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:07,100
I'll have you know,
that's a hereditary trait.

863
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:09,520
My mom fell for my dad's face too.

864
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:15,560
Oh, right.

865
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:18,070
- Did you go back home?
- Yeah.

866
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:19,150
How's your dad?

867
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:20,280
Fine.

868
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:23,410
I told him everything, you know.

869
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:25,570
How you said we're both

870
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:28,240
riddled with "cool syndrome."

871
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:31,040
What?

872
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:34,000
Jeez! Why would you tell him that?

873
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,330
Seriously!

874
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:37,090
I can't even slap you.

875
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:40,380
Well, anyway.

876
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,930
Just make sure
your next relationship goes well.

877
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:45,260
What?

878
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:47,350
Hmm?

879
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:52,930
Spit it out. Something happened, right?

880
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:58,690
- The clinical trial?
- My audition!

881
00:58:58,770 --> 00:58:59,780
What did you say?

882
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:02,440
I auditioned for a movie.

883
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,450
How did you do that?

884
00:59:06,530 --> 00:59:09,080
I just barged in and did it.

885
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,200
You know what happened?

886

What is it?

888
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:22,920
What happened? What is it?

889
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:24,760
Is it a cockroach?

890
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:27,970
- Mom.
- Let me see.

891
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:29,470
CONGRATULATIONS ON PASSING ROUND
1 OF "WHITE IN LOVE" AUDITIONS

892
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:35,020
Congratulations!

893
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,190
I'm so happy for you.

894
00:59:43,650 --> 00:59:45,070
Please tell me two things.

895
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:47,410
"Well done."

896
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:50,280
and "Good luck."

897
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:54,330
Well done.

898
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:55,830
Good luck.

899
00:59:56,830 --> 00:59:59,040
Well done! Good luck!

900
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:09,850
I see you've mostly worked on short films.

901
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:11,300
- Yes.
- Right.

902
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:14,890
What do you do in your free time
when you're not acting?

903
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:18,100
I work as a freelance translator.

904
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:20,560
How have you been after the first round?

905
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,270
I've been well, thank you.

906
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,650
What have you been up to?

907
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,950
I went to some university hospitals
to do research on Gyuwon.

908
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:29,070
University hospitals?

909
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,030
Okay, Taerin.

910
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,370
That's enough for today. Thank you.

911
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:34,910
Okay, thank you.

912
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:40,000
- Take care, Mr. Lee.
- Goodbye.

913
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:57,020
Oh, no.

914
01:00:57,770 --> 01:00:59,190
I'm sorry, Dr. Lee.

915
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:02,690
Why? What happened?

916
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:06,990
Daeum is gone.

917
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,790
Lee Daeum is coming in.

918
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:22,880
- Thank you.
- You got this.

919
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:23,960
I got this.

920
01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:41,060
Hello!

921
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:42,850
Yes, hello.

922
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:45,150
Take a seat.

923
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:54,120
So I've analyzed the character.

924
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:02,000
You're not here to act
or analyze the character today.

925
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,710
Instead,

926
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:05,040
let's have a chat.

927
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:06,590
Just the two of us.

928
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:09,510
Just the two of us?

929
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:10,590
Yes.

930
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:12,340
You know,

931
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,430
just chat like you normally do.

932
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:18,350
Okay, Mr. Lee.

933
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:23,140
Don't let the camera bother you.

934
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:25,190
We won't use this footage for anything.

935
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:29,030
Relax, and talk how you normally do to me.

936
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:37,780
Don't you think this character
and this film are too cliché?

937
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:39,580
I do.

938
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:44,830
You do?

939
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,340
Some people might even find it boring.

940
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,750
Seems like you find it boring too.

941
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:53,550
But it'll never be boring to me.

942
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:56,680
When that "terminal illness" cliché
is your life,

943
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,600
every day feels like
the climax of a movie.

944
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:04,230
This will be real method acting.

945
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:10,320
It sounds like you're okay
with this movie using your illness.

946
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:12,360
But you already did.

947
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,570
You used my words in your script.

948
01:03:17,070 --> 01:03:18,620
I'll change the lines then.

949
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:23,000
Have you found someone better than me?

950
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,080
We're searching.

951
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:29,130
Don't waste your time like that.

952
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:32,170
I just don't see this happening.

953
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:37,180
I want to forget about my illness
and live as an actress.

954
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:40,060
There's a difference between forgetting

955
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:41,680
and overlooking.

956
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:49,940
I'm attending an audition right now,

957
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:53,780
so please see me as an actress,
not a sick person.

958
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:14,630
There were over 200 videos
of you doing monologues.

959
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:16,880
I wanted to ask…

960
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:22,310
what drove you to come this far

961
01:04:23,890 --> 01:04:25,430
even while you were sick?

962
01:04:26,310 --> 01:04:28,020
When I was eight,

963
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:31,820
I asked my mom lying in the hospital bed

964
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:34,360
what her dream was.

965
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,030
I still remember the face she made.

966
01:04:39,490 --> 01:04:41,490
If she ever got to leave the hospital,

967
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:44,120
she said she wanted to find
the dream that she had forgotten.

968
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:47,080
I don't know what her dream was,

969
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,870
but it sure wasn't being a patient.

970
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:51,500
Same goes for me.

971
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:56,510
That's the kind of thinking
that brought me here.

972
01:04:57,470 --> 01:04:59,180
I don't know if that makes sense.

973
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:12,690
Are you hungry?

974
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,320
Give me 10 minutes.

975
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,240
Mr. Lee,

976
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:23,660
even though I'm sick,

977
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,700
I can still watch movies,
go to auditions, and even love.

978
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:29,250
So I can make movies too.

979
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,420
I can do everything. I really can.

980
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,090
Just let me prove that to you.

981
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,130
That's enough for today.

982
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:40,380
You may leave now.

983
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:42,640
We'll let you know the results.

984
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,520
Thank you.

985
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:07,160
Mr. Lee.

986
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:09,750
Yes?

987
01:06:11,790 --> 01:06:13,040
Put your faith in me.

988
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,170
What exactly do you have
that I can put my faith in?

989
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:21,170
A plan…

990
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:23,050
and guts.

991
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:31,270
Looks flimsy to me.

992
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:34,190
But I like your spirit.

993
01:07:08,970 --> 01:07:10,220
I have one condition.

994
01:07:15,810 --> 01:07:17,020
Don't die.

995
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:05,740
<i>Everyone knows</i>
<i>Chae Seoyoung should get the part.</i>

996
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:08,610
<i>Why are you so stuck on Lee Daeum?</i>

997
01:08:09,490 --> 01:08:10,990
<i>What is it about her?</i>

998
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:12,700
A rookie?

999
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:14,160
You just need to do it.

1000
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:16,000
<i>I'll make it happen.</i>

1001
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:18,540
<i>What's this?</i>

1002
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:20,380
<i>We're deciding if the role of Gyuwon</i>

1003
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:22,250
<i>should go to Chae Seoyoung</i>
<i>or you, a rookie.</i>

1004
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:24,840
<i>Did you read the script?</i>

1005
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:26,720
<i>Are you interested?</i>

1006
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:28,760
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

1007
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:37,060
