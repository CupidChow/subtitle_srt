ANY RESEMBLANCE
TO ACTUAL PEOPLE, PLACES,

3
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:33,617
OR MEDICAL CONDITIONS
IS COINCIDENTAL.

4
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,785
CHILD ACTORS
WERE ALWAYS SUPERVISED

5
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,953
AND SAFELY FILMED
UNDER GUIDELINES.

6
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,232
There’s a warm moment
at the end of every film

7
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,359
where it reads the names
of everyone involved.

8
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,821
Until that final moment arrives,

9
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,823
movies, like life,

10
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,118
race tirelessly toward the ending.

11
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,086
Ready.

12
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,755
Action!

13
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,864
And sometimes…

14
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,161
just when we think the ending is here…

15
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,628
that's when life begins.

OUR MOVIE

00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:59,721
EPISODE 1

18
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,601
The two lead actors
of The Lonely People,

19
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,812
who delivered outstanding performances

20
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,480
with a wide range of emotions,

21
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,607
Chae Seoyoung and Kim Sungwoo.

22
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,275
Please say hello.

23
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,194
Great.

24
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,822
Please look toward your right.

25
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,158
Now please look toward your bottom right.

26
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,787
Could you look toward your left now?

27
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,498
A lot of photographers are here today.

28
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,708
And back to center, please.

29
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,963
Could we ask the two of you
for a charming pose?

30
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:37,175
You both look so lovely.

31
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,221
THE LONELY PEOPLE

32
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,142
We just received some very sad news.

33
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,893
Jeha.
One of Korea's greatest directors,

34
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,562
Mr. Lee Duyoung,

35
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,148
has passed away at the age of 70.

36
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,192
The press event
will now take a brief pause

37
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,862
per the production company's request.

38
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,452
5 YEARS LATER

39
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,454
You better come to the premiere tomorrow.

40
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,789
It's at 2:00 p.m., okay? Don't forget.

41
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,291
Have some decency, will you?

42
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,750
This is Chae Seoyoung's big return

43
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:14,337
and everyone except for camera, from art
and music to editing and color grading,

44
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:18,383
they're all from The Lonely People team!
On top of it all, I'm the producer again.

45
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,469
Every single person here
got their start with you.

46
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,972
If you don't show up,
you're no better than an animal, man.

47
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:28,018
So please,
come out into the world again, okay?

48
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,687
And as for Seoyoung…

49
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,689
Well, I'll make sure
you don't run into her.

50
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:37,360
Why are you bringing her up?
There's nothing between us now.

51
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,154
Look at that, he's alive.

52
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:43,658
Also, there's the thing
I mentioned a while ago.

53
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,327
Are you really not doing Love in White--

54
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,378
LOVE IN WHITE

55
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,422
"White"? What a joke.

56
00:04:58,924 --> 00:04:59,925
THE CHASE

57
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,260
"Sophomore slump."

58
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,012
Do you know that phrase?

59
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:08,058
It's also known as the second-year slump.

60
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,811
It's when an athlete or artist

61
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,814
has a great first season or debut project,

62
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:18,360
but then takes quite a while
to get to the next one.

63
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,197
It's not so different
from our own lives, is it?

64
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:26,159
Even in romance.
Getting to that first kiss is one thing,

65
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:30,497
but figuring out how to land the second?
That's the real challenge.

66
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,502
It's Tuesday, the second day of the week,
and I'm your host Joo Hyunyoung.

67
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,806
Are you all right?

68
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,937
Yes, I'm completely fine.

69
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:55,730
I'm fine!

70
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,109
Thank you.

71
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,194
Thank you. Thank you.

72
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:04,030
Thank you!

73
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,265
Skip to the 2:40 and 20:18 marks.

74
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:31,850
For what?

75
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,228
You know, the stuff
Park's only good at directing.

76
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,481
I don't know why,

77
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,067
but Chae Seoyoung being a divorcée

78
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,278
just makes it hotter, doesn't it?

79
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:47,991
Well, being divorced is hip now.
But are there only two scenes of that?

80
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,244
Quality over quantity, my friend.
It's Director Park.

81
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,705
I bet those love scenes are killer.

82
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:56,833
You're all disgusting.

83
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:02,130
Excuse me, were you talking to me?

84
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,384
Yes.

85
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:07,469
Get out of my way.

86
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,012
I'm trying to get off.

87
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:19,064
Hey. Isn't that bastard Lee Jeha?

88
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,231
Lee Jeha?

89
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,901
Oh, Lee Duyoung's son.

90
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,153
What, has he been in mourning
for three years?

91
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,489
No, it's been way more than three years.

92
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,532
Why is he here all of a sudden?

93
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,745
"THE DISCOVERY OF ROMANCE"
PRESS AND INDUSTRY SCREENING

94
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,297
Hello, everyone.

95
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,633
I'm the producer, Bu Seungwon.

96
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,219
Thank you so much for coming.

97
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:53,515
Hello! I'm Park Byeongsik,
director of Discovery of Romance.

98
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:59,437
Honestly, I was fueled by anger.

99
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,399
The rumors were nonstop after my divorce,

100
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,402
so I thought I'd just show them
what I could do.

101
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,695
See?

102
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,822
Isn't it nice
to be out like this for once?

103
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,867
I only came because you asked me
to fill a seat, but this place is packed.

104
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,953
I've shown my face, so I'm leaving.

105
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,621
Come on, where are you going?

106
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,666
We still have stuff to talk about.
Not interested.

107
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,502
Seriously, man?
I'll keep trying until you are.

108
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,133
I can't even write my own stuff,
and you want me to do a remake?

109
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,636
You talk about Love in White
like it's some film by a stranger.

110
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,221
This is your father's film.

111
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,639
Your father wasn't a stranger.

112
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:38,017
We're only connected biologically.
I cut ties with him a long time ago.

113
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,649
And who even likes
that kind of melodrama anymore?

114
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,901
Just stick to what you know,
the stuff that makes money.

115
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,445
Like that.

116
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,613
Melodrama or not,

117
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,575
if I lay my finger on it,
it rakes in the money.

118
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,619
I tried to portray the character

119
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,872
with more subtlety and depth.

120
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,542
I think I was too sensitive
throughout the shoot.

121
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,960
Right, Mr. Park?
No!

122
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,378
Of course not.

123
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,630
Seoyoung's still stunning, right?

124
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,009
She's still got it even after her divorce.

125
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,804
Wait, that look.

126
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,723
The stuff of romance films.

127
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,396
Looks like you're not done
with that story.

128
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,025
What's left to tell, after all this time?

129
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,694
Look, you can take
what you've been writing for five years

130
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,446
and shop it around, but it won't work.

131
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,324
You've got to learn to let things go.

132
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:38,036
I haven't made the movie
I want to make either.

133
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,414
But I feel like it could happen
if you help me, man.

134
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,084
I'm not asking you to make anything weird.

135
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,295
This was your father's--
Seungwon.

136
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:49,839
I'm not doing it.

137
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:50,924
I just…

138
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,593
despise that film.

139
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,435
You know,

140
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,647
what if we surround these alliums
with baby's breath?

141
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,524
Would that be weird?

142
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,276
If I did it, it might work.

143
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,904
If you did it, it might be a disaster.

144
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,115
Got it.

145
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,992
Why do you never
take your nice arrangements home?

146
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,244
This is all money, you know.

147
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,413
I know! It does seem like such a waste.

148
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,207
Then just take them.

149
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,001
I can't.

150
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,212
I'll get in trouble if I do.

151
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,257
Did you all enjoy the movie?

152
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,759
Here's Director Lee.
I had to drag him over here.

153
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,554
Director Lee.

154
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,472
This is Director Joo Inyoung.

155
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:42,225
She went to film school
and won an award at Mise-en-scène.

156
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:43,977
I'm a big fan.

157
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,312
The Lonely People was sensational.

158
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,565
Thank you for the kind words.

159
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,861
Ah. Jeha, Chae Seoyoung and I
all had our debut with that one.

160
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:56,531
Honestly, Seoyoung wouldn't have
come this far if it wasn't for that film.

161
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,615
Same goes for me.

162
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,409
I'll never get used to that.

163
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,120
Oh! Speak of the devil.
It's always tough.

164
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,621
Great job putting yourself out there!

165
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,207
Congratulations.
Good work, everyone.

166
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,459
Congrats.
What? Mr. Lee?

167
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,211
You're really here.

168
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,296
Yes.

169
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,840
Oh, I've heard a lot about you.

170
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,593
I appreciate you coming. My goodness.

171
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,719
Here.

172
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,101
I never thought you'd show up, Jeha.

173
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:26,853
What did you think of the film?

174
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,148
Well, time just flew by.

175
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,110
Right, because you get totally sucked in.

176
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,946
Who would've thought
it would turn out this good? No one.

177
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,408
You've won a ton of awards,
so you'd probably know.

178
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,411
Do you think we've got a shot
at winning anything?

179
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,625
We have to win. Absolutely.

180
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,212
But you know, no one's ever won
both Best Screenplay and Best Director

181
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,671
for their debut since Lee here.

182
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,716
It was a romance
and it pulled five million people.

183
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,303
Whether you're an actor or a director,
your first project is everything.

184
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,638
It's the start that matters.

185
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:06,267
It's what comes after that matters,
whether you're an actor or a director.

186
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,774
Sorry, but I have to head out now.

187
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,317
Excuse me.

188
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,653
Mr. Lee.

189
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,155
You're not busy, are you?

190
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,493
If you are, ditch it.

191
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,787
It's been a while. Let's talk.

192
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,833
Hello!

193
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:31,918
Hi!

194
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,419
Hello.

195
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:34,712
Have you eaten yet?

196
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,049
Hello!
Hello.

197
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,342
Good to see you!

198
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,637
How's it going, everyone?

199
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,014
I'll just write this quickly
and go change.

200
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,393
Lee Daeum, the busiest person alive.
Are you seeing someone these days?

201
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,230
Why must you rub salt

202
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,607
in my very open wound?

203
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,234
I had dreams too, you know.

204
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,988
In movies and TV,
everyone falls in love in hospitals.

205
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:03,449
So why is someone
as gorgeous as me still single?

206
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,244
Can't speak for your love life,
but Dr. Kim was looking for you.

207
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,413
Give him a call.
Eh.

208
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,914
Looking for me again?

209
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,587
Hello.

210
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,672
Hello.

211
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,756
TASTY RAMYEON

212
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,384
Come in.

213
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,471
Why, it's Da-da-da Daeum.

214
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,854
Wow, that must've been heavy.

215
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,856
I feel bad for always taking from you.

216
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,776
What kind of doctor lives on cup noodles
and instant coffee every day?

217
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,445
You're gonna end up with diabetes.

218
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,447
What the heck is this?

219
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,532
You know I don't like trying new stuff.

220
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,786
Exactly why I brought something
a little healthier this time.

221
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,039
Healthier, you say?

222
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,334
What, does it
contain protein or something?

223
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,337
Well, thank you then.

224
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,758
All right.

225
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,057
Mmm.

226
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,642
It tastes better too, hmm?

227
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,438
So you've been
leaving the hospital a lot lately.

228
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,524
It's a secret.

229
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,613
I'm just curious, that's all.

230
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:30,036
What, is there anything fun
going on out in the world?

231
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,704
Shh.

232
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,129
I know Mr. Park
likes to mix soju and beer.

233
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,214
Now…

234
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,341
Ready, action.

235
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,509
That's perfect.

236
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,394
What are you up to these days?

237
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,773
Uh, me?

238
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:03,903
What does a director always do?
Prepare for his next movie.

239
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:09,117
Now I'm really curious
about what kind of movie you're planning.

240
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,577
What kind of masterpiece would it be?

241
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,872
Aren't you curious, Seoyoung?
Pass me some napkins.

242
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,042
Napkins, behind you.

243
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,253
Oh, yes. Here they are.

244
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:21,963
Here you go, Mr. Park.

245
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,513
All right.

246
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,890
Why don't you drink up?

247
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,395
Looks refreshing.

248
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,108
It's a romance film.

249
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,443
You know, what Lee is best at.

250
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,695
He's making one with me.

251
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,657
You ask any director on a break,

252
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,286
and they always say
they're preparing the next one.

253
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,454
They make one hit,

254
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,624
and then poof,
they're gone without a trace.

255
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,377
But you said Mr. Lee's different.

256
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:07,216
And you really are different,
seeing how you showed up here.

257
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,139
What's so different? I'm the same.

258
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,434
But it seems like you've taken
quite an interest in me. It's a bit much.

259
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,561
Well, sorry if I made you uncomfortable.

260
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,023
What was it like
when you two were together?

261
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,570
Must have been a pretty tough shoot.

262
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,573
Your knack for rudeness
really mirrors your directing style.

263
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:33,784
I'm going to get some air.

264
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:50,051
You do know
humility isn't your thing, right?

265
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:53,221
I honestly have no idea
where that ego of yours comes from.

266
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,223
Hey now, come on.

267
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:58,309
Would you both cut it out?
Please.

268
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,479
At least I'm still making movies
one after another.

269
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,273
Isn't that what a director's
supposed to do?

270
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,235
Movies full of out-of-context
love scenes and nudity?

271
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,071
The kind people only skip
to whatever the "good part" is?

272
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,116
Don't you feel sorry
for those poor actors?

273
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,956
I don't know how you can laugh
after wasting such talent.

274
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,169
Go easy

275
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,463
on the soju bombs.

276
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,091
And those box office bombs too.

277
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:34,095
If this one flops too,
that's what, three? No…

278
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,639
four in a row, is it?

279
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:38,724
Hey!

280
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,060
What the hell did you just say to me?

281
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,603
"If it flops"?

282
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,897
It's only the premiere
and you say that crap?

283
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,107
You rat!
Let's not do this.

284
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,317
Mouthing off to someone
who's done this longer than you.

285
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,820
Let's take a smoke break, Mr. Park.
This little…

286
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,113
Get some air, okay?

287
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,408
Look what this industry has become!

288
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,245
Did you have to go that far?

289
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,831
That was seriously out of line.

290
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,834
You can't deny his movie was good.

291
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,127
The Lonely People?

292
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,461
Sure, it was solid.

293
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,047
But was it really a film
five million people needed to see?

294
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:13,301
Will you keep it down?
The big debut from the master's son!

295
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,303
You're embarrassing yourself.

296
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,930
We were all just curious
what the late Lee Duyoung

297
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,975
would have thought about it.
We get it. You can stop now.

298
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,811
That's the only reason
five million people went to see it!

299
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,646
Unbelievable. Please calm down.

300
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,610
Seriously, who does he think he is?

301
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,405
He's just jealous of you.

302
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:36,657
It's inferiority complex.

303
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,328
I'll bring him over,
so let's clear the air, okay?

304
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,331
What misunderstanding?
They were purely facts.

305
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,460
That's low, beating me down
with stone-cold facts.

306
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,964
Congratulations. And sorry too,
for killing the vibe.

307
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,716
Come on, don't leave yet.

308
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,635
No, I'll stay buried a little longer.

309
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:56,761
Not as Lee Jeha,

310
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,680
but as "Lee Duyoung's son."

311
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,475
Fine, get outta here.

312
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,809
We'll talk later.

313
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,187
CHOIDAEPO BBQ

314
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,984
Sure, there were some pointless nudity
and love scenes.

315
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,362
But I did it
because I liked the character.

316
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,657
So, I don't hate the film.

317
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,784
Though I don't like the director.

318
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,999
I'm sorry.

319
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,503
I know it doesn't mean much now…

320
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,716
But you were great.
I could tell how hard you must've worked.

321
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:41,055
You know,
my acting got better after the divorce.

322
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:44,433
Like how breaking up with you
finally set things in motion.

323
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,603
Maybe things only work well for me
when I end it with someone.

324
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,232
Should I just keep dating, break up,

325
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,484
get remarried, break up again, and repeat?

326
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,862
Want to make me a better actor
and date me for a bit?

327
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,949
You're drunk. That's enough for tonight.

328
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,286
Director Lee.

329
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:14,797
Do you still love me?

330
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,511
If you don't, stop getting upset over me.

331
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,680
Don't act like you regret it.

332
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,227
It's not because of you. It's just…

333
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,480
After five years of being stuck,

334
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,942
it feels like I'm rotting away. That's it.

335
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,964
NO SMOKING ZONE

336
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,961
Oh.

337
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:20,881
Oh, was that your seat?

338
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:22,675
No, I'm leaving. You can stay.

339
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:23,759
No, wait.

340
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:27,429
Please sit.
It's fine, really.

341
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,516
I guess I'll stay then.

342
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,607
GRAPE 100

343
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,333
I wasn't looking because I wanted one.

344
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,593
Here.

345
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:07,219
Take one.

346
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:11,015
I don't want it.

347
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,898
Come on, just take one.

348
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,859
It's really okay. Please take it.

349
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:30,034
You didn't film me, right?
I feel like you did.

350
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,913
No, I didn't.
I saw the red light turn on.

351
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,708
No. I really didn't film you.

352
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:43,380
All right, then. Thanks for this.

353
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:46,508
Actually, I got that
from a "buy two, get one free" deal,

354
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:50,679
so this makes it like I just got two
for the price of two now.

355
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:51,805
Hmm…

356
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,974
But it's really okay.

357
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,730
It's my gift to you.

358
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,279
Okay.

359
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,955
Thank you!

360
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,166
I just wanted to thank you,

361
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:21,710
that's all.

362
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,839
Gosh, that's hot.

363
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,179
Who was that guy?

364
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,306
Someone you know?

365
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:52,408
I'm not sure if
I could say I know him or not.

366
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:54,868
What does that mean?

367
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,079
Is he hot?

368
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,292
He's not bad-looking.

369
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:03,711
Are you serious?

370
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:05,170
Like you would know.

371
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,588
You've never even dated.

372
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:07,965
Hey now,

373
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:11,301
there's a difference between
"not doing" and "not getting to."

374
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,763
Of course, there is.
Mmm.

375
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,933
So what's it like
to have never "gotten to" date anyone?

376
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:23,272
Freaking fantastic. Satisfied?

377
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:25,899
Hilarious.

378
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,030
Hey, what's this?

379
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:33,157
Where have you been running around lately?

380
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,366
Did you have a fall?

381
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,493
Ah.

382
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:39,705
This was just a plain old fall. That's it.

383
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,374
You know,
you've been acting strange lately.

384
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:47,254
Wait, wait, hang on.
I had something to ask you.

385
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,089
Look at this right here.

386
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:50,215
What do you think?

387
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,843
It looks tacky.

388
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,388
What about this?

389
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,182
Gives me grandma vibes.

390
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,683
"Grandma vibes"?

391
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:00,893
What's the occasion?

392
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:04,063
Fashion's all about when and where
you're going to wear it.

393
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,608
It's for an important day.

394
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,194
The most important day for me.

395
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:23,957
GRAPE 100

396
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:42,226
LOVE IN WHITE
SCREENPLAY BY LEE DUYOUNG

397
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:08,585
Stop!

398
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:12,923
Are you crazy?

399
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,091
Let me go!

400
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:17,302
Who are you to tell me what to do?

401
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,055
I…

402
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,809
have every right to destroy myself!

403
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:27,396
No one…

404
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:30,899
has the right to destroy themselves.

405
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,280
The only right we have is to love.

406
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,117
It's cold. Let's get out of here.

407
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,505
The door?

408
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:55,465
I closed it.

409
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,843
How's your health nowadays?

410
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,887
It'd be strange
if I was healthy at this age.

411
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,221
Don't worry about it.

412
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,807
Maybe it's time you took a step back.

413
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:07,060
There have been a lot of
young people coming in lately.

414
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:08,270
Even younger than you.

415
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,940
I told you,
young people don't watch this stuff.

416
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,692
Who even likes melodrama anymore?

417
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,660
Looks like there is one.

418
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:36,340
Oh.

419
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,633
No.

420
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,468
You don't know me.

421
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,511
No, no.

422
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:01,865
I found him.

423
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,328
KIM HYUNCHEOL

424
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,122
KIM JINYEO

425
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:11,041
LOVE IN WHITE

426
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,095
You came to see Love in White.

427
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:25,389
It's a great film, isn't it?

428
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:31,979
Maybe for people like you
who want to remember it that way.

429
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:36,400
Do you have something to say to me?

430
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,944
Yes. About Love in White.

431
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,905
You really want
to talk about that film with me?

432
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:45,200
I just thought
maybe you didn't understand it.

433
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:48,078
Love in White,

434
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:51,081
it's a truly beautiful love story.

435
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,918
I'm sure it's tear-jerkingly beautiful,
since it's all fake.

436
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:56,837
The second my mom passed,

437
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,506
you two went right ahead and made it
like nothing was in your way.

438
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:02,634
I guess you really don't understand

439
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,594
what the writer was feeling.

440
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,264
The viewer's feelings matter too.

441
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,477
For some people,
this film could be a filthy memory.

442
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,312
You still don't get that, do you?

443
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:18,400
I just hoped you'd understand
what this film really means.

444
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:20,902
And why would I need to?

445
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,530
You've only seen Love in White
as a finished production.

446
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:27,284
When you have time,
try reading the first draft.

447
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,037
As a writer yourself,
maybe if you read it--

448
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,330
We're not in any position
to be talking like this.

449
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,000
I'm sorry.

450
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,795
You're sorry? After all this time?

451
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,425
Well, that's funny.

452
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,844
Enjoy soaking up what's left of
dear Mr. Lee Duyoung.

453
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,600
The legendary director's masterpiece,

454
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,811
reimagined by his son for the modern era.

455
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:56,688
That's a movie in itself, isn't it?

456
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:57,814
Right.

457
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,608
He's not the type to say yes easily.

458
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,234
We'd have to set it up right.

459
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,820
We've already got Kim Jungwoo as the lead.

460
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:05,447
That's right, Korea's boyfriend.

461
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,365
So if we can just
get Chae Seoyoung on board--

462
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:13,121
Okay, sir.
I'll explain everything in person.

463
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:21,630
Isn't it about time you took those?

464
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,839
I told you to keep them.

465
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:25,884
They literally say "Lee Jeha".
How long am I supposed to hold on to them?

466
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,094
BEST DIRECTOR BEST SCREENPLAY

467
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:28,386
Next year,

468
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,681
Cannes is holding a special retrospective
for your father, Director Lee.

469
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:35,519
I'm getting the Love in White remake
into that lineup.

470
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,897
I'll get it in,
and you're going to make it.

471
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,858
Easy for you to say.

472
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:46,404
I think this could be your chance
to face everything head-on.

473
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,366
I'm not interested in going head-on.

474
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,910
I want to make something that's mine,
in my own name.

475
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,371
Do you even have any money?

476
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,624
Inheritance? Come on.
Everyone except Director Park knows

477
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:00,585
that your dad couldn't make
another film after Love in White

478
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,546
and just racked up debt.

479
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,589
You dumped all your money
into paying it off!

480
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,345
You know, this project…

481
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,972
LOVE IN WHITE

482
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,640
…actually went to Park first.

483
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,936
What did you just say?
So answer carefully.

484
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,355
If you keep refusing it,

485
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,732
it'll have to go back to Park.

486
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,484
Seungwon…

487
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:27,487
Exactly! This film
shouldn't be handled that way.

488
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,156
That's why I called you.

489
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,366
That's why I can't let it go.

490
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,702
Because I know
you're the best one for this job.

491
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,164
I don't think I have it in me
to do this right.

492
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:45,213
HOSPITAL
SHUTTLE BUS

493
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,051
TIME TO EAT

494
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:53,847
♪ Man, I was so close ♪

495
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,475
♪ Could've been on that bus ♪

496
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,647
Everything hurts
and falls apart at this age.

497
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:03,982
Why are you making a fuss?

498
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,359
Enough now!

499
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:07,819
Hospital stay?

500
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:09,237
You think money grows on trees?

501
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:10,906
I'm hanging up.

502
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,962
Excuse me.

503
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,132
Would you like some of this?

504
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,134
I'm fine.

505
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,553
Aren't you sweet? You go ahead.

506
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:35,263
I'm fasting right now anyway.

507
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,641
Ah. Okay.

508
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,115
Is there something on my face?

509
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,034
You're just pretty.

510
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,204
But you're way prettier than I am.

511
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,497
Oh, come on.

512
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:04,125
What's pretty about an old,
shriveled-up granny?

513
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:07,504
That's what makes you beautiful.

514
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,882
You really are much prettier.

515
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:16,721
You reached the end
of your savings plan!

516
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:17,806
Congratulations.

517
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:19,683
Yes, thank you.

518
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:20,976
How would you like to proceed?

519
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:24,229
Could you transfer the funds
to this account?

520
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,647
Of course, I can do that.

521
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,401
So that clears all the debt
tied to the house, right?

522
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,528
Must've been tough,
covering it month by month.

523
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,737
I'm happy for you.

524
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:34,906
Here's the key.

525
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,119
Five years was too long to pay it off.

526
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,997
I'm sorry.

527
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,082
I'm the one
who owes your father an apology.

528
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,543
Times got tough, you know.

529
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:49,879
It's okay. You didn't sell the house.

530
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,089
That's enough for me.

531
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:53,925
Take care.
You too.

532
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,432
That's that.
Keep up the good work, everyone.

533
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,601
Cheers!
Cheers!

534
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:45,810
Great work.

535
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:47,187
Let's dig in.

536
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,398
Mom.
Oh, my baby!

537
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:51,816
When did you get here?

538
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:55,820
Do you want a slice of apple? Here.

539
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,416
Don't forget to eat.

540
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,128
Try reading the first draft.

541
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:38,757
As a writer yourself,
maybe if you read it,

542
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,717
you'd understand the writer's feelings.

543
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,379
YU EUNAE

544
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:19,899
COMPLETED SEPTEMBER 17, 1996

545
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:22,569
SCREENPLAY BY YU EUNAE

546
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:29,075
LOVE IN WHITE

547
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:12,368
How could it be?

548
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:17,457
LOVE IN WHITE
SCREENPLAY BY YU EUNAE

549
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:54,744
I HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO DESTROY MYSELF

550
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:08,049
Scene 31 feels a bit flat to me.

551
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,803
What do you think, Nam?
You know, in Love in White.

552
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,473
The scene where they meet again.

553
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:16,975
Even when I was writing it,

554
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,687
I kept second-guessing myself, you know?

555
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,230
"Is this right?"

556
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,399
So I rewrote it again and again.

557
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,026
But you're telling me
it all came together?

558
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,446
That's the stuff
I need you all to look out for.

559
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:10,945
How's Seung…

560
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:14,574
No. How is Mr. Bu doing?

561
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,951
He never checks in since he went solo.

562
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,495
He's the same as always.

563
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,914
Seems to be doing well.

564
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,252
THE CHASE

565
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,213
BLACK SUN

566
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:34,302
You know how it is these days.
The market's tough.

567
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:39,849
You'll at least read it, right?
I think with a few tweaks--

568
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:43,227
Director Park sat on this one
for two years.

569
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:46,272
It didn't work out,
but the premise is solid.

570
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,482
Take a look.

571
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:51,360
Maybe you could give it a spin
in your own style, you know?

572
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:53,988
I'll pass.

573
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:56,824
Well, give me a call
if you change your mind.

574
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,910
Hello, Mr. Jeong!

575
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,411
Oh, Mr. Park.
Gosh.

576
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,582
Fancy seeing you here.

577
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,209
Right.

578
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:09,003
It would've been nice
to grab a meal together,

579
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,214
but I've got plans.

580
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,720
Sorry, I feel like I wasted your time.

581
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:19,514
No, please. Carry on.

582
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,977
I guess he knows
how to be polite to a producer.

583
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:30,274
I should get going.
Seems like you have plans with Mr. Park.

584
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:33,653
Yes, it's about the project
he's doing after Love in White.

585
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:35,404
Pardon?

586
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:37,907
Love… Love is White?

587
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,660
Oh, of course.
I heard you were at the top of the list,

588
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,829
but you turned it down for good.

589
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:45,498
Park said he's doing it in his usual,

590
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,166
you know, very sexual style.

591
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,335
At this rate, Love in White

592
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,671
might as well be Love in Red.

593
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,468
Hey, Lee!

594
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:10,106
If this one tanks,
how many in a row is that for you?

595
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:12,692
Are you really doing it?

596
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,569
You mean, Love in White?

597
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:17,280
I'm considering the offer.

598
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,407
I know you've only done one film,

599
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,535
but you're still a director.
You know how tacky that film is.

600
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,704
Of course, I know.

601
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,248
What, do I need
your permission or something?

602
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,000
To direct Love in White?

603
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:32,086
Would you back out if I said no?

604
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,550
You're still close with Seoyoung, right?

605
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:40,261
I've got her in mind
for another spicy role.

606
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,346
Can you put in a good word?

607
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,766
Don't want to?

608
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:47,476
No, I don't.

609
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:50,813
What the--

610
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,359
Why so scared?

611
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:57,570
You out of your mind? I'm your senior!

612
00:44:58,154 --> 00:44:59,197
You're right.

613
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,327
Maybe I am losing my mind.

614
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:24,931
LOVE IN WHITE
SCREENPLAY BY YU EUNAE

615
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:35,983
We need some serious
stripping for this genre to work.

616
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:39,987
Yeah, sure.
We've got to make it work.

617
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:43,616
Speaking of which,
can't we get Chae Seoyoung?

618
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:46,244
Not like last time.

619
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:49,705
This time, we explicitly state
the level of nudity in her contract…

620
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:51,457
GIVE ME TIME TO REWORK IT.
COLD NOODLES. YOUR TREAT.

621
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,917
…so she can't back out of it.

622
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,753
Why are you so obsessed
with stripping people down?

623
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,713
They'd catch a cold in this warm weather.

624
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:01,676
Our investor's starting drama again.

625
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,719
I'll call you, okay?

626
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,639
Wait, you're leaving?

627
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:07,932
Aren't we eating?

628
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:09,934
I'm heading out for the day.

629
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,143
Yes, sir.

630
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:14,313
PYEONGYANG COLD NOODLES

631
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:18,025
This was your plan all along, right?

632
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:20,194
I don't have plans.

633
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:23,531
I didn't have a reason to do it,
but now I do.

634
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:27,034
Let's make it better than your father's.

635
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:29,495
Whatever you want to do,

636
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,789
I'm here to support you 100%.

637
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:35,376
Okay, so we got the director.

638
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:39,005
And for actors, let's see…

639
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,882
How about Chae Seoyoung?

640
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:44,969
She absolutely lit up

641
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,513
when she heard you were directing again.

642
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:50,599
Maybe she still has a thing for you?

643
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:52,768
Go on at your own risk.

644
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:54,186
Can't you see it?

645
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,604
Back in the day,

646
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:59,150
she was just a rookie who'd cry all night
from one note you gave her…

647
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:02,028
…and now she's a heavyweight
in the industry.

648
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:04,572
She was married but is now single.

649
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,117
So you want me
to reel in the great Chae Seoyoung?

650
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,536
If you don't lock her in now,
you never will.

651
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,414
The timing's perfect.
She's loyal, you know.

652
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,833
I don't want to make a film
out of loyalty.

653
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,752
This is all about investment, man.

654
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,504
If Seoyoung signs on, the money follows.

655
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,631
I'd have to write the script first.

656
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,259
I'm not writing with anyone in mind.

657
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,804
Oh, and like I told you,

658
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:31,640
I need at least two months
for the rewrite.

659
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:35,728
Is there a way you can do it in one?

660
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:37,772
The original's from the '90s.

661
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:42,068
Updating it to the present day
changes more than you think.

662
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:47,698
What we need is realism.

663
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:51,994
I need a consultant
for depression and terminal illness.

664
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:53,996
You have to connect me to one ASAP.

665
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,290
I got chills.

666
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:57,541
So brazen,

667
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:00,628
barging in
and shamelessly asking for everything.

668
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,755
You haven't changed one bit!

669
00:48:06,092 --> 00:48:07,093
Jeha.

670
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,428
Can I get a hug?

671
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,640
Come on, man.

672
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:13,724
Wait, my drink…

673
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:15,935
Got it. Come here.

674
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,509
What are they filming?

675
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,136
Who is that?

676
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:52,555
Please step back.
That's pretty cool.

677
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:54,807
What is it?

678
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,725
Isn't that Chae Seoyoung?

679
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:59,603
Excuse me. Sorry. Pardon me.

680
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:00,980
Sorry.

681
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,482
Chae Seoyoung is here.
Can we take a picture?

682
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:05,526
I don't know.
For some movie, I guess.

683
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,529
What? Of course, you're way prettier.

684
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,365
She's not that pretty at all.

685
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:16,412
Hang on a second.

686
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:21,876
Wow, she's gorgeous.

687
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,294
I've never seen her in real life.

688
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,880
The dolly shot is gonna come right to you.

689
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:28,466
Can't I just take one picture?

690
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,050
No filming.

691
00:49:30,843 --> 00:49:32,928
Why not?
No photos, please.

692
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:35,556
Sorry.
Can't I just take one?

693
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,141
Scene 67, take 1.
Action!

694
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,022
Cut!

695
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,148
Action!

696
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,276
Take 7!

697
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,489
Let me wipe my sweat first.

698
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:57,411
Cut!

699
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:00,623
Let's try one more time.
Take 15.

700
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:02,541
Take 17.

701
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:04,293
This better be the last take.

702
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,456
TIME TO EAT

703
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,278
Cut! Okay!

704
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:15,948
That last take was fantastic!

705
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,534
I never thought it'd be this exhausting.

706
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:20,869
I'm only doing this
because you're directing.

707
00:51:20,953 --> 00:51:22,955
Geez, I'm sorry.

708
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,749
Speaking of, let's take a break
and do the next scene.

709
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,669
The water might be a bit cold.

710
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,754
I checked, and it was all right.

711
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,799
We got five outfits,
so you just need to go in five times.

712
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:42,266
Yeah.

713
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:45,102
The car was stuffy…

714
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,562
…so I'm taking a breather.

715
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:50,357
No, I'm fine. Don't come.
You guys go ahead and eat.

716
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:52,651
I'll be back after getting some air.

717
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,532
I'm hungry.

718
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:02,036
Look, that's Chae Seoyoung.

719
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,329
What? For real?

720
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:05,623
Chae Seoyoung.
Is that really her?

721
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:06,999
Why is she here?

722
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:10,586
What do I do…

723
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:15,132
Um, excuse me.

724
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:16,467
Take this if you need.

725
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:19,219
Uh…

726
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:20,846
I can't ruin my hair.

727
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:21,930
But thank you.

728
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:23,682
Oh, okay.

729
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:52,336
Well, would you like a sandwich?

730
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:55,089
I'm okay.

731
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:57,758
Sorry to keep bothering you
while you're resting.

732
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:04,723
Oh, this is rye bread.

733
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:17,903
Are you Chae Seoyoung?
Could we take a picture with you?

734
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:19,154
I'm such a huge fan.

735
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,741
I'm sorry.

736
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:24,993
She's eating right now.

737
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:28,497
Sorry. My apologies.
Okay.

738
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:34,086
Thank you.

739
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:38,674
I just thought you needed some peace
for your break.

740
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:40,759
Am I being too nosy?

741
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,516
Can I ask why you're filming with that?

742
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:51,145
The scenery's pretty.

743
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:56,984
I want to watch this later
in case I don't get to be here again.

744
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,987
Why won't you be here?
You can always come back.

745
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,823
I have to dive in there later.

746
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:03,907
Why?

747
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,869
I'm being chased with a bag full of money,

748
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:09,079
then I fight over it with the bag's owner

749
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:10,664
until it drops in there.

750
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:13,751
That's so awesome.

751
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:15,210
It sounds really exciting.

752
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:16,462
It's actually not.

753
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,839
I'm afraid of water.

754
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,759
It feels like dying when I'm underwater.

755
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:27,973
Sorry about that.

756
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:31,518
But why, then?

757
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:33,353
Because it's my job.

758
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:35,606
I have to endure it.

759
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:39,860
Thanks for the food.

760
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:42,237
I'm a big fan.

761
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:45,866
Ever since The Lonely People.

762
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:48,619
Ah, want an autograph?

763
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,205
Or a photo, if you don't have a pen?

764
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:56,126
If you don't mind, could we use this?
It has a selfie mode.

765
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,003
Sure.
Give me a second.

766
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:06,970
I love you, Seoyoung!

767
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,264
Thank you for the food.

768
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:12,059
Wait, I forgot to press the button.

769
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,185
Hang on, sorry.

770
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,728
There we go.

771
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,648
I love you, Seoyoung!

772
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:19,399
Thanks for the food.

773
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:21,902
Thank you so much.

774
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:23,820
Thank you.

775
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:25,739
I need to pay you back for the sandwich.

776
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,908
It's okay. Go ahead.

777
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:32,120
Thanks. If we ever meet again,

778
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:33,997
I'll pay you back for the sandwich.

779
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,211
Break a leg, Seoyoung!

780
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:40,879
Good luck on the shoot!

781
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:43,715
Break a leg!

782
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:45,425
I love you!

783
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:48,136
My gosh. Unbelievable.

784
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,445
"LOVE IN WHITE" 6TH DRAFT
TERMINAL ILLNESS…

785
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:34,975
BU SEUNGWON

786
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:43,525
I don't like the consultant you got me.
They didn't even read the synopsis.

787
00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:46,737
Can you at least say hello first?

788
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,864
How's it going? It's been a month.

789
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,116
I told you two months.

790
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,659
Was it the third draft last time?

791
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,494
Now, that one was good.

792
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:57,581
Was it the fifth?
It looks modern and ready to go.

793
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:01,877
How can a female character
just be so submissive?

794
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,005
What would've happened
if the male protagonist didn't find her?

795
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,466
No dream, no ambition.

796
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:10,385
I don't know what the writer was thinking.

797
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:14,348
Well, it's what your father was thinking.

798
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:17,476
I don't know.

799
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:19,144
What?

800
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:22,356
I mean, it's way too old-fashioned
even for something from the 90s.

801
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:23,940
Old-fashioned?

802
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:26,985
Anyway, I got a new consultant for you.

803
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:28,153
You'll like this one.

804
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:30,322
He's a very busy man, you know.

805
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:32,157
I worked really hard to fit you in.

806
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:35,410
Okay, I'll humor you one more time.
Can I see him today?

807
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,121
Maybe the assistant director
wants to join?

808
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:41,458
I'll just go alone.
I'll send you the address.

809
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:43,210
Oh, and that doctor…

810
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:46,088
How should I put it?

811
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:47,339
Well, he's a bit…

812
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,299
Never mind, you'll know when you see him.

813
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:50,884
All right.

814
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,433
You're only 29,

815
00:57:58,517 --> 00:57:59,685
and you did Squid Game

816
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,895
and even I, the Executioner?

817
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:05,482
Your résumé is seriously…

818
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:07,317
Thank you so much.

819
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,862
Are you okay, not getting any rest
after your last project?

820
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:13,699
Well, this will be my last job as an AD.

821
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:14,908
Of course!

822
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:18,078
Producers are lining up
for your directorial debut.

823
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,996
Why would I direct? It's such a hassle.

824
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,083
It's exhausting. It's stressful.
Everyone wants everything from you.

825
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:26,378
You work in the cold when it's freezing,
in the heat when it's hot. Mm-mmm.

826
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:28,380
I hate it.

827
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:31,758
What? Then why are you still an AD?

828
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:34,594
I wanted to work on Director Lee's film.

829
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,644
That Bu Seungwon must be insane.

830
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:44,813
How dare he try to throw her into that?

831
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:48,483
Should I still run it by Seoyoung?

832
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:49,776
Are you insane too?

833
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:53,530
Just thinking about Lee Jeha
still makes my blood boil.

834
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:56,742
All that time, money, and roles
Seoyoung lost because of him!

835
00:58:56,825 --> 00:58:57,951
I'm sorry, ma'am.

836
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,496
Don't even say a word to Seoyoung.

837
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:05,292
Keep this project away from her
no matter what.

838
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,543
Yes, ma'am.

839
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:09,379
Just shred it to pieces!
I will.

840
00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:21,266
BE AS HAPPY AS YOU CHOOSE TO BE

841
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,229
Here's your coffee.

842
00:59:28,148 --> 00:59:30,776
Have you ever been sick?

843
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,529
I had a check-up a few years back.
Nothing extraordinary.

844
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:36,823
What about your family, your parents?

845
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:41,870
Both of my parents passed.

846
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:44,873
Well, my mother…

847
00:59:45,874 --> 00:59:47,167
She was ill before she passed.

848
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,376
Hmm.

849
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,380
So your mother was ill.

850
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:55,342
For now,

851
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:58,011
you asked about terminal cases
on your questionnaire.

852
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,889
Those can't be confirmed
through basic check-ups.

853
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:03,725
It just doesn't show up there. Never does.

854
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:08,104
Then how do people
find out that they're sick?

855
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:10,315
Well,

856
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:12,859
they're usually carried in
when it's already too late.

857
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:18,323
Oh. Usually.

858
01:00:18,824 --> 01:00:19,825
Mmm.

859
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:25,121
You know,
this whole "terminal illness" premise…

860
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:27,666
It's a bit cliché, I know. Way overused.

861
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:30,126
Nah. It should be used more.

862
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:33,004
Do you know how many terminal patients
there are in Korea?

863
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:36,091
A lot of them, and they're all different.

864
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:39,469
It's a melodrama,
so we just need a simple terminal case.

865
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,687
Now that's a cliché way of thinking.

866
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,189
My man,

867
01:00:51,857 --> 01:00:53,984
terminal cases are never simple.

868
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:56,319
Right. Poor choice of words.

869
01:00:58,196 --> 01:00:59,281
I'm sorry.

870
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,700
No need to apologize to me.

871
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:05,203
How long does the patient have?

872
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:07,622
You know, in your movie.

873
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:12,419
I'm a doctor who actually understands
dramatic license.

874
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:15,672
How long would be appropriate?
That's what I came to ask.

875
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,511
I think…

876
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:26,224
I want to be a director in my next life
instead of a doctor.

877
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:29,144
You guys make up whatever you want.

878
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:31,688
Love, death…

879
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:35,692
Well, yeah.

880
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:39,571
How about a year?

881
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,867
Is that too long? Six months?

882
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,995
A year or six months,
which is it?

883
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:48,455
You've got to make a choice.

884
01:01:48,997 --> 01:01:50,790
That's a massive difference.

885
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,084
Six months.

886
01:01:53,168 --> 01:01:54,210
Six months?

887
01:01:58,256 --> 01:01:59,507
Hmm.

888
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:04,137
Hang on. Let's see…

889
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:14,230
Hey, where are you?
You're still here, right?

890
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:15,690
Want to do some consulting?

891
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:17,859
Is that so?

892
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,028
Oh, I see.

893
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:23,990
Mmm.

894
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:27,535
Dr. Lee probably doesn't know yet either.

895
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:28,828
I should head down too.

896
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:31,373
All right.

897
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:35,377
Follow me.

898
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,098
Cause of death was shock.

899
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:51,017
It happened just once,

900
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,230
but for this patient, that once was fatal.

901
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,608
Excuse me.

902
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:03,989
That's why it ended so suddenly.

903
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:07,742
That's why

904
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:10,120
illnesses are so scary.

905
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,330
You can't stop them,

906
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:15,250
you can't reverse them.
They happen so fast.

907
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:19,671
The shock episodes become more frequent
as the condition worsens.

908
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:23,091
And yes, they're painful.

909
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:24,634
Almost like getting shot.

910
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:28,263
Like your whole body is torn apart.

911
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:33,018
Yes?

912
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:36,855
Ah. I'll head back up.

913
01:03:37,856 --> 01:03:39,357
They're calling for me.

914
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:42,444
Wait here,
and she'll be right over.

915
01:03:43,028 --> 01:03:44,988
Sorry? Who?

916
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:46,364
The one you're looking for.

917
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:48,074
Carry on.

918
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:58,668
OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES

919
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:45,340
THE LATE KIM MINJEONG

920
01:04:59,104 --> 01:05:00,188
Minjeong…

921
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:14,053
TIME TO EAT

922
01:06:57,263 --> 01:07:00,683
Hey.
Is there another doctor I can consult?

923
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:02,602
This one's just a bit weird.

924
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:03,811
Yes.

925
01:07:03,895 --> 01:07:05,063
Is that so?

926
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:08,107
Yes. All right.
Hang on. I have to go.

927
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:10,193
Yes, I understand.

928
01:07:11,069 --> 01:07:12,070
What is it?

929
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:13,905
Hello.

930
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:17,116
I'm not really sure how this works…

931
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:21,788
I just wanted to ask if we can
use flowers other than chrysanthemums.

932
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:25,208
Maybe something like ranunculus or lilies?

933
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:27,126
You know, like…

934
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:30,088
Something a bit more colorful and bright.

935
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:31,547
I don't know how to put it.

936
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:35,051
Kind of like wedding decorations, I guess?

937
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:37,470
And for the portrait area,

938
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:39,973
I was thinking
maybe alliums or baby's breath?

939
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,516
In the funeral hall?

940
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:44,143
Yes, the funeral hall.

941
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:47,063
Actually, can we
change the location entirely?

942
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:49,315
I'd prefer it not be at a funeral home.

943
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:51,359
Nothing too formal or traditional.

944
01:07:51,943 --> 01:07:53,695
Is that even allowed?

945
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:56,239
That's what I'm asking. Is it?

946
01:07:56,906 --> 01:08:00,410
Honestly, it's my first week on the job.
But I'll find out for you.

947
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,161
Thank you.

948
01:08:02,954 --> 01:08:04,414
Could I just get your card?

949
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:09,377
FUNERAL DIRECTOR, KIM JIHO

950
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:18,344
HANKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
FUNERAL HOME

951
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:52,337
Thank you.

952
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:33,127
Where have you been?

953
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:38,424
Me?

954
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:41,094
Yes, you.

955
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:47,225
You were looking for me.

956
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:50,019
I was?

957
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:58,778
Are you the one
from the convenience store?

958
01:10:00,488 --> 01:10:01,656
And also…

959
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:05,451
at Cinema Jongno, right?

960
01:10:08,496 --> 01:10:09,622
We meet again.

961
01:10:16,087 --> 01:10:17,088
Are you--

962
01:10:17,171 --> 01:10:18,172
Yes.

963
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,007
That's me too.

964
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,016
I heard you needed a consultant.

965
01:10:32,103 --> 01:10:35,022
Are you a doctor? Or a nurse?

966
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:39,569
Neither.

967
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:03,468
I'm your consultant,

968
01:11:04,051 --> 01:11:06,971
the terminal patient, Lee Daeum.

969
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:52,517
I'm not looking to cast someone
in a documentary.

970
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,310
Hello!

971
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:57,563
My name is Lee Daeum, and I'm an actress.

972
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:03,444
Try persuading Seoyoung
until production begins,

973
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:05,863
and if she says yes,
then the rookie can go.

974
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:09,700
I want to do that movie.

975
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:11,994
I really want

976
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:15,331
to make this movie with you.
