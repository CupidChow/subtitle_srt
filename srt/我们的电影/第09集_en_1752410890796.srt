00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,837
[Seoyoung] You made the right call.

8
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,715
You know how hard it was
to make this happen, right?

9
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,842
It's our best chance
at getting back on our feet.

10
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,721
Okay, I'll call you when I get back.

11
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,515
Yeah, see you in Seoul.

12
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,184
But that woman…

13
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,109
I'll deal with her.

14
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,444
You should probably hurry.

15
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,613
Well, time will take care of it.

16
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,575
See you.

17
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:52,279

EPISODE 9

19
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,911
-[♪ romantic music plays]
-The sun went down too fast.

20
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:01,872
I know.

21
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,999
I came here to see the sunset,

22
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,460
but I can't even remember
what color it was.

23
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,254
The sun did set, right?

24
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,590
[chuckles]

25
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,551
Mr. Lee.

26
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,389
Your head's all over the place,
it feels like you're dreaming,

27
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:23,226
and your heart keeps racing, right?
Like you've done something wrong.

28
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,145
How did you know that?

29
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,147
I can feel it all.

30
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,444
I kept pretending not to notice

31
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,821
the feelings I have for you.

32
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,407
I was scared.

33
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,785
So was I.

34
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:41,953
Hmm?

35
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,789
Are you still scared?

36
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,083
No, I've forgotten all that.

37
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,878
[inhales deeply] Watching you stay strong
and smile all the time,

38
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:53,048
even when I know
it's been way harder for you,

39
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,967
it makes all the fear I had
feel like nothing.

40
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,553
Fear is never nothing.

41
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,682
You don't know what it's like.

42
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:05,769
Dying of fear that you might die,
even though you're not dying.

43
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:11,525
That feeling of wondering if
it's okay to love someone who's dying?

44
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,443
I don't know it either.

45
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,155
When you came running to me earlier,

46
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,283
I felt like my heart would burst.

47
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,162
But at the same time, it sank.

48
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,541
All this joy I feel now,

49
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,085
I'll probably forget it soon.

50
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,297
And the one left behind
will remember me without me.

51
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,927
So I keep wondering
if I'm allowed to revel in all of this.

52
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:43,348
Of course you are.

53
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,936
Me, of all people,
when I'm going to die soon?

54
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,857
Is it really okay for me to like you?

55
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,833
Is it okay…

56
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,629
-for someone like me to like you?
-[chuckles]

57
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,675
Yes. [chuckles]

58
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:20,927
Let's just…

59
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,555
live in this moment.

60
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,391
I've made my decision.

61
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,268
[exclaims] Then you're in trouble.

62
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,897
You're about to be really happy.
[chuckles]

63
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,581
[gasps]

64
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,254
[Daeum] Wow, it looks delicious.

65
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,007
Enjoy, everyone.

66
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,634
-Enjoy.
-Bon appétit.

67
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,346
-This is definitely a hot place to eat.
-[Cheolmin] Hmm?

68
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,598
[scoffs] You haven't even tried the food.

69
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:11,937
I can tell without eating.

70
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,524
You can tell from the vibe
that it's a hot spot.

71
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:16,608
Can't wait to dig in.

72
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,987
How come the four of you were together?

73
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,781
Ah…

74
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,157
Well…

75
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:27,577
Ms. Jo burned a hole in my coat
with her cigarette,

76
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:32,666
so she bought this for me yesterday,
and I wanted to thank her--

77
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,335
For goodness' sake.
Talk about dragging it out.

78
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,756
We ran into these two downtown,
had coffee, and were on our way back.

79
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,341
Ah. [chuckles]

80
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,676
And how did you two…

81
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,181
What were you doing together?

82
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,976
Uh…

83
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,019
Well…

84
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,402
Location scouting.

85
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,737
You know, the sunset was so beautiful.

86
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,615
Thought it might be
a good spot to shoot later.

87
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,035
Yes, the sunset… Very beautiful.

88
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,495
Being pink and all.

89
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,456
It was obviously orange.

90
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,501
-W-Well, orange and…
-Orange…

91
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,587
-Orangish pink.
-Yeah.

92
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,422
-Orangish pink, right.
-[mutters]

93
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,257
Like this kind of color, you know?

94

96
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,602
Jeha, can I ask you a question?

97
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:34,728
No.

98
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,521
-Just one.
-No.

99
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,315
-Just one!
-I said no.

100
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,068
[huffs] Remember what I said last time?

101
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,654
You don't mind things you normally hate--

102
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:45,739
Quiet.

103
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,533
And you don't even get tired.

104
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:49,993
I'm tired now. A lot.

105
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,495
Man, that's strange.

106
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,333
Your voice is cold,
but that look on your face is warm.

107
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,793
I've never seen that look on you before.

108
00:06:58,877 --> 00:06:59,919
Jeha,

109
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,129
why were you…

110
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,757
holding Daeum's hand?

111
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,931
You saw that?

112
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,017
Of course I did! I have eyes.

113
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,227
Are you seeing Daeum?

114
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,563
Can you do that?

115
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,566
Can't I?

116
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:23,735
[sighs]

117
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,237
You could've at least talked to me first.

118
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:29,658
I'm supposed to protect
my artist's rights, you know.

119
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:32,285
I'm Daeum's manager after all.

120
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,995
Protecting her rights?

121
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,789
Sounds good.

122
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:36,915
Huh?

124
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,423
What's this camcorder…

125
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,217
Gosh, Daeum.

126
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,719

<i>You little…</i>

133
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,749
Could you be any more obvious?
And stop leaving your things about.

134
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,836
-Leave what around?
-<i>Your camcorder.</i>

135
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,130
It's in my hands.
How much is it worth to you?

136
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,882
Oh, I must've left it behind.
Hey, don't touch that.

137
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,010
But why aren't you in it? You're the lead.

138
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,846
Wait, did you watch it already?

139
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,889
You should've asked
your manager to film you.

140
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,851
I did ask him to film me,

141
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:38,935
but he's no good.

142
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,605
Guess this pro should step in
and do it for you.

[inhales sharply] No. Don't even think
about coming down here because of me.

You're too busy to even take a vacation.

00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:05,331
Those two.

182
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,667
When do you think it started?

183
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,793
Mmm…

184
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,461
Not sure.

185
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,798
Let's go again
from "Thank you for pulling me out."

186
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,259
Wow, you're so oblivious.

187
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,387
How do you shoot so well
with that kind of awareness?

188
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,805
[chuckles]

189
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:24,434
Well, I don't know
if I should be flattered or offended.

190
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,229
It was definitely since the team dinner.
My eyes are never wrong.

191
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,856
Just let it go.

192
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,399
What's the big deal?

193
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,943
People can catch feelings
when they work together.

194
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,446
That's a bit naive.

195
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,199
I just hope it doesn't blow up later.

196
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:41,618
[mutters]

197
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,662
[sighs]

198
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,583
Oh, Eunho, it's your last day, isn't it?

199
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:50,960
Yes.

200
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,087
Hang on. In that case…

201
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,215
do you want to shoot the final scene?

202
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,676
-I'll talk to Mr. Lee.
-Me?

203
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,303
Give it a go.

204
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,228
-Mr. Lee.
-[Jeha] Yes?

205
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,313
[Cheolmin] It's Eunho's last day today.

206
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,399
-[Jeha] Right.
-[Cheolmin] Could he shoot the last scene?

207
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,072
[Seungwon] No, it's fine.

208
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,907
-The production will relay it all.
-[sighs]

209
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,033
[Seungwon] Yeah.

210
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,120
Hello, everyone.

211
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:29,540
Yeah. Let me know
if there are any issues on set.

212
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:32,710
[mutters]

213
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,587
[sighs, exclaims]

214
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:35,713
What brings you here?

215
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:38,591
Well, why haven't you done
anything about this?

216
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,678
You're the CEO here, Mr. Bu.

217
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,182
Why? What is it?

218
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,768
[exclaims]

219
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,396
Planning to write up a scandal
about those two?

220
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,649
Man, that would be a disaster.

221
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,318
Production's barely just begun,

222
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,862
and the actress and the director
are caught up in a scandal!

223
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,823
Gosh, what a headache that would be!

224
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,200
The investors would all flip out over it.

225
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,287
Did you actually look at the photo?

226
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,872
That's a hospital. A university hospital.

227
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,875
There's plenty of room for interpretation.

228
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,629
Calm down. It's not like they were
in front of the OB-GYN or something.

229
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,549
Our medical consultant
is in that very hospital.

230
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,135
So the director and actress stopped by

231
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,929
to consult a big name in the industry.
What's the big deal?

232
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,306
Without her manager?

233
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,308
Just the two of them, asking for advice?

234
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,643
The manager could've waited in the car

235
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,603
or gone to the restroom.

236
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,814
What can you even prove with one photo?

237
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,941
It's way too vague.

238
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,777
And what were you doing at the hospital?

239
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:41,779
Well, I just…

240
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:44,073
Look at the <i>Terms of Jealousy</i> scandal.

241
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,451
That only sold more tickets for the movie.

242
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,785
Go ahead, break the story.

243
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,913
I really don't see how that'll hurt me.

244
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:57,920
[clears throat] Just stick to writing down
the tips you're fed, okay?

245
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:01,424
That's all you've ever done.
What's with the new act? [clicks tongue]

246
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,474
Does he take me for some kind of idiot?

247
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,190
[Seoyoung] <i>Sincerity.</i>

248
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:21,069
<i>I'm not asking</i>
<i>for something you don't have.</i>

249
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,654
We weren't always like this.

250
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,411
What happened to us?

251
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,874
Get some rest.

252
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,008
[knocks on door]

253
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,177
Yes?

254
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:50,473
[mutters]

255
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,061
[whispering] Oh, man.

256
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,939
[Jungwoo]
I couldn't last a month like I promised.

257
00:14:58,523 --> 00:14:59,857
I'm heading to Seoul now.

258
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,568
You're not thinking
of dying anymore, are you?

259
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,696
[Jungwoo] Thank you for pulling me out.

260
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,573
You'd better be thankful.

261
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,619
There are so many things
you can only do when you're alive.

262
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,038
[Jungwoo] Take care of yourself.

263
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,290
I'll take care of myself too.

264
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,513
[Daeum] You make me want…

265
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,895
to keep living, Hyunsang.

266
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,527
<i>In your version of</i> Love in White…

267
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:46,988
does the ending…

268
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,158
stay the same?

269
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:54,829
No.

270
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,208
In the end…

271
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,005
In the end, she'll probably die.

272
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,387
-Cut.
-That's a cut.

273
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:13,973
Are we going with this?

274
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,099
Hang on a second.

275
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:22,064
THEN HOW ABOUT I…

276
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,234
[scribbling]

277
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,161
Jungwoo, can I talk to you for a moment?

278
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,245
Sure, go ahead.

279
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:37,914
Uh…

280
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,667
What if Hyunsang stayed with Gyuwon

281
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,336
for just one more day?

282
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,546
[Jungwoo] Why? Would that mean much?

283
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:52,220
Isn't Hyunsang the kind of guy
who coldly walks away from a sick woman?

284
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,971
You're right. That's true, but…

285
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,016
I've been rethinking the ending.

286
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:02,104
Does that mean he loves her now,
like he did in the original?

287
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,858
Well, I'm on Team Original anyway.

288
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,193
I'll give it a try.

289
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:14,283
[inhales] So you're thinking of leaving
the door open for Gyuwon and Hyunsang.

290
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,869
I'm still thinking about it.

291
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,872
I'm all for it.
That's what <i>Love in White</i> should be.

292
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:25,253
Then let's adjust the angle to make it
a bit more hopeful and beautiful.

293
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,130
You're scene's not over yet, Eunho.

294
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:30,716
Mr. Lee.

295
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,510
Yes?

296
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,970
[stammers]

297
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,307
-Go on.
-No, I'll tell you later.

298
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,060
Let's do it.

299
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,770
[Jungwoo] Thank you for pulling me out.

300
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,522
You'd better be thankful.

301
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,775
There are so many things
you can only do if you're alive.

302
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,486
Then how about I stay one more day?

303
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,030
Seems a shame to leave on this note.

304
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,409
I'd love that.

305
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,958
[in English] Cut! Okay.
[in Korean] That's good.

306
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,876
[Hong] We're good to go!
That's it for today!

307
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,461
Great work, everyone!

308
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,131
-[crew 5] Well done, everyone.
-[crew 6] Great job.

309
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:12,883
-[crew 7] Good job.
-[crew 8] Great work!

310
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,468
-Great job!
-Well done!

311
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:15,928
[Eunho] Thank you.

312
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,889
[Daeum] Great work, everyone.

313
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,141
Great work.

314
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,644
Mr. Lee.

315
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:25,688
Great work today.

316
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,856
You did well too.

317
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,319
[chuckles]

318
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:38,367
-You're going straight into another shoot?
-[Eunho] I take the work that comes in.

319
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,495
Guess I won't see you until spring.

320
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,331
Yeah.

321
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,793
I wanted to see
the cherry blossoms in Seoul with you.

322
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,379
But I know you wouldn't go with me.

323
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:53,924
I'm joking.

324
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,719
You know I can get clingy.

325
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,807
Eunho.

326
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,063
I'm glad I got to see you
one more time like this.

327
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,648
[Eunho] This won't be the last time.

328
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,651
You always act like it's the last time.
It hurts, you know.

329
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,361
[chuckles]

330
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:17,698
Let's shake hands.

331
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,325
[sighs]

332
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,376
Take care of yourself, Eunho.

333
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,295
Take care of yourself, Daeum.

334
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,217
Ah. Why's your hand so cold?

335
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:37,843
[both chuckle]

336
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,486
[breathes shakily]

337
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,655
He's gone, right?

338
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,906
Your first love.

339
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:01,784
Yes.

340
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:03,494
He's gone.

341
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:05,871
First love, long ago.

342
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,085
[sighs]

343
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:32,064
[Jeha] I feel at peace now that
my competition's out of the picture.

344
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:36,944
[sighs]

345
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,947
I'm a little worried, though.

346
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,117
What if you start acting
all petty and jealous?

347
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,036
Could you really be that type of guy?

348
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,330
All humans…

349
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,623
Well…

350
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,585
All men are the same.

351
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,171
Men?

352
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,339
Yes. Why? What?

353
00:20:58,632 --> 00:20:59,800
[chuckles]

354
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,343
Seriously, what's with you?

355
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,435
I don't know. Did I lose my mind?

356
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,562
That's cute.

357
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,856
Cute?

358
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,525
You acted jealous to make me laugh,
didn't you?

359
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,404
Yes, well…

360
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:22,740
I wanted to laugh too.

361
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,826
I think your laugh is funny.

362
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,081
You know, Mr. Lee…

363
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,920
Why did you change

364
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,172
that scene earlier?

365
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,508
I thought Hyunsang would feel different

366
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:44,303
when he looked at Gyuwon,
and would want to live now.

367
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,559
He'd want to stay by Gyuwon's side too.

368
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,812
Like you do?

369
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,525
Yes, like I do.

370
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,568
Looks like Gyuwon pulled it off.

371
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:35,646
Then…

372
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:38,899
do you think our movie's ending

373
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,777
could change as well?

374
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,407
I've been reading
my mother's original draft every day.

375
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,658
I keep wondering

376
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:49,994
why she chose that ending.

377
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:55,291
Even when she was dying
and her husband took her script,

378
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:59,169
why did she talk about love
as something beautiful?

379
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:02,715
That's why

380
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:06,969
I want to leave the ending of our movie
a little more open.

381
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,805
I want to take a deeper look at it.

382
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:11,807
Are you sure?

383
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,478
Will you help me?

384
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,357
We said we'd look for it together.

385
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:24,904
Yes, let's keep looking.

386
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:27,740
Together.

387
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,380
We've walked two laps already.

388
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,718
I used to do about 30
when I was in better shape.

389
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,972
And who did you walk 30 laps with?

390
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,850
Uh… [sucks teeth]

391
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:57,269
Shall we go for another lap?

392
00:23:58,854 --> 00:23:59,855
[Jeha] We should head in.

393
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:01,941
You need your rest.

394
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:04,485
Mmm.

395
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,322
[groans]

396
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:16,038
Well, I can't go unless you let go.

397
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,920
Oh, of course.

398
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,799
I don't want to let go.

399
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,054
Or let you go.

400
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,392
We'll see each other tomorrow.

401
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:40,646
-I'm going in.
-Okay.

402
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,090
Is this better?

403
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,174
Or this?

404
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:12,302
Hey, if you're not eating it,
stop messing with the food.

405
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:13,971
[sighs]

406
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,849
Mr. Bu said it was for consulting,

407
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:18,726
but you never know.

408
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:22,938
Why would a director and actress
be at a university hospital together?

409
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,399
If we spin this right,

410
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,317
it could really take off.

411
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,948
[chuckles, inhales sharply]

412
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,783
You should've just done what I said.

413
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:35,909
What is this crap?

414
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,038
Mr. Noh,

415
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:43,125
you think I lasted 20 years
in this industry by accident?

416
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,460
Pardon?

417
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,795
I've had it with scumbags

418
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,799
twisting disgusting stories
to screw over actresses.

419
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,343
It makes my skin crawl.

420
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:54,636
Got it?

421
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,015
CEOs, man. From the studio or the agency.

422
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:01,435
They only come crawling
when they need something.

423
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,105
Isn't that spicy?

424
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,402
Pour me a drink.

425
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:13,655
Just you wait.
I'm going to hit them where it hurts.

426
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:18,535
Beyond Entertainment's already a mess
with Chae Seoyoung likely leaving.

427
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:20,412
It's just a waste of time.

428
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,664
[groans] Always late to the story.

429
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:25,542
Ms. Go is never letting go
of Chae Seoyoung.

430
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:28,879
She's already desperate
to find "the next Chae Seoyoung."

431
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:32,216
I heard she even reached out to Nam Jaein.

432
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:37,471
What? Ms. Go just asked her questions
because she went to school with Lee Daeum.

433
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:41,975
Oh.

434
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,770
[laughs]

435
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:06,667

CHAE SEOYOUNG

437
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:14,800
[Seoyoung] You've been smiling a lot.
The mood on set is better than ever.

438
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,680
It's very surprising that someone
as tightly wound as you

439
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,057
could be so relaxed on set.

440
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,768
I just decided

441
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,020
to think differently.

442
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:28,689
Is that so?

443
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,399
I did too.

444
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,783
Did you think it was a compliment
when I said you looked good?

445
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:46,081
I told you that I won't support you
no matter what choice you make.

446
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,378
So what are you going to do? I mean…

447
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,507
What do you want to do?

448
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:05,684
Here.

449
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,232
[Jaein] It's past 11:00 p.m.,

450
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:15,444
and you're okay with drinking
high-fructose syrup?

451
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,155
Oh. Want me to get you something else?

452
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,366
[Jaein] No, it just threw me off.

453
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,368
You eat a ton of food too.

454
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:26,163
Doesn't the director say anything?

455
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,665
Like, "You're playing
a terminally ill character.

456
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:31,585
Shouldn't you be responsible
and watch what you eat?"

457
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,345
As long as I look fine, isn't that enough?

458
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,640
What are you trying to say is the problem?

459
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,141
Lee Daeum as a person.

460
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:47,684
Nam Jaein.

461
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:50,437
I just want to get along with you
like we used to.

462
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,730
Don't do this.

463
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:52,898
[chuckles]

464
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,193
Did we ever get along?

465
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,946
You remember things differently.

466
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:03,533
Why are you so angry with me, hmm?

467
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,703
Just tell me. This is really frustrating.

468
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,914
I'm the one who's frustrated.

469
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:13,752
[sighs]

470
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,923
Wow. It's a lot bigger than my room.

471
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,591
Must be nice.

472
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,969
You're lucky.

473
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,971

[door closes]

475

from who I was back then?

-[♪ melancholy music plays]
-No.

477
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,205
Why is the Lee Jeha now
so different from the Lee Jeha then?

478
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,166
Your feelings for Daeum…

479
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:56,878
Are you absolutely sure
they're not cheap pity, but real love?

480
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,463
Yes.

481
00:29:58,547 --> 00:29:59,840
I'm sure.

482
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:05,012
[inhales deeply] Seoyoung, I just…

483
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:07,931
decided to live in the moment.

484
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:10,183
And the one who made me think that way

485
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:11,977
was Daeum.

486
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,148
I'll understand whatever you choose to do.

487
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,567
I just hope it doesn't end up

488
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,945

poking at others' pain.

00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:05,961
Exactly.

538
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,963
If anything, this is free buzz.

539
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,507
-[chuckles]
-[knocks on door]

540
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:12,384
Mr. Han!

541
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,012
-[groans] What's with all the fuss?
-Mr. Han.

542
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:17,305
We have a situation.

543
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,565
[Sungho] What's this now?

544
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,567
LEE JEHA (36)
AND LEE DAEUM (25) DATING…

545
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,027
"GIRLFRIEND CASTING"
CONTROVERSY…

546
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:34,030
This isn't the kind of buzz we want.

547
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,284
A simple dating scandal is one thing,

548
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,662
but "fairness" and "equity"?

549
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:44,666
It's hitting the two issues the public
is hyper-sensitive about right now.

550
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:48,086
[groans] Noh Huitae, that bastard.

551
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:52,716
Two of my higher-ups
are already facing indictment

552
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:56,052
over rigged hiring
and preferential bidding.

553
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:59,806
I'm only throwing money at this movie
to clean up the crap they made.

554
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,975
And now the director rigged the audition?

555
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:05,020
I'll get a correction piece ready.

556
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,647
You think a correction's
going to fix this?

557
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,610
[Ms. Jo] That article was too nasty.

558
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,486
You must've been so shocked.

559
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,656
Is going to the director's room
for a meeting a crime?

560
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,325
Even I've been in that room.

561
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,661
And with your acting skills,
how's that favoritism?

562
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,204
Mr. Lee's the one who got lucky.

563
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,707
[Ms. Go] Lee Jeha, that bastard.

564
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,251
I knew this would happen.

565
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:29,711
SO "THE LONELY PEOPLE"
WAS RIGGED TOO?

566
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,296
THE DIRECTOR FOUND
A LEAD AND A GIRLFRIEND

567
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,131
And Seoyoung?

568
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,591
I can't get a hold of her.

569
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,176
Can't reach Minhee either.

570
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:40,597
Get my car ready.
I'm going to Samcheok myself.

571
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,891
[Sungho] Hey.

572
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:47,979
You must've thought I was a pushover
because I smile all the time.

573
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:50,523
I'm sorry, Mr. Han.

574
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:53,526
How do you call yourself a CEO
when you can't even handle a reporter?

575
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:57,364
[sighs] Forget the apologies.

576
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:59,949
Unless you want to cough up what we paid,

577
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:02,786
get the director and actors

578
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,413
to cry, beg, whatever it takes,
in front of the camera,

579
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:07,707
and change

580
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,251
the public's opinion.

581
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,711
[stammers] Wait, Mr. Han…

582
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:14,756
I'll make sure to shut down
this favoritism scandal.

583
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,258
I'll call you right away, Mr. Han!

584
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,804
-Hello.
-Hello.

585
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:24,140
Hello!

586
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,520
-Hello.
-Hello.

587
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,941
Hello.

588
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:35,985
[sighs]

589
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,448
[crew chattering]

590
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:49,040
What's with all the chatter?
What, we can't go on with the shoot?

591
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,960
Just get back to work!

592
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,679
Hello.

593
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,305
Hello.

594
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:06,766
-Hello.
-Hello.

595
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:07,851
Hello.

596
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,314
"GIRLFRIEND CASTING" CONTROVERSY

597
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,942
It looks like
someone on set took that photo.

598
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:18,445
It does.

599
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:21,573
Could I talk alone
with Ms. Chae for a moment?

600
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:22,949
Yes, we're done.

601
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,285
Take your time, both of you.

602
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,120
-Let's go.
-[stylist] Okay.

603
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,170
Isn't that reporter…

604
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,383
close with Ms. Go?

605
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:43,511
It wasn't Ms. Go.

606
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,890
She's not that kind of person.

607
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,190
[Jungwoo] Hello.

608
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,524
Hello, Mr. Kim.

609
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,235
Think you can focus?

610
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:04,032
Yes. I'll do my best
to love you again today.

611
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,037
Are you both ready?

612
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:11,706
Yes, we're all ready.

00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,378
LEE GYUWON BOOKSTORE

614
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:18,505
[Jeha] Let's begin.

615
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:20,632
Ready.

616
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,135
Action!

617
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,726
<i>I'll understand whatever you choose to do.</i>

618
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,937
I just hope it doesn't end up

619
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,482
circling back and hurting you.

620
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,401
[Jaein] Great work today, Ms. Chae.

621
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,905
-You have one scene left?
-Yes.

622
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,408
Ms. Chae, didn't I tell you?

623
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:48,868
That girl's seriously weird.

624
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:50,328
"That girl"?

625
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,663
Lee Daeum.

626
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,666
How can she smile right now
like nothing's happened?

627
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:58,545
Acting all innocent while slipping
in and out of the director's room--

628
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:00,588
I've been to his room.

629
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:04,050
So have you.
And so have most of the actors here.

630
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:09,264
But someone took that photo in secret,
so it looked all sneaky and scandalous.

631
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,348
[chuckles]

632
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,809
It was a scandal waiting to happen.

633
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,018
By the way,

634
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,187
weren't you two friends?

635
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,940
Why are you so hostile?

636
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:20,942
[chuckles]

637
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:25,947
Wait, are you suspicious of me right now?
[chuckles]

638
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,199
You think I took the photo and leaked it?

639
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:29,534
-You're here.
-Yes.

640
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,785
Come in.

641
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,123
[Seoyoung] <i>No.</i>

642
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,624
<i>I'm not just suspicious.</i>

643
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,460
I actually saw you take that photo.

644
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,089
Daeum's not the only one
who goes to that room.

645
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,174
Ms. Chae, you've got this all wrong. I--

646
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,760
Tearing someone down for your own gain

647
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:49,888
turns out to be meaningless.

648
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,098
Jaein.

649
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,600
I know it sounds preachy,

650
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:55,810
but trust me.

651
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,187
I figured that out recently myself.

652
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,158
[sighs]

653
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,621
What? Why aren't you at work?

654
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,708
I quit spectacularly.
Hence, I'm having lunch here.

655
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:20,668
Why you little…

656
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:23,004
-Are you out of your mind?
-[grunts]

657
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:26,966
[groans]
What did I do to get a kid like you…

658
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:30,803
But poor Daeum. What should we do?

659
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:33,139
If that stuff starts spreading online,

660
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,099
her dad's going to see it too.

661
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,270
So we should

662
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:41,314
split up our duties.

663
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,608
You should go to Uncle Junghyo.

664
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,902
-What about you?
-Mom.

665
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:49,656
Not a lot in my life is going to change
by taking a break from work.

666
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:53,409
You know very well
that I'm still very young.

667
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:56,287
I have so much time to spare.

668
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:59,791
So if I'm not by Daeum's side right now,

669
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,126
I don't think I could handle it.

670
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:04,587
Of course.

671
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,423
That's exactly how I feel too,

672
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:09,717
but I was worried
you wouldn't feel the same.

673
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,178
I knew it! I'm your daughter after all.

674
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,429
We're so on the same page.

-You're heading there today, right?

676
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,684
Yeah.

677
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:18,810
What do you need?

678
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,645
What should we pack first? Let me think.

679
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:23,815
-Give me everything you've got!
-All right!

680
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,566
Everything. Right away.

681
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,693
Got it.

682
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:32,407

[Gyoyeong's mom] Well, hello.

687
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,544
Hello.

688
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,838
I came by because I was worried.

689
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,340
I know you're strong, but still.

690
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:52,927
I'm sorry.

691
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,263
I don't know what to say.

692
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,015
No, don't worry.

693
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,435
Gyoyeong takes such good care of Daeum.

694
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,479
Of course. She's better than me.

695
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:05,148
She always has been.

696
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:07,984
Lately,

697
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,654
I keep thinking
about when I first met Daeum.

[♪ whimsical music plays]

699
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,371
My mom told me to bring you.

700
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,754
Here, ta-da!

701
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:30,048
Welcome, my valued guest.

702
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:31,257
Here.

703
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,467
Let's eat.

704
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,885
So, you don't have a mom?

705
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,304
Hey, Gwak Gyoyeong.

706
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:40,141
What? I don't have a dad either.

707
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,393
I just wanted to tell her that…

708
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,562
Man, you little…

709
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:46,397
Stop that. Quiet.

710
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,649
It's all right, darling.

711
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:51,903
At first, I thought she was a gloomy kid,
so I felt bad for her.

712
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:57,366
But I was wrong. She was always smiling
and always ate so well. [chuckles]

713
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,077
And after she got sick,

00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,621
she smiled even more

715
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,706
so her father wouldn't be sad

716
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,792
and people wouldn't worry about her.

717
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,628
She never once showed she was in pain.

718
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,546
Yes, I know.

719
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,967
I'm not worthy of being her father.

720
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:17,136
No one's unworthy of being a parent.

721
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,930
Don't give up.

722
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:20,973
I know I shouldn't.

723
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,315
But no matter how much I try,
I don't see any hope ahead.

724
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,734
I keep losing faith.

725
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:39,075
It's time to think
about another kind of hope.

726
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,829
Not as a doctor, but as a father.

727
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:45,873
<i>Think about how lonely she must've been,</i>

728

in the middle of that schoolyard.

730
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:55,842
Think about what she really wants,
and try to enjoy that

731
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:58,261
in the time she has left, together.

732
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,307
I know, but it's not easy.

733
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,688
I'm actually terrified.

734
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:10,523
I know.

735
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,191
But still,

736
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:14,026
Dr. Lee,

738
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,826

-Okay.

Figured you'd be more comfortable
sitting away from them today.

Let's eat.

743
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,689
Enjoy your meal.

745
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:58,404
Why aren't you eating?

746
00:44:58,487 --> 00:44:59,572
Got no appetite?

00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:07,496
Now give me my tip.

Hey, catering's not bad here.

00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:23,930
I'm on leave.

755
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,265
On leave? Why would you do that?

00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:30,895
This bond! This friendship!

00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:38,653

The article did better than I expected.

764
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:07,390
I got caught up writing a follow-up.

You're keeping me anonymous, right?
You promised.

Of course.
Trust is everything in this business.

You're the lead.

I just can't.

I can't keep pretending
to be nice and understanding.

I don't like you. I resent you.

So I decided…

795
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:20,314
to stick it out
and finish this film with you.

796
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:22,608
If we keep going,

797
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:26,487
maybe I'll figure out
why I don't like you so much.

798
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:28,989
You just be the tragic lead.

00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:38,666
Okay.

-Sure.
-Sorry about this.

First, Youngjin's caught
in a hiring scandal,

807

and now the film they invested in
is in this casting scandal.

They're threatening to pull their money.

And of course, they are. I would too.

The public's already made up their minds,

815
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:35,639
and you're going to go out there

816
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:37,808
saying, "We were totally fair back then"?

817
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:41,770
Yes, even if they don't believe us.
Even if it's foolish. I want to do that.

00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:45,316

You can't just
rush into something like this.

to live like everyone else.

I've never been like other people.

Scared of being caught and judged.

Come to think of it,
we still need Lee Daeum.
