=The Missing Snowflakes=

00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,140
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,160
I've made it!

4
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,600
It's the nine-tailed poison.

5
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,960
It doesn't have a smell or taste.

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,960
Only the liquor

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,480
will trigger its toxicity.

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,400
No wonder.

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,400
The kids were not seriously sick.

10
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,760
Who would do such a thing?

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,880
Why did they want to poison everyone?

12
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,480
You're hungry?

13
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,360
(He looks cute when cooking.)

14
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,400
What are you looking at?

15
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,880
I didn't know

16
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,320
you can cook well.

17
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,680
Are you sure

18
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,080
the water is safe?

19
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,440
Yes, I am.

20
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,640
Rest assured.

21
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,880
You won't be poisoned.

22
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,200
Any antidotes
to the nine-tailed poison?

23
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,040
Come on.

24
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,320
Can I just finish eating?

25
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,800
I haven't eaten anything today!

26
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,400
Aren't you hungry?

27
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,120
Want some garlic?

28
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,440
No.

29
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,880
It tastes good.

30
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,000
By the way,

31
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,800
do you know anything
about the poison?

32
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,720
How will you deal with it?

33
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,400
The poison is from the North State.

34
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,240
It's made from nine kinds of tails

35
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,720
and nine poisonous weeds.

36
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,200
It's unique

37
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,200
and hard to deal with.

38
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,960
Eat more.

39
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,560
And work harder.

40
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,280
Only one extra egg for me?

41
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,240
There are more.

42
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,840
You can get more if you want.

43
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,340
(Imperial Palace)

44
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,240
Your Majesty,

45
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,520
Prince Peace and his wife
arrived at Qingshui County.

46
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,600
Keep an eye on them.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,160
I don't want to see them again.

48
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,520
Got it.

49
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,120
Your Majesty,

50
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,080
nice to meet you!

51
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,480
You're so thoughtful!

52
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,240
You came here so early

53
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,880
to visit an old woman like me.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,920
Your Majesty,

55
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,280
you're still very young.

56
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,320
I believe you're in your 20s.

57
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,120
How sweet!

58
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,120
Have a seat.

59
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,120
(He looks even cuter)

60
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,640
(when working hard.)

61
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,680
Morning.

62
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,880
Have a seat.

63
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,040
What do the royal members do

64
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,640
at ordinary times?

65
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,280
You didn't have much work
in the capital city.

66
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,880
You can understand all these files?

67
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,480
These are some big cases.

68
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,360
And that one is about diplomacy.

69
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,640
I had a lot to do.

70
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,080
You didn't see it.

71
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,360
By the way,

72
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,480
do you know how to get the antidote?

73
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,480
Certainly!

74
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,720
No big deal.

75
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,200
You'll look for the nine kinds

76
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,760
of tails.

77
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,040
I'll look for the nine

78
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:19,999
poisonous weeds.

79
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,080
Then I can make the antidote.

80
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,560
OK.

81
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,640
I'll ask Shiqi to go with you.

82
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,440
But how can we get out?

83
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,080
See?

84
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,960
It's the new way you figured out?

85
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,160
Your Highness,

86
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,000
she's laughing at the hole I made.

87
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:52,840
Miss.

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,160
It took me a long time to do it!

89
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,080
Look at my calluses!

90
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,960
Stop it.

91
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,680
It's getting late.

92
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,520
We should go now.

93
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,720
OK.

94
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,520
Sir,

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,720
stand still.

96
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,520
Listen to me.

97
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,440
We need skills to get through the hole.

98
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,840
Keep yourself balanced...

99
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,200
Miss.

100
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,160
The mountain is huge.

101
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,880
Where will we find the weeds?

102
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,960
To practice medicine

103
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,280
is more difficult than you imagine.

104
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,920
I'm just wondering

105
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,480
whether

106
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,560
we can find the weeds

107
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,840
that you need in such a huge mountain.

108
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,040
I'm not sure.

109
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,160
Then why are we here?

110
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,640
Go home.

111
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,440
Don't go.

112
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Look at the picture I drew.

113
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,160
Poisonous weeds are colorful.

114
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,480
It's easier to find them.

115
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,280
If I pick up the poisonous weed,

116
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,880
will it poison me and make me ugly?

117
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,160
Certainly.

118
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,080
Really?

119
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,360
If so,

120
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,240
can I just go home?

121
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,240
Hurry up.

122
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,640
(Courier Station)

123
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,119
Tell you what.

124
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,640
I saw the purple flower in no time.

125
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,880
It was shining for me, you know.

126
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,920
You've been
talking about it for a long time.

127
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,890
-Aren't you tired?
-Miss,

128
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,900
the one flower was hard...

129
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,440
Your Highness!

130
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,240
Don't die, please!

131
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,840
-I can't live without you!
-Your Highness...

132
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,600
Your Highness!

133
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,480
What's wrong?

134
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,240
Look.

135
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,479
It's not fair if you die

136
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,840
only for finding the tails.

137
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,520
Be quiet.

138
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,320
He was poisoned.

139
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,040
What?

140
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,280
Take him home.

141
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,920
Your Highness,

142
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
why is

143
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,560
his wound black

144
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,760
instead of bleeding?

145
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,440
The poison is tricky.

146
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,690
It clots when blood goes out.

147
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,200
So, all the toxicity will be blocked.

148
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,320
Just tell me

149
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,480
if you can cure him.

150
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,000
I can.

151
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,480
But...

152
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,760
Come on!

153
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,800
Can you just tell me it?

154
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,440
I can only use the oldest way.

155
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:49,920
Well,

156
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,720
go ahead.

157
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,680
Do it.

158
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,320
Hurry up.

159
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,640
Don't hesitate!

160
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,120
(Courier Station)

161
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,240
Your Highness.

162
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,720
You're a great physician.

163
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,280
His Highness isn't running a fever.

164
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,120
You made a miracle happen!

165
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,910
It's a piece of cake.

166
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,960
What are you doing?

167
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,000
Your lips...

168
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,120
I'm a very kind person.

169
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,760
And I'm selfless.

170
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,680
What a great physician I am!

171
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,280
(His nose is cute.)

172
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,400
(He has long eyelashes.)

173
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,880
(And the chin looks good.)

174
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,440
(And his mouth...)

175
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,000
What are you doing?

176
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,800
I'm looking at your wound.

177
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,480
It's in my chest.

178
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,680
Right.

179
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,480
It hurts.

180
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,720
Sorry about that.
