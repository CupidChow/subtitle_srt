00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,550
=Episode 17=

3
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,200
Her Majesty's orders.

4
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,680
The Lins hide twin sisters,

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,760
which is a bad omen for the country.

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,440
Lin Yuzhi lies to His Majesty.

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,000
He shall no longer be the Grand Tutor.

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,840
Search Lin Residence.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,440
Everyone in Lin Residence

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,360
shall be in prison.

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,600
Master,

12
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,400
please save Shangguan Li.

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,800
I've told you,

14
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,240
no one can cure him.

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:58,920
Master,

16
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,190
why no one can help him?

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,600
Why is that?

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,160
You can save him.

19
00:01:03,228 --> 00:01:04,400
Aren't you the medical sage?

20
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,360
I said,

21
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,160
no one can cure him.

22
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,440
Yes, you can.

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,560
Master, please help me.

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,680
I'm begging you.

25
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,840
I'm begging you.

26
00:01:12,914 --> 00:01:14,220
- Please help him.
- Huanhuan.

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,400
Please save him.

28
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,480
Huanhuan.

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,400
I...

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,320
I give up.

31
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,160
Shangguan Li.

32
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:22,960
Shangguan Li.

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,800
I give up.

34
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,840
Huanhuan,

35
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,440
I give up.

36
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,440
I give up.

37
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,480
I don't need it.

38
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,640
I give up, Huanhuan.

39
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:30,490
Why did you say that?

40
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,680
How could you say that?

41
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,120
You want to be the emperor, right?

42
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,480
You can't do it like this.

43
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:36,880
I give up.

44
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,120
I won't be the emperor.

45
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,080
No, you can't give up.

46
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,280
Master,

47
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,360
please help him.

48
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,360
There must be a cure.

49
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,200
Please help me.

50
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,600
Please do something.

51
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,640
There must be a way.

52
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,200
If you want to revive his legs,

53
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,560
you need the Thousand-Year Ice Toad,

54
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,320
the Snow Lotus,

55
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,080
and Tail of the Fire Phoenix.

56
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,960
How can you find

57
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,040
all these treasures?

58
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,600
I can.

59
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,520
(I'm afraid)

60
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,514
(I can't protect you in the future.)

61
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,360
(But if you use this whistle,)

62
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,720
(my secret guards)

63
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,800
(will be in your charge.)

64
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,280
Your Highness.

65
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,120
Do not tell his highness

66
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,680
what I ask you to do.

67
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,640
Yes, Your Highness.

68
00:03:08,714 --> 00:03:11,314
I heard there's the Tail
of the Fire Phoenix in the capital city.

69
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,440
Do you know where it is?

70
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,280
Why would you do that

71
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,080
if you knew it would happen?

72
00:03:18,285 --> 00:03:19,914
Give me the Tail of the Fire Phoenix.

73
00:03:19,971 --> 00:03:21,270
I need it for Shangguan Li's legs.

74
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,360
How dare you say that!

75
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,771
If it wasn't for you,

76
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,040
how could Li end up like this?

77
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,600
What do you mean?

78
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,800
You don't know, huh?

79
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,640
Li did this to save you,

80
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,960
and to save the Lins.

81
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,800
That's why he broke his legs willingly.

82
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,960
Or there's nobody

83
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,520
who can hurt him.

84
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,480
What?

85
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,760
He didn't tell you that?

86
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,920
What a man in love!

87
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,080
You're not Lin Shangshang.

88
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,920
You just have the same face

89
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,360
as she had.

90
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,800
You disgust me.

91
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,000
How about disfiguring it?

92
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:20,920
If I do it,

93
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,800
can you give me
the Tail of the Fire Phoenix?

94
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,760
Depends on my mood.

95
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,440
(Everything started)

96
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,760
(from this face.)

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,920
Huanhuan.

98
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,200
You're here again.

99
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:51,960
Huanhuan,

100
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,880
see what I got for you.

101
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,280
I have walnut cookies and
cheese from the capital city.

102
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
And the jewelry.

103
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,440
It's very pretty.

104
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,720
I will wear it for you.

105
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,240
I don't need it.

106
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,520
I can only stay in the mountains.

107
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
I can't leave.

108
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,080
You're just a few minutes
older than me!

109
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,280
You aren't my big sister.

110
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,720
Huanhuan,

111
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,960
I'm so sorry.

112
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,800
Why are you crying?

113
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,360
I'm the one who should cry.

114
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,840
Try the fried fish,

115
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,400
you can't find it in the capital city.

116
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,720
Do you like it?

117
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,200
Yes.

118
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,920
I've made up my mind.

119
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
Just go back.

120
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,240
She's not Shangshang.

121
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,080
Shangshang is dead.

122
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,400
She's the younger one, Lin Huanhuan.

123
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,560
I understand.

124
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,520
If Shangshang is still alive,

125
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,920
she wouldn't stand it.

126
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,920
Father,

127
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,480
please spare the Lins.

128
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,080
Why are you so stubborn?

129
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,760
They are twins,

130
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,360
which is a bad omen.

131
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,080
How can that be a bad omen?

132
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,960
She saved the people
of Qingshui County.

133
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,240
She made Shangguan Li
give up his pride.

134
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,350
She treats and cures people.

135
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,290
How can a woman like her

136
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,240
be a bad omen to the country, Father?

137
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,800
Are you trying to against me?

138
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,800
Father,

139
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,040
that saying isn't true.

140
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,440
You are a wise emperor

141
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,040
who rules the country with wisdom.

142
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,840
Why are you afraid of a woman?

143
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,040
I...

144
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,680
You fool.

145
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,560
Now you're eloquent, huh?

146
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:07,960
Guards!

147
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,228
Take him out.

148
00:07:10,257 --> 00:07:11,390
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Father.

149
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,480
You're a wise emperor.

150
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,080
Please think twice, Father.

151
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,360
Father!

152
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,280
Darling,

153
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,120
please don't be mad.

154
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,440
He's still young.

155
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,160
You!

156
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,080
I spoiled you

157
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,480
too much.

158
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,200
That's why you're being so foolish.

159
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,760
Even if Li is a thorn in your side,

160
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,520
he is my son.

161
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,000
He is a Prince.

162
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,000
I made your son

163
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,640
the Crown Prince.

164
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,720
Empress,

165
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,800
what do you want from me?

166
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,000
Tell me!

167
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,080
What do you want from me?

168
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,640
Susu,

169
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,320
I just

170
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,520
love you too much.

171
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,360
That's why I ignored

172
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,920
all the things

173
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,120
you have done.

174
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,240
But you tried to kill the Prince,

175
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,160
help General Zhao,

176
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,720
deliver the fake drugs,

177
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,960
and poison common people.

178
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,960
You disappointed me.

179
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,040
Guards!

180
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
The empress should stay in cold palace,

181
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,360
and never step out from it again.

182
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,520
Darling.

183
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,960
Darling, no.

184
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,120
Darling, I'm sorry.

185
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,080
I will never do that again, darling.

186
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,159
Darling.

187
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,480
Darling.

188
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,559
I'm so sorry.

189
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,520
Darling.

190
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,039
No need to worry.

191
00:08:44,228 --> 00:08:45,920
I have found the
Tail of the Fire Phoenix.

192
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,440
Just two things left.

193
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,800
Huanhuan.

194
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,080
What is it?

195
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,800
Are your legs hurt?

196
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,320
No.

197
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:00,840
What about you?

198
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,200
How is your face?

199
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:07,960
It's alright.

200
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,680
But,

201
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,320
I'm not pretty now.

202
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,320
Will you love me the way you were?

203
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,200
I will.

204
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,600
Shangguan Li,

205
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,600
let's leave this place.

206
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,320
I don't like it here.

207
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,080
Okay.

208
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,640
That's it?

209
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,840
Aren't you asking where we go?

210
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,520
I will go wherever you go.

211
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,920
Where there is you,

212
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,880
there is home.

213
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,960
I will watch your treasures for you.

214
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,320
Go ahead.

215
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,600
He saved the Lins.

216
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,360
Did Shangshang die in pain?

217
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,920
She hanged herself.

218
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,880
I'm sorry for your loss.

219
00:10:17,428 --> 00:10:19,080
At least my sister was in love with you

220
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,480
when she ended her life.

221
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,200
My face is now

222
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,040
different from hers.

223
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,920
I didn't know

224
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,480
what kind of love

225
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,560
can cost one's life.

226
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,120
Now I understand.

227
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,342
Your Royal Highness,

228
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,520
please take care.

229
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,680
Turns out

230
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,120
you never left me.
