=The Missing Snowflakes=

2
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,885
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,120
See for yourself,

4
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,960
smiling like a blossom.

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,480
I asked you here to discuss something.

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,800
What is it?

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,680
What is this?

8
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,200
It's too big to swallow.

9
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,280
It's precious.

10
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,400
The name of it
is the Faked-death Drug.

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,520
I secretly made it in Qingshui County.

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,200
The Faked-death Drug?

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,760
What do you need it for?

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,720
I wanted to leave without notice.

15
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,510
So that's all I have left.

16
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,200
I see.

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,160
You...

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,880
you're still into the Crown Prince.

19
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,880
You want to fake your death
and marry him instead.

20
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,200
Then you need a new identity.

21
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,720
Let me think.

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,880
You can be our distant relative,
our cousin.

23
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,800
Then we can be the Crown Prince's
brother-in-law.

24
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,520
A royal brother-in-law.

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,720
Stop.

26
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,520
That's enough.

27
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,160
I wanted to leave,

28
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,040
to be free,

29
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,240
and to fly away.

30
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,560
Are you not free in this Mansion?

31
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:38,920
Does His Highness treat you unwell?

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,800
No, he doesn't.

33
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,440
He treats me nicely.

34
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,680
But it has been my dream

35
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,000
to be a rich physician.

36
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,480
I can travel everywhere.

37
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,560
I can see how the flowers blossom,

38
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,400
and how the snow thaw.

39
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,720
You can see how the flowers blossom,

40
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,720
and how the snow thaw in here.

41
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,240
That's a metaphor.

42
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,120
Anyway,

43
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,880
I don't know what to do.

44
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,400
Do I leave?

45
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,840
Or do I stay?

46
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,240
Bro,

47
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,760
we can't let her leave like that.

48
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,760
His Highness...

49
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,360
We must count on him.

50
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,760
You are right.

51
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,560
This time,

52
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,120
we need to be on his side.

53
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,760
Soft-boiled eggs of love.

54
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,200
Steamed bun of love.

55
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,640
Radish of love.

56
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,600
Your Highness.

57
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,600
please enjoy.

58
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,920
These two fools

59
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,840
took my job.

60
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,160
Thanks to Shangshang, who made the cure,

61
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,720
and saved thousands of lives.

62
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,240
Tell me,

63
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,840
what reward do you want?

64
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,720
- I'd like...
- Shangshang and I

65
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,040
went to Qingshui County
for mending our mistake.

66
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,200
We need no reward.

67
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,200
Besides,

68
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,360
Shangshang has mercy.

69
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,440
The well-being of people

70
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,400
is what Princess Peace hopes.

71
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,600
(I never said that.)

72
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,800
Princess Peace.

73
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,160
That's good.

74
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,320
What a Princess Peace!

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,520
I would

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,920
reward you greatly.

77
00:03:38,257 --> 00:03:40,200
- Much obliged, Father.
- Much obliged, Father.

78
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,400
(Benevolent Physician)

79
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,640
He's really stingy.

80
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,480
What a coincidence.

81
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,640
Shangshang, I...

82
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,542
Your Royal Highness,

83
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,360
I know we had history before.

84
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,400
But,

85
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,160
I am Princess Peace now.

86
00:04:09,828 --> 00:04:10,920
Li treats me well.

87
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,080
I like him as well.

88
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,760
You will find a better girl

89
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,160
in the future.

90
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,760
I'll take my leave.

91
00:04:16,828 --> 00:04:18,040
Li is waiting for me.

92
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,640
I doubt that

93
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,480
the fake drugs in the army

94
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,360
have connections with Qingshui County.

95
00:04:47,628 --> 00:04:48,720
Please take a look, Father.

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,800
What is this?

97
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,080
It is the totem on the neck

98
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,280
of the one who delivered the drug.

99
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:04,720
Moreover,

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,840
the magistrate of Qingshui County,
Xu Qingfeng,

101
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,680
had this totem on his neck.

102
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,200
This arrow

103
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,680
was the weapon used
to attack me in Qingshui County.

104
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,360
It had poison on it.

105
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,880
It aimed to kill me

106
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,120
at once.

107
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,120
How dare they do that!

108
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,800
Assassinating the Prince

109
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,280
in the public.

110
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,560
Such villains.

111
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,720
Keep investigating.

112
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,640
Yes, Father.

113
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:27,960
Your Highness.

114
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,057
(Zhao)

115
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,120
They lose their patience.

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,080
Send the token
to the imperial palace.

117
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,560
Yes, sir.

118
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,142
(Benevolent Physician)

119
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:06,800
Look!

120
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,840
It was given by His Majesty.

121
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,920
It's the first one
in the capital city.

122
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,600
We should visit here from now on.

123
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,040
The physician is even a lady.

124
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:15,457
You're right.

125
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,720
Is everything alright? Your Highness?

126
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,520
Do you often find a funny smell on you?

127
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,771
Is it hard to clean it?

128
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,520
I give you some Golden Lotus Pill.

129
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,880
Take it for two weeks.

130
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,800
And,

131
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,480
your underwear

132
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,080
should be dried by sunlight.

133
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:32,920
Got it?

134
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,080
(Benevolent Physician)

135
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,720
Next.

136
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,680
Come here.

137
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,680
Shut up. Come.

138
00:08:05,857 --> 00:08:07,000
What's this all about?

139
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,080
Forget it.

140
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,000
Pick them up.

141
00:08:20,371 --> 00:08:21,520
What are you looking at?

142
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,680
Look at me.

143
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:23,920
What are you doing?

144
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,320
Are these for you?

145
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,560
They're for Her Highness.

146
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,760
You two fools, come on.

147
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,150
You're in my way.

148
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,840
Honey,

149
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,030
look!

150
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,920
I prepared so many things for you,

151
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,160
and you just want gold?

152
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,440
You prepared it?

153
00:09:01,114 --> 00:09:01,920
What do you think?

154
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,800
What day is it?

155
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,720
It's so special.

156
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,000
You don't know what day it is?

157
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,400
No, I don't.
