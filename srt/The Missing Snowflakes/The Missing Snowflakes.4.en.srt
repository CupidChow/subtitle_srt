=Episode 4=

3
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,760
Are you in love with me?

4
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,600
No.

5
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,320
Why did you kiss me?

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,720
I did it for fun.

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,600
How could you do it?

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,120
You can do anything at home.

9
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,200
But

10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,440
never mess

11
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,999
with anyone in the imperial palace.

12
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,200
You mean the Crown Prince?

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,240
Yes.

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,480
He was coming on to me all the time!

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:00,880
Furthermore,

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,880
Lin Shangshang and the Crown Prince
loved each other.

17
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,080
You stole her from him.

18
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,680
I never did such a thing.

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,440
And I meant every word.

20
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,040
Remember:

21
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,840
don't get involved with him.

22
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,640
You look ugly.

23
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,440
I think he falls in love with me.

24
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,480
Don't do it.

25
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,440
I won't love you back.

26
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,380
(Nature's Treasures)

27
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,680
Your Highness,

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,160
waiting for the secret guards?

29
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,600
You're hardworking!

30
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,450
I'm watching the moon.

31
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,320
The moon?

32
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,840
It's so bright!

33
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,840
Take a look.

34
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,160
Mother,

35
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,240
it's...

36
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,720
Shangguan Li is plotting something.

37
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,560
It seems he listens to us

38
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,880
and obeys our orders.

39
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,680
But he's close
to important officials secretly.

40
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,400
He hasn't revealed his true colors.

41
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,840
You need to be careful.

42
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,200
I will.

43
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,480
I heard his wife

44
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,760
opened a clinic in the capital city.

45
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,600
Mother, Shangshang is innocent.

46
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,120
Please leave her alone.

47
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,200
I won't hurt her.

48
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,380
(Mansion of Prince Peace)

49
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,200
Should I go in or not?

50
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,720
Go in.

51
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,560
Shangguan Li,

52
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,480
I want to...

53
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,920
It's daytime!

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Why are you undressed?

55
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,960
It's my room.

56
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,720
I can do anything I want.

57
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,120
You've got

58
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,160
fair skin.

59
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,200
Turn around.

60
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,800
Well...

61
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,760
I want to talk to you about something.

62
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,360
Shoot.

63
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,000
Can I work

64
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,880
in my clinic every day?

65
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,160
I don't want to idle about at home.

66
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,920
If I can work in the clinic,

67
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,600
I'll make money for our family.

68
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,720
You can count on me.

69
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,720
Money isn't my only goal
in the clinic.

70
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,080
(His eyes...)

71
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,160
(And his nose...)

72
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,240
(Why am I feeling nervous?)

73
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,200
(She's not beautiful.)

74
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,680
(It must be because
I lost too much blood.)

75
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,920
(But...)

76
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,000
(Why is my heart beating fast?)

77
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,680
(He's good-looking.)

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,880
Why do I smell
Wound Healing Ointment?

79
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,080
It's very expensive.

80
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,120
Are you injured?

81
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,760
Get out.

82
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,360
Can I go to my clinic?

83
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,280
Get out before I change my mind.

84
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,120
OK!

85
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,720
(Why is my heart beating so fast?)

86
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,880
(It's because I'm injured.)

87
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,080
Lin Huanhuan,

88
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,280
why is your heart beating fast?

89
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,120
You can't fall for him!

90
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,600
Your Highness,

91
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,120
why are you blushing?

92
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,950
Are you having a fever?

93
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,560
What?

94
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,760
No, I'm not.

95
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,320
Yuetao,

96
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,240
I'll take you out tomorrow.

97
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,620
(Clear and Dustless)

98
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,760
Your Highness,

99
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,120
are you looking at the sun?

100
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,360
I'm waiting for the secret guards.

101
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:52,760
What?

102
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,600
Are they coming in the daytime now?

103
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,320
Get lost.

104
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:57,920
Hold on.

105
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,080
What's this?

106
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,130
Her Highness asked me
to brew medical herbs

107
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,560
to dispel dampness and coldness.

108
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,080
It's for everyone.

109
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:05,960
You want some?

110
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,840
Will it work?

111
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,400
You'll know after having some.

112
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,760
Should I?

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,760
Have a shot.

114
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,640
I'll pass.

115
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,240
(I'm your nominal wife now.)

116
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,250
(So, you can think
I'm Lin Shangshang.)

117
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,840
(Are you in love with me?)

118
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,520
(No.)

119
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,760
(Why did you kiss me?)

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,160
What's wrong with me?

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,320
I'm just working with her.

122
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,350
Your Highness,

123
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,280
the empress sent her people
hanging around.

124
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:12,960
Got it.

125
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,860
(Mansion of Prince Peace)

126
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:19,400
Your Highness,

127
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,000
how is your wound?

128
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:21,800
It's OK.

129
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,560
In the capital city,

130
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,120
no one dares to hurt you

131
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,160
in such a bad way

132
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,200
except for the empress.

133
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,040
Now the royal court

134
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,000
is under her control.

135
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,560
The Crown Prince
is cowardly and spineless.

136
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,560
The future of the Wind Dynasty

137
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,160
is really gloomy.

138
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,560
My father is alive.

139
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,840
I don't want to betray him.

140
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:50,500
(Clear and Dustless)

141
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,000
Shangshang.

142
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,040
What?

143
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,400
I'll go with you.

144
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,170
Really?
