=Episode 13=

3
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,960
(Courier Station)

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,760
Your Royal Highness,

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,680
Your Royal Highness.

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:29,960
Here it is.

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,600
Best fried bread stick
in Qingshui County.

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,960
Please enjoy.

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:39,800
Is it good?

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,360
Here, slowly.

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,360
Some massaging.

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,320
Princess Peace is here.

13
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,520
Take care.

14
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,200
What are you doing here?

15
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,600
Your Highness,

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,000
what happened to you?

17
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,320
Bitten by a snake.

18
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,480
What a smart snake!

19
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,120
It knows where to bite.

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,160
Stay focused.

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,640
What are you doing here?

22
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,560
You're with His Royal Highness, too.

23
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,600
You said you would write a letter to us.

24
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,880
- We didn't receive anything.
- That's right.

25
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,800
Answer my question.

26
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,160
- It is a sad story.
- It is a sad story.

27
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,000
(Three Days Ago)
It's been so long.

28
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,680
It has been 17 days
since Her Highness left.

29
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,960
We receive no letter.

30
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,600
We really can't count on her.

31
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,920
Just make it a casino.

32
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:15,960
You want treatment,

33
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,320
or medicine?

34
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,520
Your Highness,

35
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,640
I didn't know you were someone like this.

36
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,560
His Royal Highness is
in love with you for 10 years,

37
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,360
how can you abandon him for another man?

38
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,280
I didn't know you were someone

39
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,640
who treats love

40
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,360
so causally

41
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,560
and carelessly.

42
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,040
Your words are so frankly.

43
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,440
What brings you here,

44
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,760
Your Royal Highness?

45
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,400
I'm here for Shangshang.

46
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,080
Does the empress know you're out?

47
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,680
She should know it by now.

48
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,240
You fools!

49
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
With so many servants,

50
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,400
the Crown Prince still ran away.

51
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,720
We're sorry, Your Majesty.

52
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,480
He doesn't care about his life

53
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,400
and went to Qingshui County

54
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,160
for a woman.

55
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,640
The Lins have a nice daughter.

56
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,920
As the Crown Prince,

57
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,120
you have great responsibility.

58
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,720
It's not the place for you.

59
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,040
You should go back.

60
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,800
Shangguan Li,

61
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,400
stop acting up like this.

62
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,800
I just care about her.

63
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,840
Your Royal Highness
should care about politics.

64
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,840
There are fake drugs in the army.

65
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,240
Soldiers are hurt but untreated.

66
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,040
And you,

67
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,840
you're here caring about my wife.

68
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,200
Sir,

69
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,160
it's done.

70
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,240
Great, I'll take a look.

71
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,920
Sir,

72
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,920
the flood-control plan
you explained last time was brilliant,

73
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,560
I was impressed.

74
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,520
I would like to discuss it more.

75
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,560
Your Highness has talents,

76
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,280
then I will go through
the details again.

77
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,680
Shangshang,

78
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,600
what are you drawing?

79
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,760
Me and Shangshang
were close since childhood.

80
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,520
I know that
you don't have feelings for her.

81
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,720
Can you give her back to me?

82
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,400
Do you want me to divorce her?

83
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,680
What do you want?

84
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,880
I can give you everything.

85
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,280
Give me the throne,

86
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,920
and I will give her to you.

87
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,040
You...

88
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,160
Did you hear that?

89
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,720
How could he say that?

90
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,600
When you were kidnapped,

91
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,120
he didn't pay the ransom.

92
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,680
Now he is selling you instead.

93
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,560
That's right.

94
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,640
Taking a look at the Crown Prince,

95
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,760
he's the richest
young man in the country.

96
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,080
He's beyond compare.

97
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,280
That's it.

98
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,240
He's right.

99
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,280
Besides, he's in love
with you for ten years.

100
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,640
Ten Years.

101
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,240
How many decades in one's life?

102
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,760
Just divorce him.

103
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,120
Wait...

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,320
Shangshang is the only one
I will marry in my life.

105
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,600
Please have some respect,
Your Royal Highness.

106
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,680
(Courier Station)

107
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,680
I'd like to say something,

108
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,200
I made this meal

109
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,720
all by myself.

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,720
First, to the outbreak is controlled.

111
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,920
Second,

112
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,360
I'd like to welcome Your Royal Highness.

113
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,920
Enjoy yourselves.

114
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,920
Please.

115
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,480
- What a good toast!
- That's right.

116
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,040
I didn't expect

117
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,880
that among all your talents,

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,160
you are also good at cooking.

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,320
It is my pleasure

120
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,320
to have a taste.

121
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,280
Please, enjoy.

122
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:31,960
Here.

123
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,640
Your Highness, let's try the fish head.

124
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,760
With the fish head,

125
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,040
luck will go ahead.

126
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,360
Got it.

127
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,120
Here.

128
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,280
With the fishtail,

129
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,960
everything will set sail.

130
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:01,920
Take it easy.

131
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,120
Take it easy.

132
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,480
Is it good?

133
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,920
Very tasty.

134
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,160
It's very tasty.

135
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,600
Your Royal Highness, please dig in.

136
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,600
Vegetables are good

137
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,520
for your health.

138
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,720
More.

139
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,200
Sure, more.

140
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:17,880
Here.

141
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:19,720
Here you are.

142
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,960
Well...

143
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,880
Is it good?

144
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,200
Yes,

145
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,040
very delicious.

146
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,000
Very well.

147
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,600
Shangguan Li,

148
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,520
I envy you.

149
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,840
You can enjoy Shangshang's
cooking every day.

150
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,160
Sure I can.

151
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,080
Your Highness, you like soup.

152
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,040
Have some soup.

153
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,000
Here.

154
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,560
- Your Highness.
- That's alright.

155
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,840
Here, enjoy.

156
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,920
(That's what you both get
when you trying to plot me.)

157
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,280
(Courier Station)

158
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,640
Your Royal Highness.

159
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,320
Me and my wife are going to rest.

160
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,560
If you're not sleepy,

161
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,240
you can enjoy
the moonlight with some tea.

162
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,480
Prince Peace,

163
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,160
maybe you should join me.

164
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,400
(Courier Station)
Get it to the back. Be careful.

165
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,120
- It's full of treasures.
- Yes, sir.

166
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,160
It's very valuable.

167
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:27,920
Wait a minute.

168
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,960
Which side are you two with?

169
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,440
How dare you!

170
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,120
You giant catfish.

171
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,240
How dare you say that.

172
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,040
The Qingshui County is safe now.

173
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,840
Treat the people with kindness in future.

174
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,800
Mr. Chen, do your best.

175
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,000
The royal court
will reward good officials.

176
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,320
I would never fail the royal court.

177
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,640
I will follow your instructions.

178
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,000
Shangshang.

179
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,280
Go away.

180
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,600
(Courier Station)

181
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,240
But how...

182
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,600
Let's go.
