=Episode 16=

3
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,280
You don't know what day it is?

4
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,720
No, I don't.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,080
It's your birthday today.

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,880
I think it is.

7
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,800
You never celebrated your birthday?

8
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:41,800
Not so often.

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,760
Mater was always on the trips,

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,240
and it's boring to celebrate birthday alone.

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,120
It's alright.

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,240
From now on,

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,960
I'll celebrate your birthday

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,200
for you.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,360
Here.

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,280
Happy birthday to Huanhuan.

17
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,400
See?

18
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,520
Beautiful scenery,

19
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,360
tasty wine,

20
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,360
beauty, and treasure.

21
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,120
It's all set.

22
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,840
I'm telling you,

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,600
they will surely have a wonderful night.

24
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,640
Smart!

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,640
Wise!

26
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,000
(Nature Breeds Treasure)

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,480
Look.

28
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,800
What?

29
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,000
There's no moon tonight.

30
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:33,760
One.

31
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,360
Two.

32
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,200
Three.

33
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,240
It's so beautiful.

34
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,680
Look at that!

35
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,240
Huanhuan.

36
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,240
What is it?

37
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,039
I...

38
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,080
I don't know when I started

39
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,840
being in love with you.

40
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,240
Oh no.

41
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,200
It really happened.

42
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,360
What should I do?

43
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,240
I heard

44
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,880
you're the bro.

45
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,000
Shiqi,

46
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,120
have this.

47
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:53,880
From now on,

48
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,840
you're my bro.

49
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,200
I'm at your service.

50
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,600
I appreciate it.

51
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,720
I appreciate it.

52
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,000
Of course.

53
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,640
Here.

54
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,520
Please take it

55
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,760
and share.

56
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,680
I'm taking care of you.

57
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,440
Right?

58
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,840
Here.

59
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,080
Thanks, bro.

60
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,950
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

61
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,520
Bro.

62
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,800
Please.

63
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:22,310
(Mansion of Prince Peace)

64
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,400
Orders from Her Majesty.

65
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,320
Your Highness.

66
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,840
Your Highness.

67
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,520
Your Majesty.

68
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,600
The Prince has arrived.

69
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,200
Leave us alone.

70
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,240
Yes.

71
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,560
Your Majesty, greetings.

72
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,360
Do you know why I called you here?

73
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,160
Yes.

74
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,560
Within one night,

75
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,600
people in General Zhao's Residence
were gone.

76
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,680
You're the only one

77
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,880
who can do this in the capital city.

78
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm just taking my responsibilities.

79
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,840
Li,

80
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,640
you should have compassion.

81
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,960
Am I right?

82
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,840
I'm from the Zhao family too.

83
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,800
Tell me,

84
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,360
what do you want?

85
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,760
Father has the evidence.

86
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,640
He should be the one

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,840
to decide.

88
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,200
I heard

89
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,320
you spent the night with your honey.

90
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,560
I wonder how deeply
Prince Peace loves her.

91
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,240
What do you want?

92
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,640
Since Prince Peace

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,080
likes taking responsibility...

94
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,240
Twins are bad omens in this country.

95
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,400
If I reveal Lin Huanhuan's identity

96
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,760
to your Father,

97
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,920
and he cares about the country so much,

98
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,320
do you think
he will kill the Lins or not?

99
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,240
Don't you dare!

100
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,360
You dare to do that,

101
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,400
me too.

102
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,800
If I set the Zhaos free,

103
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,400
will you stop?

104
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,840
It's not enough.

105
00:06:55,514 --> 00:06:56,200
Your Highness.

106
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,200
Your Highness.

107
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,200
Let's get out of here.

108
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,600
Yes, sir.

109
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Your Highness,

110
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,400
you are not

111
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,880
leaving this time, right?

112
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,120
Leave?

113
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,960
Why would I leave?

114
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,080
Happy life.

115
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,520
Happy life. Happy me.

116
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,240
Happy life. Happy me.

117
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,640
- Happy...
- Your Highness!

118
00:08:01,485 --> 00:08:02,200
Your Highness!

119
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,680
What happened?

120
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,960
Please help His Highness.

121
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,720
Please help His Highness.

122
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,240
(Mansion of Prince Peace)

123
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,400
Get out!

124
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,720
Get out.

125
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,120
From now on,

126
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,880
her orders

127
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,159
are my orders.

128
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,039
Yes, Your Highness.

129
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,960
It's scary, huh?

130
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,040
Who was it?

131
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,680
Who did this to you?

132
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,000
Will you

133
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,240
dislike me?

134
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,840
I will.

135
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,080
I will cure you.

136
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,800
Huanhuan.

137
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,400
Huanhuan.

138
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,040
Take this.

139
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,440
I'm afraid

140
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,280
I can't protect you in the future.

141
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,720
But if you use this whistle,

142
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,920
my secret guards

143
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,480
will be in your charge.

144
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,360
Take it.
