=The Missing Snowflakes=

2
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,850
=Episode 14=

3
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,360
Why you're in the same carriage with me?

4
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,960
We're husband and wife,

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,280
of course, we can share it.

6
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,920
My carriage was broken
before we took off.

7
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,120
Shangshang,

8
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,520
do you want some water?

9
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,120
Here you are.

10
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,680
- Have some water.
- Goat milk is better.

11
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,120
Have some water.

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,400
Stop the carriage.

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,239
- Shangshang.
- Shangshang.

14
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,160
- Shangshang.
- Shangshang.

15
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,640
Shangshang,

16
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,360
are you taking a break?

17
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,720
I'll go with you.

18
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,600
Leave me alone.

19
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,560
Shangshang.

20
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,320
Where are you going?

21
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,000
Here.

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,440
- Your Highness.
- Your Royal Highness.

23
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:21,880
Let's have a word.

24
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,800
Shangshang's leaving.

25
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,440
Let's go that way.

26
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,880
- Your Highness.
- Your Royal Highness.

27
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,080
Listen to me.

28
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,720
You can not be

29
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,400
hasty about it.

30
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,120
Take it slow.

31
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,120
Yeah, take it slow.

32
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,400
If she's not responding,
you can attract her

33
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,480
with your charm.

34
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,480
Go get her.

35
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,200
We should earn Her Highness' sympathy.

36
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,200
Her sympathy?

37
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,680
Her sympathy.

38
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,200
She's looking at you.

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,320
Harder.

40
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:53,960
Make it perfect.

41
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,280
Shangshang.

42
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,720
Is there...

43
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,240
anything to hunt?

44
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,680
It...

45
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,040
It was there.

46
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,200
It's gone now.

47
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,480
It ran away.

48
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,240
Your Highness,

49
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:35,960
get down.

50
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,760
Get down here.

51
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,160
Hurry up.

52
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,320
His Highness fell.

53
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,560
Someone come here.

54
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,120
Your Highness.

55
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,680
- Are you alright, Your Highness?
- Let's go.

56
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,480
Your Highness.

57
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:52,960
You...

58
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,320
Your Highness.

59
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,320
Are you alright?

60
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,160
I...

61
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,680
I picked you an apple.

62
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,960
His Highness fell from the tree

63
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,800
for picking you an apple.

64
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,680
He did it on purpose.

65
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,000
Smart move.

66
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
Your Highness, get up.

67
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,560
Watch your steps.

68
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,760
Your Highness,

69
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,080
can this tree grow apples?

70
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,640
What an apple tree!

71
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,200
People say that when one dies,

72
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,800
one will turn into a star.

73
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,399
Lin Shangshang,

74
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,280
which one is you?

75
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,760
Do you really believe in it?

76
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,240
Why do you ignore me?

77
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,880
You don't know why?

78
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,520
What am I to you?

79
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,600
You are my love.

80
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,800
I don't believe in you.

81
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,120
It's true.

82
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,960
Aren't you trading me
for the throne with His Royal Highness?

83
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,680
Give me the throne,

84
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,240
I will give her to you.

85
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,040
You...

86
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,960
So that's why you weren't willing
to speak to me.

87
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,920
Isn't that enough?

88
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,400
I would never

89
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,720
trade you for anything.

90
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,440
All my life,

91
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,720
my whole life,

92
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,000
I won't let you go.

93
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,320
Are you...

94
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,520
serious?

95
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,320
Shiqi is back!

96
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,040
Go get the cases.

97
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:36,840
Yes, sir.

98
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,880
What a big mansion!

99
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,400
You two,

100
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,560
the Crown Prince is back.

101
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,720
Why aren't you following him

102
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,560
instead of coming here?

103
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,840
Shiqi,

104
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,400
there's no fun

105
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,000
being the Crown Prince.

106
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,240
He will have countless beauties,

107
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,360
which means

108
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,480
there will be countless fights.

109
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,120
You fool.

110
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,040
That's why you are not successful.

111
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,000
Shiqi,

112
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,720
take them to the West Garden.

113
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,560
No problem.

114
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,760
I'm in charge here,

115
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,640
understood?

116
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,280
Huanhuan.

117
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,680
What is it?

118
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,400
It's nothing.

119
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,760
Then I'll head to the West Garden.

120
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,080
Is it cold?

121
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
Is the West Garden cold?

122
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,840
It's alright.

123
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,760
Are you hungry?

124
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,840
I'm OK.

125
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,240
Do you want to move in with me?

126
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:36,960
Alright.

127
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,000
I'll go to the West Garden.

128
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,920
You were supposed to
take care of Shangguan Li.

129
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,120
Mother,

130
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,920
it's my fault.

131
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,680
I thought I could

132
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,840
take Shangshang back from Shangguan Li.

133
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,040
But,

134
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,400
they were really in love.

135
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,360
Mother, please don't worry.

136
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,760
I would never do anything

137
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,960
to upset you.

138
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,080
They're in love.

139
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,840
From now on,

140
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,840
behave like the Crown Prince,

141
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,240
and please your Father.

142
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,680
Just leave things to me.

143
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,080
Take your leave.

144
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:50,920
Yes, Mother.

145
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,120
I'll take my leave.

146
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,680
(Mansion of Prince Peace)

147
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,000
What?

148
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,240
You two kissed?

149
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,280
That's right.

150
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,480
You're getting close.

151
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,680
Getting close?

152
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,000
That's right.

153
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,880
Take your leave.

154
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,120
Yes.

155
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,840
I would never

156
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,960
trade you for anything.

157
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,240
(All my life,)

158
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,120
(my whole life,)

159
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,040
(I won't let you go.)

160
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,200
You asked us to be here,

161
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,560
and you're just giggling?

162
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,680
I can't feel my hips.

163
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,400
I...

164
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,680
Was I smiling?

165
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,080
See for yourself,

166
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,880
smiling like a blossom.
