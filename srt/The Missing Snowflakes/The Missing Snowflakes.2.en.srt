=The Missing Snowflakes=

2
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,220
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,360
Why can't I do it?

4
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,840
They didn't ask us to have dinner.

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,080
We had to go hunting for ourselves.

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,480
It must be a domesticated mail pigeon.

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,280
Look.

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,160
It carried a bamboo tube.

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,760
Fake drugs appeared in the army.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,560
Your Highness.

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,400
Stealing the royal court's secret
is a capital crime.

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,520
The Lins are important officials.

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,000
Do you want to betray the emperor?

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,720
Don't talk about the Lins.

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,320
I'm Princess Peace,

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,560
which means I'm a member
of your family.

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,520
Stop looking!

18
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,440
Go to bed after eating.

19
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,920
We'll go to the imperial palace

20
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:10,999
to meet His Majesty.

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,360
(Imperial Palace)
Tea serving!

22
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,600
- Father and Mother.
- Father and Mother.

23
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,640
- Please have some tea.
- Please have some tea.

24
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,880
Time flies.

25
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,600
Li is married now.

26
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,080
Get up.

27
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,520
- Father, thank you.
- Father, thank you.

28
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,880
Shangshang is
the Grand Tutor Lin's daughter.

29
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,080
She has learned music, chess,
calligraphy and painting.

30
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,640
And Li is wise and capable, too.

31
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,080
You're a perfect couple.

32
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,320
(Lin Shangshang,)

33
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,960
(why did you learn so many?)

34
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,880
(I know nothing about them.)

35
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,880
Li,

36
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,760
you're the new future of the nation.

37
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,520
You need to assist the Crown Prince.

38
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,720
I will, Father.

39
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,160
The Crown Prince...

40
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,480
I'm talking to you!

41
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,560
Yes, Father.

42
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,520
(What is the Crown Prince doing?)

43
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,200
Do you know

44
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,760
why the Crown Prince stared at me?

45
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,120
He loved your elder sister.

46
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,800
Are you kidding?

47
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,040
You should've told me!

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,800
You didn't ask.

49
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,160
I should've looked back at him,

50
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,520
and found out why he was attractive.

51
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,080
Lin Shangshang even died for him.

52
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,880
But why did the empress
wanted her son's love

53
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,720
to marry you instead?

54
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,200
Because the Lins
is not powerful enough.

55
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,400
I see.

56
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,880
If you married into power,

57
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:01,999
you might take the throne.

58
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,360
Stop the carriage.

59
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,120
Get off!

60
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,200
Calm yourself down in the chilly wind.

61
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,040
Think about what you can say

62
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,200
and what you can't.

63
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,640
Shangguan Li!

64
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,720
How dare you?

65
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,280
You'll beg me to come back one day!

66
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,160
It's her.

67
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,400
Have you found her?

68
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,900
Your Highness, sorry.

69
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,640
I haven't found Princess Peace.

70
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,600
She's my wife now.

71
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,200
We should protect her.

72
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,840
Send more people.

73
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,800
Find her.

74
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,160
Got it.

75
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,760
(She can't find home?)

76
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,360
(Or she walks too slowly?)

77
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,480
How much did they pay you?

78
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,160
Twenty taels of silver.

79
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,040
What?

80
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,950
I'm worth much more!

81
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,240
Set me free.

82
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,510
My husband is loaded.

83
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,760
We're not foolish.

84
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,720
Stop bragging, OK?

85
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,500
He'll give you 200.

86
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,780
(Mansion of Prince Peace)

87
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,280
Who is it?

88
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,200
It's very early now!

89
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,480
Go tell your...

90
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,680
Open the door!

91
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,800
Open the door!

92
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,920
What do you want?

93
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,280
Pay the ransom!

94
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,960
You should know better!

95
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,160
Your... Your Highness!

96
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,400
Your Highness!

97
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,000
-It's...
-Stay calm.

98
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,720
It's from the kidnapper!

99
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:56,960
Read it.

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,550
Your Highness,
I'm your wife, Lin Shangshang.

101
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,160
I'm kidnapped.

102
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,520
The ransom is 200 taels of silver.

103
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,720
Please rescue me.

104
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,160
Thanks.

105
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,390
Your Highness...

106
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,960
Prince Peace... is kidnapped.

107
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,640
What should we do?

108
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,120
Shall we report to an official?

109
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,880
I'm more capable than those officials.

110
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,640
Such a small silver ingot?

111
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,800
Shangguan Li,

112
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,040
you've gone too far.

113
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,040
I can pay for the ransom.

114
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,080
What?

115
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,080
Do you have money?

116
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,560
I'm good at gambling!

117
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,520
Small!

118
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,560
Small! Small!

119
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,440
Place your bets!

120
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,880
Five, five, six. It's big.

121
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:57,960
It sucks.

122
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,680
They say the new comer will be lucky.

123
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,000
I thought I could win.

124
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,600
Just leave.

125
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,000
I told you

126
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,520
not to believe a woman.

127
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,480
Women are all

128
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,960
good liars.

129
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,200
Bro,

130
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,840
we can sell her.

131
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,600
Right!

132
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,000
Don't do it.

133
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,480
You should know more about me.

134
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,200
I've got many strong suits.

135
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,760
Please!

136
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,880
I won!

137
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,840
He died?

138
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:31,920
He's dead!

139
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,800
Go, now!

140
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,720
Stay where you are!

141
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,240
Help me to place him on the table!

142
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,040
You two, come here!

143
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,040
Miss,

144
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,840
we don't believe you.

145
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,950
It's a life-and-death matter!

146
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,040
He got too excited
and couldn't breathe.

147
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,600
I need someone to help him breathe.

148
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,280
What?

149
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,280
How?

150
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,240
How can we do it?

151
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,680
Just use your mouth!

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,400
You!

153
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:06,840
Me?

154
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,560
No way!

155
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,120
You woke up!

156
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,640
Don't be too excited anymore.

157
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,360
Let's go.

158
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,480
Miss, thank you.

159
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,040
Take these.

160
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,080
And all these.

161
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,520
I'm a very old man.

162
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,720
I know I didn't deserve your 'help'.

163
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,760
Listen to me.

164
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,840
My wife is waiting for me

165
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,520
at home.

166
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,680
So, I just can't

167
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,920
stay longer.

168
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,240
-Take these.
-His wife is waiting.

169
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
So, he can't stay with you.

170
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,720
Stop it!

171
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,640
Is she really kidnapped?

172
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,280
Listen to me.

173
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,240
Her Highness doesn't seem reliable.

174
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,360
But she's quite smart and competent.

175
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,920
Otherwise, the old man

176
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,640
would die just now.

177
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,360
Shut down the casino.

178
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,720
Got it.

179
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,480
It has bad influences.

180
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes.

181
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,520
It's good.

182
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,320
Very tasty.

183
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,440
Now I believe

184
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,920
they are a gang.

185
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,640
Your Highness,

186
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,640
should we rescue her?

187
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,560
If not, can we go home?

188
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,400
It's getting

189
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,200
much colder now.

190
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,680
To be frank,

191
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,040
I feel much better

192
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
after adding the herbs.

193
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,080
I'm sweating now.

194
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,960
You are so ignorant!

195
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,200
It's a medical herd,

196
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,240
named wormwood.

197
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,360
So, you're a real physician?

198
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,960
Of course!

199
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm the medical sage's apprentice.

200
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,560
I've made a lot of money for you.

201
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,160
Now you should tell me

202
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,440
who sent you to kidnap me.

203
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,100
It doesn't matter.

204
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,160
Then what matters?

205
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,840
-We should make more money.
-Yes!

206
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,840
I agree.

207
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,120
As a woman,

208
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,160
I need to make money.

209
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,240
Or no one will respect me at home.

210
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,400
She wants my respect?

211
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,080
Send people

212
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,200
to keep an eye on her.

213
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,200
Got it, Your Highness.

214
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:10,920
Don't be mad.

215
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,680
We can also

216
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,690
take a foot bath at home.

217
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,680
No big deal.

218
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,350
She has wormwood.

219
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,050
And we have stones.

220
00:10:15,051 --> 00:10:16,039
Take a foot bath with stones.

221
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,510
We can do it.

222
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,350
Right, Your Highness?

223
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:18,640
Your Highness.

224
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,640
Your Highness!
