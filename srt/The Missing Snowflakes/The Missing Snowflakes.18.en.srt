=Episode 18=

3
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,120
At last, we're leaving now.

4
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,800
We need to start over again.

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,000
We should leave.

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,360
The capital city

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,400
is too dangerous,

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,680
too risky.

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,720
Well,

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,320
Jiajia knows the best.

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,760
Jiajia is there.

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,628
It doesn't matter.

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,960
We can be something anywhere.

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,600
What?

15
00:00:48,714 --> 00:00:50,440
You know how to
make money like Her Highness?

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,760
Of course.

17
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,240
What did he say?

18
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,880
Why didn't you stop them?

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,440
That would be enough.

20
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,040
As long as Huanhuan is happy.

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,680
Right.

22
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,960
We owe her.

23
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,280
Well,

24
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,520
let's go home.

25
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,760
Ask me about it.

26
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,120
You never asked me about it.

27
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,640
You don't know where we're going.

28
00:01:51,714 --> 00:01:53,428
There's no sense
of accomplishment for me.

29
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,160
Well,

30
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,440
where is my greedy honey

31
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,280
selling me to?

32
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,280
I'm not greedy.

33
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,880
You are not?

34
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,760
The case behind is filled with treasure.

35
00:02:08,771 --> 00:02:09,750
Don't talk about it.

36
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,680
Nobody needs to know.

37
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,400
Understand?

38
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,960
You're so unlucky

39
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,680
that you met me.

40
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,480
No more throne,

41
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,200
and no more Prince...

42
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,240
Even your legs were broken.

43
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,560
That's why

44
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,760
you should

45
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,800
be responsible for me.

46
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,720
Honey,

47
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,480
look!

48
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,640
The stars!

49
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,880
It's so beautiful.

50
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,760
So this is freedom.

51
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,800
Look!

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,880
It's snowing.

53
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,720
It's amazing.

54
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,760
So beautiful.

55
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,400
You got snow in your hair.

56
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
I remember

57
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,720
my sister used to read me a poem:

58
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,600
"If the snowflakes drifted
on our heads at the same time,"

59
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,240
"it would be
as if we grew old together."

60
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,720
Shangguan Li,

61
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,720
I want to spend my life with you.

62
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,200
Yes.

63
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,800
Yes!

64
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,480
Silly.

65
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,400
How can snow compare

66
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,360
to our grey hair?

67
00:06:47,114 --> 00:06:48,314
It is my best luck

68
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,960
that

69
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,040
I

70
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:56,840
met

71
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,280
you.

72
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,760
(What am I to you?)

73
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,760
(You are my love.)

74
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,520
I would never

75
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,880
give you away to anyone.

76
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,200
All my life,

77
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,000
(my whole life...)

78
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,640
(I won't let you go.)

79
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,280
(You need the Thousand-Year Ice Toad,)

80
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,320
(the Snow Lotus,)

81
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,200
and the Tail of the Fire Phoenix.

82
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,360
How can you find

83
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,160
all these treasures?

84
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,520
(Huanhuan.)

85
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,559
(It's not easy to heal my legs.)

86
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,320
(I can't let the rest of your life
be stuck with a cripple.)

87
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,160
(Leave me.)

88
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,040
(The world is yours.)

89
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,520
(Live a free life you like.)

90
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,680
(I never regret meeting you.)

91
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,720
(I regret)

92
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,257
(that I can't spend the rest)

93
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,000
(of my life with you.)
