=Episode 10=

3
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,280
Your Highness,

4
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,080
how...?

5
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,480
How did you get injured?

6
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,640
Why do you have many enemies?

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,960
They think

8
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,600
I want to take the throne.

9
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,800
Do you?

10
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,120
Yes.

11
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,240
It's your little secret, right?

12
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,880
Forget it.

13
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,270
I won't ask more questions.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,920
Don't touch my lips.

15
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,760
I look ugly.

16
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,040
I don't think so.

17
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,680
You look cute.

18
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,160
My lips are swollen

19
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,499
because I tried to save your life.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,240
Repay my kindness.

21
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,320
Huanhuan,

22
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,440
I...

23
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,640
You're injured.

24
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,120
Sleep in bed tonight.

25
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,600
I'll sleep on the floor.

26
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
(Stop beating.)

27
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,680
(Don't do it anymore.)

28
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,200
(Or I'll be embarrassed.)

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,800
(Lin Huanhuan,)

30
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,640
(you'll leave him one day.)

31
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,200
(You can't do this.)

32
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,760
(You just can't.)

33
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,980
(Courier Station)

34
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,480
Sir.

35
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,000
No one went out, right?

36
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,240
No, Sir.

37
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,160
It's so quiet.

38
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,690
I'll go in and have a look.

39
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,100
(Courier Station)

40
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,760
Your Highness.

41
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,960
Qingshui County is not rich.

42
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,150
But I hope you like it here.

43
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,720
We are having a good time

44
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,160
except that we can't go out.

45
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,960
You can't leave here.

46
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,000
It's dangerous out there.

47
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,080
The outbreak is everywhere.

48
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,920
Mr. Xu,

49
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,040
how do you stay healthy

50
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,120
when walking around?

51
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,560
I...

52
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,120
I take measures.

53
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,680
I wear my mask when going out.

54
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,160
I can wear the mask, too.

55
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,000
No way.

56
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:42,760
You can't.

57
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,360
You are a royal member.

58
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,360
-So...
-Enough!

59
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,400
You're talking nonsense!

60
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,320
You don't dare to let us
see the truth!

61
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,080
Why did you say that?

62
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,200
There aren't

63
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,840
epidemic outbreaks
in Qingshui County!

64
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,360
Xu Qingfeng,

65
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,280
you've got some nerve!

66
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,360
You lied to the royal court

67
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,560
and defied the government.

68
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,560
Guards!

69
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,000
Arrest both of them!

70
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,800
One...

71
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,160
I planned to count to three.

72
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,000
The dose was too high.

73
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,960
My legs...

74
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,040
It's Bone Weakening Powder I made.

75
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,840
After being drugged,

76
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,600
you can't get up in seven days.

77
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,480
You witch!

78
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,040
Only you know how to use poisons?

79
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,240
I began to study

80
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,680
poisons when I was three years old.

81
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,520
You're only a magistrate
of one county.

82
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,560
You don't dare to poison
all your people.

83
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,120
Tell us

84
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,880
who were behind you,

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,040
and what they wanted.

86
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,100
Your Highness, forgive me.

87
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,440
I was forced into it.

88
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,200
It was...

89
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,360
Your Highness,

90
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,660
there was poison on the dart.

91
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,600
Your Highness!

92
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,600
A letter.

93
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,340
Your Highness,

94
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,520
you have mail pigeons here?

95
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,200
I see.

96
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,360
What is it?

97
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,280
They are running a drugstore here,

98
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,720
and selling drugs at a high price.

99
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,040
I guess it's the antidote.

100
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,560
Poisoning others
and selling the antidote?

101
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,840
How shrewd they are!

102
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,719
Let's arrest them now!

103
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,280
It won't work.

104
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,960
All of them are gone.

105
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,400
And the key figures were killed.

106
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,720
They are so ruthless.

107
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,720
What should we do now?

108
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,920
You and Shiqi go help
the poisoned people.

109
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,400
I'll write a memorial to the throne.

110
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,360
Wait. I can't...

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,440
I...

112
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,120
You're useless!

113
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,440
Why do I keep you here?

114
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,240
You couldn't either kill them

115
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,040
or poison them?

116
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,640
If Shangguan Li comes back,

117
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,720
you should die with him!

118
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,240
Get lost!

119
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,000
Got it.

120
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,100
Your Royal Highness.

121
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,200
(Courier Station)

122
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,200
Hello!

123
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,520
-Anyone here?
-Coming!

124
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,360
Who are you?

125
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,600
How may I address you?

126
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,040
I'm Chen Yiqing.

127
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,520
I'm Shiqi.

128
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,560
Chen Yiqing is here

129
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,320
to pay respects to Your Highness.

130
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,120
As you were.

131
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,150
Sit down.

132
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,720
Thank you.

133
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,670
I don't know much
about Qingshui County.

134
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,880
Since you are sent by the royal court,

135
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,880
the local government
will connect with you.

136
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,720
You don't need to stay with me.

137
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,120
Got it,

138
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,800
Your Highness.

139
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,840
But the people in Qingshui County

140
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,120
suffered too much.

141
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,600
Please treat them nicely.

142
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,800
I'll live up to the responsibilities.

143
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,080
I promise

144
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,680
I'll do a good job
for the rest of my life.

145
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,400
Mr. Chen, you've got something else?

146
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,440
I've been studying medicine
since I was small.

147
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,640
I admire Her Highness very much

148
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,520
after knowing
she made the antidote on her own

149
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,040
for all the poisoned people.

150
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,880
I really want to learn from her.
