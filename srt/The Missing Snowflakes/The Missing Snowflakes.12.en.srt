00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,200
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:26,680
Your Highness,

4
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:29,680
wait for me.

5
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,480
I thought we wouldn't come.

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,120
Wait a second, please!

7
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,760
Your Highness,

8
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:52,880
have some water.

9
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,160
Your Highness?

10
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:58,840
Thank you.

11
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,240
Your Highness,

12
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,160
why are you so interested

13
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,190
in the golden lotus banana

14
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,800
that you'll look for it in person?

15
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,360
(That's my little secret.)

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,880
I'm running a clinic
in the capital city.

17
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,750
When women
have gynecological problems,

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,720
they're unwilling to see a physician.

19
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,160
But the herb can cure them easily.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,200
You're my role model.

21
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,840
A royal member looks for
medical herbs for common people.

22
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:26,519
How great...

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,840
My women patients are all loaded.

24
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,600
If I can cure them,

25
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,760
I'll make a big fortune.

26
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,840
Making money in this way

27
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,520
is a good thing.

28
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,800
You're making a profit

29
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,640
in a noble way.

30
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,440
We should go now.

31
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,560
It's getting late.

32
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,000
Wild beasts
will walk around when it's dark.

33
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,080
OK.

34
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,400
Oops!

35
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,880
Your Highness,

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,720
they're over there.

37
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,520
I saw them.

38
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,120
I'm dizzy.

39
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,480
It's OK.

40
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,760
She may be tired.

41
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,320
What's wrong?

42
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,800
I got a head rush
from standing up too fast.

43
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,440
Your Highness.

44
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,920
What happened?

45
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,400
Your Highness!

46
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,840
Are you OK?

47
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:23,960
She's fine...

48
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,120
Your Highness!

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,560
Hurry up!

50
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,520
Your Highness!

51
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,520
Bummer.

52
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:44,999
Your Highness,

53
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,340
I have to do it.

54
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,680
Jerk!

55
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,480
What are you doing?

56
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,520
You're a jerk!

57
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,040
How could you
offend Her Highness?

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,600
Your Highness,

59
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,000
don't get me wrong.

60
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,220
Her Highness is intoxicated.

61
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,440
What?

62
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,520
I was trying to find the wound.

63
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,120
Get out.

64
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,680
Now!

65
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,520
Move.

66
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,480
Look what you did!

67
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,390
I don't see any wounds
in her limbs.

68
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,880
It should be in the body.

69
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,480
Your Highness,

70
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,000
it was highly toxic.

71
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,480
You need to find the wound now.

72
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,200
After the toxic goes to her heart,

73
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,200
she can't be cured.

74
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,280
(Huanhuan,)

75
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,920
(I don't mean to offend you.)

76
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,760
Your Highness,

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,760
did you find it?

78
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,720
I think I did.

79
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,890
What does it look like?

80
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,450
May I see it?

81
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:32,760
No!

82
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,400
Don't come in!

83
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,550
Your Highness,

84
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,920
your jealousy may harm her!

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,840
She might die!

86
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,680
You can't come in!

87
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,360
Four bleeding spots.

88
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,400
Seemed...

89
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,720
A snake bit her.

90
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,200
I think you're right.

91
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,160
Your Highness,

92
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,720
suck out the toxin, please.

93
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:52,920
What?

94
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,240
Wait...

95
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,240
It's...

96
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,680
I can't...

97
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,160
I can't!

98
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,080
Allow me, please.

99
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,800
No way!

100
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,640
I can do it.

101
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,560
Save your crap!

102
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:05,920
Your Highness,

103
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,200
hurry up, please.

104
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,680
I'll go get medical herbs.

105
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,440
You'll have to

106
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,200
clean the wound

107
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,480
in a little while.

108
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,720
Your Highness.

109
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,440
I'll go with him.

110
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,640
You really should thank me for this.

111
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,240
You woke up!

112
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,200
Huanhuan, are you OK?

113
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,800
You undressed me?

114
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,240
How dare you?

115
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,240
You were injured!

116
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,200
Nonsense!

117
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:00,899
Stop fooling me!

118
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,720
Save your crap!

119
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,840
You're a liar!

120
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,240
How could you do this to me?

121
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,240
What a jerk...!

122
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,080
A snake bit you, understood?

123
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,080
A snake!

124
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,520
I...

125
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,920
Why are you here?

126
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,360
Did you stalk me?

127
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,360
I...

128
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,470
I'm picking mushrooms!

129
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,080
Seriously?

130
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,800
Put your clothes on.

131
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,640
By the way,

132
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,320
you're a physician, right?

133
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,120
How could a snake hurt you?

134
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,520
I'm a human, OK?

135
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,960
I'm not omnipotent.

136
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,360
I could be intoxicated.

137
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,840
And I could get sick and die.

138
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,760
I agree with you.

139
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,400
Physicians can't treat themselves.

140
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,440
It happens all the time.

141
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,880
Your Highness,

142
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,200
remember to change dressings.

143
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,840
Save it, OK?

144
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,220
Enjoy it, please.

145
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,320
The couple needs some privacy.

146
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:28,880
Let's go.

147
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,199
I want to watch the stars with you.

148
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,600
Let's go.

149
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,520
No.

150
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,320
I don't want to.

151
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:34,760
Yes.

152
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,640
You do.

153
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,240
Lin Huanhuan,

154
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,320
I want to be with you.

155
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,200
What did you call me?

156
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,800
Lin Huanhuan?

157
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,000
Lin Huanhuan.

158
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:04,900
Anything wrong?

159
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,000
It's been a long time

160
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:09,400
since someone called my name
last time.

161
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,000
I thought
I had become Lin Shangshang.

162
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,760
You...

163
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,150
You're Huanhuan.

164
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,720
Lin Shangshang

165
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,700
was highly cultured
and steeped in propriety.

166
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,120
She was edified by
the traditional culture.

167
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,670
But you...

168
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:37,960
Get lost!

169
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,360
Don't!

170
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,150
Be careful!

171
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,760
-Don't!
-Get lost!

172
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,400
Hi, there.

173
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,640
I need some air.

174
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,520
I feel sleepy.

175
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,240
I feel cold.

176
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,120
The moon is beautiful.

177
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,200
On my back.

178
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,560
What are you doing?

179
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:36,880
I'll carry you.

180
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,240
No, thanks.

181
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,800
Let's go.

182
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,320
We'll go home.

183
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,000
I want to look for
the golden lotus banana!

184
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,040
You don't need to.

185
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,640
His Highness will buy you a lot.

186
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:55,970
Your Highness,

187
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,840
the way home is here!

188
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,730
Where are you going?

189
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,639
To look for the herb.

190
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,600
Seriously?

191
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,960
The golden lotus banana
can help many women.

192
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,760
Your wound has recovered?

193
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,640
My wound?

194
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,440
Yes.

195
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,240
It's not important.

196
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,800
