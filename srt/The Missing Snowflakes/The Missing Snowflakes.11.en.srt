=The Missing Snowflakes=

2
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,370
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,480
Now Qingshui County

4
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:25,900
has a young and handsome magistrate.

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,120
I beg to differ.

6
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,200
A pretty face may be common.

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,480
But an interesting soul like you

8
00:00:29,481 --> 00:00:30,880
who's good at medicine is a rare kind.

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,520
Thank you!

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,240
Your Highness, how could you tell

11
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,700
it was the nine-tailed poison
in no time?

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,160
I heard it could be very tricky.

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,480
You're an expert!

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,760
Tell you what:

15
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,160
the poison is hard to handle.

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,520
It's colorless, odorless,

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,520
and very rare.

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,880
Luckily, my master told me about it.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,760
That's why

20
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,640
I know how to make the antidote.

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,600
I see.

22
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,080
Listen...

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,600
The new magistrate is good-looking.

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,040
But he is too young.

25
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,280
Not mature enough.

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,400
I don't think so.

27
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,640
I've heard that

28
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,690
he's young and promising.

29
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,680
He even won
the "Number One Scholar" title.

30
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,680
How can he talk to my wife

31
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,720
for such a long time

32
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,040
and ignore me?

33
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,760
It's inappropriate!

34
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,720
I don't think so.

35
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,000
Listen to them.

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,440
They are talking about medicine.

37
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:21,800
Shiqi,

38
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,200
you can work for him if you want.

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,680
No. I won't do it.

40
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,960
I want to grow old with you.

41
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,360
I don't buy it.

42
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,440
Wait. Where are you going?

43
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,000
I...

44
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,120
Your Highness.

45
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:48,920
Your Highness.

46
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:52,960
Shangshang,

47
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,440
it's getting cold.

48
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,400
Keep yourself warm.

49
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,400
Thank you.

50
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,200
What was I talking about?

51
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,560
The golden lotus banana.

52
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,400
Have a seat.

53
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,190
Please.

54
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,360
The golden lotus banana.

55
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,680
You mean we can find it

56
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,760
in Qingshui County?

57
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,440
Yes.

58
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,880
Before I took office,

59
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,800
I had read everything
about the county.

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,080
(I've found it finally)

61
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,520
(after taking so much effort.)

62
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,880
(Thank heaven!)

63
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,240
Great!

64
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,680
You'll achieve great things!

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,000
Your Highness,

66
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,200
can you understand

67
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,480
what we are talking about?

68
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,999
I'm willing to learn from you.

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,830
Let's go look for
the golden lotus banana tomorrow,

70
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,280
OK?

71
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,440
I agree.

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,560
However, according to records,

73
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,200
it only grows in deep mountains.

74
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,600
We have to set out very early

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,520
so that we can get back
before it's dark.

76
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,280
OK.

77
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,840
I'll go with you.

78
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,720
You don't need to.

79
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,200
I just

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,200
want to see the herb.

81
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,480
Can I join you?

82
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,000
Are you sure?

83
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,080
Yes, I am.

84
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,560
Your Highness,

85
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,040
have a nice day.

86
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,240
Thank you for enlightening me.

87
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,600
Stay.

88
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,199
Let's chat more.

89
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,760
Goodbye.

90
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,960
Stay a little longer.

91
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,240
We can chat more!

92
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,320
Stay!

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,520
Your Highness,

94
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,920
were you jealous?

95
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,560
No.

96
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,080
I think you were!

97
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,400
You are right.

98
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,400
I want to be with you.

99
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,920
Aren't you

100
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,200
being with me

101
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,600
all the time?

102
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,830
I don't want to work with you,

103
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,800
or keep distance from you.

104
00:04:22,801 --> 00:04:24,199
I don't want you
to chat with other guys.

105
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,320
Because I will be jealous!

106
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,000
I...

107
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,360
It happened too fast.

108
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,920
I wasn't ready at all.

109
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,600
I planned

110
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,920
to look for the golden lotus banana.

111
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,760
When I find it,

112
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,040
I can make the Faked-death Drug.

113
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,800
When I get the drug,

114
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,280
I'll leave him.

115
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,600
But...

116
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,600
Shangguan Li...

117
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,000
Don't worry.

118
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,440
They're after me.

119
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,600
If anything happens,

120
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,200
I will protect you.

121
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,520
Don't touch my lips.

122
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,120
I look ugly.

123
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,600
I don't think so.

124
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,960
You look cute.

125
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,100
We can work together.

126
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,960
I'm your nominal wife now.

127
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,920
So, you can think I'm Lin Shangshang.

128
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,280
I don't want to work with you,

129
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:38,240
or keep distance from you.

130
00:06:38,241 --> 00:06:39,630
I don't want you
to chat with other guys.

131
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,880
Because I will be jealous!

132
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,440
(In fact,)

133
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,160
(if we can always be like this,)

134
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,280
(it will be nice.)

135
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,080
No, I can't.

136
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,880
Was I moving

137
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,520
too fast

138
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,680
and being too direct?

139
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,480
I might scare her.

140
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,960
Maybe she's not in love with me?

141
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,240
Leave.

142
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,880
Don't leave.

143
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,560
Leave.

144
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,120
Don't leave.

145
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,600
Leave.

146
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:09,920
Don't leave.

147
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,720
Leave?

148
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,560
Or should I stay?

149
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:27,780
(Courier Station)

150
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,400
Your Highness.

151
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,320
Are you alone?

152
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,720
Let's go.

153
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,880
We should set out now.

154
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,200
Where is His Highness?

155
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:36,880
We...

156
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,750
Don't wait for him.

157
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,600
He's still sleeping.

158
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,640
Hurry up.

159
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,600
We won't wait for him?

160
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,600
No, we won't.

161
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,000
Where is my wife?

162
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,280
Her Highness

163
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,400
just left.

164
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,800
She went to look for the drug

165
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,040
with her new friend.

166
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,440
She doesn't love me,

167
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,640
or does she just hate me?

168
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,590
Your Highness.

169
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:40,720
Enjoy.

170
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,799
Why are they all green vegetables?

171
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,400
Why?

172
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,500
They suit
your relationship status now.
