00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,080
Fried bread sticks!

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,040
What are you up to

5
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,720
in the early morning?

6
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,200
You're our boss now.

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,880
We want to follow you.

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,800
You can't do it.

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,840
I'm your hostage, remember?

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,840
It's all the money we have.

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,880
My brother and I think
you can achieve great things.

12
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,470
We want to team up with you.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,680
No need.

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,720
We can work for you.

15
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,320
Exactly!

16
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,920
I can't do evil things with you.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,840
We can invest

18
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,120
in a business.

19
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,680
How much money do you have?

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,760
We've got a little.

21
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,160
It's not a little!

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,480
My brother and I
almost save everything.

23
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,520
I can work with you.

24
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,280
OK.

25
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,600
But I'm not doing it for money.

26
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,800
Your sincerity and determination

27
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,920
touch me a lot.

28
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,040
So, let's make a fortune!

29
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,320
Great!

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Great!

(Good Deeds Clinic)

32
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,160
Great!

In the future,

36
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,560
I'll be your rock.

37
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,480
Awesome!

38
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,400
Great!

39
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,600
(With the clinic,)

40
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,560
(I can get all the medical herbs
to make the Faked-death Drug.)

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,600
(Good!)

42
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,920
Are you done?

43
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,320
Shangguan Li?

44
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,040
Prince Peace!

45
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,400
He's so handsome!

46
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,320
But he's married now.

47
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,440
I'm willing to be his concubine!

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,030
You showed up finally!

49
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,480
I've been kidnapped since days ago!

50
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,720
You're kidnapped?

51
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,040
Where are the kidnappers?

52
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,920
I will revenge for you.

53
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,720
I don't need you to.

54
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,440
Is our effort in vain?

55
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,720
(Riding the horse made me sick.)

56
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,840
Your Highness, welcome home!

57
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,999
We'll have a family dinner tonight.

58
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,000
Go get dressed.

59
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,880
Your Highness,

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,120
welcome home!

61
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,520
I went missing for many days
but he didn't look for me.

62
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,560
He showed up
when I opened a clinic today.

63
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,880
You went missing?

64
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,080
His Highness said
you visited your parents.

65
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,280
I was wondering

66
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,920
why you didn't take me.

67
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,200
What?

68
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,240
By the way,

69
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:21,870
His Highness said

70
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,000
you should wear
something beautiful for tonight.

71
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,040
Or he'd be embarrassed.

72
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,920
Fine.

73
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,080
Shangguan Li,

74
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,880
you should wait and see.

75
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,040
Princess Peace is here!

76
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,920
Hi, everyone!

77
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm sorry

78
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,120
for being late.

79
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,200
I gave you a heads-up.

80
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,160
All of them

81
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,400
are here to meet you.

82
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,800
The hearsay is not true.

83
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,240
Your Highness, you're a poor guy.

84
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,680
How may I address you, Miss?

85
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm General Zhao's daughter,

86
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,000
Zhao Xiangxiang.

87
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,840
Miss Zhao, nice to meet you.

88
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,000
Why did you say he's a poor guy?

89
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,640
We're being happy

90
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,240
every single day.

91
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,120
Am I right,

92
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,040
Li?

93
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,280
Li,

94
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,160
I said something inappropriate.

95
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,720
I'll toast to Mrs Shangguan.

96
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,920
Don't say anything
you're not sure about.

97
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,120
Since you're close to him,

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,640
I think

99
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,480
you should address me
"Your Highness".

100
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,360
However,

101
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,880
I know you grew up in the military.

102
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,100
It's OK if you don't
know about the etiquette.

103
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,400
Your Highness,

104
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,840
your father is very knowledgeable.

105
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,600
We respect him very much.

106
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,360
But you shouldn't be
aggressive like this.

107
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,440
(He wants to defend her.)

108
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,600
It's OK.

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,120
We all know Princess Peace
is capable of many things.

110
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,800
Could you show something to us?

111
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,280
Your Highness,

112
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,240
they're ostracizing me!

113
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,000
I know they are.

114
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,080
Could you stand up for me?

115
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,400
They're embarrassing you.

116
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,880
But I'm always tolerant.

117
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,200
I know I'm talented and capable.

118
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,040
But I don't think

119
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,480
I should ever show off.

120
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,960
It'll end badly.

121
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,080
Am I right?

122
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,760
The Crown Prince is here!

123
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,360
Well said!

124
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,080
Good evening, Your Royal Highness.

125
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,520
Shangshang, as you were.

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,999
Everyone, sit down, please.

127
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,680
(Lin Shangshang,)

128
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,640
(I'm sorry.)

129
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,280
(I let your loved one
see you like this.)

130
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,040
Shangshang, you look unique tonight.

131
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,720
You're like

132
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,640
a traditional image
in the New Year's pictures.

133
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,240
I couldn't agree more.

134
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,320
Come on.

135
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,160
Let's drink.

136
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,680
Cheers.

137
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,880
Shangshang.

138
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,550
Now it's clean.

139
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,360
After you.

140
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,320
See you next time.

141
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,360
Goodbye, Your Highness.

142
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,280
Your Royal Highness.

143
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,160
Lin Shangshang has married me.

144
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,200
Please remember it.

145
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,000
But she doesn't love you.

146
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,120
I don't care.

147
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,960
Shangguan Li!

148
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,920
Your mother arranged the marriage.

149
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,320
You should face the music,

150
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,080
and plan for the future
when you become the emperor.

151
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,600
(He kissed me?)

152
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,200
(How dare he?)

153
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,800
(I didn't want anything like that.)

154
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,920
(Is he in love with me?)

155
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,920
(Shangshang was forced to get married.)

156
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,480
Your Royal Highness,

157
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,960
what a shame!

158
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,600
We saw you and her

159
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,670
growing up together.

160
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,840
How could she...?

161
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,880
What are you saying?

162
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,400
Your Royal Highness,

163
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,670
I know you're into Princess Peace.

164
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,000
And I can help you.
