=Episode 6=

3
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,360
Your Majesty.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,840
Spill it.

5
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,400
Your Majesty,

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,240
Prince Peace's secret guards

7
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,320
killed all the people we sent.

8
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,080
It seems

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,000
Shangguan Li

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,680
values Lin Shangshang very much.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,200
It's a good thing for us.

12
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,600
(Mansion of Prince Peace)

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,150
(Mansion of Prince Peace)
Yuetao, hurry up!

14
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,560
Coming!

15
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,120
(What is he doing here?)

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,000
Your Royal Highness.

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,000
Shangshang.

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,160
Are you looking for my husband
at such an early hour?

19
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,320
He's in the room.

20
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,040
I'll go to my clinic.

21
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,200
Shangshang.

22
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,560
Don't avoid me.

23
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm here to see you today.

24
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,160
Why?

25
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,160
Shangshang,

26
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,520
please look out for yourself.

27
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,600
What's it for?

28
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,520
Well...

29
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,320
Just be more careful.

30
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,680
I will protect her.

31
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,280
Your Royal Highness, you're free now?

32
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,360
You should work on government affairs.

33
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,640
Why are you here talking to my wife?

34
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,440
I'm just giving her a heads-up.

35
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,920
Thank you very much.

36
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,490
I appreciate Her Majesty
for arranging the marriage.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,720
I believe

38
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,400
I can protect my wife.

39
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,760
Lord Li is here!

40
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,840
(Why are so many people)

41
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,320
(coming here at an early hour?)

42
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,880
Morning, Your Royal Highness.

43
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,800
Morning, Your Highness.

44
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,800
Lord Li, what brings you here?

45
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,720
Her Majesty sent me here.

46
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,400
She wants to meet

47
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,400
with your wife alone.

48
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,040
Me?

49
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,760
Why does Her Majesty want to see me?

50
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,960
Lin Shangshang,

51
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,640
you were a person of few words.

52
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,200
I didn't know
you were connected to everyone.

53
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,600
Tell me.

54
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,680
Are you nervous to see me?

55
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,000
Your Majesty,
I'm stunned by your beauty.

56
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,760
You are such a sweet talker!

57
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,120
The weather is good today.

58
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,720
I want to hear you play some music.

59
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,000
(What should I do?)

60
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,080
(I can't play the instrument!)

61
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,680
(I've never learned it.)

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,800
You can start.

63
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,999
Your Majesty, I'm sorry.

64
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,560
I was too nervous.

65
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,640
So, I broke a string.

66
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,760
I need privacy with her.

67
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,160
Got it.

68
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,800
Lin Shangshang,

69
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,560
you're the Grand Tutor's daughter.

70
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,080
You should be good at it.

71
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,880
How could you

72
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,000
break the string of Phoenix Zither
left by the empress dowager?

73
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,680
How careless you were!

74
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,080
I was very nervous just now.

75
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,360
Enough!

76
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,000
Nonsense!

77
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,240
I gave Lin Shangshang a red ginseng.

78
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,440
But she thought it was a ginseng.

79
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,600
Now she's running a clinic
in the capital city.

80
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,760
I begin to doubt it more and more.

81
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,560
(I'm screwed.)

82
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,840
(What should I do?)

83
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,520
(She may know who I am!)

84
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,320
However,

85
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,360
you look

86
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,800
the same

87
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,280
with Lin Shangshang.

88
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,040
If I am right,

89
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,840
you're her twin sister.

90
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,600
In our dynasty,

91
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,680
twins may destroy the nation's future.

92
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,960
The Lins defied the royal.

93
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,840
Nonetheless,

94
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,960
Lin Shangshang is dead.

95
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,280
I'll keep the secret for you.

96
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,080
Your Majesty,

97
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,520
tell me what you want from me.

98
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,640
I'm kind of slow-witted.

99
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,120
No, you're not.

100
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,960
I like you a lot.

101
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,040
Put the doll

102
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,920
in your husband's room secretly.

103
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,520
That's it?

104
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,680
That's it.

105
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,800
But why?

106
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,320
Don't ask

107
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,640
any questions.

108
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,840
The doll will keep you alive.

109
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,200
One more thing.

110
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,200
Stay away from the Crown Prince,

111
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,760
will you?

112
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,880
No problem.

113
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,380
(the Crown prince's Birth Time)

114
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,040
I'm not stupid.

115
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,560
It's the art of witchcraft
to curse someone.

116
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,960
She wants to frame Shangguan Li.

117
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,000
If anyone finds it in this residence,

118
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,480
I won't get away.

119
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,320
I need to put it here.

120
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,160
But I'll figure out a way
to deceive them.

121
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,560
I've never seen

122
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,680
the note ever.
