00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,380
=Episode 1=

3
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:34,760
Miss!

4
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,760
Shangshang!

5
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,960
Shangshang!

6
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,920
Shangshang!

7
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,080
My sweetheart!

8
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,840
Shangshang!

9
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,820
(Only Good Virtue Matters)

10
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,060
(Lin Residence)

11
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,160
(Huanhuan,)

12
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,040
(only you can save the Lins now.)

13
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,899
(Why did my elder sister hang herself?)

14
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,450
(The empress arranged her marriage.)

15
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,700
(In Memory of My Daughter Lin Shangshang)
But she didn't agree.

16
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,520
She loved someone else.

17
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,440
So, she chose to die for love.

18
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,040
It was all your fault.

19
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,440
Huanhuan,

20
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,880
we didn't have any choice.

21
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,480
What do you want now?

22
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,000
I should replace her?

23
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,680
(The empress arranged the marriage.)

24
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,880
(But the bride killed herself.)

25
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,240
(Defying the royal is a felony.)

26
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,600
The new couple is here!

27
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,240
Tie the knot with an embroidered ball.

28
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,840
To love and to cherish.

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,200
Till death do you part.

30
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,640
Kneel down!

31
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,000
You pledge to honor each other

32
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,960
and will build a life together!

33
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,160
(Huanhuan,)

34
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,160
(the Lins owe you a lot.)

35
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,680
(But there are more than)

36
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,200
(thirty people in our family.)

37
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,160
Miss. Miss.

38
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,640
Please don't go.

39
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,800
Miss...

40
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,360
Kowtow for the first time!

41
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,700
(Mansion of Prince Peace)

42
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,480
(Where is my husband?)

43
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,920
(I haven't met him on our wedding night.)

44
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,600
(But it's a good thing.)

45
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,000
(I'll have time to figure out something.)

46
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,920
(I don't want to sleep with him.)

47
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,120
(Where should I put the poison?)

48
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,600
Your Highness!

49
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,440
Your Highness,

50
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,240
Lin Shangshang killed herself at home.

51
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,120
It seems

52
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,920
I've married a fake bride.

53
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,480
(If I poisoned the liquor,)

54
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,120
(I would be poisoned by myself.)

55
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,240
(He'll kiss me later.)

56
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,080
(I can put my Bone Weakening Power)

57
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,160
(on my lips.)

58
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,280
(Then he'll be intoxicated.)

59
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,900
(She looks the same as Lin Shangshang.)

60
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,120
(Is she wearing an expensive
human skin mask?)

61
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,120
(I will see)

62
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,160
(how much longer you can pretend.)

63
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,040
(He looks like a cold fish.)

64
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,960
(The mask fits her so perfectly?)

65
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,280
(Wait...)

66
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
(It's my first time.)

67
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,120
(I don't know what to do.)

68
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,160
(It'll be OK.)

69
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,840
(I'll kiss him.)

70
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,560
(Taste the Bone Weakening Powder I made.)

71
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,800
(It's her real face?)

72
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,360
What are you doing?

73
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,080
It hurts!

74
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,280
Who on earth are you?

75
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,760
I'm Lin Huanhuan.

76
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,160
You were twins?

77
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,960
The government never
allows twins to be born.

78
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,000
And you just admitted it?

79
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,840
I may report you...

80
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,600
Stop it.

81
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,840
You're bluffing.

82
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,320
I know

83
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,480
that you have to get married.

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,520
Otherwise,

85
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,840
you wouldn't want
to marry a dead person.

86
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,920
It doesn't seem right.

87
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,000
I bought the most famous

88
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,120
Love Liquor in the capital city.

89
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,760
They only need to take a sip and...

90
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,280
Are you blaming me
for forcing your love

91
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,320
to marry Shangguan Li?

92
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,360
No, I'm not.

93
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,440
The Lins is not powerful enough.

94
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,480
You deserve much better.

95
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,840
And I'll rest assured
if their daughter

96
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,400
becomes Princess Peace.

97
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,680
I'm planning for your future.

98
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,000
Do you get it?

99
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,440
Yes, I do.

100
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,600
I'll follow your orders.

101
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,999
(Mansion of Prince Peace)

102
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,999
Your Highness,

103
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,800
it's pigeon soup.

104
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,080
It's tonic for you.

105
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,720
Do I look weak to you?

106
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,240
It's not what I meant.

107
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,080
Your Highness,

108
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,880
it's for you.

109
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,360
Why?

110
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,850
I don't need anything like that.

111
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,599
Stewed blood clams with papaya.

112
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,800
It'll make you more beautiful.

113
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,280
Shiqi,

114
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,120
clean the West Garden.

115
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,480
And help my wife to move in.

116
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,640
Besides,

117
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,960
change everything in my room.

118
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,240
What?

119
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,800
You'll separate
after the wedding night?

120
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,160
Thank you.

121
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,040
You know me well.

122
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,480
You want to avoid me?

123
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,160
One day, you'll want to be with me.

124
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,200
The West Garden's rooms are nice!

125
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,600
The rooms are big.

126
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,240
I need to get all the medical herbs.

127
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,720
With my master's formula,

128
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,360
I'll succeed in making
the Faked-death Drug.

129
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,080
By then,

130
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,480
I can run away from the place.

131
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,920
Did the mail pigeon come back?

132
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,200
Yes.

133
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,080
I saw it flying back.

134
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,800
But when I looked for it,

135
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,960
I couldn't find where it was.
