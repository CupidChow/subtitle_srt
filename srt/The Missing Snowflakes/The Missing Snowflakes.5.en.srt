How weird!

Everyone is healthy enough,

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,680
and no one gets sick?

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,160
You're talking like a fool.

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,600
If someone comes here,

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,200
can you feel the pulse?

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,400
Can I write a prescription?

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,680
You're right.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,720
Can we

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,840
turn the clinic into a casino?

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,840
We'll win our money back.

15
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,360
We got here!

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,200
Look! She's back!

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,360
You agree with me, right?

18

Her Highness is back!

She's back?

20
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,360
What's wrong with you?

21
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,760
Be my patient, will you?

22
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,360
I'm not sick.

23

Now he's nice to you!

No patient at all, right?

30
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,920
It's true.

31
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,400
We should turn it into a casino

32
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,720
and make money.

33
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,360

People will laugh at me
if no patient comes!

00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,320
Maybe the place doesn't
create good Feng Shui.

He's right.

-I'm not interested.
-Sir, wait a second!

Sir, you want pancakes?

Hello.

48

The pancakes smell good.

49
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,280
I'll get two.

Welcome to my clinic!

grows in the south.

The leaves grow after blooming.

54

on the ground.

It's great!

57
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,200
It can make the Faked-death Drug,

58
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,200
and cure gynecological diseases.

59
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,680

I'm not surprised.

63
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:42,920
Look.

64
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,440
The location sucks.

65

Your Highness,

66

she's your wife.

She's Princess Peace!

68
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,720
It's embarrassing you!

69
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,640

70
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,160
What do you want?

71
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,440
To see the physician!

72
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,120

74

But you're suffering
from muscular strain.

75

Thank you, Miss!

79
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,920
People in the capital city are great.

80

They're well-trained!

81
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:41,720
OK.

No one would kidnap me.

88

we're stalked.

99
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,040
Be quiet.

100
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,720
Follow me.

What?

00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,120
Yes, Your Highness.

106
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,320
His Highness doesn't want you
to go out alone.

107
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,080
He sends us to protect you.

108
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,040
But why were you so sneaky?

109
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,760
His Highness

110
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,120
tells us to do it secretly.

111
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,360
Get lost!

112
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,440
Got it.

113
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,920
I was so scared! I really was!

114
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,600
Your Highness!

115
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,560
She is...

116
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,080
She's home!

117
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,560
I got it.

118
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,800
I'll start eating.

119
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,760
How was your business?

120
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,960
Are you insane?

121
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,480
Did she know

122
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,960
I sent my secret guards there?

123
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,680
I was just

124
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,040
protecting our reputation.

125
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,880
How did the reputation get involved?

126
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,920
Do you know you scared me to death?

127
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,560
What?

128
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,950
What was so scary?

129
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,120
I have no idea.

130
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,880
It was scary!

131
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,360
We're just working together.

132
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,040
Please stay out of my business,

133
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,120
and mind your own!

134
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,760
Your Highness,

135
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,720
is she important to you?

136
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,400
Eat the meal.

137
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,320
Get lost!

138
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,720
Was I

139
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,760
being too harsh on him?

140
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,440
I shouldn't have said it.

141
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,480
Never mind.

142
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,840
I'll leave him soon.

143
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,920
What's in it?

144
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,800
You don't know?

145
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,400
His Highness ordered dishes for you.

146
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,240
Got it?

147
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,840
Watch your attitude.

148
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,320
You're ungrateful.

149
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,200
What did you say?

150
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,400
Get it straight!

151
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,600
Don't push your luck.

152
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,560
Fine!

153
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,640
I'll tell you everything!

154
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,680
His Highness worried

155
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,280
your clinic didn't have any patients.

156
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,120
So, he sent his secret guards

157
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,120
to get treatments there.

158
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,880
You know what?

159
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,960
I didn't want to hurt your pride.

160
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,400
So, I told everyone
to wear casual clothes.

161
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,240
Don't interrupt me!

162
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,900
One more thing.

163
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,360
She came home late.

164
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,400
His Highness

165
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,320
didn't start eating
until she was back!

166
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,320
You knew nothing!

167
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,000
I haven't eaten anything!

168
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,360
But I won't complain!

169
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,720
Your Highness,

170
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,280
please enjoy the meal.

171
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,080
(I got everything wrong.)

172
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,320
Did you take care of it?

173
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,320
We killed all the five.

174
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:24,880
Let's go.

175
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,050
Do you know who they were?

176
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,400
They weren't civilians.

177
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,000
They had poisons in their teeth.

178
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,990
They killed themselves
after being caught.

179
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,230
They were Men of Sacrifice.

180
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,280
Her Highness
offended some big potatoes?

181
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,920
In fact, they were after me.

182
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,880
One more thing...

183
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,480
You should go.

184
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,520
Got it.

185
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:04,920
Your Highness.

186
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,920
You're healthy.

187
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,040
Go get some rest.

188
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:11,840
I will.

189
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,240
Are you mad at me?

190
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,400
I am not.

191
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,200
I think you are.

192
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:34,799
It's not worth it.

193
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,440
Don't go!

194
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,840
Please remember who you are.

195
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,320
OK.

196
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
I will.

197
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,400
Your Highness,

198
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,440
it was my fault.

199
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,920
It was not.

200
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,520
You're always right.

201
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,840
It's never your fault.

202
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,480
I'm really sorry.

203
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,080
I shouldn't have lost my temper
to you when I got back.

204
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,240
Well...

205
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,040
Your secret guards scared me to death.

206
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:06,800
However,

207
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,880
I know you were protecting me.

208
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,600
(My secret guards scared her.)

209
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,800
You sent your people
to be my patients.

210
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,400
You waited for me to have dinner.

211
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,790
-And you ordered dishes...
-I didn't.

212
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,360
Well, OK.

213
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,440
You didn't do it.

214
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,400
In a word,

215
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,520
I should've cherished your kindness.

216
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,560
I did nothing for you.

217
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,300
It was just for...

218
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,160
It's OK. Don't worry.

219
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,720
I know what you mean.

220
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,080
Your Highness,

221
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm really sorry.

222
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,240
It won't happen again.

223
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,360
What's this?

224
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,880
I thought hard about it.

225
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,480
You don't need money.

226
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,000
So, I'll give you my lucky charm.

227
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,080
Your secret guards protect me.

228
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,360
And my lucky charm protects you.

229
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,120
I don't need it.

230
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,120
It works well!

231
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,800
Take it.

232
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,560
I don't believe it.

233
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,359
You're not mad, right?

234
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,400
The moon is beautiful!
