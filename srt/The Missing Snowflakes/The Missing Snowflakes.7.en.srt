=Episode 7=

3
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,220
(Mansion of Prince Peace)

4
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,320
Shangshang,

5
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,280
do you have anything to tell me?

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,840
Nope.

7
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,920
Why did the empress

8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,080
meet you?

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,400
We had a small talk

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,250
and I had to cozy up to her.

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,080
I said she was beautiful.

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,040
She got very happy.

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,640
Really?

14
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:55,800
Yes.

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:56,840
Your Highness!

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:00,850
Your Highness!

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,920
Many soldiers came here.

18
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,450
What's going on?

19
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,200
How dare you

20
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,520
break into my mansion?

21
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,840
Your Highness, sorry.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,240
His Majesty ordered us

23
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:22,460
to search Mansion of Prince Peace.

24
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,000
Go ahead.

25
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,240
Start!

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:27,960
Got it.

27
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:38,800
Don't worry.

28
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,200
They're after me.

29
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,440
If anything happens,

30
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,160
I will protect you.

31
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,680
Sir, look at this.

32
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,440
Your Highness,

33
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,920
go to the imperial palace with us.

34
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,800
I'll go with you.

35
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,160
My wife is feeble.

36
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,560
She can't endure the coldness.

37
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,560
Your Highness,

38
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,190
it's not my decision to make.

39
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,800
(He is a responsible person.)

40
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,360
(He wants to protect me.)

41
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,000
Both of you let me down.

42
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:34,840
Here.

43
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,360
Explain it to me.

44
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,680
What the heck is this?

45
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,480
I didn't do it.

46
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,800
Then who did it?

47
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,480
Your Majesty.

48
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,440
Shoot.

49
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,560
I made the doll.

50
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,480
It'll get you in trouble!

51
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,520
Your Majesty,

52
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,840
it was a gift for my husband.

53
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,450
Not the art of witchcraft
to curse someone.

54
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,800
You two are interesting!

55
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,800
Is it really a gift?

56
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,800
We can take the doll apart

57
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,640
and check it up.

58
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,200
(How could it happen?)

59
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,920
(I tore the note up, didn't I?)

60
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:39,960
Your Majesty,

61
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,720
have a look.

62
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,780
(the Crown Prince's Birth Time)

63
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,040
Darling...

64
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,840
It's Yu's birth time on the note.

65
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,120
Can you explain it?

66
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,960
It's not possible!

67
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,960
I really tore the note up!

68
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,640
Someone switched the doll!

69
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,240
I treat both of you nicely.

70
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,120
And I arranged the marriage for you.

71
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,480
What you did has hurt me a lot!

72
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,640
-It's not...
-Shangshang!

73
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,480
It was my fault.

74
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,520
Father,

75
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,200
please give me a second chance.

76
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,480
It's good for you to admit it.

77
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,720
Darling,

78
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,280
how should we deal with them?

79
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,120
Darling,

80
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,280
some officials reported yesterday

81
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,520
that Qingshui County
had an epidemic situation.

82
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,040
I'm thinking

83
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,160
they can go there
to control the outbreak,

84
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,680
and the people will be saved.

85
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,280
They can fix the fault then,

86
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,600
right?

87
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,680
But they may get sick

88
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,080
and die in the epidemic.

89
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,480
According to our law,

90
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,550
-it's illegal to...
-Enough.

91
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,480
Stop talking now.

92
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,920
I'm willing to make up for my fault.

93
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,560
But Shangshang
has nothing to do with it.

94
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,720
I should go there alone.

95
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:02,960
(No way.)

96
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,440
(I made a mistake.)

97
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,960
(I should be responsible.)

98
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,440
Your Majesty.

99
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,080
I'll go to Qingshui County
with my husband.

100
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,080
I practice medicine.

101
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,560
So, I can help my husband.

102
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,960
You do love each other deeply.

103
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,360
Good.

104
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,600
You can go together.

105
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,040
Stay safe and healthy.

106
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,320
Mother!

107
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:47,880
Mother.

108
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,200
Why did you send Shangshang
to Qingshui County?

109
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,600
She truly loves her husband.

110
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,400
So, she decided to go with him.

111
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,200
There is an epidemic outbreak.

112
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,720
She may die there!

113
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,320
Enough!

114
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,120
How can you be

115
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,800
so cowardly and spineless?

116
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,600
I'm planning for your future.

117
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,680
But you only want
a relationship with her!

118
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,080
Your Highness.

119
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,920
Don't you have questions for me?

120
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,160
No.

121
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,400
Actually,

122
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,440
I put the doll at home.

123
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,240
The empress forced me to.

124
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,119
She threatened me

125
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,800
after knowing I had a twin sister.

126
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,800
But I took the note out

127
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,400
and tore it up already.

128
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,160
Yuetao put another note in.

129
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,480
The empress bribed her.

130
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,520
What?

131
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,520
How did you know?

132
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,480
My secret guards know everything.

133
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,520
They'll let me know

134
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,280
who goes into my room.

135
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,640
Why didn't you tell the emperor?

136
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,360
They can always falsely accuse me.

137
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,680
Moreover,

138
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,080
it's a good thing

139
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,840
to leave the capital city

140
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,720
and stay out of trouble.

141
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,800
So, you wanted to walk away?

142
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,160
Why did you wait for so long?

143
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,080
Do you know how scared I was?

144
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,400
My father and his empress
are incredulous.

145
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,300
If I leave the capital city
for no reason,

146
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,680
they will worry about everything.

147
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,240
I don't care about them.

148
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,760
But I get more worried now.

149
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,840
I lived a good life in the mountains.

150
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,480
When I got here,

151
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,400
my sister died,

152
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,080
and I got married.

153
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:33,680
I was kidnapped,

154
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,650
and framed by the empress.

155
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
What did I do wrong?

156
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,600
I really feel aggrieved!

157
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,080
Huanhuan,

158
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,880
thank you

159
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,400
for taking the note out.

160
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,400
It's OK.

161
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,200
Don't thank me.

162
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,440
We're just working together.

163
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
But please let me know

164
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,680
what happens in advance.

165
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,480
Otherwise, I would be doomed.

166
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,320
She got mad?

167
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,560
Did I do it

168
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,240
in a wrong way?

169
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:18,880
Your Highness,

170
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,400
you've changed.

171
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,280
You never

172
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,400
introspected yourself like this before.

173
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,240
You were brutal and cold-hearted.

174
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,240
But it doesn't matter now.

175
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,760
Do you know why you've changed?

176
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:37,840
Why?

177
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,150
It's because

178
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,550
you're rooted

179
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,440
in love.

180
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,480
Love is something really magic.

181
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,080
You can be sad.

182
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,080
You can be happy.

183
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,840
You'll be happy when you
think of your wife, right?

184
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,100
Your Highness.

185
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,160
Wait...

186
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,280
Did I say something wrong?

187
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,280
What's wrong with me?

188
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,840
Why did I stand up for him?

189
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,080
Why should I go there?

190
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,560
I don't want to!

191
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,880
I deserve it.

192
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,320
I need to make
the Faked-death Drug soon.

193
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,040
The south!

194
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,440
Qingshui County is in the south!

195
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,720
Lin Huanhuan,

196
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,880
you're a genius!

197
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,680
Your Highness.

198
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,840
Did you kill Yuetao

199
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,840
or bury her alive
in the back mountain?

200
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,999
She's back to the Lin Residence.

201
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,360
It's very kind of you!

202
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,400
Your Highness,

203
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,960
the road will be bumpy.

204
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,320
Please sit tight.

205
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,200
I don't need your help.

206
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,360
I can handle it.

207
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,850
I didn't mean to.

208
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,120
I didn't.

209
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,680
You don't have to go with me.

210
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,600
I can explain it to my father.

211
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,160
Don't worry about me.

212
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,800
I am strong enough.
