3
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:27,640
Here.

4
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:33,720
Allow me.

5
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,800
I'm here to pay my respects,

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,840
Your Highness.

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,440
I'm Xu Qingfeng,
the magistrate of Qingshui County.

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,640
As you were.

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,440
Let's go inside.

10
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,200
Got it.

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:50,340
(Courier Station)

12
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,200
Your Highness,
hope you'll like it here.

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,360
It's good.

14
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,720
Tell me what's going on in the county.

15
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,680
The outbreak has lasted for a year.

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,520
The old magistrate died of the disease.

17
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,920
(He's too young to be an official.)

18
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,440
No one wants to take office here.

19
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,520
I took the job not long ago.

20
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,480
Many physicians here
died of the sickness.

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,320
So, the people are struggling,

22
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,400
and relying on luck.

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,840
The royal court won't give up.

24
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,399
Thank you, Your Highness.

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,720
Mr. Xu, we'll follow you

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,440
to check on all the patients.

27
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:40,920
Your Highness,

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,960
you took a long journey.

29
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,720
Why not get some rest?

30
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,480
It's OK.

31
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,200
I'm not tired.

32
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,160
The disease is infectious.

33
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:48,760
Look.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,920
I'll ask some patients to come here.

35
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,960
Don't bother.

36
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,600
It's OK.

37
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,160
Let's go.

38
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,520
Mr. Xu, you can take patients here.

39
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,600
Tired?

40
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,240
Grab a bite.

41
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,440
I'll pass.

42
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,880
The snacks are expensive.

43
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,360
You should enjoy them.

44
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,600
You royal members

45
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,760
always love to say

46
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,000
something high-sounding.

47
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,840
The royal court won't give up?

48
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,450
But you don't even dare
to go to the epidemic area.

49
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,480
Huanhuan,

50
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,160
Qingshui County

51
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,080
isn't as safe as you imagine.

52
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,600
Be careful.

53
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,760
It's just an outbreak.

54
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,880
(Courier Station)
Next one.

55
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,520
(Courier Station)
Thank you, Miss.

56
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,080
Roll up your sleeves.

57
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,720
Let me check.

58
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,440
Does it hurt?

59
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,360
No.

60
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,640
Have you been injured?

61
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,480
No.

62
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,640
OK.

63
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,040
Get some rest.

64
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,320
Thank you, Miss.

65
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,200
Next one.

66
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,000
How are you feeling?

67
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,240
I'm coughing

68
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,520
and feeling exhausted.

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,799
I've got a fever, too.

70
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,240
Show me your tongue.

71
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,080
Did you eat any moldy food?

72
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,160
No.

73
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,040
It can't be right.

74
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,680
Impossible.

75
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,520
What's wrong?

76
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,920
The patients I saw

77
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,520
were having strong and steady pulses.

78
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,200
No one had any ulceration.

79
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,840
The symptoms they said

80
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,280
were all caused by the outbreak.

81
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,960
But they didn't
look like what they said.

82
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,600
How dare they?

83
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,240
What's wrong?

84
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,320
Who upset you?

85
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,400
The people here

86
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,320
didn't let me out

87
00:04:58,321 --> 00:04:59,200
because of the epidemic.

88
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,680
I told them I needed to buy something.

89
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,880
They said they'd deliver it.

90
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,200
I didn't want the delivery!

91
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,840
I didn't!

92
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,120
I wanted to go out!

93
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
They've gone too far.

94
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,920
Aren't we locked up here?

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,840
Exactly!

96
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,230
Your Highness,

97
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,120
do something.

98
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,240
OK.

99
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:19,260
(Courier Station)

100
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,920
You witch!

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,080
I can't stand you anymore!

102
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,920
You called me "witch"?

103
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,160
Fine! Whatever!

104
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:26,960
Just tell me

105
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,960
who Xiangxiang is!

106
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,080
It's so unfair!

107
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,560
His Highness quarrels
with his wife?

108
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,480
-Stop Crying!
-Humans are the same.

109
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,560
Couples will quarrel.

110
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,600
We should guard the gate.

111
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,440
Let it be.

112
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Go ahead! You can break anything!

113
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,760
Screw you!

114
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,440
Shut up!

115
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,040
Get lost!

116
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,440
Shangguan Li,

117
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,920
I will divorce you

118
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,160
after I finish my job here!

119
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,120
Don't threaten me!

120
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,520
Shangguan Li!

121
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,360
You...

122
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,840
You think it's a good idea?

123
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,800
It doesn't matter.

124
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,600
Where should we start?

125
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,080
No hurry.

126
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,840
Let's walk around.

127
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,360
Will you be nervous

128
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,520
in a strange place?

129
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,760
No.

130
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,400
The mountains taught me a lot.

131
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,960
Was your life hard?

132
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,160
I don't think so.

133
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,760
I'm not used to living
in the capital city.

134
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,200
Are you still mad at me?

135
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,360
You...

136
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
-You're not mad at me?
-Mom!

137
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,560
Mom!

138
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,200
-My Mom needs help!
-Hurry up!

139
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,200
Miss,

140
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,400
I live here.

141
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,000
Miss, my mom
has been sick for a long time.

142
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,360
Please help her.

143
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,120
Don't worry.

144
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,440
I'll feel the pulse first.

145
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:18,880
Kiddo,

146
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,480
let me check up on you, OK?

147
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,280
Miss,

148
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,160
will we be cured?

149
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,360
Yes.

150
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,400
Just tell me

151
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,240
who got sick in the first place.

152
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,120
I don't remember.

153
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,320
It's been over a year.

154
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,760
Seemed we suddenly got sick together.

155
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,480
Kiddo,

156
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,320
who else got sick near your home?

157
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,960
The neighbors next door are sick.

158
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,400
Take me there, please.

159
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:44,920
OK.

160
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,480
Huanhuan,

161
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,240
you have clues?

162
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,880
I need to confirm something.

163
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,680
Thank you!

164
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,940
(Qingshui County)

165
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,280
Have you figured it out?

166
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,680
It was not an epidemic.

167
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,440
They were poisoned.

168
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,400
Can you just talk to me?

169
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,680
Why aren't you surprised?

170
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,480
I was suspicious

171
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,680
when the magistrate
didn't let us go out

172
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:31,900
after we had arrived at the county.

173
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:32,600
Exactly.

174
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,790
The patients they sent were not sick.

175
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,550
Can you detoxify them?

176
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,480
Yes.

177
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,600
But

178
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,600
I need to know where it started

179
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,800
in order to get the antidote.

180
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,840
What could

181
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,080
poison everyone in the county?

182
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,320
What would they use

183
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,400
every single day?

184
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,880
Water!

185
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,400
Smart girl.

186
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,080
I'm smarter than you think!

187
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,260
(Qingshui County)

188
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,880
It must be the water resource
of the county.

189
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,680
You're smart, too.

190
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,840
Let's go.

191
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,620
(Courier Station)

192
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,680
I've made it!
