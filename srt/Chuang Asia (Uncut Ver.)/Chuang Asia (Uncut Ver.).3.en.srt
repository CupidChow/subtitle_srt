00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,480
MIKE: And at the bottom of the song,

78
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,640
MIKE: there'll be the numbers of members

79
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,000
MIKE: who can be in the songs.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,760

81
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,560

MIKE: The selection order will be made

85
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,840
MIKE: based on the theme song evaluation,

86
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,080
MIKE: starting from the top rank.

87
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,960
MIKE: Yes.
So, the top rank gets to choose first.

88
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,600
MIKE:
So, when I call the names by ranking,

89
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,200
MIKE: you guys can just
walk straight to the song

90
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,280
MIKE: and choose the song right away.

91
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,640
ELYN: I think it's a fair game.

92
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,440

So, the stronger ones get to choose first.

93
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,520
WANG KE: I can

94
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,200

95
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,240
PREAM: I'm excited. I'm afraid
someone will take the song that I want.

96
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,280
PREAM: I'm afraid

97
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,160
PREAM: those from A class

98
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,600
PREAM: will choose my song

99
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,920
PREAM: and take the center position.

100
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,240
PAILIU: Do I agree?

101
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,400
PAILIU: There's nothing I can do.

102
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,120
PAILIU: In the end,
F class gets to choose last.

103
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,120
PAILIU: And my name is one of the last.

104
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,240
PAILIU: I just have to accept

105
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,840
PAILIU:
that I may not get the song that I want.

106
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,120
TEGAN: Oh, my God.

107
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,640
TEGAN: F class

108
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,400
TEGAN: is not great.

109
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,480
MIKE: The first person who gets to choose.

110
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,160
MIKE: RUAN.

111
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,680
MIKE: please stand up.

112
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,600
NATTY: Wow, I'm excited.

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,440
MIKE: So, your friends voted for you

114
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,800
MIKE: and respect you
as the center of the theme song.

115
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,240
MIKE: So, you get to choose first.

116
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,680
MIKE: And...
the rest of class A, please stand up.

117
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,040
MIKE: The rest of Class A will be
able to choose the song.

118
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,400
MIKE: after RUAN.

119
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,920
RUAN: When I started to feel the pressure,

120
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,840
RUAN: I was much more nervous.

121
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,480
NENE: The ten of you will have
the priority to choose the song.

122
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,600
NENE: If more than one of you choose
the same song,

123
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,440
NENE: you will have to complete

124
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,960
NENE: among each other
for the CENTER position

125
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,320
NENE: If that song doesn't have any
of the A-class trainees or RUAN,

126
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,720
NENE: everybody will have a chance
to be the Center.

127
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,440
NENE: So, you can discuss in your team
to find the Center.

128
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,640
MIKE: But, remember this

129
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,800
MIKE: any trainees

130
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,760
MIKE: who are in the same ranking
that chooses the last position

131
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,760
MIKE: of one of the song in the same time

132
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,600
MIKE: you guys will have to do
Extra Challenges.

133
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,200
MINGMING: Extra Challenge

134
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,440
MIKE: So, let's start.

135
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,880
MIKE: RUAN, please choose.

136
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,400
TRAINEE: I'm surprised that RUAN,
with her cute look,

137
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,320
TRAINEE: I don't think RUAN will choose
the song, HARD.

138
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,880
RUAN: I chose Hard because I would like
to let people see me perform other styles

139
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,120
RUAN: other than Summer Dream.

140
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,200
MIKE: EMMA.

141
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,800
EMMA: The first compete Center,
I lost for Theme Song.

142
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,720
EMMA: I think it's because of
the song style, it's more fit on her.

143
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,960
EMMA: And this HARD is more fit on me.

144
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,560
EMMA: So, I think it's me better.

145
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,160
EMMA: YEAN

146
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,800
MIKE: Is that correct? Correct? Correct?

147
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,680
MIKE: QIAO YI YU.

148
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,360
QIAO YI YU: The first time I heard
the voice of Kick Back, I was like

149
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,720
QIAO YI YU: this is my song.

150
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,000
MIKE: COCO.

151
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,000
QIAO YI YU: Actually, I'm quite worried
about COCO the most,

152
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,040
QIAO YI YU: because I knew COCO also ...

153
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,560
QIAO YI YU: When we were on the stand,
we've talked to each other.

154
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,160
QIAO YI YU: I asked COCO

155
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,400
QIAO YI YU: which kind of the song
do you want to choose?

156
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,160
QIAO YI YU: She was saying to me like,
either Booty Bomb or

157
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,200
QIAO YI YU: Kick Back.

158
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,680
MINGMING: At that time I think
in my mind that

159
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,480
MINGMING: I actually want to choose
HARD, right?

160
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,840
MINGMING: But when I saw the Center, who
walked into the row for the song,

161
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,520
MINGMING: Oh-ho! she is
such a cool girl, you know.

162
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,520
MINGMING: So, I feel that

163
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,200
MINGMING: there's the other choice for me.

164
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
MIKE: KANOMPANG.

165
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,240
MIKE: That's the hard choice.

166
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:57,800
MIKE: Hey!

167
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,280
MIKE: At first, I thought you would choose
Booty Bomb.

168
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,680
KANOMPANG: Yes, at first I want to choose
Booty Bomb , but

169
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,400
KANOMPANG: um... when I saw COCO, so

170
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,000
KANOMPANG: I feel like it's hard for me
to compete for the Center.

171
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,800
KANOMPANG: I thought it would be easier
to compete with you.

172
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,960
MIKE: WANG KE.

173
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,640
WANG KE: I think out of those ten songs,

174
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,600
WANG KE: this song is fit on me the most.

175
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,520
WANG KE: Although it's hard, I think

176
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,800
WANG KE: it doesn't matter if it's hard.

177
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,880
MIKE: MAO XIU TING.

178
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,120
MAO XIU TING: I definitely want to choose
the song.

179
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,960
MAO XIU TING: Besides, I saw COCO
choosing the song.

180
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,360
MAO XIU TING: I really like COCO,

181
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,920
MAO XIU TING: and I want to join
in the same team with her.

182
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,480
MAO XIU TING: So, I chose this song.

183
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,800
COCO: No matter whoever is the Center,

184
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,080
COCO: If it comes to competing
with anybody, I don't want to.

185
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,120
COCO: It's not because of MAO XIU TING.

186
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,800
COCO: I don't want to compete with anyone.

187
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,600
MIKE: REI-chan.

188
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,000
MIKE: Please.

189
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,160
REI: Frankly speaking, WANG KE-chan
chose it first.

190
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,880
REI: I've never thought
she would choose 7 RINGS.

191
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,000
REI: Since when I saw WANG KE performing
her first stage,

192
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,000
REI: I feel that I want to do battle
with her. I want to perform with her once.

193
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,600
REI: So, I decide to compete with her.

194
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,120
MIKE: Very nice, very nice. Okay.

195
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,200
MIKE: So, you guys will have to compete
later for the Center, okay?

196
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,840
NENE: Then, we'll move on to Class B.

197
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,200
MIKE: Starting from ILENE.

198
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,400
ILENE: I... I feel

199
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,640
ILENE: very happy that

200
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,160
ILENE: my ranking score

201
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,280
ILENE: is quite high among
the B-ranking trainees.

202
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,000
MINGMING: So awesome.

203
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,520
PREAM: In my mind, I actually think
I will choose this song.

204
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,720
MINGMING: Dancer in veins.

205
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,160
PREAM: I really like
I’ll do it how you like it.

206
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,000
PREAM: So, I'm the first who walked
into the row of the song.

207
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,360
MIKE: MAO XIU LING

208
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,800
MAO XIU LING: I feel like my sister
also likes this song.

209
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,160
MAO XIU LING: So, we made eye contact
with each other for a moment,

210
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,720
MAO XIU LING: we knew right away that
the other one

211
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,200
MAO XIU LING: definitely like Booty Bomb.

212
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,200
JESSICA: Oh, my God. So cute. Twins.

213
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,040
MIKE: Three people with the same ranking

214
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,280
MIKE: VITA, YEHAM, DUNA. Please stand up.

215
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,360
ILENE: Two left.

216
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,760
YEAN: Play with Me, DUNA, YEHAM.

217
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,800
DUNA: I think I went to that song first

218
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,200
DUNA: because there's no trainee
going there yet.

219
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,800
DUNA: I think this is really good.

220
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,360
DUNA: I'm very happy.

221
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
MIKE: Next.

222
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,800
LISSA: I heard 7 RINGS are like

223
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,160
LISSA: That's my song.

224
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,120
LISSA: Only one place left.

225
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,640
MIKE: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

226
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,800
MIKE: PRAEW

227
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,920
NENE: Kick Back, five members right now.

228
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,000
NENE: So, only two places are left
for Kick Back.

229
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
CHACHA: I only want to go to Kick Back.

230
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,280
MIKE: Next.

231
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,000
MIKE: LILIANA LI and SEOYEON

232
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,120
LILIANA LI: When I started to see
like how they were separating.

233
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,960
LILIANA LI: I was like,
"Okay, I have a chance."

234
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,240
MIKE: Alright, guys.

235
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:18,200
MIKE: As of now, 7 Rings is closed
for selection.

236
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,840
MIKE: 7 Rings is full, guys.

237
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,200
PAILIU: I want 7 Rings. I want it so much.

238
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,840
PAILIU: I've already prepared my heart.

239
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,840
PAILIU: I know there's no chance for me.

240
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,560
MIKE: Okay, so now Kick Back.
Only got one spot left.

241
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,160
MIKE: Booty Bomb!

242
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,040
MIKE: Three of you, please step up.

243
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,160
MIKE: You guys ready?

244
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,360
MIKE: Go!

245
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,920
CHACHA: The person in front of me

246
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,920
CHACHA: is the last one who got Kick Back.

247
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,160
KAYLEN: Actually, Kick Back
wasn't my first choice.

248
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,960
KAYLEN: My first choice was 7 Rings.

249
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,400
KAYLEN: But I'm just glad that Kick Back
still has one member.

250
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,200
CHACHA: I feel like my soul has left
my body for the second time.

251
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,600
MIKE: Kick Back is full.

252
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,640
MIKE: CHACHA, your turn.

253
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,480
MIKE: Okay.

254
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,120
MIKE: So, now Booty Bomb is closed
for selection.

255
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,800
MIKE: R-JING.

256
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,880
MIKE: We're done for Class B.

257
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,800
MIKE: Moving on to Class F.

258
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,040
MIKE: Okay.

259
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,000
MIKE: Not so good?

260
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,440
MIKE: Alright, let's start
with the first person.

261
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,320
MIKE: Ready... Go!

262
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:28,680
MIKE: So, right now,
I'll Do It How You Like It is full.

263
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,600
MIKE: One More Last Time is full.

264
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,240
TEGAN: Honestly, it didn't affect F Class,

265
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,400
TEGAN: till I was sitting there,
watching everyone pick.

266
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,200
TEGAN: It was kinda like torture.

267
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,920
TEGAN: I could like feel myself...

268
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,360
TEGAN: just wanting to like fall
backwards and like it's...

269
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,560
TEGAN: I don't know.

270
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:48,880
MIKE: Okay.

271
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,880
MIKE: Now, Hard already got six members.

272
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,000
MIKE: Only one spot left.

273
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,560
MIKE: Next, XUANNING and YUAN KE.

274
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,200
MINGMING: I was stunned to speak.

275
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,040
MINGMING: Everyone was saying
the same thing

276
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,200
MINGMING: that XUANNING will choose this song.

277
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,560
XUANNING: Maybe it was fate.

278
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,400
XUANNING: That left the most suitable song
for me.

279
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,400
MIKE: NATTY looks so ready.

280
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,680
MIKE: I see you've been eyeing this
for a long time.

281
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,240
MIKE: What if the person next to you
also wants this song?

282
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,760
NATTY: I got the same

283
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,400
NATTY: score as KITTIE.

284
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,920
NATTY: And she wanted to choose Hard.

285
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,480
NATTY: That song is the last song
with one position left.

286
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,840
KITTIE: Actually, I felt like...

287
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,440
KITTIE: Other than that song,

288
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,400
KITTIE: there's no other option.

289
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,240
KITTIE: But I know that NATTY
also likes this song.

290
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,000
KITTIE: So, she doesn't have
any options too.

291
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,600
MIKE: I count one, two, three.

292
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,760
MIKE: Extra Challenge!

293
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,880
MIKE: Extra Challenge!

294
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,800
NATTY: I feel like my life is so hard.

295
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,920
NATTY: Ever since I came here,
I have to fight for everything.

296
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
NATTY: Even the song selection.

297
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,400
MIKE: So, the trainees who chose
the song, Hard,

298
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,240
MIKE: We'll be doing this Extra Challenge,

299
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,800
MIKE: which is called
the 'Windmill Challenge.'

300
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,160
MIKE: What we call it in Thai is
'Pun Jing Reed.'

301
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,000
MIKE: I will count one to ten.

302
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,800
MIKE: So, you guys will be spinning
like ten rounds.

303
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,560
MIKE: And then, you guys have to run
as fast as you can.

304
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,800
MIKE: I put this here.
NENE: Put it here.

305
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,160
MIKE: In here, yeah.

306
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,200
NENE: So, the winner got that song.

307
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,800
MIKE: But the one who failed

308
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
MIKE: will have to choose another song.

309
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,200
KITTIE: I'm confident that I run fast.

310
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,760
MIKE: Are you guys ready?

311
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:07,000
MIKE: Go! One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

312
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,480
NATTY: I won Hard eventually.

313
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,720
NATTY: That selection was like
pulling teeth.

314
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,200
KITTIE: What a shame.

315
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,280
PAILIU: The songs that were left for me

316
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,720
PAILIU: were all cute songs.

317
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,360
PAILIU: So, I thought 'Karm Vela' would...

318
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,280
PAILIU: suit me.

319
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,240
MIKE: And now, Karm Vela is full,

320
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,160
MIKE: with seven members.

321
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,520
JASMINE: When I went down,
I knew that I have no choice.

322
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,080
JASMINE: I just went down
because there were few songs left,

323
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,640
JASMINE: so I chose that song.

324
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
MIKE: Now, there are only two persons left.

325
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,400
MIKE: How are you guys feelings?

326
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,400
MIKE: Okay.

327
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,080
MIKE: WANG YIBING.

328
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,800
WANG YIBING: Let's leave it to fate.

329
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,040
MIKE: Okay.

330
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,720
MIKE: Pieces of Love is full. Okay.

331
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,160
MIKE: So, now we have got the new team
formation.

332
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,800
MIKE: Stage One is a team competition,
more importantly,

333
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,760
MIKE: The team is going to be
a head to head battle.

334
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,760
MIKE: So, you guys is gonna be battling
with each other.

335
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,600
NENE: How do you feel?
MIKE: How do you feel?

336
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,880
RAY: I'm confident because we have
no place to go down but up.

337
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,600
RAY: Fighting!

338
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:51,960
MIKE: Oh.

339
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,880
