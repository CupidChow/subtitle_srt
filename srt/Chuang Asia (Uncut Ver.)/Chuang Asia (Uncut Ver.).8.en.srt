1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
(The third stage grouping)

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,840
MIKE: Let's be more exciting.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,080
MIKE: Congratulations to the 29 of you

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,280
MIKE: for making it to Stage 3.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,640
MIKE: Today, we'll be making
song selection for Stage 3.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,040
MIKE: And for this stage,
there'll be a special arrangement.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:32,240
MIKE: Each group performance will be
accompanied by a special guest artist.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,240
MIKE: Are you guys excited?

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,720
TRAINEES: Yes.

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,360
MIKE: We will be having
five songs altogether with five guests.

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,120
MIKE: There'll be four songs
that require six members

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,480
MIKE: and one song
requires only five members.

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,000
NENE: Are you ready to listen to the song?

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,280
YUAN KE: Yes.

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,480
NENE: Let's start with
the first song for this stage,

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,560
NENE: a cute Korean dance song from TWICE.

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,960
TRAINEES: Oh, TWICE.

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,520
NENE: WHAT IS LOVE?

19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,320
WANG SHENG XI: WHAT IS LOVE?

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,240
NENE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,200
LISSA: This song is the song
that impresses me the most, WHAT IS LOVE?

22
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,120
LISSA: It's a mixture

23
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,600
LISSA: of what I haven't done
in the show yet.

24
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,800
MIKE: Next, we have a playful Pop R&amp;B song

25
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,280
TRAINEES: R&amp;G song?

26
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,320
MIKE: called NIGHT RIDE.

27
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,400
ILENE: WIN METAWIN, wow.

28
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,640
LILIANA LI: It has the prop
and everything.

29
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,000
PAILIU: Aw, that's cute.

30
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,120
JAOYING: NIGHT RIDE catches my attention
because it looks like...

31
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,000
JAOYING: there's a little bit
of storytelling and musical.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,600
JAOYING: So, an acting student like me
wants this song.

33
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,880
JAOYING: I feel a little bit
of theater in it.

34
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,440
JEFF: So, we have a sweet love song
straight from CHUANG 2021.

35
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,360
NENE: Okay. It's that song
PUSH NO.5 FOR CUTE INPUT METHOD.

36
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,200
NENE: The song from the last season.

37
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,000
YEAN: I know.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,880
NENE: This is a very cute song.

39
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,880
- PAILIU: JEFF.
- JASMINE: JEFF.

40
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,920
NENE: Next song. We move to the next song.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,160
NENE: This is one of our mentors' songs.

42
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,760
LILIANA LI: I gotta do this song.
ILENE: JEFF.

43
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,400
JASMINE: Aw. Oh.

44
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,520
TRAINEES: I know this song.

45
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,000
PAILIU: I've always thought

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,560
PAILIU: if there is a stage
with JEFF's song,

47
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,800
PAILIU: I would definitely go for it.

48
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,160
JEFF: Too sexy.

49
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,920
- YEAN: JEFF, are you gonna dance this?
- ILENE: JEFF, are you gonna dance this?

50
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,440
JEFF: Nope. Nope.
NENE: It's gonna be another guest.

51
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,320
- MIKE: It'll be a guest.
- NENE: Yes.

52
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,400
MIKE: Okay, the last song,

53
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,440
MIKE: also from one of our mentors.

54
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,120
- PRAEW: MIKE.
- YEAN / ILENE: TEN?

55
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,280
MIKE: NIGHTWALKER.

56
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,880
MINGMING: All the five songs
are very good.

57
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,920
MINGMING: I like all of them.

58
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,880
ILENE: DUM DUM or NIGHTWALKER?
MINGMING: I can't choose.

59
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,160
ELYN: I told myself that I want to
try something new.

60
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,080
ELYN: Don't stay in my comfort zone
for too long.

61
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,200
ELYN: I'm going for DUM DUM.

62
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,080
MIKE: Now that everyone
has seen all five songs.

63
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,440
MIKE: Like the last time,

64
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,520
MIKE: the Trainee with the highest ranking
gets to choose first.

65
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,600
MIKE: But for this time,

66
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,040
MIKE: the Top 5 members

67
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,720
MIKE: will automatically become
the center of each song.

68
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,440
TRAINEES: No chance.

69
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,760
MIKE: There'll be no competition or vote
for the center position.

70
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,280
MIKE: But it also means that

71
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,120
MIKE: the Top 5 Trainees cannot be
in the same team.

72
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,560
PAILIU: Oh, cannot be in the same team.

73
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,560
WANG KE: Top 5 cannot be in the same team?
DIDI: Yes.

74
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,400
YEAN: I feel like it's fair

75
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,840
YEAN: because the fans vote for them
to get high ranking.

76
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,040
YEAN: So, they can have the right
to choose the songs

77
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,280
YEAN: and be the center.

78
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,240
R-JING: I feel like this rule
is not fair for anyone.

79
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,360
R-JING: The fairest would be...

80
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,040
R-JING: No.1. That's it.

81
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,600
R-JING: The others don't get to choose.
Only No.1 can choose.

82
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,280
R-JING: Or do I have to be No.1?

83
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,160
R-JING: Even if it's hard, it's worth it.

84
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,400
MIKE: Top 5 Trainees, please step forward.

85
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,640
- MIKE: Ready?
- RUAN: Yes.

86
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,360
MIKE: Let's start with our Top 1,
QIAO YI YU.

87
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,920
QIAO YI YU: Of course, I feel a bit good
because a lot of people who saw the demo

88
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,720
QIAO YI YU: told me that
they know which song I'm going to choose.

89
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,120
QIAO YI YU: So, I asked them "Do you
really know it? I might surprise you."

90
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,400
NENE: Oh, I'm surprised.

91
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,800
TRAINEES: I'm shocked.

92
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,960
NENE: I'm so shocked.

93
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,280
PAILIU: I'm surprised

94
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,040
- WANG KE: She likes it.
- PAILIU: Really?

95
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,800
WANG KE: Yeah.

96
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,440
MIKE: We are already so surprised
by your choice.

97
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,440
QIAO YI YU: Because in my Audition Stage

98
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,280
QIAO YI YU: and my first stage,
it was already my comfort zone.

99
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,640
QIAO YI YU: It's handsome. It's cool.

100
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,600
QIAO YI YU: And now it's Stage 3,

101
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,480
QIAO YI YU: I want to
give the audience a surprise.

102
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,840
- MIKE: Good choice, by the way.
- NENE: Okay.

103
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,600
- QIAO YI YU: Thank you.
- MIKE: Good choice.

104
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,760
MIKE: Top 2, RUAN.

105
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,480
- R-JING: They switch.
- MINGMING: They switch.

106
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,240
RUAN: Switch.

107
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,480
RUAN: People normally call me
a cute hamster

108
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,360
RUAN: or something cute.

109
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,080
RUAN: But this time,
I'll show RUAN that's cool,

110
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,480
RUAN: RUAN that's been through a lot
and can do everything.

111
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,760
RUAN: I want to be in the Top 1 with that.

112
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,760
MIKE: Alright. WANG KE.

113
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,000
WANG KE: My song.

114
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,120
WANG KE: I love it.

115
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,640
JEFF: Good choice.

116
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,440
PAILIU: I'm so sad that I don't get it.

117
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,280
ELYN: WANG KE.

118
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,240
ELYN: I think you should have it.

119
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,120
WANG KE: I also like JEFF's song.

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,760
MIKE: ELYN, your turn.

121
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,080
ELYN: My choices are
PUSH NO.5 FOR CUTE INPUT METHOD

122
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,400
ELYN: and NIGHT RIDE.

123
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,200
ELYN: Actually, I don't know NIGHT RIDE

124
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,080
ELYN: buy I know
PUSH NO.5 FOR CUTE INPUT METHOD

125
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,480
ELYN: because I've heard of it
when I watched CHUANG.

126
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,080
ELYN: I think this song

127
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,080
ELYN: is very sweet. So, I...

128
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,000
MIKE: Okay. Here we go.

129
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,240
MIKE: PAILIU, you have no choice.

130
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,640
PAILIU: The girls already chose
the other songs. This is the only one left

131
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,720
PAILIU: but I'm not sad
that I get this song

132
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,240
PAILIU: because I think it's my fate

133
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,840
PAILIU: that will make me prove
and challenge myself.

134
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,360
NENE: Next, Top 6 to Top 9,

135
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,480
NENE: you can choose
whichever song you want.

136
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,640
NENE: Please come down
and make your song choice.

137
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,200
MIKE: Starting from YEAN.

138
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,200
YEAN: Actually,
I really wanted to choose DUM DUM.

139
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,360
YEAN: I hesitated for a long time but...

140
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,440
YEAN: But when I thought about it again.
I felt like

141
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,000
YEAN: my mom would hit me.

142
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,800
YEAN: It's too sexy. My mom would hit me.

143
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,520
MIKE: EMMA.

144
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,640
RUAN: Same?

145
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,640
TRAINEES: What?

146
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,480
MIKE: Oh, WHAT IS LOVE?

147
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,200
EMMA: How does it not suit me?

148
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,240
MIKE: Alright. Next, KRISTA.

149
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,480
PAILIU: Finally, someone to help me.

150
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,520
KRISTA: Yeah.

151
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,440
MIKE: ILENE, last one.

152
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,760
JEFF: So, now, as you see,
there're many spots here.

153
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,680
JEFF: But unfortunately,

154
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,000
JEFF: the trainees, you can't choose.

155
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,400
JEFF: All the remaining Trainees
can't choose the song.

156
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,360
JEFF: But you have to wait for the Top 5
to invite you instead.

157
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,800
TRAINEES: Oh, JEFF.

158
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,920
TRAINEES: That's crazy.

159
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,680
- R-JING: Again.
- MINGMING: We can't choose.

160
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,240
R-JING: I never get to choose.

161
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,120
MIKE: We're so sorry, guys.
It's just the rule.

162
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,520
MINGMING: At that point, I and R-JING
turned to each other and said

163
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,480
MINGMING: we don't get to choose again.

164
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,320
MINGMING: and we were blank.

165
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,400
R-JING: I never get to choose.
NENE: Oh, they're begging.

166
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,160
ILENE: I looked at WANG KE
and her face was like...

167
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,040
ILENE: "What can I do? Who should I pick?"

168
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,360
ILENE: I'm worried for her.

169
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,160
RINKA: I can only wait for the others
to pick me

170
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,840
RINKA: which I may to wait until the end

171
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,280
RINKA: and can't choose the song
that I want.

172
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,080
RINKA: I think it's very cruel.

173
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,760
LILIANA LI: PAILIU.

174
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,080
LILIANA LI: PAILIU

175
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,760

00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,320
TEGAN: I can learn Chinese fast.

177
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,040
TEGAN: PAILIU.

178
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,560
TEGAN: You hear me?

179
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,520
PAILIU: Okay. I hear you.

180
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,680
TEGAN: Okay.

181
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,080
JEFF: So, now it's time for Top 5
to make some choices again.

182
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,280
JEFF: You will now get the privilege
to choose who you want to perform with

183
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,560
JEFF: and invite them to join your team.

184
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,840
JEFF: One by one,

185
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,000
JEFF: you can choose anyone
remaining on the ranking stand.

186
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,800
JEFF: We will start from Top 1 to Top 5.

187
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,600

188
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,920

JASMINE: RUAN, I want NIGHTWALKER.

193
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,360
JASMINE: I want either DUM DUM
or NIGHTWALKER

194
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,640
JASMINE: because I've never tried
this style.

195
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,600
JASMINE: I gave my signal
to the other groups that I don't want.

196
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,040

197

203
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,480
MIKE: PAILIU.

204
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,120
R-JING: I sent my signal to PAILIU.

205
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,320
R-JING: I believed she'd see my eyes.

206
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,920
R-JING: I was like... PAILIU, choose me.

207
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,400
R-JING: My eyes said that.

208
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,560
PAILIU: TEGAN.

209
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,920
MIKE: Congrats, TEGAN.

210
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,640
R-JING: That looks bad.

211
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,960
MIKE: Alright, that's five.

212
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,160

213
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:57,920

214
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,160

217
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,960
JEFF: WANG KE.

218
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,800

YUAN KE: I'm actually a little worried.

222
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,560
YUAN KE: I think I have a lot of pressure

223
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,040
YUAN KE: because I know

224
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,080
YUAN KE: that the song
that I want the most is DUM DUM.

225
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,360
YUAN KE: But I'm afraid
if I don't get chosen,

226
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,480
YUAN KE: I have to go with another song.

227
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,000
YEAN: Look at LISSA, I can see "No."

228
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,720

229

235
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,320

00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,600

238
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,480

What's wrong?

239
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,680

- ILENE: She can sing.

253
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,160

261
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,040
LILIANA LI: The song that I didn't
want the most was the song that I got.

262
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,760
LILIANA LI: I didn't choose.

263
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,360
LILIANA LI: My heart dropped.

264
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,800
LILIANA LI: Now, I know how it felt like
for most of the people in ZULU PAKA TAPA HEY.

265
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,920
LILIANA LI: I'm so happy.

266

XUANNING: I felt disappointed.

290
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,360
XUANNING: I thought I was too bad
or I wasn't good enough.

291
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,040
XUANNING: Or they didn't trust me.

292
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,400
XUANNING: You know? It's those feelings.

293
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,320
WANG KE: XUANNING.

294
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,280

MAMCÙ: Of course...

303
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,920
MAMCÙ: No matter what,
a person standing on that big place

304
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,400
MAMCÙ: is depressing.

305
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,120

306
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,080
