YEAN: Yes, I had that thought.

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,440
YEAN: I'm trying to prove myself
in many ways.

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,960
YEAN: Before coming here,
I didn't have a lot of fans.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,840
YEAN: There's only one thing I believe in
which is my ability.

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,160
YEAN: But I might not have
as many fans as the others

9
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,800
YEAN: or someone who would vote for me.

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,120
YEAN: I want to prove that my ability
is worth being in the Top 9.

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,680
LU YUTING: I've seen the critique on social media
that some people don't like me.

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,200
LU YUTING: I'm standing here now
because my fans support me.

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:06,480
LU YUTING: I hope they will see in the future
how much I try and how strong I am.

14

XUE YAO: I want to fight with it.

15
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,480
XUE YAO: I want to be the one
who can debut again.

16
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,560
WANG KE: I might not show it much

17
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,320
WANG KE: but I really tried.

18
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,720
WANG KE: I think I can deal with it.

19
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,600
STAFF: Do you think
you can really deal with it?

20
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,880
WANG KE: I can't not deal with it.

21
00:01:33,632 --> 00:01:34,304
WANG KE: I can definitely deal with it.

22
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,840
RUAN: I got selected to be the center
of the theme song because of everyone's vote.

23
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,640
RUAN: I think being liked by people
is one of my strengths.

24
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,520
RUAN: I want to say confidently
that I am the center.

25
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,800
JASMINE: What can I do?
I can't sing well. I can't dance well.

26
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,120
JASMINE: But I try.

27
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,400
JASMINE: For me, I think sometimes
compliments are poisons.

28
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,560
JASMINE: But critique is medicine.

29
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,480
JASMINE: Because this is me.

30
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,760
JASMINE: This is how I am
or do you want me to be yours?

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,080
KRISTA: There's so many different unique aspects
of each person who deserves to be an idol.

32
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,400
KRIS: It's okay if you don't think
that I deserve to be an idol

33
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,960
KRISTA: because I will work hard
and do my best to prove

34
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,920
KRISTA: I do deserve to be
where I am right now.

35
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,320
PAILIU: I think I don't blame the comments
of these people.

36
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,360
PAILIU: And I don't feel like
it's my fault

37
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,280
PAILIU: because I feel like
I've tried hard enough.

38
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,560
PAILIU: Even though I'm not good now,

39
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,400
PAILIU: it doesn't mean I won't be good
in the future.

40
00:02:56,832 --> 00:02:58,880
PAILIU: It's true that everyone tries.

41
00:02:58,976 --> 00:03:01,664
PAILIU: It's true
that everyone works hard.

42
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,240
PAILIU: Maybe I'm really not good.

43
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:05,920
PAILIU: Or...

44
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,120
PAILIU: I should go back

45
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,440
PAILIU: and do something else
or choose other paths.

46
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,120
JEFF: I know there's a lot more pressure.

47
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,440
JEFF: The most important thing
in this situation

48
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,880
JEFF: is the ones who can handle pressure.

49
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,440
JEFF: Cut everything off.

50
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,800
JEFF: The more you can handle it, the more

51
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,120
JEFF: you can enjoy the stage.

88
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,830

89
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,750

91
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,590
MIKE: How are you guys doing?

92
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,550

has it been in CHUANG ASIA?

98
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,470

have all seen your hard work and your improvement.

103
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,510

104
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,630
JEFF: So, for me,

105
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,790
JEFF: I just wanna say
that I've seen you for a very long time.

106
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,470
JEFF: It's been 83 days.

107
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,990
JEFF: Since day one,

108
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:27,550
JEFF: I've seen you grow to be beautiful,
shining and everything you do

109
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,270
JEFF: just keeps getting better.

110
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,790
JEFF: I just wanna say
that you're doing a good job.

111
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:38,390
JEFF: And I hope that I would see you
in the thing that you love to do,

112
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,350
JEFF: acting, singing, dancing,
whatever you want to do.

113
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,270
JEFF: Do it with yourself,
with your passion.

114
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:50,070
JEFF: So, I just wanna cheer you up
one more time before we go to the elimination day

115
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,470
JEFF: which is gonna be a lot of crying.

116
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,550
JEFF: So, let's just cheer one more time.
Let's go.

117
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,350
NENE: I can see you guys
grow up every day.

118
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:11,430
NENE: And some of you might think about
your friends outside and your family.

119
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,270
NENE: But we're half way there.

120
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,150
NENE: We're half way there
to the last day.

121
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,990
NENE: I hope you guys enjoy
this precious moment with your friends

122
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,070
NENE: because this might be the last time.

123
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,630
NENE: And... yeah.

124
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,990
TRAINEES: Yeah.

125
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,750
MIKE: Thank you, NENE.

126
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,910
MIKE: Alright. So, if everyone is ready,

127
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:41,950
MIKE: let's start announcing the ranking
for the second stage of CHUANG ASIA.

128
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,310
MIKE: Out of 39 trainees,

129
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,870
MIKE: there'll only be 26 of you
who get to advance to the next round.

130
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,430
MIKE: And unfortunately
for the rest of you,

131
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,550
MIKE: you guys will be going home.

132
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:03,910
LISSA: When the mentor said
26 people will make it,

133
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,550
LISSA: I looked at my ranking.

134
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,150
LISSA: Mine is 27.

135
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,830
LISSA: If I don't jump further,

136
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,110
LISSA: I'd be gone.

137
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:17,710
ÁNH SÁNG: I think I can stay in 22... 20?

138
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,110
ÁNH SÁNG: I think so.

139
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:23,190
ACARE: This time,
I think I'll be around 25-30.

140
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,550
STAFF: Why?
ACARE: Because if I get it,

141
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,870
ACARE: I may be the last place, like 26.

142
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:32,190
ELYN: I hope my ranking this time
will be higher than last time,

143
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,630
ELYN: just one place.

144
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,910
WANG KE: I hope the Top 9 list

145
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,870
WANG KE: will change. That way,
I can be in the Top 9.

146
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,310
YUAN KE: If I change myself a little bit,
I'll be in Top 9.

147
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,150
MIKE: In this round of voting,

148
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:52,750
MIKE: TRAINEE's final ranking not only
depends on the votes.in WeTV platform,

149
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:57,990
MIKE: but also additional votes
from various channels, including

150
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:02,670
MIKE: the best performance group
in Stage 2.

151
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:07,790
MIKE: So, will this additional votes
affect the ranking?

152
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:12,430
MIKE: Let's start announcing
the ranking now.

153
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,910
R-JING: I'm so excited because...

154
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,550
R-JING: last time,
I almost got eliminated.

155
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,430
R-JING: I hope
I won't be eliminated this time.

156
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:23,350
YUI: Because I was saved last time,
I'm so excited this time.

157
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,990
YUI: Last time, I didn't make it by myself
but I was saved.

158
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:30,590
YUI: So, I'm so nervous
if I'll make it this time.

159
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:35,590
MIKE: Let's start
with all the trainees who...

160
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,830
MIKE: won the MVP for the second stage.

161
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,990

172
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,710
MIKE: So, before we start,
I have to tell you this.

173
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:27,750
MIKE: Out of all eight of you,
in this round of ranking,

174
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:33,790
MIKE: 7 of you have moved up in ranking.

175
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,830
MIKE: But one of you have gone down.

176
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:49,310
MIKE: Your ranking has gone up or down,

177
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,870
MIKE: let's start with the Top 9

178
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:58,190
MIKE: which is RUAN, QIAO YI YU and YEAN.

179
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:03,590
MIKE: Let's start with YEAN.

180
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:10,070
MIKE: Do you think your ranking
has moved up or down, YEAN?

181
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:17,390
YEAN: For me, in all the performances,
I've done my best/

182
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:21,150
YEAN: And I believe
someone must see my ability.

183
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,750
YEAN: And I might my ranking would go up.

184
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,070
TRAINEES: Yes.

185
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,950
MIKE: Nice. Nice.

186
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:33,470
MIKE: RUAN, do you think you're still
in the Top 9?

187
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,870
RUAN: In my performance this time,

188
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,790
RUAN: I've shown all the idol side in me.

189
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,160
RUAN: I think my ranking would go up.

190
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:49,630
MIKE: QIAO YI YU, do you think
you're still in the Top 9?

191
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:54,350
QIAO YI YU: I think, I just have a feeling
my ranking is gonna go up.

192
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,030
MIKE: Last time you said
that you wanted to be in the Top 3.

193
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,270
QIAO YI YU: Yes.

194
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,870
MIKE: Do you think
you can make it happen this time?

195
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,710
QIAO YI YU: I think I can.

196
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:10,590
MIKE: LISSA, green is your lucky color.
Right?

197
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,550
LISSA: Yes.

198
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,590
MIKE: And today you're wearing green.

199
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,350
LISSA: Yes.

200
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:24,230
MIKE: This is the first time you get MVP,
from Stage 2, right?

201
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,550
LISSA: Yes.

202
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:32,510
MIKE: Do you think the green power
will help you make it to the next round?

203
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,830
LISSA: I really believe in green.

204
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,390
LISSA: I think all of you know that.

205
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,390
LISSA: And I believe that the green
will bring me up today.

206
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,510
LISSA: I believe.

207
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,550
MIKE: R-JING and YUI.

208
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,710
MIKE: I'll start with R-JING.

209
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,230
MIKE: Last time, you were eliminated

210
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,790
MIKE: but you were saved.

211
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,270
KRISTA: R-JING.

212
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,670

213
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:11,550
MIKE: R-JING, do you think
you'll make it this time?

214
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,310
R-JING: I think I've got that chance

215
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,870
R-JING: and I've done my best.

216
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,590
R-JING: I believe everyone will see it.

217
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,310
R-JING: And I believe I'll make it today.

218
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,552
MIKE: YUI.

219
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:30,630
MIKE: Are you confident you'll make it?

220
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:37,030
YUI: Last time, I got eliminated
and was saved by RUAN.

221
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,350
YUI: This time, I've done my best.

222
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,350
YUI: So, I think I'll make it
to the next performance.

223
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:44,832
MIKE: Next, COCO,

224
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,576
MIKE: you have received MVP twice?

225
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:56,890
MIKE: and XUANNING, you have been awarded
MVP three times from the AUDITIONS Stage to Stage 2.

226
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,250
MIKE: You guys are very good
at what you guys do.

227
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:07,290
MIKE: Do you guys think that you guys are
gonna be able to advance to the next round

228
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:13,410
MIKE: or you guys think that you guys are
gonna be able to go up to the Top 9?

229
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,170
MIKE: Okay. That's everyone.

230
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,250
MIKE: Then shall we start
with the announcement?

231
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,750
MIKE: Let's start with...

232
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,910
MIKE: I'll choose two first.

233
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:30,710
MIKE: The two people who, in Stage 2,
were competing in vocal.

234
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,350
MIKE: LISSA and YEAN, please step forward.

235
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,670
TRAINEES: YEAN, LISSA.

236
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,990
CHACHA: LISSA.
MINGMING. YEAN, LISSA.

237
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,080
MIKE: Last time we started with you,
right, LISSA?

238
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,880
LISSA: Yes.

239
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,240
MIKE: What's your ranking now, LISSA?

240
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,910
LISSA: Right now I'm 27

241
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:59,750
LISSA: which I know won't be able
to make it to the next stage.

242
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:00,870
MIKE: Why would you say that?

243
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,670
LISSA: Because there's no 27 there.

244
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,130
MIKE: We have 26.

245
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,250
MIKE: So, if your ranking goes up,

246
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,970
MIKE: you'll still make it
to the next round.

247
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:14,410
LISSA: Hopefully.

248
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,170
MIKE: But if your ranking goes down,

249
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,290
MIKE: you're going home.

250
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:24,050
MIKE: And your ranking is...

251
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,210
MIKE: 26.

252
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,970
TRAINEES: Oh, my God.

253
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:36,290
MIKE: Congratulations.
You get to advance to the next round.

254
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,170
LISSA: Congratulations.

255
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:50,250
LISSA: LISSA, you've jumped so far.

256
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:54,770
LISSA: I was screaming inside.

257
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,730
LISSA: You made it.
You actually did make it.

258
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:02,610
LISSA: The little dream
you've ever dreamed of actually came true.

259
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,450
LISSA: You made it to the third round.

260
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,090
LISSA: I really want to be in the Top 9

261
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:11,690
LISSA: but I'm thankful for all the votes
that make me stay

262
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,848
LISSA: in this rank 26. I'm very proud.

263
00:17:15,616 --> 00:17:16,970
WANG KE: Good job.

264
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,112
MIKE: LISSA.

265
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,370
MIKE: You're on the edge of the cliff.

266
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,490
LISSA: Thank you.
MIKE: Very lucky.

267
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:25,690
LISSA: Green, green, green.
MIKE: Green, green, green.

268
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,730
TRAINEES: Green, green, green.

269
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,490
MIKE: YEAN,

270
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:34,210
MIKE: You are both Center and MVP twice.

271
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,210
YEAN: Yes.

272
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,490
MIKE: Let's see if you'll make it.

273
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,760
MIKE: What's your ranking now?

274
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,330
YEAN: Rank 8.

275
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,930
MIKE: Rank 8, right?
YEAN: Yes.

276
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,770
YEAN: I'm excited

277
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,170
YEAN: because last time my ranking was 8.

278
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,170
YEAN: So, I want to know if my ranking
will go up or down.

279
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,210
MIKE: And your ranking is...

280
00:17:59,130 --> 00:17:59,930
MIKE: 6.

281
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,650
MIKE: Congratulations. Please go to No. 6.
TRAINEES: YEAN.

282
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,130
PANDA: Good job, YEAN.

283
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:21,850
YEAN: Now, I feel like I'm really close
to the word "All-rounder"

284
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,690
YEAN: I believe no matter
what people want me to do,

285
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,010
YEAN: even if it's hard,
I'll work hard to do it.

286
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,410
YEAN: And I'll do it in the end.

287
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,490
YEAN: So, I think
there's nothing I can't do.

288
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:37,050
MIKE: Congratulations.
Your ranking went up. Yeah.

289
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,490
TRAINEES: Yeah.

290
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:42,944
MIKE: Next.

291
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:48,370
MIKE: RUAN from ZIGZAG and YUI from AIN'T MY FAULT,
please step forward.

292
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:08,410
MIKE: Last time, RUAN, you saved YUI
after she got eliminated, right?

293
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:35,650
- JACKSON: Congratulations, YUI.
- MIKE: Congratulations.

294
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:41,930
MIKE: And so once again,
you guys get to perform on stage two.

295
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:49,210
MIKE: Let's see if you guys, both of you,
if you get to advance to the next stage

296
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,490
MIKE: or one of you will have to go home.

297
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:54,770
MIKE: You guys ready?

298
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:55,610
YUI: Yes.

299
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:03,130
RUAN: Since I've been on Team HEART
with YUI,

300
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:07,890
RUAN: I've been taking care of her.
I believe she can do it when it comes to her abilities.

301
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,570
MIKE: Before I'll announce the rankings,

302
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:17,250
MIKE: Just wanted to congratulate both of you
that your rankings both went up.

303
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,930
YUI: Last time, I didn't have many fans
supporting me.

304
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:27,490
YUI: But this time,
I've got many more fans.

305
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,850
YUI: If this time I get eliminated again,

306
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,370
YUI: I would be even more disappointed
than last time.

307
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,210
MIKE: I will start with RUAN first then.

308
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:39,410
RUAN: Okay.

309
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:44,810
MIKE: Last time, your ranking was sixth.

310
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,530
MIKE: Ranking number six.

311
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:53,120
MIKE: This time, your ranking is...

312
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,120
MIKE: Ranking number two.

313
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,130
MIKE: Congratulations.

314
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,330
MIKE: Congratulations.

315
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,770
WANG KE: RUAN.

316
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,250
- WANG KE: RUAN.
- MIKE: Your ranking is number two.

317
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,912
WANG KE: RUAN.

318
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,690
RUAN: Last time, I got sixth place.
This time, I got second place.

319
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,450
RUAN: I'm so glad
that I moved up four ranks.

320
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:25,770
RUAN: But I'm a little bit regretful
that I'm only one step from the first place.

321
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:29,050
RUAN: I will definitely get
the first place next time.

322
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:33,810
MIKE: YUI, your ranking went up a lot.

323
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:42,490
MIKE: For me, I see your talents
and you are very talented.

324
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,530
MIKE: We all like you.
We all like your performances.

325
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,610
MIKE: I'm sorry.

326
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,850
MIKE: You do not get to advance
to the next round.

327
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:06,770
MIKE: Don't give up. Please keep going.

328
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,370
YUI: Thank you so much.

329
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:13,770
TRAINEES: YUI

330
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,850
YUI: I feel sad

331

496
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,500
YEAN: I want to debut in Top three.

497
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,460
YEAN: I will definitely debut
in Top three.

498
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:57,340
YEAN: Please support
and vote for me a lot.

499
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,820
- YEAN: Thank you, everyone.
- TRAINEES: Wow.

500
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,660
MIKE: Thank you.
Our little girl with a big talent.

501
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,940
MIKE: Have you been practicing
your Chinese?

502
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,540
YEAN: Yes, it's because of the staffs.

503
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,540
YEAN: Before LIVE Weibo,

504
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:10,380
YEAN: the staffs told me
that I've got a lot of Chinese fans.

505
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,860
YEAN: So I want to speak Chinese.

506
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,420
YEAN: I want to communicate
with all of my fans.

507
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,620
MIKE: You're very good.

508
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,180
- MIKE: Very good.
- YEAN: Thank you.

509
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,140
MIKE: XUANNING

510
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,180
XUANNING: I'm in the 14th place.

511
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:26,060
XUANNING: I'm quite used to it.

512
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:30,380
XUANNING: To be honest, I still have
a lot of flaws and need to work harder.

513
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,940
XUANNING: Actually,
when I first started learning to dance,

514
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:37,340
XUANNING: I was the one standing
at the edge of the stage.

515
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,900
XUANNING: But after that, I thought to myself
that I had to climb up to the center position.

516
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,420
XUANNING: And I finally made it.

517
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,900
XUANNING: And I came to this show,
standing here today.

518
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,820
XUANNING: It reminds me of myself
who used to stand at the edge of the stage.

519
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:54,580
XUANNING: But now I feel like my attitude
and goals are not the same anymore.

520
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,300
XUANNING: My current goal is

521
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:01,620
XUANNING: I want to be a hard-working
and brave person, that's all.

522
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,620
MIKE: Thank you.

523
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,260
MIKE: Thank you. Keep going.

524
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,140
NENE: Keep going.

525
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:08,980
MIKE: R-JING

526
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,780
R-JING: I would like to thank KRISTA

527
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,740
R-JING: for saving me last time

528
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,860
R-JING: and for giving me an opportunity
to prove myself.

529
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,900
R-JING: So people can notice me,

530
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,940
R-JING: love me and vote for me.

531
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:26,700
R-JING: Thank you for all the votes
that got me here.

532
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:30,100
R-JING: I will make those who already love me
love me even more.

533
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:33,780
R-JING: And for those who still
don't love me or haven't noticed me yet,

534
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,900
R-JING: I will make them love me
and notice me.

535
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,820
R-JING: I also hope that I will make it
into the Top nine next time.

536
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,220
R-JING: Thank you.

537
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,660
- NENE: You can do it.
- MIKE: I'm looking forward to it.

538
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,340
- R-JING: Thank you.
- MIKE: Keep going.

539
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,340
MIKE: LISSA

540
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,300
LISSA: I've waited for this show
for two years now.

541
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,780
LISSA: Almost 700 days
that I've been waiting.

542
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,780
LISSA: Oh, I'm gonna cry again.

543
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,740
LISSA: So, I'm now half way
through the game.

544
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:02,380
LISSA: The goal is so close,
but yet so far.

545
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,220
LISSA: I imagine myself sometimes up there

546
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,860
LISSA: as I'm one of the Top nine.

547
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,060
LISSA: I imagine myself debuting.

548
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,860
LISSA: But what I can imagine is
how tiring it must have been for...

549
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,980
LISSA: Don't cry.

550
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,180
LISSA: I'm standing right here today.

551
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,380
LISSA: So, I promise you I won't waste
this opportunity.

552
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,740
LISSA: I will keep showing myself.

553
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,340
LISSA: I will keep proving myself.

554
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:26,784
LISSA: So...

555
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:33,100
LISSA: Let's show them how strong
the green family is!

556
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,380
TRAINEES: Yeah! Whoo!

557
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,060
LISSA: There's so many green in the world.

558
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,380
LISSA: But there's only one
little lucky green girl, LISSA.

559
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,140
LISSA: That never betrays her dream.

560
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,780
LISSA: I will never betray my dream.

561
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:50,020
LISSA: I will never betray my fans.

562
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,500
LISSA: Let me debut. Let's debut together!

563
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,540
TRAINEES: Okay.

564
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,100
- TRAINEES: Well said.
- LISSA: Thank you.

565
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,100
MIKE: Thank you, LISSA.

566
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,860
CHACHA: I want to tell LISSA that
whenever I feel sad

567
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,140
CHACHA: Or feel like I'm at a dead end,

568
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,780
CHACHA: You will always be
the first person I go to.

569
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,420
CHACHA: And I want to be that person
for you too.

570
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,460
CHACHA: No matter what happens,

571
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,340
CHACHA: I want her to feel like
she can always let me know.

572
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,420
CHACHA: I love LISSA.

573
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,980
JEFF: I was genuinely surprised.

574
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,420
JEFF: The positions really fluctuated.

575
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,100
JEFF: From last week to this week,

576
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,940
JEFF: you wouldn't know
the results would turn out like this.

577
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,660
JEFF: We've seen people ranked higher

578
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,900
JEFF: and some lower.

579
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,060
JEFF: With the positions that are
highly competitive

580
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,860
JEFF: like first, second,
third, and fourth position,

581
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,620
JEFF: it gets really intense.

582
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,180
JEFF: Okay.

583
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:46,340
JEFF: We'll continue with
announcement of the ranking.

584
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,100
JEFF: Are you okay?

585
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,900
TRAINEES: Yes.

586
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,020
JEFF: I'm not okay.

587
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,580
JEFF: Just kidding.

588
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,180
JEFF: Okay, okay.

589
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:00,700
JEFF: So, who wants to know your ranking?

590
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,860
TRAINEE: EMMA and WANG KE.

591
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,300
TRAINEE: XUEYAO.

592
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,900
TRAINEE: Yes, everybody
has raised their hands.

593
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,420
MIKE: Probably everyone.

594
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,060
- JEFF: Everyone?
- MIKE: They need to know their ranking today.

595
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,180
- JEFF: Okay.
- MIKE: Who wants to know first, right?

596
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,020
- JEFF: Yes, who wants to know.
- MIKE: Who wants to know first?

597
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,140
JEFF: Everybody can raise your hand.

598
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,060
JEFF: You raise your hands
and you look over here.

599
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,540
JEFF: Because...LISSA

600
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:34,700
JEFF: whose of your friends
would you want to know the ranking?

601
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,300
MIKE: Oh, the green girl gets to choose.

602
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,340
LISSA: Yay.

603
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:50,900
MIKE: LISSA, I want to know
my ranking, too. What's my ranking?

604
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,140
JEFF: Zero. Go away.

605
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,220
TRAINEE: "Zero. Go away."

606
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:03,340
JEFF: LISSA, so, you'll get a chance
to announce your friend's ranking.

607
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,940
TRAINEE: LISSA.

608
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,100
JEFF: You think of a name
and you describe her.

609
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,380
JEFF: Okay. So, go on.

610
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:23,620
LISSA: So, this friend of mine that
I never thought I'd be friends with her.

611
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:27,300
LISSA: Because at first,
I was kind of scared of her.

612
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,140
LISSA: Because I didn't know
her personality.

613
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,940
LISSA: But once you get to know her,

614
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,460
LISSA: you'll fall in love with her.

615
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,060
LISSA: Because she's such
an admirable person.

616
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:38,060
LISSA: She's so kind.
She has such a pure heart.

617
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:41,140
LISSA: So, I want her
to be one of the Top nine.

618
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:48,020
JEFF: In each of the envelope, there's
your friend's ranking. It's here.

619
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,660
TRAINEES: What?!

620
00:37:54,180 --> 00:38:00,140
JEFF: So, you go to the envelope
of your friend's

621
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,180
TRAINEE: Seriously?

622
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,220
JEFF: that you'd like to pick.

623
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,660
TRAINEES: Oh, my God.

624
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,020
EYLN: Her friend, and I was like...

625
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,460
ELYN: LISSA, choose me. That's me.

626
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,780
JEFF: Okay, open the locker.

627
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,100
TRAINEE: So excited.

628
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,460
JEFF: Okay.

629
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:49,460
JEFF: So, inside this envelope
is the ranking.

630
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,860
- JEFF: Are you ready?
- LISSA: Yes.

631
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,840
LISSA: ELYN, what's
your ranking right now?

632
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,280

- LISSA: Five.

633
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,240

your new ranking.

634
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,560
LISSA: Will you go up?
Stay at the same place?

635
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,480
ELYN: Will I?

636
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,760
LISSA: Or will you go down?
I hope you go up.

637
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,000
TRAINEE: Mentor LISSA.

638
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,200
JEFF: Mentor LISSA, let's go.

639
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,320
TRAINEES: Oh, my God.

640
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:35,440
LISSA: In the previous elimination,
you ranked fifth place.

641
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,424
LISSA: In this elimination,
your rank has gone...

642
00:39:41,632 --> 00:39:43,104
LISSA: up.

643
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,720
LISSA: Congratulations,
your new rank is...

644
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,240
LISSA: four.

645
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,600
LISSA: I wanted to know.
ELYN deserves to stand there

646
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,000
LISSA: with confidence and pride

647
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,240
LISSA: because she actually
really deserves it.

648
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,680
ELYN: I'm so happy since
I have stepped up one ranking this time.

649
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,936
ELYN: I want to thank you
for supporting and voting for me

650
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,520
ELYN: making me still standing on stage.

651
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:32,160
ELYN: In the next performance,
I will choose a different style

652
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,520
ELYN: to impress everyone. And...

653
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,640
ELYN: thank you for supporting me.

654
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:45,000
ELYN: I know it's hard to vote
because of the many steps.

655
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:51,520
ELYN: So, I'll keep trying to give you
the best performances.

656
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,480

657

00:41:07,008 --> 00:41:10,336
JEFF: So, now,
you give your mic to R-JING.

661
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,800
TRAINEE: R-JING

662
00:41:15,136 --> 00:41:15,968
TRAINEES: Oh, my God.

663
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,880
JEFF: R-JING, look at your friends.

664
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,240
R-JING: Oh, my God.

665
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,720
JEFF: Which one of your friends
do you want to know their ranking?

666
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:34,000
R-JING: The person I want to know
their ranking most is like my daughter

667
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,920
- R-JING: whom I...
- JEFF: How old are you?

668
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,920
R-JING: Twenty. But I've only
raised her for a couple of months.

669
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,960
- MIKE: A couple of months?
- R-JING: Yes.

670
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,240
MIKE: What have you been raising her with?

671
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,520
R-JING: We just sleep next to each other.

672
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,560
JEFF: So, come to the lockers.

673
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,360
- TRAINEE: KRISTA
- KRISTA: R-JING

674
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,360
R-JING: My daughter,

675
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,640
R-JING: in the previous elimination,
you ranked ninth place.

676
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:27,200
R-JING: In this elimination,
your rank has gone...

677
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,400
R-JING: up.

678
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,840
R-JING: Congratulations,
your new rank is...

679
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:42,960
R-JING: eight.

680
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,720
- KRISTA: Mama.
- R-JING: I'm so proud of you.

681
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,800
MIKE: So, KRISTA is R-JING's daughter.

682
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,680
- KRISTA: R-JING SHIM.
- MIKE: R-JING SHIM. Okay.

683
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,040
- KRISTA: R-JING SHIM.
- MIKE: R-JING SHIM.

684
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,320
MIKE: KRISTA SHIM. Okay.

685
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,800
JEFF: Congratulations, KRISTA

686
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,560
KRISTA: I ranked eighth
from today's results.

687
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,080
KRISTA: I was so surprised.

688
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:13,280
KRISTA: But I was also happy that
everyone finally recognized me.

689
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:17,120
KRISTA: I'm so happy to still be here

690
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,560
KRISTA: and be able to perform again.

691
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:19,600
KRISTA: and be able to perform again.

692
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,824
KRISTA: Thank you so much.

693
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,560
MIKE: Thank you KRISTA. Thank you.

694
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,840
JEFF: So, XUANNING please come down here.

695
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,640
JEFF: Look at your friends,

696
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,040
- JEFF: think of their name,
- TRAINEE: XUEYAO

697
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,480
JEFF: and then you describe her.

698
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,640
XUANNING: I don't think
I have to describe what she's like.

699
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,880
XUANNING: Because XUEYAO
is my best friend,

700
00:43:40,768 --> 00:43:41,840
XUANNING: that's why I'll choose her.

701
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,440
- WANG KE: XUEYAO
- XUEYAO: I'm not ready.

702
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,200
YUAN KE: You got this. You got this!

703
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,160
XUEYAO: I don't want to know my ranking.
I'm afraid it won't be as expected.

704
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:58,520
XUEYAO: That means,
my ranking my be worse.

705
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,280
XUANNING: I want to...

706
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,000
XUANNING: Sweetie, you're placed 11th.

707
00:44:11,744 --> 00:44:13,200
TRAINEES: You're placed 11th.

708
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,520
TRAINEES: TIAN XUANNING

709
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,440
XUANNING: I didn't want you to wait.

710
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,240
XUANNING: I wanted to tell her right away.

711
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:31,040
XUANNING: I knew you really wanted
to know. I didn't want you to...

712
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,600
XUEYAO: Your makeup is ruined.

713
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:44,600
XUANNING: They wanted me to announce
slowly. So, I read through the script.

714
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,000
XUANNING: Oh! Rank 11.

715
00:44:46,656 --> 00:44:48,960
XUANNING: XUEYAO ranked 11.

716
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,640
XUANNING: She's stepping up another step.

717
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,200
XUANNING: XUEYAO ranked 11.

718
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:02,560
XUANNING: I think everyone,
if they were her, would be so happy.

719
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,240
XUEYAO: I broke out in tears.

720
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,640
XUEYAO: At the time,
I wanted to say I love TIAN XUANNING.

721
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,960
XUEYAO: I love you the most.

722
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,640
XUEYAO: Like this.

723
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,480
XUEYAO: I am so happy.

724
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,200
XUEYAO: At first, I never thought I would
still be in the show, but here I am.

725
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,920
XUEYAO: I'm so excited.
It feels like I'm dreaming.

726
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,560
XUEYAO: I didn't think I'd jump
from being in the 23rd place to 11th.

727
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,040
NENE: The 23rd place is XUEYAO.

728
00:45:31,584 --> 00:45:33,080
XUANNING: Sweetie, you're placed 11th.

729
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,560
XUEYAO: I truly never thought
I would rank this high before.

730
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,640
XUEYAO: I never had such a hope.

731
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:45,520
JEFF: XUEYAO, just want to say
congratulations. It's 23th to 11th.

732
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,440
MIKE: Congratulations, congratulations.

733
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,480
JEFF: Okay.

734
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,480
JEFF: So, we're moving to
the next person. It's YEAN.

735
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,320
JEFF: Please come down here.

736
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,000
MIKE: Who will YEAN choose?

737
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,320
YEAN: It's...

738
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,880
JEFF: Please spike up the suspense.

739
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,120
VITA: No.

740
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,640
VITA: PANDA PANDA PANDA
PANDA PANDA, Please.

741
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,320
TRAINEE: PANDA

742
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,520
JEFF: Okay. So, it's PANDA.

743
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,320
- TRAINEE: PANDA
- TRAINEE: Oh, PANDA.

744
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,960
- TRAINEE: VITA is below that locker.
- TRAINEE: PANDA with black eyes.

745
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:41,800
TRAINEE: Yes.

746
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,960
TRAINEE: Please keep up the energy.

747
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:55,720
YEAN: PANDA,

748
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:05,840
YEAN: in the previous elimination,
you ranking 31 place.

749
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:16,800
YEAN: In this elimination, your ranking...

750
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,200
YEAN: down.

751
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,080
YEAN: Your new ranking is 35.

752
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,920
PANDA: It's okay.

753
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,040
JEFF: Unfortunately, you didn't
advance to the next round.

754
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,600
JEFF: Thank you, PANDA.

755
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,120
- PANDA: Don't cry.
- VITA: Don't cry.

756
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,160
JEFF: Thank you, PANDA.

757
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,280
JEFF: Okay, so, the next person is RUAN.

758
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,440
JEFF: Your choice of friend...

759
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:59,640
RUAN: She's the one I want to debut with.
She's also a sister that I really love.

760
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,240
RUAN: You might know
who I'm talking about.

761
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:15,280
RUAN: In the previous elimination,
you ranked 22nd place.

762
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,440
RUAN: In this elimination,
your rank has gone...

763
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,440
RUAN: up.

764
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,200
RUAN: I'm so happy.

765
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,840
RUAN: Congratulations, your new rank is

766
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,880
RUAN: three.

767
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,320
JEFF: Congratulations, WANG KE.

768
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:55,280
JEFF: So, you're the highest gain of
the ranking in this stage,

769
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,160
JEFF: From 22 to a third place.

770
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,640
JEFF: It's up 19 in ranking.

771
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,720
JEFF: So, congratulations!

772
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,200
NENE: Congratulations.

773
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,624
MIKE: Congratulations, congratulations.

774
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,240
RUAN: In the last elimination,
WANG KE was ranked 22nd.

775
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,440
RUAN: But this time she ranked third.

776
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,920
RUAN: That's moving up 19 places.

777
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,320
RUAN: I think she's really suitable
to be my older sister.

778
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,600
RUAN: She did a really great job.

779
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:26,080
QIAO YI YU: Actually, RUAN and WANG KE
are the same type of people.

780
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:30,240
QIAO YI YU: They have long strived
to be in the industry.

781
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,680
QIAO YI YU: Their dream is
to be in a girl group.

782
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:38,600
QIAO YI YU: So, I'm really happy for them
for ranking so high in this program.

783
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:45,440
QIAO YI YU: I said that it was unlikely
for WANG KE to be ranked in the 20's

784
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,880
QIAO YI YU: and that
she should be in Top nine.

785
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:52,960
QIAO YI YU: Her jump
to the third place is reasonable.

786
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,480
WANG KE: For many years, I practiced
in a room in the basement abroad.

787
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,840
WANG KE: I practiced alone
in a small room.

788
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,360
WANG KE: I used to feel like
I was only a speck of dust.

789
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,640
WANG KE: But thanks to all of my fans
who gave me warmth and energy,

790
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:17,480
WANG KE: they make me believe
that I can shine as brightly.

791
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:24,160
WANG KE: From now on,
I want to be the sun.

792
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,480
WANG KE: to give them warmth and energy.

793
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,312
WANG KE: The fact that I'm ranked third,

794
00:50:29,632 --> 00:50:32,736
WANG KE: after having been
chasing my dream for six years,

795
00:50:32,736 --> 00:50:35,000
WANG KE: I am finally going to win.

796
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:36,720
WANG KE: Really.

797
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,080
WANG KE: This time, we'll try our best.

798
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,600
WANG KE: And this time,
we will cross the finish line.

799
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,680
DIDI: Yes.

800
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:48,360
WANG KE: I want to thank my family
for always supporting me

801
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,920
WANG KE: and making me like
I'm not fighting here along.

802
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,360
WANG KE: Because of the support from you,
I gained my confidence and the spirit

803
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,080
WANG KE: that made me

804
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:03,120
WANG KE: stand straight
and walk steadily forward.

805
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,640
WANG KE: I know people might think

806
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,320
WANG KE: that by being diligent doesn't
mean that you'll get anything in return.

807
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:11,560
WANG KE: Since I've been here,
many people wondered

808
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,912
WANG KE: why no one ever noticed them
despite their diligence to train.

809
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:19,400
WANG KE: I want to tell you that
determination is the key to success.

810
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,840
WANG KE: As long as we keep trying,

811
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,920
WANG KE: there's nothing we can't do.

812
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,440
WANG KE: You'll see the result
of your hard work, for sure.

813
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,280
WANG KE: Let's go, everyone!

814
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,040
JEFF: Okay.

815
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,840
JEFF: The last one here.
Are you ready, QIAO YI YU?

816
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,680
QIAO YI YU: This is really hard to pick.

817
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,600
QIAO YI YU: I got more than one friends.

818
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,488
- JEFF: Me, too. Me, too.
- QIAO YI YU: It's really hard to pick.

819
00:51:51,488 --> 00:51:56,760
QIAO YI YU: But there's one girl
who raised her hand so high

820
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,160
QIAO YI YU: that I can't ignore.

821
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,048
QIAO YI YU: And she's even
stand in the middle.

822
00:52:02,944 --> 00:52:03,616
QIAO YI YU: It's...

823
00:52:06,816 --> 00:52:07,648
MIKE: Ah.

824
00:52:07,648 --> 00:52:08,560
- MIKE: EMMA
- JEFF: Okay.

825
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,656
MIKE: EMMA.

826
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:18,480
QIAO YI YU: In the previous elimination,
you ranked 15th place.

827
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:24,160
QIAO YI YU: In this elimination,
your rank has gone...

828
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,960
QIAO YI YU: has gone...

829
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,840
QIAO YI YU: has gone...

830
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:30,528
QIAO YI YU: up.

831
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:39,960
QIAO YI YU: Congratulations,
your new rank is...

832
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:43,560
QIAO YI YU: seven.

833
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,560
- TRAINEES: Yay.

834
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,840

835
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,280
- EMMA: Keep going.
- QIAO YI YU: Keep going.

836
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,840
TRAINEES: Congratulations.

837
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,160
- EMMA: Which rank again?
- WANG KE: Seven.

838
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,560
EMMA: My rank has finally gone up.
That's incredible!

839
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,760
EMMA: Finally stepping up. Good.

840
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:12,200
EMMA: I thought my rank would
lower to around the 10th place.

841
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,440
EMMA: First of all, I'm so happy

842
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,840
EMMA: that more people have seen me
and for ranking higher.

843
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,280
EMMA: Thank you, everyone.

844
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,320
EMMA: Please give me a lot of compliments.

845
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,640
EMMA: Because, when you
compliment me, I shine brighter.

846
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,160
EMMA: I will shine even brighter.

847
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,000
DIDI: Bright!

848
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,320
EMMA: Thank you.

849
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,280
NENE: All the previous Top nine
in the last ranking,

850
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,320
NENE: please come to the announcing area.

851
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,200
MIKE: Ranking number four, DIDI.

852
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,680
DIDI: Thank you.
(First Elimination, Top Four)

853
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,360
MIKE: Ranking number three is RINKA.

854
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,160
(First Elimination, Top Three)

855
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,880
JACKSON: Rank Two, LU YUTING

856
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,480
JACKSON: LU YUTING
(First Elimination, Top Two)

857
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,800
JACKSON: Number One, PAILIU.

858
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,520
(First Elimination, Top One)

859
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:16,280
NENE: The four of you are in the top nine
from the first elimination announcement.

860
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:22,360
NENE: But I have to say there's only
one of you that still remains in Top Nine.

861
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,240
NENE: Do you think if that's you?

862
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,040
NENE: DIDI.

863
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:40,080
DIDI: I'm a person who
doesn't have high hopes.

864
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,440
DIDI: So, I think

865
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,040
DIDI: whatever the ranking is,
I'll go with it.

866
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,320
DIDI: And then I don't regret at all,

867
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:50,240
DIDI: because I push myself
for all in my last stages.

868
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:53,880
DIDI: So, I think whatever the ranking is,
I'll take it.

869
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,440
TRAINEES: DIDI

870
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,640
LU YUTING: Actually, I think the ranking
isn't important that much.

871
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,480
LU YUTING: But, I would like to show
more of myself to everyone.

872
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,320
LU YUTING: I don't want to be eliminated
in this round.

873
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:11,424
LU YUTING: I hope I can stay.

874
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:18,200
PAILIU: Actually, I don't hope that
I will remain in the top nine.

875
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,600
PAILIU: And I don't hope
about what ranking I have to be.

876
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,480
PAILIU: I hope that I can pass
to just one more round. That's enough.

877
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:30,560
RINKA: In the last round,
I was in the top nine,

878
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,880
RINKA: until now I still can't believe it.

879
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,280
RINKA: I'm really surprised.

880
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,840
RINKA: I can't confidently say
that I will be able to stay.

881
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,920
RINKA: But if I could still stay,

882
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,280
RINKA: I would feel very happy.

883
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:50,600
NENE: So, RINKA,
what is your ranking right now?

884
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,000
RINKA: Three.

885
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:57,560
NENE: So, what ranking do you think?

886
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,080
RINKA: Last time

887
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,760
RINKA: well… I was called by the mentor

888
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,680
RINKA: and asked how I felt.

889
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,120
RINKA: And suddenly they told me that
my rank was three.

890
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:16,720
RINKA: This time I was asked
the same question, so I was very excited.

891
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:24,120
RINKA: I myself don't know why.

892
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,720
RINKA: I really want to stay
in the top nine,

893
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:33,640
RINKA: but this time I feel like
I won't be in the top nine anymore.

894
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,600
NENE: So, I have to say

895
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:41,560
NENE: Unfortunately,
you're not in top nine,

896
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,160
NENE: but the ranking is twentieth.

897
00:56:51,264 --> 00:56:52,704
MIKE: Congratulations.

898
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,320
TRAINEES: Good job.

899
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,760
TRAINEES: Very good, very good.

900
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,920
DIDI: Little butterfly, RINKA.

901
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,968
RINKA: Hello, everyone.
I'm everyone's RINKA.

902
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,520
JASMINE: RINKA.

903
00:57:07,168 --> 00:57:09,056
RINKA: I hope I get to debut.

904
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,520
RINKA: Thank you everyone
for supporting me.

905
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,984
RINKA: I love you all.

906
00:57:16,544 --> 00:57:17,888
RINKA: Even though my rank is twentieth,

907
00:57:17,888 --> 00:57:19,400
RINKA: I'll keep trying

908
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,192
RINKA: and trying hard

909
00:57:20,192 --> 00:57:23,520
RINKA: in order to return to the top nine.

910
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,640
RINKA: Please help to support me, including
the members from LOVE ME LIKE YOU DO.

911
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:31,440
RINKA: They really helped me improve
a lot from before.

912
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,248
RINKA: Thank you so much.

913
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,960
RINKA: Love you. Muah Muah.

914
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,144
RINKA: Thank you. It's RINKA.

915
00:57:39,232 --> 00:57:40,920
RINKA: To say it frankly,

916
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,760
RINKA: for me,

917
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,840
RINKA: when performing LOVE ME LIKE YOU DO
in the second stage,

918
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,760
RINKA: I felt I wasn't enough competent.

919
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:55,280
RINKA: But, I think I can try to climb up
to a higher rank

920
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,880
RINKA: I'll be determined
as well as thinking positive

921
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,000
RINKA: in order to return to the top nine.

922
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,216
RINKA: I will try harder.

923
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:04,992
NENE: DIDI.

924
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:06,400
DIDI: Yeah.

925
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,416
NENE: How many letters in your name?

926
00:58:08,992 --> 00:58:09,856
DIDI: Four.

927
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,760
NENE: Four?

928
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,560
DIDI: Ah, you mean my name?

929
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,200
DIDI: It's also four.

930
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,688
NENE: How about today?

931
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:25,800
DIDI: I was guessing I think
I was like in between ten to fifteen.

932
00:58:26,144 --> 00:58:28,160
DIDI: Yeah, that's my guess. Yeah.

933
00:58:29,696 --> 00:58:31,200
NENE: Unfortunately.

934
00:58:34,528 --> 00:58:35,616
NENE: Unfortunately,

935
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,528
NENE: you're not in the top nine.

936
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,744
NENE: But your ranking is fifteenth.

937
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,120
DIDI: Oh, I was right.

938
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,160
MIKE: You guessed right.

939
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,440
MIKE: Excellent.

940
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,384
TRAINEES: DIDI

941
00:58:57,568 --> 00:58:59,712
TRAINEES: Lucky guess.

942
00:58:59,712 --> 00:59:01,152
TRAINEES: Really good.

943
00:59:01,152 --> 00:59:02,432
DIDI: I'm good at guessing.

944
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,240
DIDI: Hello, everyone.

945
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,440
DIDI: Hello, everyone.
My name is OUYANG DIDI.

946
00:59:09,568 --> 00:59:13,720
DIDI: Even though I'm out of the top nine,
I'm still really happy.

947
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,880
DIDI: Because there are still many people
voting for me.

948
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,880
DIDI: Even though I lacked for a few more
votes to stand together with my friends,

949
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:26,520
DIDI: I'm really happy that EMMA and KEKE
made it into the top nine,

950
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,840
DIDI: and can get the red outfits.

951
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,720
DIDI: I'm really happy for them.

952
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:36,256
DIDI: And I want to thank all the fans
who loved and voted for me.

953
00:59:36,256 --> 00:59:38,280
DIDI: I'm very happy.

954
00:59:38,656 --> 00:59:42,320
DIDI: Thank everyone for voting for DIDI.

955
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:46,208
DIDI: My friends told me that
DIDI is like sunshine,

956
00:59:47,328 --> 00:59:49,312
DIDI: sunshine for everyone.

957
00:59:49,312 --> 00:59:52,320
DIDI: But today, everyone is...

958
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,920
- DIDI: sun...
- JAOYING: (sunshine)

959
00:59:53,960 --> 01:00:00,288
DIDI: DIDI's sunshine.

960
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,800
TRAINEES: Love you, DIDI.

961
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:06,440
DIDI: I think that I did actually
quite good on my second stage.

962
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:10,720
DIDI: But I saw so many girls
shine on stage so much.

963
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,080
DIDI: So, I feel like

964
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:15,160
DIDI: I need to do better
in my third stage

965
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:20,800
DIDI: to be able to like more audiences
to see me shine and vote for me

966
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:32,400
NENE: LU YUTING, your rank is two, right?

967
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,312
LU YUTING: Yes.

968
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,200
NENE: How about today? What do you think?

969
01:00:36,896 --> 01:00:42,720
LU YUTING: Now there are not
many positions left in the top nine,

970
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:49,024
LU YUTING: so I think I may be
in the sixteenth rank.

971
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:55,320
NENE: Sorry, it's not sixteenth.

972
01:00:57,952 --> 01:00:59,200
NENE: It's tenth.

973
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,480
MIKE: Congratulations, congratulations.

974
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,680
LU YUTING: Hello, everyone. I'm LU YUTING.

975
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:18,520
LU YUTING: Thank you for supporting me.
Because of you guys, I can go on walking.

976
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:21,400
LU YUTING: And I thank those
who don't like me too.

977
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:24,384
LU YUTING: I accept everyone's criticism
from right here.

978
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,000
LU YUTING: Actually, after I participated
in this show,

979
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,136
LU YUTING: I've received
a lot of objections.

980
01:01:31,456 --> 01:01:32,400
LU YUTING: Everyone said that

981
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,480
LU YUTING: "Who is LU YUTING?"

982
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,280
LU YUTING: "Why did she get
the second rank?"

983
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,880
LU YUTING: Honestly, I don't know
who could stand in my shoes

984
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:43,520
LU YUTING: and witness this fear
and helplessness.

985
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:47,240
LU YUTING: If I got to debut,
people would say that

986
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,560
LU YUTING: it's all because of her family
who makes her stand where she wants to be,

987
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,200
LU YUTING: to fly comfortably.

988
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:54,000
LU YUTING: But if I couldn't debut,

989
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,200
LU YUTING: they would say it was because
my ability was too poor.

990
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,120
LU YUTING: The dream has started

991
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:59,960
LU YUTING: but in the end
it couldn't be sustained.

992
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,944
LU YUTING: Actually, being the GIRL GROUP
is always my dream.

993
01:02:03,104 --> 01:02:06,120
LU YUTING: From the performances
in the first and second stages,

994
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:11,424
LU YUTING: the audience cheered
and applauded me.

995
01:02:11,424 --> 01:02:14,528
LU YUTING: Even though there are only
a few people cheering for me,

996
01:02:15,456 --> 01:02:16,256
LU YUTING: I do believe

997
01:02:16,450 --> 01:02:21,792
LU YUTING: life isn't about waiting for the storm
to pass, but learning how to live with it.

998
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:25,330
LU YUTING: I knew I have many weak points.

999
01:02:25,330 --> 01:02:26,210
LU YUTING: But,

1000
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:27,776
LU YUTING: this is my chance.

1001
01:02:27,776 --> 01:02:29,504
LU YUTING: No matter how many
questions I was asked,

1002
01:02:29,504 --> 01:02:31,520
LU YUTING: but I will keep fighting

1003
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:34,112
LU YUTING: and reaching higher ranks

1004
01:02:34,112 --> 01:02:36,850
LU YUTING: to shine in my own way.

1005
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:42,410
LU YUTING: To the Thai fans,
please support me a lot

1006
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:45,530
LU YUTING: and cheer me a lot too.

1007
01:02:45,984 --> 01:02:49,216
LU YUTING: Please continue to support me.

1008
01:02:57,970 --> 01:02:59,410
MIKE: Are you lonely there?

1009
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:01,570
NENE: There are the fifth and ninth left.

1010
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:04,250
NENE: PAILIU, do you think
what is your ranking?

1011
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:07,290
TRAINEES: Five. The fifth.

1012
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:08,210
TRAINEES: Five. Five. The fifth.

1013
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:11,930
TRAINEES: Five. Five. Five. Five. Five.

1014
01:03:13,610 --> 01:03:15,090
PAILIU: Actually, any rank is alright.

1015
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:18,850
PAILIU: But my friends said five,
so I'll say five first.

1016
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:20,370
TRAINEES: Yeah.

1017
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:22,810
NENE: It's good to listen to your friends.
Your rank number is five. Congratulations.

1018
01:03:26,770 --> 01:03:27,810
MIKE: Congratulations.

1019
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:28,770
MIKE: Congratulations, congratulations.

1020
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:30,570
ILENE: You go to the fifth.

1021
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:32,490
NENE: Congratulations.

1022
01:03:36,370 --> 01:03:37,530
PAILIU: First of all,

1023
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:39,650
PAILIU: PAILIU has to say that
I don't feel sad at all that...

1024
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:41,930
PAILIU: at first I was in the first rank,
and then came down to the fifth rank.

1025
01:03:41,970 --> 01:03:45,730
PAILIU: And I want to tell all my fans
you don't have to be sad and disappointed

1026
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:47,970
PAILIU: that I'm in the fifth rank today.

1027
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:49,690
PAILIU: I want everyone to be
very proud of yourselves

1028
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:52,010
PAILIU: because I'm very proud of everyone.

1029
01:03:52,010 --> 01:03:56,610
PAILIU: Because I knew that everyone
will have to sacrifice many things for me.

1030
01:03:56,610 --> 01:03:59,890
PAILIU: I want everyone to trust me.
Believe in me.

1031
01:03:59,930 --> 01:04:03,170
PAILIU: And time will prove everything.

1032
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:07,530
PAILIU: My Chinese fans, are you tired?

1033
01:04:07,570 --> 01:04:10,490
PAILIU: I want to thank you all.

1034
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:15,250
PAILIU: I knew that I'm not the best,

1035
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:18,930
PAILIU: but I'll try my best.

1036
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:20,490
PAILIU: So... believe in me.

1037
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:23,570
PAILIU: I want to tell everyone
and I want to tell myself too.

1038
01:04:23,570 --> 01:04:25,330
PAILIU: People don't have to like you.

1039
01:04:25,330 --> 01:04:28,570
PAILIU: People don't have to love you
and people don't have to respect you.

1040
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:30,610
PAILIU: But when you're looking
in the mirror,

1041
01:04:30,610 --> 01:04:32,970
PAILIU: you have to love yourself.

1042
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:35,770
PAILIU: You have to like yourself
and you have to respect yourself.

1043
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:36,930
PAILIU: Thank you.

1044
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:45,210
PAILIU: My opinion about my first rank
is replaced, right?

1045
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:51,850
PAILIU: Actually, I didn't think much
of anything from my true feeling.

1046
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:53,810
PAILIU: But if asking me if I regret it,
I regret it.

1047
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:56,250
PAILIU: But I still feel that

1048
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:59,850
PAILIU: if today I dropped
to the rank fifth, right?

1049
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:03,370
PAILIU: there are still many things
that I may need to improve myself a lot

1050
01:05:03,370 --> 01:05:06,810
PAILIU: in order to develop myself,
to prove everyone that

1051
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:10,410
PAILIU: I'm actually suitable for being
in one of the first three rankings.

1052
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:13,090
PAILIU: Another thing is that I feel that

1053
01:05:13,090 --> 01:05:16,970
PAILIU: for QIAO YI YU, she deserves
the first place.

1054
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:17,890
PAILIU: That's it.

1055
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:25,010
ILENE: It's almost full.

1056
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:28,330
- ILENE: It's almost full.
- MINGMING: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 11

1057
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:30,690
- ILENE: Will there be a place for me?
- MINGMING: Fifteen people.

1058
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:32,770
MIKE: Okay. So, ...

1059
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:38,570
LILIANA LI: Who's number nine?

1060
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:40,570
AKINA: Perhaps, it's LILIANA LI.

1061
01:05:46,530 --> 01:05:47,610
MIKE: As you guys can see.

1062
01:05:48,770 --> 01:05:52,930
MIKE: There's only one spot left
in the top nine.

1063
01:05:55,730 --> 01:06:00,690
MIKE: This trainee has never been
in the top nine before,

1064
01:06:00,810 --> 01:06:03,730
MIKE: and never been the center.

1065
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:05,970
PAILIU: PRAEW.

1066
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:07,850
PAILIU: ILENE.

1067
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:09,850
ILENE: LILIANA.

1068
01:06:10,170 --> 01:06:11,650
MIKE: She is...

1069
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:15,490
MIKE: very good at dancing.

1070
01:06:17,130 --> 01:06:18,810
JASMINE: Or PRAEW?

1071
01:06:18,810 --> 01:06:20,850
ILENE: Never been in top nine before.

1072
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:22,370
MIKE: On the second stage

1073
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:27,970
MIKE: she performed in Vocal position.

1074
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:29,890
MAMCÙ: ACARE.

1075
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:35,530
MIKE: How do you guys even know?

1076
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:37,610
MIKE: I just said vocal.

1077
01:06:37,690 --> 01:06:39,490
- TEGAN: and good at dance.
- JAOYING: and good at dance.

1078
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:40,490
LILIANA LI: and good at dance.

1079
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:42,890
MIKE: Yeah, but I mean you guys
are all good at dancing.

1080
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:45,570
MIKE: Like, it is my standard.

1081
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:52,970
MIKE: Okay. Who performed vocal position
on the second stage? Raise your hand up?

1082
01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:57,930
MIKE: Okay. Okay.

1083
01:06:58,330 --> 01:07:00,890
MIKE: Okay. So, there's a lot, right?

1084
01:07:01,970 --> 01:07:05,170
MIKE: Okay. The last top nine...

1085
01:07:10,010 --> 01:07:11,330
AKINA: Who is it?

1086
01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:14,890
MIKE: ILENE. ILENE.

1087
01:07:17,970 --> 01:07:19,690
RUAN: My favorite.

1088
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:24,130
ILENE: It's nine, bro?

1089
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:27,450
ILENE: Nine is something like...
I'm already in the top nine.

1090
01:07:40,530 --> 01:07:42,010
ILENE: Oh, my God.

1091
01:07:42,090 --> 01:07:43,490
MINGMING: I'm really proud.

1092
01:07:43,530 --> 01:07:45,890
MINGMING: Looking at ILENE,
I really felt touched.

1093
01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:47,250
MINGMING: I also looked at PRAEW too.

1094
01:07:47,290 --> 01:07:51,130
MINGMING: Three of us made eyes contact
to each other. It's very profound.

1095
01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:53,410
ILENE: I'm in Top Nine?

1096
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:56,450
TRAINEES: So good job.

1097
01:07:56,690 --> 01:07:59,850
MIKE: ILENE is the one who has
ranked up the most.

1098
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:02,210
- MIKE: From twenty-eight, right?
- ILENE: Twenty-eight.

1099
01:08:03,530 --> 01:08:04,530
MIKE: You rank up to nine.

1100
01:08:05,410 --> 01:08:07,130
MINGMING: Nineteen ranks.

1101
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:08,050
MINGMING: What a shoo-in!

1102
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:12,570
ACARE: ILENE's ranking also surprised me
that it's suddenly risen to the top nine.

1103
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:14,690
ACARE: But, she's really talented.

1104
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:18,410
ACARE: And in the past performance,
even if it was what she wasn't good at,

1105
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:20,210
ACARE: she could do it very well.

1106
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:23,730
ACARE: And I believe that all the fans saw
how determined she was.

1107
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:25,170
ACARE: And ILENE can do many things.

1108
01:08:25,410 --> 01:08:29,010
ILENE: This time I'm in the ninth rank.

1109
01:08:29,490 --> 01:08:32,170
ILENE: At first, I was very afraid that
there was no one seeing me, wasn't there?

1110
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:32,250
ILENE: But now I got the answer.

1111
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:33,650
ILENE: But now I got the answer.

1112
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:35,130
ILENE: That is I'm in the ninth rank.

1113
