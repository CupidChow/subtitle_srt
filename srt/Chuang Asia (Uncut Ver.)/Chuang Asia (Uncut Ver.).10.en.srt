170
00:17:03,933 --> 00:17:06,300
LISSA: I'll be asking you guys
to vote for me.

171
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:08,448
LISSA: So I'm always at the last place.

172
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,500
LISSA: Some people said
it's because of luck.

173
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,266
LISSA: Some people said
it's because of green.

174
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:14,500
LISSA: But, I think
it's because of my passion

175
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,672
LISSA: and the power of my fans.

176
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,144

177
00:17:19,328 --> 00:17:21,280
LISSA: I've debuted before,

178
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,323

my dream one more time.

and dedicated but stylish girl,

1062
01:16:18,088 --> 01:16:20,364
LU YUTING: LU YUTING. I think
the moment that I stood out was

1063
01:16:20,364 --> 01:16:21,438
LU YUTING: when the ranking was announced.

1064
01:16:21,691 --> 01:16:22,845
JACKSON: LU YUTING

1065
01:16:23,038 --> 01:16:24,849
LU YUTING: In every evaluation,
my ranking is high.

1066
01:16:24,995 --> 01:16:26,225
LU YUTING: 2nd place

1067
01:16:26,334 --> 01:16:27,503
LU YUTING: and 10th place

1068
01:16:27,609 --> 01:16:28,731
LU YUTING: and 16th place.

1069
01:16:28,846 --> 01:16:31,070
LU YUTING: The ranking keeps decreasing,

1070
01:16:31,070 --> 01:16:33,709
LU YUTING: but it's still pretty high.

1071
01:16:34,188 --> 01:16:37,095
LU YUTING: I know everyone has doubted me,

1072
01:16:37,181 --> 01:16:40,112
LU YUTING: but those experiences
will make me grow.

1073
01:16:40,229 --> 01:16:42,809
LU YUTING: This is a way that I can
pursue my dream again.

1074

LU YUTING: If everyone can understand me,
I'd be very happy.

1075
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:47,486
LU YUTING: I'm happy for everyone
to get to know me.

1076
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:50,527
LU YUTING: But if you don't know me yet,

1077
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:53,310
LU YUTING: you can try getting to know me.

1078
01:16:59,358 --> 01:17:03,560
YUANKE: In the AUDITION STAGE,
I got Class F. So, I was very sad.

1079
01:17:05,085 --> 01:17:09,278
YUANKE: Then, in the theme song,

1080
01:17:09,411 --> 01:17:11,406
YUANKE: I worked very hard
as I wanted to move up.

1081
01:17:12,001 --> 01:17:15,758
YUANKE: Even if I was disappointed twice,
I never thought about giving up.

1082
01:17:15,908 --> 01:17:20,558

I got the MVP.

I want to debut.

the distractions,

1445

XUEYAO: limitations or whatever

1446
01:36:33,698 --> 01:36:35,492
XUEYAO: and my self-pressure

1447
01:36:35,636 --> 01:36:37,026
XUEYAO: and let everyone know that

1448
01:36:37,168 --> 01:36:39,547

1450
01:36:42,967 --> 01:36:45,264

I've seen

1451

with a white uniform to a grey uniform

1452
01:36:49,488 --> 01:36:51,170

1457
01:36:57,930 --> 01:37:00,278

1458
01:37:00,502 --> 01:37:03,289

until the last second.

1461

1508
01:39:17,671 --> 01:39:19,152
QIAO YI YU: I was a nobody
that no one knew.

1509
01:39:19,616 --> 01:39:22,717
QIAO YI YU: I was lost and not confident.

1510
01:39:22,820 --> 01:39:25,476

01:39:44,159 --> 01:39:45,328
QIAO YI YU: I became No.1

1519
01:39:45,429 --> 01:39:46,433

1520
01:39:46,568 --> 01:39:49,088

- HOST: There was a split.
- KRATAE: A little bit.

1632
01:50:14,566 --> 01:50:17,646
KRATAE: Just like someone who's almost 40.

1633
01:50:19,224 --> 01:50:23,248
HOST: Age is just a number for KT KRATAE.

1634

02:03:10,146 --> 02:03:11,944
TEN: I want you all

02:03:12,150 --> 02:03:13,183

02:03:16,818 --> 02:03:17,996
TEN: the stage that you're performing,

1790
02:03:18,131 --> 02:03:20,731
TEN: because if we don't enjoy,

1791
02:03:20,837 --> 02:03:23,214
TEN: the audience won't feel it.
I want you all

1792
02:03:23,831 --> 02:03:25,210
TEN: to remember this and...

1793
02:03:25,348 --> 02:03:28,072
TEN: Every time you're on the stage,
please give it your all

1794
02:03:28,202 --> 02:03:31,492
HOST: Right? Even though
there's some pressure or excitemnt,

1795
02:03:31,573 --> 02:03:34,626
HOST: but don't forget
to enjoy every bit of it.

1796
02:03:34,978 --> 02:03:35,389
HOST: JEFF, please.

1797
02:03:35,580 --> 02:03:37,093
JEFF: I'd like to say that

1798
02:03:37,209 --> 02:03:39,669
JEFF: tonight is the debut night,

1799
02:03:39,797 --> 02:03:43,911
JEFF: but not only for
those who get to debut

1800
02:03:44,313 --> 02:03:46,607
JEFF: as international girl group,

1801
02:03:46,726 --> 02:03:52,499
JEFF: but those of you who didn't have
a chance to debut, those of you're here too.

1802
02:03:52,689 --> 02:03:54,333
JEFF: I just wanna say that

1803
02:03:54,333 --> 02:03:56,285
JEFF: this is also a debut night for you

1804
02:03:56,470 --> 02:04:00,288
JEFF: because you're going to go on
and do your things, do you work.

1805
02:04:00,417 --> 02:04:02,044
JEFF: Being an artist as you want.

1806
02:04:03,032 --> 02:04:04,655
JEFF: You're going to find your stage,

1807
02:04:05,023 --> 02:04:06,872
JEFF: and tonight is that night.

1808
02:04:06,988 --> 02:04:08,566
JEFF: So, whatever happens,

1809
02:04:08,710 --> 02:04:10,719
JEFF: don't say it's because of luck.

1810
02:04:10,822 --> 02:04:13,667
JEFF: don't say because of
whatever, whoever.

1811
02:04:13,921 --> 02:04:15,645
JEFF: You deserve everything.

1812
02:04:15,816 --> 02:04:19,796
JEFF: And I'd say that I'm...
don't forget to thank yourself too.

1813
02:04:19,939 --> 02:04:22,430
JEFF: Because you've come this far
because of yourself.

1814
02:04:22,558 --> 02:04:24,881
JEFF: And also to the fans here

1815
02:04:24,973 --> 02:04:26,678
JEFF: that come to support you that I'm...

1816
02:04:26,844 --> 02:04:31,677
JEFF: at their houses too.
Just... I wish you the best in the world.

1817
02:04:31,677 --> 02:04:32,398
JEFF: Thank you.

1818
02:04:33,309 --> 02:04:34,536
HOST: Thank you JEFF.

1819
02:04:35,165 --> 02:04:35,786
HOST: NENE, please.

1820
02:04:36,215 --> 02:04:37,492
NENE: Hello, ladies.

1821
02:04:38,606 --> 02:04:43,515
NENE: So, tonight is tonight
and the one thing that I want to remind you,

1822
02:04:43,641 --> 02:04:48,985
NENE: myself also.
As a friend, as your sister,

1823
02:04:49,152 --> 02:04:52,279
NENE: as your mentor, is that

1824
02:04:52,963 --> 02:04:55,566
NENE: don't question yourself.

1825
02:04:55,708 --> 02:04:57,144
NENE: don't doubt yourself.

1826
02:04:57,285 --> 02:04:59,899
NENE: Whether you've made to debut or not,

1827
02:05:00,049 --> 02:05:03,605
NENE: even you have a feel like,
"why not me?"

1828
02:05:03,815 --> 02:05:06,862
NENE: "why I'm so unlucky?"

1829
02:05:07,192 --> 02:05:11,805
NENE: I want to say that
failure paves the path to success.

1830
02:05:12,765 --> 02:05:14,793
NENE: And because of the sadness,

1831
02:05:15,080 --> 02:05:17,787
NENE: then you know
how the beauty of the happiness is.

1832
02:05:18,811 --> 02:05:23,099
NENE: So, believe in yourself
and the world will believe in you.

1833
02:05:23,634 --> 02:05:24,357
NENE: Good luck.

1834
02:05:24,725 --> 02:05:27,126
HOST: That gives me goosebumps as well.

1835
02:05:27,252 --> 02:05:28,861
HOST: Awesome, aewsome.

1836
02:05:29,365 --> 02:05:33,804
HOST: Right? It's not easy
to achieve the success and the failure

1837
02:05:33,910 --> 02:05:36,882
HOST: is not the opposite thing.
Actually, it's a component.

1838
02:05:37,002 --> 02:05:40,339
HOST: No one achieves success without
experiencing failure along the way.

1839
02:05:40,924 --> 02:05:42,698
HOST: Right?

1840
02:05:42,856 --> 02:05:44,510
HOST: Failure is not
the opposite of success.

1841
02:05:44,646 --> 02:05:46,718
HOST: Failure is part of success.

1842
02:05:46,845 --> 02:05:49,581
JACKSON: Right.
HOST: You know?

1843
02:05:49,756 --> 02:05:53,629
JACKSON: I'm also curious about
what does the guest mentors think.

1844
02:05:53,629 --> 02:05:57,945
JACKSON: Cause I guess
it's like life is the first time seeing

1845
02:05:58,269 --> 02:05:59,677
JACKSON: all the trainees performance.

1846
02:05:59,677 --> 02:06:03,037
JACKSON: So, I really wanna ask MIKA.

1847
02:06:03,772 --> 02:06:07,773
JACKSON: What do you think?
What do you have to say to the trainees?

1848
02:06:12,765 --> 02:06:14,557
HOST: Okay, thank you so much.

1849
02:06:14,934 --> 02:06:15,666
HOST: Thank you, MIKA.

1850
02:06:15,805 --> 02:06:17,328
MIKA: I understand your feelings.

1851
02:06:17,483 --> 02:06:19,725
MIKA: Because I was standing
on the same spot three years ago.

1852
02:06:19,889 --> 02:06:22,306
MIKA: And I know
all of you are probably nervous,

1853
02:06:22,418 --> 02:06:23,785
MIKA: you really wanna debut.

1854
02:06:23,933 --> 02:06:26,063
MIKA: Your life is about to change
if you do.

1855
02:06:26,183 --> 02:06:28,247
MIKA: But honestly,
no matter which direction that goes,

1856
02:06:28,364 --> 02:06:30,285
MIKA: I really think
you all should not be worry.

1857
02:06:30,435 --> 02:06:33,047
MIKA: You all came here,
came this far to the show.

1858
02:06:33,218 --> 02:06:36,439
MIKA: You've made these many fans.
All people support you no matter what happens.

1859
02:06:36,635 --> 02:06:38,241
MIKA: they'll continue to support you.

1860
02:06:38,377 --> 02:06:40,641
MIKA: And you can keep on trying,

1861
02:06:40,767 --> 02:06:42,653
MIKA: you have as many chances
as you want

1862
02:06:42,671 --> 02:06:43,585
MIKA: don't worry.

1863
02:06:43,753 --> 02:06:45,757
MIKA: I think you guys are all amazing.

1864
02:06:45,757 --> 02:06:47,069
MIKA: So, good job.

1865
02:06:47,133 --> 02:06:48,263
MIKA: You've made it here.
JACKSON: Thank you.

1866
02:06:48,395 --> 02:06:49,213
JACKSON: Thank you.

1867
02:06:49,213 --> 02:06:49,821
HOST: Thank you, MIKA.

1868
02:06:49,821 --> 02:06:51,860
JACKSON: What about MILLI?

1869
02:06:53,597 --> 02:06:55,645
JACKSON: You think
I'm not gna choose you, huh?

1870
02:06:56,477 --> 02:06:58,478
JACKSON: Too late. What do you think?

1871
02:06:58,771 --> 02:06:59,780
MILLI: Hello.

1872
02:07:01,971 --> 02:07:04,349
HOST: This is live.

1873
02:07:04,436 --> 02:07:08,182
JACKSON: You have to say to
final trainees.

1874
02:07:08,786 --> 02:07:11,146
MILLI: Okay.

1875
02:07:12,009 --> 02:07:15,779
MILLI: I think like this is not...
whatever the result will happen,

1876
02:07:15,931 --> 02:07:17,757
MILLI: this is not the end of your career.

1877
02:07:17,999 --> 02:07:19,385
MILLI: This is your passion, right?

1878
02:07:19,530 --> 02:07:21,234
MILLI: Don't turn it to be like,

1879
02:07:21,354 --> 02:07:22,301
MILLI: Just only today.

1880
02:07:22,397 --> 02:07:25,048
MILLI: You have tomorrow always
and like...

1881
02:07:25,887 --> 02:07:27,893
MILLI: I'll always support you.

1882
02:07:28,170 --> 02:07:32,377
MILLI: This is your passion,
just do it, going on, keep going with it.

1883
02:07:32,547 --> 02:07:35,130
MILLI: Don't give up.
You deserve everything.

1884
02:07:35,268 --> 02:07:39,037
MILLI: And whatever
the result is going to happen tomorrow,

1885
02:07:39,037 --> 02:07:41,822
MILLI: You promise me
to have a good Thai massage.

1886
02:07:42,365 --> 02:07:43,331
JACKSON: Yeah.

1887
02:07:43,331 --> 02:07:46,525
MILLI: Please. You deserve that.
JACKSON: It's going to be sponsored by We TV.

1888
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:49,901
MILLI: Please. Sponsored by JACK. Thank you.
JACKSON: Yes.

1889
02:07:50,717 --> 02:07:52,061
JACKSON: No!

1890
02:07:52,277 --> 02:07:54,653
JACKSON: No!

1891
02:07:54,763 --> 02:07:57,155
JACKSON: Okay it's okay.

1892
02:07:57,693 --> 02:07:59,453
JACKSON: What about LIU YU?

1893
02:07:59,584 --> 02:08:03,101
JACKSON: What do you have to say
to all the final trainess?

1894
02:08:03,101 --> 02:08:04,375
LIU YU: Okay, You all can hear me.

1895
02:08:04,536 --> 02:08:08,120
LIU YU: We've all came this far,
nothing is important anymore.

1896
02:08:08,272 --> 02:08:12,008
LIU YU: But the most important thing is that
you need to think carefully about the next segment of speech.

1897
02:08:12,349 --> 02:08:14,620
LIU YU: This part is so important,
do you remember?

1898
02:08:14,759 --> 02:08:18,973
LIU YU: And because the results
have been decided,

1899
02:08:18,973 --> 02:08:21,108
LIU YU: so, there's no need to worry.

1900
02:08:21,234 --> 02:08:23,689
LIU YU: There are many stages
awaiting your performance.

1901
02:08:23,828 --> 02:08:26,529
LIU YU: So you must cherish every opportunity
on stage in the future.

1902
02:08:26,613 --> 02:08:30,032
LIU YU: After becoming part of this group,
you must unite together.

1903
02:08:30,279 --> 02:08:32,632
LIU YU: Because I feel that each member

1904
02:08:32,753 --> 02:08:35,228
LIU YU: has put in too much effort
for this group.

1905
02:08:35,391 --> 02:08:38,564
LIU YU: So you must work hard
and enjoy every moment on stage. Good luck.

1906
02:08:46,052 --> 02:08:49,664
HOST: And what about KATAE?

1907
02:08:50,557 --> 02:08:51,775
KATAE: Hello.

1908
02:08:53,974 --> 02:08:55,037
KATAE: Well,

1909
02:08:55,917 --> 02:08:59,368
KATAE: I'm also those who keeps fighting.
I'll keep fighting unil

1910
02:08:59,737 --> 02:09:03,021
KATAE: I'm out of energy.
But I always tell myself that

1911
02:09:03,198 --> 02:09:06,330
KATAE: I won't run out of energy
if I haven't tried to make my dream come true.

1912
02:09:10,459 --> 02:09:11,797
HOST: Thank you so much.

1913
02:09:11,823 --> 02:09:13,917
HOST: NINE.

1914
02:09:13,917 --> 02:09:16,457
HOST: Same question.

1915
02:09:17,629 --> 02:09:18,574
NINE: Now it's my turn.

1916
02:09:19,613 --> 02:09:20,916
NINE: Hello.

1917
02:09:21,067 --> 02:09:24,771
NINE: So, I'm going to speak English then.

1918
02:09:24,901 --> 02:09:31,242
NINE: Cause when I was on our final stage,

1919
02:09:31,242 --> 02:09:34,237
NINE: I was so nervous too

1920
02:09:34,237 --> 02:09:38,685
NINE: that I was thinking
what if I can't debut.

1921
02:09:40,274 --> 02:09:44,000
NINE: But then I promised myself
always that

1922
02:09:44,669 --> 02:09:49,149
NINE: There're so many things
that you actually have to believe in.

1923
02:09:49,435 --> 02:09:51,761
NINE: First, you fans.

1924
02:09:52,940 --> 02:09:55,701
NINE: Second, the people who love you.

1925
02:09:56,305 --> 02:09:59,130
NINE: Third, yourself.

1926
02:10:00,639 --> 02:10:06,649
NINE: Like NENE said,
don't ever doubt yourself never.

1927
02:10:08,129 --> 02:10:10,808
NINE: And just like MILLI said if today,

1928
02:10:10,982 --> 02:10:15,243
NINE: we don't have the results
that we wanted,

1929
02:10:15,415 --> 02:10:19,567
NINE: we still have tomorrow.
Like as always.

1930
02:10:20,029 --> 02:10:24,129
NINE: So, it's okay
if anything is going to happen.

1931
02:10:24,412 --> 02:10:27,517
NINE: Just love yourself a lot more.
And believe that

1932
02:10:27,580 --> 02:10:30,044
NINE: we have new opportunity tomorrow.

1933
02:10:30,973 --> 02:10:31,667
NINE: Fighting!

1934
02:10:31,936 --> 02:10:34,737
HOST: Fighting. Thank you, NINE.

1935
02:10:35,485 --> 02:10:37,716

JACKSON: Add a Wechat.

1939
02:10:45,629 --> 02:10:47,997
TEN: I love that.

1940
02:10:48,254 --> 02:10:50,368
HOST: NINE and TEN.

1941
02:10:50,368 --> 02:10:52,628
HOST: Any EIGHT in the house?

1942
02:10:52,989 --> 02:10:54,255

1944
02:10:57,981 --> 02:11:02,827
HOST: Mentors, how do you feel
get to be mentors in this season?

1945
02:11:05,181 --> 02:11:06,794
JACKSON: Starting from me?

1946
02:11:07,083 --> 02:11:11,549
JACKSON: I feel like it's an honor and...

1947
02:11:12,022 --> 02:11:14,826
JACKSON: I'm glad that I can share
what I've been through

1948
