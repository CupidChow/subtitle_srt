TEGAN: Wow.

11
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,160
STAFF: Do you know why you're here today?

MAMCÙ: What is this?

15
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,440
MAMCÙ: One box is black,
the other is purple.

16
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,640
STAFF: Okay, so, in front of you
there are two boxes.

17
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:49,280
STAFF: The purple one is filled with all
the nice comments for you on the Internet,

18
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,200
STAFF: and the black one is filled
with all the negatives

19
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,000
STAFF: and critiques on the Internet.

20
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,400
XUEYAO: Negatives, positives, right?

21
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,480
STAFF: All you have to do is

22
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,600
- STAFF: pick up messages from either box.
- DIDI: Oh.

23
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,120
STAFF: You can mix and match
however you want,

24
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,280
STAFF: but only 3 messages.

25
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,880
STAFF: Do you think which one
you want to pick up from?

26
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,440
TEGAN: Okay, we gonna go good.

27
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,800
TEGAN: I don't want nothing negative.

28
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,280
TEGAN: "The last time I felt like this"

29
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,520
TEGAN: "was my first love."

30
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,040
TEGAN: Oh, my Gosh.

31
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,560
TEGAN: I'm single.

32
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,840
TEGAN: So, get in the line.

33
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,960
PRAEW: Let's take PRAEW to the FINAL.

34
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,360
PRAEW: You're right.

35
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,240
MAMCÙ: Every character has a lot of power.

36
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,600
MAMCÙ: Actually, the bad comments

37
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,920
MAMCÙ: are like black stains
on colorful things.

38
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,640
MAMCÙ: Even if there are 99 good comments

39
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,960
MAMCÙ: and just one bad comment,

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,120
MAMCÙ: people often choose to read

41
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,400
MAMCÙ: the bad one.

42
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
MAMCÙ: It is these good comments

43
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,960
MAMCÙ: that will give us good energy.

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,240
MAMCÙ: I'll keep them in my body

45
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,080
MAMCÙ: and utilize them

46
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,760
MAMCÙ: to show my full potential.

47
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,840
MAMCÙ: For the bad comments,
I'll just skim through them,

48
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,640
MAMCÙ: and then crush them,

49
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,600
MAMCÙ: and stomp them on the ground.

50
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,360
ELYN: "I'm so happy to have such a cute
and brave girl representing Malaysia."

ELYN: "ELYN will definitely debut
in a high rank."

52
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,080
ELYN: "We will support you forever."

53
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,360
ELYN: For me, the word ‘brave’

54
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,960
ELYN: gives me a lot of energy,

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,760
ELYN: because I believe what I'm doing

56
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,080
ELYN: may be the bravest thing
I've ever done in my life.

57
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,960
ELYN: Seeing so many people supporting me

58
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,240
ELYN: gradually makes me feel like

59
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,320
ELYN: coming here is
the very right choice for me.

60
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,160
ELYN: Shining bright and glowing.

61
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,120

my singing skill.

00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,160
LILIANA LI: So, I also...

69
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,920
LILIANA LI: So, I wanna only be known
for my own personalities,

70
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,920
LILIANA LI: but also my singing.

71
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,120
LILIANA LI: That's my goal.

72
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,240
LILIANA LI: Husband girl?

73
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,520
LILIANA LI: Something I've never thought
I would be called.

74
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,600
STAFF: What causes others saying to it
just for you?

75
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,280
LILIANA LI: I guess people...

76
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,040
LILIANA LI: I think it may be because...

77
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,880
LILIANA LI: people think I'm handsome

78
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,120
LILIANA LI: and feel like
I can be a husband?

79
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,080
LILIANA LI: Hey, this is your husband.

80
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,480

00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,400

86
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,320

88
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,440

89
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,480
R-JING: "who's really suitable to be
a girl group member."

90
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,960
R-JING: "In addition to your clear voice"

91
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,600
R-JING: "that can easily raise high notes"

92
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,720
R-JING: "you also dance and perform well."

93
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,000

and performing."

00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,320
R-JING: "The more you're confident,"

95
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,520
R-JING: "the more you're shining."

96
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,560

in yourself.

97
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,840
R-JING: I'm happy that people see me
and love me.

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,200
R-JING: It's like this is
always my question

99
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,640
R-JING: whether what I've been doing now
has been seen or not.

100
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,280
R-JING: Here it is what I want

101
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,920
R-JING: from doing this.

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,440

LU YUTING: Let me introduce myself.

104
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,600
LU YUTING: Who is LU YUTING?

105
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,200
LU YUTING: She's an ordinary girl
who has dreams.

106
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,360
LU YUTING: She likes singing, dancing,

107
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,840
LU YUTING: and doing magic tricks.

108
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,720
ILENE: "Wanna go and cheer for boxers?"

109
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,960
ILENE: "I saw you always shout out."

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,520
ILENE: Ow, if I could go there,
I would do.

111
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,920
ILENE: But I wanna tell you that

112
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,680
ILENE: watching our performance is like
watching a boxing match.

113
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,600
ILENE: It's exciting. It's like...

114
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,400
ILENE: "Oh! Which side was off the hook?"

115
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,240
KRISTA: "The center lacks confidence,
making the whole team drop."

116
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,280
KRISTA: Actually, everytime KRISTA was
on the stage.

117
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,160
KRISTA: KRISTA would feel confident
in what KRISTA did.

118
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,560
KRISTA: But maybe it's KRISTA's face.

119
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,200
KRISTA: My face always looks worried.

120
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,920
KRISTA: But KRISTA is trying to practice
making my face look more confident.

121
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,360
RUAN: "Being in Class B,"

122
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,760
RUAN: Frankly, when it was announced

123
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,840
RUAN: the CENTER of the THEME SONG,

124
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,560
RUAN: first of all, since I was selected

125
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,240
RUAN: I was afraid of the eyes of everyone
in Class A looking at me.

126
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,200
RUAN: There were also

127
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,520
RUAN: reactions from fans who thought that
the center must definitely be from Class A.

128
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,920
RUAN: But I

129
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,800
RUAN: seems like destroying that rule.

130
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,840
RUAN: Even if I'm in Class B,

131
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,400
RUAN: I have proven to everyone that
I can be a charming

132
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,320
RUAN: and different CENTER.

133
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,920
DUNA: "When the three team members
were eliminated,"

134
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,520
DUNA: "DUNA seemed to lose
her fighting spirit"

135
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,920
DUNA: "and her ambition was nowhere
to be seen on the show."

136
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,200
DUNA: "Doesn't DUNA want to debut?"

137
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,280
DUNA: I think...

138
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,440
DUNA: it could be understood like this.

139
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,680
DUNA: My three teammates were out.

140
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,720
DUNA: Actually, it's not like that I'm

141
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,080
DUNA: always depressed and sad.

142
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,120
DUNA: In this third stage too,

143
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,960
DUNA: because I believe I made it
for my three teammates.

144
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,840
DUNA: Everyone will definitely see

145
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,640
DUNA: my ambition again.

146
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,840
DUNA: Please wait a little longer.

147
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,000
DUNA: Everyone, Korean fans,

148
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,200
DUNA: Chinese fans, and Thai fans,

149
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,120
DUNA: if you guys

150
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,680
DUNA: encourage me,

151
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,120
DUNA: it's not just that
I have to be with my teammates,

152
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,320
DUNA: but if there's only me,

153
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,600
DUNA: I'm confident that
I will be able to make it.

154
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,240
EMMA: "Is EMMA a person
who doesn't have many fans?"

155
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,320
EMMA: "She has a good look and character,"

156
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,760
EMMA: "but it's strange that
those don't attract many fans."

157
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,800
EMMA: If I don't attract fans,

158
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,280
EMMA: how can I be in the top nine?

159
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,800
XUANNING: "I don't see any ambition
from XUANNING in this show."

160
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,000
XUANNING: "I feel like she doesn't want
to debut at all."

161
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,760
XUANNING: "Having gone through many stages,
yet she is still in her safe zone."

162
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,320
XUANNING: "No matter how good-looking
you are, you're like a log."

163
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,200
XUANNING: Actually, I have an ambition.

164
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,360
XUANNING: I don't think
I hold still like a log.

165
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,640
XUANNING: I think I still look lively.

166
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,080
XUANNING: Let me make eyes at the camera.

167
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,120
DIDI: "If it weren't for her older sister,
she wouldn't attract people that much."

168
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,440
DIDI: "If you were born in an ordinary
family, would you be famous?"

169
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,040
DIDI: I think, unlike others, thanks to
my sister and family,

170
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,880
DIDI: I'm in a spotlight.

171
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,920
DIDI: Maybe a lot of people came to see me

172
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,280
DIDI: because of my older sister.

173
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,440
DIDI: So, I think with this opportunity

174
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,200
DIDI: that will make people pay
more attention to me,

175
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,640
DIDI: I have to practice harder

176
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,040
DIDI: and make my stage performances
the best.

177
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,040
DIDI: It's because at this time
I can only rely on myself.

178
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,920
DIDI: Nobody can give me extra points.

179
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,720
XUEYAO: I think I didn't have much luck

180
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,520
XUEYAO: in the judgement
from the THEME SONG battle.

181
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,360
XUEYAO: I think in the THEME SONG battle

182
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,120
XUEYAO: I wasn't that bad.

183
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,360
XUEYAO: With my real potential,

184
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,440
XUEYAO: I think I don't deserve Class F.

185
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,840
XUEYAO: I think there's even
a place for me in Class A.

186
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,240
YEAN: "If you were in other countries,
your ranking would drop for sure"

187
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,320
YEAN: "because you don't have charisma."

188
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,960
YEAN: Charisma, the word 'charisma'
in me is

189
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,320
YEAN: being nice, cute, friendly.

190
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,000
YEAN: And all of those are me.

191
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,120
YEAN: So, I feel that

192
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,560
YEAN: I'm charismatic in my own way.

193
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,160
RINKA: I got this comment,

194
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,560
RINKA: it means

195
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,960
RINKA: you recognize me, and

196
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,160
RINKA: from now on

197
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,760
RINKA: I think you will see me shine
and grow even more.

198
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,800
RINKA: I am sure that
you definitely like this hair

199
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,800
RINKA: because it shines like this hair.

200
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,920
RINKA: I think it will definitely
catch everyone's attention.

201
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,560
WANG KE: Thank you for telling me that

202
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,080
WANG KE: I pass the level of being
a girl group member.

203
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,040
WANG KE: Thank you so much.

204
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,560
WANG KE: This means I passed the exam.

205
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,760
WANG KE: Thank you for accepting me.

206
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,600
WANG KE: But as it's said that
I don't have any good points,

207
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,320
WANG KE: actually, I'm also worried

208
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,880
WANG KE: that I would look like
a small flower in a garden on the show.

209
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,280
WANG KE: I'm also afraid that
everyone won't see me.

210
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,120
WANG KE: But I believe that

211
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,200
WANG KE: even I may be not the most
outstanding flower,

212
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,960
WANG KE: I do believe I'm the most hopeful
and powerful flower.

213
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,240
WANG KE: I can wait patiently
until it will be my day,

214
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,360
WANG KE: the day that I'm ready to bloom.

215
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,680
WANG KE: I just want myself to stand firm
until that day comes,

216
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,520
WANG KE: I will bloom.

217
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,120
WANG KE: So, when I'm blooming,
you will see me.

218
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,280
WANG KE: My strength is that

219
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,840
WANG KE: I'm very optimistic and strong.

220
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,520
YUAN KE: Singing is bad, dancing is
mediocre, like a vase for display.

221
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,560
YUAN KE: Since I was young,

222
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,080
YUAN KE: I've been judged a lot
on my appearance.

223
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,400
YUAN KE: So, on this path

224
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,440
YUAN KE: I've never declined
that I'm beautiful.

225
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,600
YUAN KE: Because I'm good-looking,

226
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,440
YUAN KE: people pay more attention to me.

227
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,520
YUAN KE: So, this bad comment,

228
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,200
YUAN KE: I'm pleased to accept it

229
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,160
YUAN KE: and pleased to get
everyone's comments

230
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,920
YUAN KE: about my facial appearance.

231
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,400
YUAN KE: From now on I will continue
to improve myself

232
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,000
YUAN KE: and develop my other abilities
more and more.

233
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,320
YUAN KE: I hope that one day

234
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,960
YUAN KE: everyone who sees me

235
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,280
YUAN KE: won't be just impressed
on my facial appearance,

236
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,760
YUAN KE: but also be impressed
on my abilities.

237
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,680
YUAN KE: Thank you, everyone.

238
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,880
PAILIU: It's because I had nose surgery.

239
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,760
PAILIU: But I haven't had surgery
on other parts.

240
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,400
PAILIU: Everything is natural.

241
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,120
PAILIU: If my accepting

242
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,600
PAILIU: that I had the surgery

243
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,880
PAILIU: is an embarassing issue
or whatever,

244
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,880
PAILIU: I don't think
this causes anyone troubles.

245
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,000
PAILIU: I do think this makes myself
feel more confident.

246
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,080
PAILIU: If in the end, it is you
who receive those good results

247
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,080
PAILIU: and those around you
are not affected,

248
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,200
PAILIU: just listen a lot
to yourself, everyone.

249
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,000
QIAO YI YU: "This is probably the most
ordinary Center in the CHUANG's history."

250
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,880
QIAO YI YU: Not everyone will agree
with this opinion 100%.

251
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,440
QIAO YI YU: I can bet my name QIAO YI YU.

252
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,720
QIAO YI YU: If I stand here,

253
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,480
QIAO YI YU: no matter whether or not
they think I'm good

254
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,320
QIAO YI YU: or bad

255
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,000
QIAO YI YU: or look down on me,

256
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,280
QIAO YI YU: just remember who I am,

257
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,200
QIAO YI YU: I'm very happy with that.

258
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,360
QIAO YI YU: Because in my previous
two programs,

259
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,880
QIAO YI YU: what I experienced
and felt the saddest was that

260
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,080
QIAO YI YU: I was there,

261
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,680
QIAO YI YU: but nobody said anything
good about me

262
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,360
QIAO YI YU: and nobody said anything
bad about me too.

263
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,760
QIAO YI YU: It was like I was just
a stranger passing by.

264
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,920
QIAO YI YU: Nobody even remembers my name.

265
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,840
QIAO YI YU: So, now I'm really happy

266
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,520
QIAO YI YU: that finally I can see

267
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,520
QIAO YI YU: bad comments

268
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,720
QIAO YI YU: This can be confirmed that
everyone has started to see me.

269
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,720
PAILIU: Can't believe the final stage is next week!

270
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,120
PAILIU: Time flies!

271
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,280
YEAN: Yeah, we've gone through it a lot.

272
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,920
YEAN: and Trip.com was our
trusted trip companion all the way.

273
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,080
YEAN: After the final stage,

274
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,240
YEAN: I'm going on a real trip!

275
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,160
PAILIU: I booked a trip already!

276
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,600
PAILIU: See?

277
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,960
PAILIU: Hotels, flights,
trains, car rentals,

278
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,800
YEAN: You’re right!

279
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,600
YEAN: It’s super easy to use,

280
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,120
YEAN: I'm gonna book now too!

281
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,680
(97 DAYS)

282
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,840
ELYN: Pattaya.

283
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,600
LISSA: Ta-da!

284
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,800
LISSA: Today I saw the sea again
in a million years.

285
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,760
LISSA: It was like we were
in the Stone Age,

286
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,880
LISSA: living in the rocks for a long time.

287
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,680
LISSA: And today we got to see
this beautiful world.

288
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,760
LISSA: It was like...

289
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,400
LISSA: Wow, so happy.

290
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,680
QIAO YI YU: Wow.

291
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,680
QIAO YI YU: It's really beautiful.

292
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,320
QIAO YI YU: Because I grew up in the city,

293
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,160
QIAO YI YU: I had a very little chances
to see the sea.

294
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,800
QIAO YI YU: On the day we arrived at
the seashore,

295
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,880
QIAO YI YU: I could feel
the salty smell of the sea

296
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,680
QIAO YI YU: and the humidity,
something like that.

297
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,280
QIAO YI YU: I also saw the sparkling sea
that I haven't seen in a long while,

298
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,840
QIAO YI YU: saw the sun
on the edge of the sea.

299
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,160
QIAO YI YU: At that time, I looked still
and thought,

300
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,440
QIAO YI YU: "why is there
such a beautiful sea view?"

301
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,120
QIAO YI YU: We also came to film here.

302
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,320
TEGAN: I feel like I'm home.

303
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,920
ILENE: I haven't seen sea
for around four to five months.

304
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,480
ILENE: Well, coming to Pattaya
in this time was like

305
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,800
ILENE: it's a very beautiful view.

306
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,960
ILENE: And I felt that

307
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,400
ILENE: it heals my heart.

308
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,280
ILENE: Yet, I knew that there would be
the elimination.

309
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,960
ILENE: It was like, "Wow,
the view is beautiful."

310
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,680
ILENE: "Eh!, but we had the elimination."

311
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,240
MIKE: Hello, trainees.

312
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,440
MIKE: Welcome to CHUANG ASIA.

313
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,320
NENE: Welcome everyone
to the important moment

314
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,800
NENE: of our journey.

315
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,840
NENE: And before we start
the final round of elimination,

316
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,760
NENE: I would like to applaud
all the trainees

317
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,000
NENE: who were successful in the third
performance, the COOPERATION STAGE.

318
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,640
NENE: Well, we all saw
the talent of all the trainees,

319
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,280
NENE: your dedication and determination

320
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,760
NENE: that we've never seen before.

321
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,960
JEFF: I think yesterday

322
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,240
JEFF: all of you saw the critics.

323
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,960
JEFF: Also the good comment about your,
the couple of performances.

324
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,720
JEFF: How was it? How's the feeling?

325
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,520
JEFF: I think it's just mix feeling.

326
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,360
JEFF: But I just wanna say that

327
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,280
JEFF: it's pretty normal
being in the industry.

328
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,840
JEFF: I got a lot of hate comments.

329
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,480
JEFF: I got a lot of love comments.

330
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,120
JEFF: It's pretty normal.

331

LISSA: And now I am apparently the last
one again.

504
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,040
LISSA: Seventeen.

505
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,760
LISSA: There are so many questions
right now in my head.

506
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,520
LISSA: "What am I doing?"

507
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,960
LISSA: I'm currently doing
something I love.

508
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,680
LISSA: I'm currently fighting
for my dreams.

509
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,000
LISSA: And then comes to another question
in my head

510
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,960
LISSA: which is
"Do you think you can debut?"

511
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,920
TRAINEES: You can!

512
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,000
- WANG KE: You can!
- R-JING: You can, LISSA!

513
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,320
LISSA: I always answer with the "Yes."

514
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,040
LISSA: Even though reality doesn't seem
like it.

515
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,160
LISSA: But at the end of the day,

516
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,560
LISSA: I remind myself always
of why I am here,

517
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,920
LISSA: what makes me happy.

518
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,280
LISSA: I started a whole green family

519
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,480
LISSA: which is why I get the chance

520
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,640
LISSA: to express happiness

521
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,840
LISSA: with the people that I love

522
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,120
LISSA: which is my fans.

523
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,120
LISSA: Thank you so much.

524
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,960
LISSA: I will forever be grateful
for all of you.

525
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,000
LISSA: I will put a lot of effort
and work hard.

526
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,680
LISSA: My fans also put a lot of effort
for me

527
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,920
LISSA: to stand here.

528
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:34,200
LISSA: I hope everyone can see
how hard I have worked.

529
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,360
LISSA: I will keep going.

530
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,800
LISSA: I will prove myself to everyone

531
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,160
LISSA: that I deserve to debut.

532
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,680
DIDI: Yeah! LISSA!

533
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,120
LISSA: Spotlight is shining on me
right now.

534
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,280
LISSA: So I hope you guys can see me,

535
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,360
LISSA: can help me

536
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,680
LISSA: be in the brightest spotlight ever.

537
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,320
LISSA: Thank you for your hard work.
Thank you so much.

538
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,200
- LISSA: Thank you.
- MIKE: LISSA

539
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,880
MIKE: I want to tell you that

540
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,800
MIKE: the lucky charm that I gave you

541
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,160
MIKE: doesn't have any magic.

542
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,000
MIKE: It's your magic.

543
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,600
MIKE: What you get now,

544
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,120
MIKE: it is because of you.

545
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,520
MIKE: It isn't because of that charm.

546
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,720
MIKE: The reason you are standing
in this position right now,

547
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,560
MIKE: it's all because of your hard work.

548
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,600
MIKE: I also want to tell you that
you are only a few steps away

549
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,120
MIKE: from your dream.

550
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,200
MIKE: So keep going.

551
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,760
- MIKE: You still have a chance.
- LISSA: Thank you.

552
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,200

- MIKE: Okay. Next, DUNA.

553
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,600
DUNA: I would like to say that

554
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,520
DUNA: I am very grateful to my team

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,280
DUNA: And I would like to thank my fans

557
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,680
DUNA: who give me a lot of love.

558
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,400
DUNA: It is because of them that

559
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,160
DUNA: I am here in fourteenth place.

560
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,000
DUNA: Also... I told my members

561
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,200
DUNA: who were out before
that I will do my best

562
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,960
DUNA: for them too.

563
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,640
DUNA: Today,

564
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,720
DUNA: I've made it to the Final Round.

565
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,040
DUNA: I'm so proud of myself.

566
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,840
DUNA: I also would like to thank you all

567
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,840
DUNA: who always take care of me,

568
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,200
DUNA: whenever I feel lonely
or discouraged.

569
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,880
DUNA: I feel very thankful

570
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,680
DUNA: and feel very grateful

571
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,800
DUNA: that I've made it to the Final Round
with you all.

572
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,880
DUNA: Please give me your support.

573
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,200
DUNA: Please look forward
to my performance in the Final Round.

574
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,880
DUNA: Thank you.

575
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,440
MIKE: Thank you, DUNA.

576
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,680
DUNA: Thank you.

577
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,320
MIKE: PRAEW, I believe
you have a lot to say.

578
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,560
PRAEW: First of all,
I would like to thank all of my fans

579
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,040
PRAEW: who always vote for me
and give me support.

580
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,120
PRAEW: I know my fandom

581
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,640
PRAEW: may be small

582
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,840
PRAEW: but I know that
everyone is always there for me.

583
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,360
PRAEW: I know that everyone
loves me a lot.

584
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,720
PRAEW: I also know that
more people are starting to notice me.

585
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,440
PRAEW: It's been eight years
since I started my journey,

586
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,560
PRAEW: From a dancer to an artist.

587
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,560
PRAEW: I think It's been...

588
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,800
PRAEW: a tough and challenging journey,

589
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,840
PRAEW: But I've never given up.

590
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,720
PRAEW: The next goal
for my next performance

591
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,440
PRAEW: is to debut

592
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,960
PRAEW: as the main dancer of the group.

593
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,200
PRAEW: I will prove to everyone that

594
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,240
PRAEW: I can achieve that goal.

595
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,440
PRAEW: I feel much more confident now.

596
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,720
PRAEW: I will prove it to everyone.

597
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,440
PRAEW: Thank you.

598
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,040
PRAEW: I've got the MVP.

599
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,880
PRAEW: Have you noticed me now?

600
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,240
TRAINEES: Yes!

601
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,320
MINGMING: Yes!

602
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:37,320
PRAEW: Can I be your first pick now?

603
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,040
PRAEW: Yes. Thank you.

604
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,560
NENE: I am happy for her.

605
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,280
NENE: I think it really is about being
in the right place at the right time.

606
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,960
NENE: It's now PRAEW's time.
She got the MVP last time.

607
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,440
NENE: More people have noticed her. Yes.

608
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,160
NENE: I really happy for her.

609
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,480
NENE: Actually, there are many trainees
like her in this season

610
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,080
NENE: who have been saved

611
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,800
NENE: and then they start to shine

612
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,880
NENE: and get to stay on.

613
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,320
NENE: I think it's great

614
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,560
NENE: because it gives them a chance
to show their true colors

615
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,440
NENE: in the next stages.

616
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,920
NENE: So next question.

617
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:18,680
NENE: I want to ask those who have
never entered the Top nine before.

618
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,960
NENE: And this time,

619
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,840
NENE: you believe that you have a chance

620
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,360
NENE: to be in the Top nine.

621
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,720
NENE: Please raise your hand.

622
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,960
- TRAINEES: XUEYAO
- LILIANA LI: XUEYAO

623
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,480
NENE: And come out
to the announcing area, please.

624
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,880
TRAINEES: Go!

625
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,560
TRAINEES: Let's go, XUEYAO.

626
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
TRAINEES: ZENG XUEYAO

627
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,960
XUEYAO: I thought to myself, If I don't
make it to the Top nine this time,

628
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,680
XUEYAO: I'll be even further away
from this position.

629
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:07,720
NENE: Only you?

630
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:08,840
NENE: Only you?

631
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,840
NENE: Is there anyone else?

632
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,600
MIKE: Oh. YUAN KE, MAMCÙ, XUANNING, XUEYAO

633
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,640
MIKE: Four people.

634
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,080
JEFF: So all of you

635
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,280
JEFF: who have never ever been
in the Top nine.

636
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,720
JEFF: Why do you think you deserve to be
in the Top nine?

637
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,320
YUAN KE: I think

638
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,760
YUAN KE: it's because...

639
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,440
YUAN KE: This has always been my dream,

640
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,840
YUAN KE: Even though it may not come true,

641
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,680
YUAN KE: I want myself

642
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,160
YUAN KE: to feel that I'm encouraged
to follow my dream.

643
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,000
YUAN KE: That's why...

644
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,000
YUAN KE: I am standing here.

645
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,800
XUANNING: Honestly, at first

646
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,160
XUANNING: I didn't have the courage
to come down here.

647
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,720
XUANNING: But when I saw ZENG XUEYAO
rush down first,

648
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,480
XUANNING: I felt...

649
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,760
XUANNING: I felt really impressed
by her courage.

650
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,600
XUANNING: I felt...

651
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,360
XUANNING: I want to be brave.

652
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,640
XUANNING: I want to be brave
like ZENG XUEYAO.

653
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,200
XUANNING: I want to be brave for once.

654
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,240
DIDI: I ship them so bad.

655
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,240
MAMCÙ: Honesty,

656
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,640
MAMCÙ: has always been my dream.

657
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,880
MAMCÙ: And I think today,

658
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,640
MAMCÙ: no matter what the factors

659
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,280
MAMCÙ: or circumstances are,

660
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,440
MAMCÙ: I stand here with courage
for myself.

661
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,000
XUEYAO: Actually, for me,

662
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,320
XUEYAO: I only have one sentence
I want to say to myself

663
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,200
XUEYAO: and to my fans.

664
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,120
XUEYAO: I want to say that I, ZENG XUEYAO,

665
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,480
XUEYAO: deserve to debut.

666
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,520
JEFF: Firstly, I just want to say that um,
Congratulations.

667
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,000
JEFF: Because...

668
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,200
JEFF: There are two of you

669
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,200
JEFF: that got into Top nine.

670
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,640
- QIAO YI YU: XUEYAO
- TRAINEES: Two people?

671
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,800
TRAINEES: XUANNING

672
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,320
TRAINEES: YUAN KE

673
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,480
TRAINEES: My sis!

674
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:16,760
JEFF: So, we'll announce the first person
that got into Top nine for the first time.

675
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,920
JEFF: And she is at the ranking
number nine.

676
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,000
JEFF: She's never been the center
of any stages.

677
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,720
WANG SHENG XI: XUEYAO

678
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:39,000
JEFF: Her ranking is increasing
over and over.

679
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,440
JEFF: She said that she's not
the lucky one.

680
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,680
JEFF: But this time she's the lucky one.

681
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,680
JEFF: Congratulations, XUEYAO!

682
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,560

683
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,560

You get to advance to the Final Stage.

684
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,560
PAILIU: Who will be another one?

685
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,560
MIKE: XUEYAO, please go to your spot.

686
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,400
MIKE: Congratulations, XUEYAO.

687
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,200
XUEYAO: I thought to myself that
"Wow, it's been four years"

688
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,640
XUEYAO: I have worked hard towards it
for four years.

689
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,200
XUEYAO: I finally got into the Top nine
for the first time.

690
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,160
XUEYAO: That's why, for me,

691
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,160
XUEYAO: it hasn't been easy at all.

692
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,160
XUEYAO: But I'm really proud of myself.

693
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,640
JEFF: And the next one ranking is
number seven.

694
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,560
TRAINEES: Number seven.

695
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,080
JEFF: She's confident

696
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,800
JEFF: with the appearance of herself.

697
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,080
JEFF: So who is she?

698
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,880
YEAN: YUAN KE, movie star.

699
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,400
JEFF: So!

700
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,800
TRAINEES: Oh, JEFF!

701
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,720
JEFF: Okay.

702
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,600
JEFF: So!

703
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,320
JEFF: Congratulations, YUAN KE!

704
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,560
JEFF: Your ranking is number seven!

705
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,160
MIKE: Congratulations, YUAN KE.

706
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,680
TRAINEES: Congratulations!

707
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,720
MIKE: Alright guys.
Get back to your place.

708
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,440
MIKE: Congratulations, YUAN KE.

709
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,600
ILENE: Good job!

710
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,520
YUAN KE: I finally got into the Top nine.

711
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,720
YUAN KE: I imagined myself standing
in the Top nine

712
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,640
YUAN KE: every night before I went to bed.

713
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,440
YUAN KE: I imagined
what it would be like to stand here.

714
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,520
YUAN KE: I also thought about my facial expression
and my speech after the result announcement.

715
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,520
YUAN KE: I thought about how I would overcome
my fear of letting go of this position.

716
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,920
YUAN KE: But now that I'm actually here,
I think

717
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,800
YUAN KE: what I have to face next is
my fear and anxiety.

718
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:06,520
YUAN KE: I have to work even harder and be more
dedicated if I want to reach even higher.

719
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,200
MIKE: Okay. Next.

720
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,000
MIKE: MAMCÙ, XUANNING
There are only two of you left.

721
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,960
MIKE: Among you guys,

722
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:21,240
MIKE: there's only one person
who will get to advance to the Final Stage.

723
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,880
MIKE: Only one of you guys.

724
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,360
MIKE: Only one of you.

725
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,320
MIKE: She ranks in number fifteen.

726
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,920
MIKE: Congratulations...

727
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,040
MIKE: XUANNING!

728
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,920
JEFF: You get to advance
to the Final Stage.

729
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,760
MIKE: Congratulations.

730
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,360
ILENE: XUANNING, you're brilliant.

731
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,600
XUANNING: First of all, I want to thank
everyone who voted for me.

732
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,920
XUANNING: I didn't realize until now

733
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,200
XUANNING: how much your support

734
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,680
XUANNING: has helped me steadily
and helped me get here where I am now.

735
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,200
XUANNING: I finally understand

736
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,000
XUANNING: how important fans
are to trainees

737
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,600
XUANNING: in a competition like this.

738
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,680
XUANNING: It's like, in this program,
the trainees and the fans are growing together.

739
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,800
MIKE: Sorry, MAMCÙ.

740
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,160
MIKE: You don't get to advance
to the next round.

741
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,720
MIKE: But you did a really great job.

742
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,600
- MIKE: Thank you for being a part of CHUANG ASIA.
- JEFF: Thank you. Thank you so much.

743
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,800
- MIKE: Thank you.
- MAMCÙ: I...

744
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,480
MAMCÙ: I wanna say something.

745
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,000
- JEFF: Yeah. Let's say.
- MIKE: Okay.

746
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:39,600
MAMCÙ: Today, I, as a girl group MAMCÙ,
have to say goodbye to everyone.

747
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,720
MAMCÙ: Please look forward

748
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,880
MAMCÙ: to a Diva MAMCÙ

749
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,080
MAMCÙ: who will be back
to show her potential for everyone.

750
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,200
MAMCÙ: I also want to say
to all of my friends behind me

751
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,160
MAMCÙ: who are close
to the Final Round that

752
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,040
MAMCÙ: Fighting!
Close your eyes and run to it!

753
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,920
MAMCÙ: Just slay, okay?

754
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,240
MIKE: Slay!

755
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,880
- MAMCÙ: Slay!
- MIKE: Slay!

756
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,000
MAMCÙ: Thank you, everyone.

757
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,400
- MIKE: Thank you, MAMCÙ.
- MAMCÙ: Thank you.

758
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,440
MIKE: Thank you.

759
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,440
MIKE: And now let's hear from the people
who advanced to the Final Stage.

760
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,480
MIKE: Let's start from XUANNING.

761
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,320
MIKE: Would you like to say something?

762
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,480
XUANNING: First of all,
I would like to thank

763
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,960
XUANNING: people who like me
and support me.

764
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,000
XUANNING: Thank you for getting me
to stand here.

765
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,800
XUANNING: I also thank you for giving me
a chance to show more of my talents.

766
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,160
XUANNING: It is very important to me.

767
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,400
XUANNING: Thank you and...

768
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,680
XUANNING: Actually, two days ago,
the staff asked me,

769
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,080
XUANNING: "If you get to advance
to the Final Round,

770
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,360
XUANNING: what rank would you like to be?"

771
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,640
XUANNING: I want to say that

772
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,600
XUANNING: I truly believe that everyone
who comes on CHUANG ASIA

773
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,560
XUANNING: wants to be in the Top nine.

774
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,200
XUANNING: I'm no different.
I want to be there too.

775
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,680
XUANNING: But I also like to ask myself,

776
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,880
XUANNING: "Am I worthy
of that position yet?"

777
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,040
XUANNING: "Do I have enough talent?"

778
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,520
XUANNING: "Do I need to work harder
to get there?"

779
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,440
XUANNING: So, I think

780
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,600
XUANNING: those nine positions

781
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,600
XUANNING: are very valuable to me.

782
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,480
XUANNING: I know it's not easy
to get there.

783
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,160
XUANNING: I don't want
to just talk about it.

784
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,360
XUANNING: I want to show everyone
that I can do it.

785
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,360
XUANNING: I want to be someone
who is determined and tries my best.

786
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,120
XUANNING: And in the end,
I want to prove it to everyone

787
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,040
XUANNING: and make them accept me.

788
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,240
XUANNING: Thank you.

789
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,280
XUANNING: And...

790
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,520
XUANNING: I would like to say
to my Thai fans.

791
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,840
XUANNING: I'll speak it in Thai.

792
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,520
XUANNING: Thank you for loving XUANNING.

793
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,760
XUANNING: I'm glad to meet you.

794
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,400
XUANNING: I will keep fighting.

795
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,480
MIKE: Thank you, XUANNING. Thank you.

796
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,760
MIKE: Next, XUEYAO.

797
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,040
TRAINEES: ZENG XUEYAO

798
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,720
XUEYAO: Hi, everyone.

799
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,600
XUEYAO: I'm ZENG XUEYAO who gets to stand
in the Top nine for the first time.

800
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:59,800
XUEYAO: First, I would like to thank
my fans who are the most important to me.

801
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,800
XUEYAO: Because of your hard work
all day and night,

802
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,800
XUEYAO: it brings me the energy
to stand here.

803
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,880
XUEYAO: For me, this journey
has been very long.

804
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,280
XUEYAO: I even thought that the light
at the end of the tunnel didn't exist.

805
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,480
XUEYAO: But I'm so grateful to myself

806
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,680
XUEYAO: that I didn't give up
along the way.

807
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,200
XUEYAO: I always believed that

808
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,240
XUEYAO: where there's a will,
there's a way.

809
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,360
XUEYAO: And now, I've finally found
my way.

810
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,000
XUEYAO: My goal is

811
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,360
XUEYAO: to stay in the Top nine forever.

812
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:31,560
XUEYAO: And I will

813
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,280
XUEYAO: definitely make
my SUMMER DREAM come true.

814
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,240
TRAINEES: Well done, XUEYAO.

815
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,160

816
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,160
MIKE: Next, YUAN KE.

817
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,000
YUAN KE: Hello, everyone. I'm YUAN KE.

818
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,040
MINGMING: Baby YUAN KE

819
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,080
YUAN KE: To me, life is like a marathon.

820
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,640
YUAN KE: Some people may be ahead of me,

821
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,600
YUAN KE: but I will never give up.

822
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,680
YUAN KE: Because I know that as long as
we haven't reached the finish line,

823
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,920
YUAN KE: everyone still has
a chance to win.

824
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,400
YUAN KE: That's why I'm here today.

825
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,760
YUAN KE: I would like to say to everyone
who likes me.

826
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,560
YUAN KE: Thank you, everyone.

827
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:15,160
YUAN KE: Thank you for being here for me
during this important time in my life.

828
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,800
YUAN KE: I know this journey is
very difficult,

829
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,840
YUAN KE: but let's be patient
a little longer.

830
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,280
YUAN KE: Let's walk together
to the finish line

831
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,600
YUAN KE: to the day...

832
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,000
YUAN KE: to the day I debut.

833
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,920
YUAN KE: Thank you, everyone.

834
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,000
TRAINEES: Slay.

835
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,040
MIKE: Thank you, YUAN KE.

836
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,520
YUAN KE: From now on, I hope that

837
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,760
YUAN KE: I will use this opportunity

838
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,240
YUAN KE: to stand firmly in seventh place

839
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,560
YUAN KE: and fight to move up
to a higher rank.

840
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,960
MIKE: Let's move to the Top nine,
debut tier.

841
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,200
MIKE: As you can see in front,

842
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,040
MIKE: it's number one,

843
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,880
MIKE: two and three.

844
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,680
MIKE: So, who's in the Top nine

845
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,680
MIKE: believes that they'll be
in the Top three,

846
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:08,200
MIKE: please step down to the ranking
you believe you will be in. Right in front of you.

847
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,400
QIAO YI YU: Before the ranking announcement,
I never thought I would get first place.

848
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,120
QIAO YI YU: But then,
I suddenly got first place.

849
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,600
QIAO YI YU: So now, I will stay here
firmly and maintain this position.

850
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,840
QIAO YI YU: I can't back down anymore.

851
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,520
RUAN: It's true that I've always wanted
to be in first place,

852
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,560
RUAN: but I haven't been able
to achieve it yet.

853
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,640
RUAN: So I chose...

854
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,720
RUAN: number one

855
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,320
RUAN: with my great desire.

856
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,560
MINGMING: Go, ILENE.

857
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,760
LILIANA LI: ILENE, have the confidence.

858
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,040
ILENE: I'm not very confident to go there.

859
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,000
ILENE: Like...

860
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,680
ILENE: If I go there...

861
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,160
ILENE: I'm not confident if I will get it.

862
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,720
LILIANA LI: ILENE, believe in yourself.

863
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,720
LILIANA LI: Go, ILENE!
Believe in yourself.

864
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,000
PRAEW: Let's go, ILENE!

865
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,600
ILENE: I eventually went down there

866
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,960
ILENE: and stand at number one.

867
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,240
TRAINEES: Yeah.

868
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,080
EMMA: I chose number two.

869
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,160
EMMA: I, honestly, think that

870
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,120
EMMA: my previous performance
isn't that bad.

871
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,520
EMMA: So I'm pretty confident.

872
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,320
EMMA: Let's see what's gonna turn out.

873
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,760
YEAN: Last time, I was number six.

874
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,600
YEAN: I expect that I will rank up

875
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,280
YEAN: to the Top five.

876
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,680
YEAN: But I actually want to be
in the Top three.

877
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,600
MIKE: Alright then.

878
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,160
MIKE: We will start with the third place.

879
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,800
MIKE: I wanted to ask YEAN.

880
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,160
MIKE: You are always the MVP
in every stage.

881
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,400
MIKE: But you have never been
in the Top three before.

882
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,480
MIKE: What gives you
the confidence this week?

883
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,160
YEAN: Honestly...

884
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,920
YEAN: I took a lot of courage

885
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,480
YEAN: to stand here.

886
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,720
YEAN: I'm here because the Top three is
where I want to be.

887
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,240
YEAN: I want everyone to believe in me

888
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,560
YEAN: that I can do it.

889
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,320
YEAN: And honestly,
I'm also a little embarrassed

890
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,160
YEAN: to be standing here

891
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,480
YEAN: because I don't know what to say.

892
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,040
YEAN: Maybe there are many people who...

893
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,080
YEAN: think that I may not deserve this.

894
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,800
YEAN: But I feel that
all of my performance

895
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,960
YEAN: has answered everyone's questions

896
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,480
YEAN: about why I chose to stand here.

897
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,640
YEAN: I want everyone
to believe in me that

898
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,960
YEAN: if they choose to vote for me,

899
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,760
YEAN: I will be able to make it
to the Top three.

900
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,560
MIKE: Okay, next.

901
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,040
MIKE: ELYN

902
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:41,120
MIKE: You are only one rank from three.

903
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,960
MIKE: How confident are you?

904
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,800
ELYN: The reason why I stepped down
at first.

905
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:52,320
ELYN: Because I got fifth
for my first elimination.

906
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,800
ELYN: And then four
for my second elimination.

907
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,240
ELYN: So, this time,
for third elimination,

908
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,640
ELYN: I'm going one step higher

909
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,600
ELYN: and hopefully I can get third.

910
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,720
DIDI: Yeah, ELYN.

911
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,600
DIDI: ELYN

912
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,520
JAOYING: You got it.

913
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,640
MIKE: PAILIU

914
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,120
PAILIU: Honestly,

915
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,320
PAILIU: I feel like if this is the final,

916
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,440
PAILIU: where I want to be the most

917
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,200
PAILIU: is the Top 3.

918
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,040
PAILIU: So I chose to stand here.

919
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,200
PAILIU: I want to stand there.

920
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,680
PAILIU: I want to go back to Top three.

921
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,160
KRISTA: So I thought like

922
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,040
KRISTA: I have to believe in myself

923
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,840
KRISTA: because if I don't believe
in myself,

924
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,280
KRISTA: then no one can believe in me.

925
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,120
R-JING: I believe in you.

926
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,360
MIKE: Anyways,

927
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:41,880
MIKE: First, I will be announcing
ranking three.

928
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,680
ELYN: Tickles the heart.

929
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,680
MIKE: Oh, actually,

930
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,680
MIKE: She's already standing
in number three.

931
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,840
- YEAN: ELYN
- KRISTA: ELYN

932
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,560
MIKE: And she's in the Top three
for the first time.

933
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,960
MIKE: And all her performances

934
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,920
MIKE: All three stages

935
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,160
MIKE: are very excellent.

936
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,000
ELYN: MVP girl.

937
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,920
- ELYN: MVP girl.
- MIKE: As I said, she's already standing there.

938
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,640
MIKE: Ranking number three is...

939
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,200
MIKE: Congratulations, YEAN!

940
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,040
MIKE: You are in the Top three,
number three!

941
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,600
MIKE: Please proceed to your rank.

942
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,800
TRAINEES: Good job.

943
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,360
YEAN: I was so surprised.

944
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,840
YEAN: I was going to cry.

945
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,120
YEAN: Because I always say that

946
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,320
YEAN: I really want to be
in the Top three.

947
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,280
YEAN: I never thought that today

948
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,680
YEAN: I will get to stand in that place

949
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,440
YEAN: I am so happy.

950
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,800
YEAN: I almost... I tried to not cry but

951
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,080
YEAN: I couldn't hold my tears.

952
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,120
YEAN: But I really tried to hold the tears.

953
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,320
YEAN: But I was very happy.

954
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,480
JEFF: Actually, she's not only
good at singing.

955
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,800
JEFF: I think she's all rounder.

956
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,720
JEFF: She can do everyting.

957
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,120
JEFF: And what makes her shine
so much is that

958
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,720
JEFF: she knows herself, knows who she is.

959
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:01,880
JEFF: And she has charisma

960
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,400
JEFF: in bringing that part of her
out on stage

961
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,880
JEFF: and making people see and
love YEAN's personality.

962
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,720
JEFF: I'm not surprised.

963
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,960
JEFF: I feel that she really deserves it.

964
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,600
NENE: Yes. YEAN.

965
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:17,720
NENE: Because you get the third rank
for the first time,

966
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,040
NENE: I would like YEAN

967
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,680
NENE: to choose between EMMA
and WANG KE, just one of them,

968
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,640
NENE: to be announced their rank.

969
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,880
NENE: Just one person.

970
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,400
MIKE: Whose ranking do you want
to be announced first?

971
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,880
MIKE: You can choose either of them.

972
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,960
MIKE: WANG KE or EMMA.

973
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,920
YEAN: Oh, it's so hard.

974
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,760
WANG KE: It's alright.

975
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,080
YEAN: Who wants to know?

976
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,600
YEAN: Okay, EMMA.

977
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,760
YEAN: At the time I was deciding
who to be announced

978
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,840
YEAN: between WANG KE and EMMA,

979
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,040
YEAN: I chose EMMA

980
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,480
YEAN: because she raised her hand.

981
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,280
YEAN: She raised her hand, so I chose her.

982
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,000
EMMA: I just don't wanna wait.

983
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,920
EMMA: Just... yeah.

984
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,680
YEAN: Actually, in my mind I already
wanted to choose EMMA,

985
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,880
YEAN: because her latest rank
isn't in the top three.

986
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,720
YEAN: So, I want to announce
the ranking for her

987
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,840
YEAN: so that she will get higher ranking

988
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,160
YEAN: than the ranking she used to be in.

989
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,880
YEAN: And I believe in WANG KE that

990
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,360
YEAN: she will be able to get ranked up.

991
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,760
TRAINEES: Yeah.

992
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,760
MIKE: In my hand, there's ... err,
I don't know what this is called,

993
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,920
MIKE: but the ranking is inside.

994
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:27,640
YEAN: I have to open it, right?

995
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,400
MIKE: YEAN, you can open it.

996
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,240
- MIKE: EMMA, are you excited?
- EMMA: Of course.

997
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,920
MIKE: Don't be excited.

998
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,800
EMMA: Is it good?

999
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,240
PAILIU: Top nine?

1000
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,520
KRISTA: For sure.

1001
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,600
- YEAN: ZHU YIMENG
- EMMA: Hi.

1002
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,240
YEAN: Congratulations

1003
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,280
YEAN: Your ranking is...

1004
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,200
YEAN: Ten.

1005
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,600
MIKE: Congratulations. Congratulations.

1006
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,200
MIKE: Your ranking is tenth.

1007
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,440
ILENE: EMMA

1008
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,520
EMMA: I'm bit sad.

1009
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,200
EMMA: I, honestly, think that

1010
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,840
EMMA: I can be in the top nine.

1011
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,400
EMMA: But perhaps it's because

1012
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,200
EMMA: everyone hasn't seen
every side of me yet,

1013
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,000
EMMA: so I feel ...

1014
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,800
EMMA: a bit sad.

1015
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,040
JEFF: Now it's the final moment.

1016
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,720
JEFF: Who will be in the top one?

1017
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,120
JEFF: So, as you see here

1018
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,520
JEFF: that new one in top three

1019
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,720
JEFF: and also in Number One area

1020
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,400
JEFF: ILENE

1021
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,360
JEFF: So, you see RUAN and YIYU?

1022
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,440
JEFF: They're both in ranking
Number One and Number Two.

1023
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,680
JEFF: Why do you think that
you deserve to be here?

1024
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,160
JEFF: In Number One.

1025
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,040
ILENE: In fact, it is that

1026
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,960
ILENE: I've never been
in the top three before.

1027
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,200
ILENE: So, this time I want to dream on it.

1028
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,520
ILENE: But, I think I've tried
to practice very hard

1029
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:15,040
ILENE: and I want to believe
in myself for once

1030
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,000
ILENE: that I can go to the first rank.

1031
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:21,080
ILENE: Yet, the first is
such a very high ranking.

1032
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:25,000
ILENE: So, I just want to dream
on it for once.

1033
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,920
MINGMING: Chase your dream, baby.

1034
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,040
DIDI: ILENE, good job.

1035
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,400
MIKE: QIAO YI YU,

1036
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:36,200
MIKE: do you think between RUAN and you,

1037
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,720
MIKE: who is in the first ranking?

1038
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,640
QIAO YI YU: Definitely, I'm gonna say
it's me.

1039
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,760
QIAO YI YU: Sorry, IKEMA RUAN, but

1040
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,160
QIAO YI YU: it's like I have to push myself

1041
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,280
QIAO YI YU: keep pushing myself,

1042
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,480
QIAO YI YU: and I keep telling myself like

1043
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,240
QIAO YI YU: I love my fans.

1044
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,400
QIAO YI YU: I love this competition.

1045
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,440
QIAO YI YU: I also love myself, so

1046
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,440
QIAO YI YU: I think QIAO YI YU
deserves Top One.

1047
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,280
MIKE: RUAN, how do you think?

1048
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,400
RUAN: Since I came here,

1049
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,760
RUAN: I always wish to be the top one.

1050
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,280
RUAN: This time I tried my best
with the show.

1051
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,720
RUAN: Even if I have a much stronger
competitor than me like YI YU,

1052
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,360
RUAN: I will not give up on YI YU

1053
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,040
RUAN: in performing a cool show.

1054
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,920
RUAN: This time I want to be able
to chase the top one.

1055
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,880
JEFF: So, this, just wondering
one thing.

1056
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,120
JEFF: YI YU.

1057
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:31,560
QIAO YI YU: Yes.

1058
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,320
JEFF: The first time I see you

1059
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,760
JEFF: you're not this confident.

1060
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,680
QIAO YI YU: Yes. I've changed a lot.

1061
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,680
JEFF: Why?

1062
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,240
QIAO YI YU: Because winning, keep winning

1063
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,360
QIAO YI YU: gives me confidence.

1064
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,880
QIAO YI YU: And also the support,

1065
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,880
QIAO YI YU: the love, and also
the screaming

1066
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,360
QIAO YI YU: I heard my name coming
from their mouth.

1067
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,720
QIAO YI YU: All these things
give me confidence.

1068
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,200
QIAO YI YU: And I know that

1069
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,080
QIAO YI YU: "Oh, I'm pretty good actually."

1070
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,360
MINGMING: Yes, you are.

1071
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,840
- JEFF: But if you're not Number One this time,
- QIAO YI YU: Yeah.

1072
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,960
JEFF: would that make you less confident?

1073
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,120
QIAO YI YU: No, it's not gonna be,

1074
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:05,960
QIAO YI YU: because ...

1075
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,200
QIAO YI YU: it's not the end.

1076
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,120
- TRAINEES: Yeah.
- MIKE: Good answer, QIAO YI YU.

1077
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,000
QIAO YI YU: Thank you.

1078
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,240
QIAO YI YU: When I heard MENTOR JEFF
asked me that

1079
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,360
QIAO YI YU: if I hadn't been the top one,

1080
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,240
QIAO YI YU: I would be less confident
in myself or not.

1081
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,200
QIAO YI YU: After listening, I thought

1082
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,040
QIAO YI YU: this question was
definitely not ...

1083
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,120
QIAO YI YU: a random question.

1084
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,440
QIAO YI YU: Because if I fell short,

1085
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,160
QIAO YI YU: I might not actually be
the top one this time.

1086
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,840
- JEFF: So, QIAO YI YU.
- QIAO YI YU: Yes.

1087
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,280
JEFF: Since you're the ranking
number one last time,

1088
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,920
JEFF: who else, among the trainees
standing behind number one,

1089
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,440
JEFF: do you want to know the ranking?

1090
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:51,360
QIAO YI YU: I'll know
someone else' ranking first?

1091
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,760
- JEFF: Yes.
- QIAO YI YU: RUAN.

1092
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,000
JEFF: Okay.

1093
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,360
JEFF: So!

1094
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:05,800
QIAO YI YU: Okay.

1095
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,160
QIAO YI YU: IKEMA RUAN.

1096
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,600
QIAO YI YU: Congratulations.

1097
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,320
QIAO YI YU: Your new ranking is ...

1098
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,520
QIAO YI YU: Number Two.

1099
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,120
MIKE: Congratulations.

1100
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,880
RUAN: Actually, getting the second ranking
is what I want to thank for,

1101
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,600
RUAN: because it is a high ranking.

1102
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,160
RUAN: But, the fact that I cannot

1103
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,760
RUAN: chase number one any way

1104
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,800
RUAN: is still hurtful for me.

1105
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,080
RUAN: I would like to show the result

1106
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,640
RUAN: of my perseverance in the past

1107
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,320
RUAN: and up until now

1108
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,200
RUAN: with number one of the top one,

1109
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,840
RUAN: because the top one
is the greatest gift

1110
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,840
RUAN: that I can pay back to my fans.

1111
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,760
RUAN: I think so.

1112
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,280
RUAN: I myself will also be determined

1113
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,040
RUAN: to chase number one

1114
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,040
RUAN: without giving up.

1115
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:19,080
RUAN: All my fans have supported me a lot.

1116
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,560
RUAN: So, I think that next time
I will have to get number one.

1117
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,600
JEFF: Okay, so we're moving on

1118
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:31,120
JEFF: to announce the ranking number one.

1119
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,360
JEFF: Are you already excited?

1120
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,520
JEFF: Okay.

1121
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,720
DIDI: QIAO YI YU.

1122
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,880
JEFF: In this last elimination

1123
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,000
JEFF: the person who got the first place

1124
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,080
JEFF: in this elimination

1125
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,160
JEFF: is ...

1126
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,080
JEFF: Congratulations, QIAO YI YU.

1127
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,760
MIKE: Congratulations, QIAO YI YU.

1128
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,040
TRAINEES: QIAO YI YU.

1129
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,520
MIKE: You are the top one.

1130
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,280
- MIKE: Congratulations. Congratulations.
- QIAO YI YU: Thank you. Thank you.

1131
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,560
QIAO YI YU: Thank you so much.

1132
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:16,160
QIAO YI YU: It may be a feeling of relief.

1133
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,200
QIAO YI YU: Because in the previous round

1134
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,000
QIAO YI YU: that I'd got the first place
for the first time,

1135
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,720
QIAO YI YU: I felt I'd been scared
to believe it was real.

1136
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,880
QIAO YI YU: I think this time

1137
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,440
QIAO YI YU: is the second time
that I've got the first place.

1138
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,360
QIAO YI YU: It makes me feel like
"I, QIAO YI YU, deserve it actually."

1139
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,280
QIAO YI YU: But it's not because
it is my luck

1140
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,960
QIAO YI YU: or I suddenly

1141
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,600
QIAO YI YU: go to the top and fall down.
It hasn't changed that much.

1142
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:35,320
QIAO YI YU: It's not like that.

1143
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,960
QIAO YI YU: I think I will be able
to remain in this position

1144
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,120
QIAO YI YU: until the Final Stage.

1145
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,000
EMMA: Before coming here,

1146
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,600
EMMA: I ...

1147
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,640
EMMA: I am just an ordinary student

1148
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,520
EMMA: who studies.

1149
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,280
EMMA: I don't think I would have
a chance to come here

1150
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:57,520
EMMA: and .... there would be
another chance .... to ....

1151
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,160
EMMA: and can ...

1152
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,120
EMMA: and ...

1153
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:09,640
DIDI: EMMA.

1154
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,400
EMMA: I want to say that

1155
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,320
EMMA: I want to debut.

1156
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:18,200
EMMA: I don't want to stop just here.

1157
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,000
DIDI: Baby.

1158
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,800
DIDI: You can do it.

1159
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:25,200
EMMA: My goal is not just Top Nine.

1160
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,760
EMMA: I want to be in the top nine

1161
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:33,240
EMMA: and advance to the higher ranking.

1162
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,560
EMMA: I want more people to see me

1163
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:41,800
EMMA: and want to be a true shining idol.

1164
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,720
EMMA: Thank you guys.

1165
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,360
MIKE: Thank you, EMMA.

1166
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,800
MIKE: Next, YEAN.

1167
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:53,320
YEAN: Now I'm in the top three.

1168
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:00,120
YEAN: I want to thank everyone so much.

1169
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,520
YEAN: I know how hard everyone has to work

1170
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:07,040
YEAN: in order to send me
to stand at this point.

1171
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:11,400
YEAN: And I want to be in the top three

1172
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,440
YEAN: until the end,
until the last minute.

1173
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:18,360
YEAN: I want everyone to help
support me until the end

1174
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,600
YEAN: and let's fight together
in the debut round.

1175
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,200
YEAN: To my Chinese fans,

1176
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,200
YEAN: thank you guys for trying so hard

1177
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,400
YEAN: to support me.

1178
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,320
YEAN: Now I'm not only

1179
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,240
YEAN: a wicked vocalist,

1180
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,360
YEAN: but I'm also all rounder.

1181
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,760
YEAN: I could get...

1182
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,640
YEAN: the MVP for four times.

1183
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,040
YEAN: I want to get higher.

1184
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:56,360
YEAN: Could you guys help me debut?

1185
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,360
YEAN: Could you guys

1186
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:09,640
YEAN: walk side by side with me

1187
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,400
YEAN: until the debut day?

1188
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,440
- TRAINEES: Yes, we could.
- YEAN: Thank you, everyone.

1189
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,680
- MIKE: Thank you. Thank you, YEAN.
- WANG SHENG XI: YEAN.

1190
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,720
MIKE: Next, RUAN.

1191
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,840
RUAN: First of all,

1192
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,160
RUAN: thank all of my fans

1193
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,000
RUAN: for voting for me until I get
the second rank.

1194
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,160
RUAN: I think the CENTER of the THEME SONG

1195
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,480
RUAN: mostly will get into a high rank

1196
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,560
RUAN: or be the top one.

1197
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:43,320
RUAN: Because of that, I think I need to be
the top one.

1198
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:46,440
RUAN: I have pressure that
if I don't express RUAN

1199
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,680
RUAN: in new ways,

1200
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,360
RUAN: the fans will slowly disappear.

1201
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,280
RUAN: This time

1202
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:59,160
RUAN: I fought until the end
until my body couldn't bear it.

1203
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,720
RUAN: But, for me, at that moment,

1204
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,480
RUAN: both of my thoughts about

1205
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,840
RUAN: the reason why I want
to be the top one,

1206
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,120
RUAN: and the reason why I want
to debut here that much,

1207
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,360
RUAN: I come back to think
through all of those.

1208
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,400
RUAN: To me, the first place is a tribute
to all the hard work

1209
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:23,040
RUAN: and a big thank you to all the fans.

1210
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,640
RUAN: Because of this, I hope that
I will be in the first place.

1211
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,600
RUAN: Until the very end, I would like
to be able to chase number one.

1212
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:39,680
RUAN: Please keep supporting me and
I will not disappoint you at all.

1213
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,080
RUAN: Let's see
that beautiful picture together.

1214
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,000
RUAN: Thank you.

1215
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:45,960
TRAINEES: RUAN.

1216
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,200
MIKE: Thank you so much.

1217
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:49,560
MIKE: QIAO YI YU,

1218
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,560
QIAO YI YU: Hello, everyone.
I am the top one, QIAO YI YU.

1219
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,600
DIDI: QIAO YI YU.

1220
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,960
QIAO YI YU: Firstly, I need to thank
all the fans

1221
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,680
QIAO YI YU: who take me
to this high ranking again.

1222
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,120
QIAO YI YU: You guys are really
working so hard.

1223
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,240
QIAO YI YU: Last time I stood here
and said that

1224
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,360
QIAO YI YU: QIAO YI YU
จะยืนอยู่ตรงนี้ไม่ขยับไปไหน

1225
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:11,280
QIAO YI YU: I really didn't think
I could keep my place here.

1226
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:15,200
QIAO YI YU: Therefore, today I would like
to emphasize to everyone once again that

1227
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,720
QIAO YI YU: I, QIAO YI YU, will protect and
maintain the top one position from now on.

1228
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,920
QIAO YI YU: No one else can take me
down from here.

1229
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,000
- TRAINEES: Good speech.
- DIDI: Great speech.

1230
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,320
QIAO YI YU: Because my goal

1231
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,040
QIAO YI YU: is to make my debut
as the center position.

1232
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:27,800
TRAINEES: Very good.

1233
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:31,240
QIAO YI YU: And after going
through many performances,

1234
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,720
QIAO YI YU: I've unlocked
so many new styles

1235
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,160
QIAO YI YU: for QIAO YI YU.

1236
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,160
QIAO YI YU: I want to step
out of my comfort zone,

1237
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,920
QIAO YI YU: to make myself proud,

1238
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,040
QIAO YI YU: and I hope that

1239
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,480
QIAO YI YU: all of you who love me

1240
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,720
QIAO YI YU: will be proud
of QIAO YI YU as well.

1241
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,200
QIAO YI YU: In the days to come,

1242
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,920
QIAO YI YU: I must do better than today,

1243
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,920
QIAO YI YU: better than myself today.

1244
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,880
QIAO YI YU: May everyone who loves me
rest assured that

1245
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,360
QIAO YI YU: I will definitely
improve myself.

1246
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,480
QIAO YI YU: Because I want to tell
everyone that

1247
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:59,040
QIAO YI YU: QIAO YI YU is worthy
of the top one.

1248
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:00,120
QIAO YI YU: Thank you, everyone.

1249
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:02,720
TRAINEES: Great speech, QIAO YI YU.

1250
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,360
MIKE: Well, about QIAO YI YU,

1251
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:06,200
MIKE: actually, I can tell
since the first day.

1252
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,760
MIKE: This girl who...

1253
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:11,400
MIKE: Honestly, I don't dare approach
or get close to her

1254
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,600
MIKE: because of her calm face

1255
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:17,240
MIKE: or because she has some vibes ...

1256
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,640
MIKE: that makes people
around her feel that

1257
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:20,720
MIKE: she's unapproachable

1258
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,240
MIKE: But today, at the present time,
right now,

1259
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,560
MIKE: something has changed within her.

1260
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:30,920
MIKE: There's something that make her
more approachable,

1261
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,160
MIKE: yet remain being herself

1262
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,000
MIKE: who is more confident.

1263
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,560
MIKE: So, I think now

1264
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,880
MIKE: she has developed to another level,

1265
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:38,880
MIKE: and I believe that

1266
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:43,840
MIKE: she is a person who is well-prepared
for the FINAL round.
