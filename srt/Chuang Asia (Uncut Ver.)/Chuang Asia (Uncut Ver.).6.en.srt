MIKE: Hello, all trainees.

15
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,520

16
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,640

00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,560

TRAINEES: Yes.

21
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,640

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,240
MIKE: For the second stage,

24
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,160
MIKE: the performance will be divided
into different positions.

25
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,520
MIKE: Each position
consists of different songs.

26
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,640
MIKE: We have eight songs in total.

27
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,040
MIKE: This time, you are free to choose
the position you want

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,880
MIKE: according to your own preferences.

29
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,928
JEFF: There are vocal and dance positions.

30
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,240
WANG KE: Main vocal.

31
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,240
YEAN: But I'll go for dance.

32
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,320
WANG KE: You'll go for dance?

33
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,080
WANG KE: Really?

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,040
ILENE: It's quite hard to choose.

35
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,600
KRISTA: I come to CHUANG

36
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,720
KRISTA: because I want everyone
to hear my voice.

37
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,040
MIKE: Alright. So, let's check out vocal.

38
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,000
KRISTA: I'm excited.
JESSICA: Oh, my God.

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,400
(The rule of Stage 2 position evaluation.)

40
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,920
(There'll be three positions.)

41
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,360
(First position, vocal.)

42
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,840
KRISTA: I love this song.

43
00:01:56,032 --> 00:02:00,800
TRAINEES: ♪Love me like you do,
l-l-love me like you do♪

44
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,760
TRAINEES: ♪Love me like you do,
l-l-love me like you do♪

45
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,600
RUAN: Memo.

46
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,760
MIKE: Let's move on to the next song.

47
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,840
YEAN: Famous song in Thailand.

48
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,280
(Music - KR)

49
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,400
WANG SHENG XI: Unnie (sister).

50
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,560
CAITH: Do you know it?
DUNA: Yes,

51
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,880
DUNA: I've listened to it.

52
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,280
WANG KE: DUNA DUNA

53
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,720
PREAM: Is this the song you like?

54
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,720
JESSICA: I love this song so much.
KRISTA: It's so pretty.

55
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,600
MIKE: That's all vocal songs.

56
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,760
JEFF: There'll be three songs for vocal
that we've just listened to.

57
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,800
JEFF: It's in all different languages.

58
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,960
JEFF: Choose wisely.

59
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,280
MIKE: So, I guess, let's move on
to the dance position.

60
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,440
MIKE: The first song is

61
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,280
PAILIU: Wow.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,320
MINGMING: Oh, WANG KE.

63
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,120
MINGMING: That's sexy.
WANG KE: I like this song.

64
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,680
ILENE: I love it.

65
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,200
TRAINEES: BARBIE?

66
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,160
CHACHA: The song we learned at SM.

67
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,800
MIKE: So, as I mentioned earlier,

68
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,120
MIKE: we'll have eight songs for Stage 2.

69
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,720
MIKE: But now we only see
seven songs, right?

70
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,200
MIKE: What position will be the last song?

71
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,880
MIKE: What else do you guys wanna try?

72
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,760
TRAINEES: Rap.

73
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,680
YEAN: Musical.

74
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,760
MIKE: Musical?

75
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,880
MIKE: Interesting.

76
00:03:31,392 --> 00:03:34,800
MIKE: Today, we will have
a surprise for everyone.

77
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,320
MIKE: We'll add a very special position

78
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,000
MIKE: that has never been seen
in CHUANG before.

79
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:47,480
JEFF: So, I think
there're many countries here.

80
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,360
JEFF: Differences in beauty.

81
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,240
JEFF: We don't have beauty standard.

82
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,440
JEFF: It's just confidence, charming,

83
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,960
JEFF: your personal charm.

84
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,016
JEFF: So, you can be your own beauty.

85
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,960
MIKE: So, this is also
one of the star qualities

86
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,720
MIKE: that we are seeking in an idol.

87
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,816
MIKE: If anyone is confident
about their own charm,

88
00:04:07,904 --> 00:04:11,040
MIKE: this position is
an interesting option too.

89
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,680
MIKE: And it is...

90
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,920
MIKE: VISUAL!

91
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,920
LILIANA LI: And what first came
into my mind for visual

92
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,416
LILIANA LI: was just posting at the camera

93
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:34,880
LILIANA LI: or something. I couldn't.
I don't really know how they would do this whole visual choice.

94
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,640
TRAINEES: I didn't know that before.

95
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,928
ELYN: I think it's not only you have to be
good at dance, you have to be good at vocal.

96
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,920
ELYN: It's how you
express yourself on stage.

97
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,800
ELYN: And I think
that is really important.

98
00:04:49,472 --> 00:04:52,992
MIKE: So, let's take a look
at the music clip

99
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,136
MIKE: in this visual position.

100
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,160
(And last position, visual.)

101
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,400
(Trainees will have to pull off
their style and outstanding charisma)

102
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,200
(as much as possible.)

103
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,160
JAOYING: I love this song.

104
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,320
PANGJANG: Oh, my God.

105
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,400
PRAWW: I really like this song.
PANGJANG: I like it too.

106
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,272
ELYN: It's also dance.

107
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,600
COCO: RINRIN.

108
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
REI: RINKA.

109
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,064
XUEYAO: This is also pretty.

110
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,584
WANG SHENG XI: Wow, I like it.

111
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,840
ELYN: I actually wanted
to challenge myself.

112
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,520
ELYN: Something different.

113
00:05:29,888 --> 00:05:32,960
WANG SHENG XI: Actually, I listened
to what mentors said.

114
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,120
WANG SHENG XI: For this position,

115
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,440
WANG SHENG XI: we have to show
our best side, the most charming side.

116
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,440
NENE: Singing and dancing
are crucial skills.

117
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,240
NENE: However, if you want to be seen
and remembered,

118
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,464
NENE: you must have
your own distinct color

119
00:05:46,464 --> 00:05:49,408
NENE: that all mentors
always mentioned earlier.

120
00:05:49,408 --> 00:05:52,960
NENE: The term visual
goes beyond just looking pretty.

121
00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:57,120
NENE: A visually appealing idol
not only have an attractive appearance,

122
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,968
NENE: but also possesses unique charm,

123
00:06:04,352 --> 00:06:08,064
NENE: So, it's not just
about the pretty face,

124
00:06:08,064 --> 00:06:10,440
NENE: but the beauty inside you guys.

125
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,120
MIKE: Now, it's time
to make your own choice.

126
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,680
MIKE: Each of you will be receiving
an application form to fill in.

127
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,520
LILIANA LI: What?

128
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,440
MIKE: Your first, second
and third song choices.

129
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,480
DIDI: I wanna challenge myself
in a different way.

130
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,800
KRISTA: JASMINE, what are you choosing?

131
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,240
ELYN: They do this a lot.

132
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,680
WANG KE: No.

133
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,640
MINGMING: I can't choose.

134
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,120
PAILIU: DO YOU is interesting.

135
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,120
YEAN: I think AIN'T MY FAULT
is harder than WHIP.

136
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,080
JAOYING: I'll choose YOU WERE BEAUTIFUL.

137
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,000
JASMINE: No, I don't choose
what you choose.

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
REI: We have to try.

139
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,360
ILENE: I think AIN'T MY FAULY first.

140
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,640
TRAINEES: Not a lot of people
will choose ZULU PAKA.

141
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,200
PAILIU: I'm hesitant how I'll rank it

142
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,800
PAILIU: because we have to rank it.

143
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,480
LILIANA LI: For this time,
it was really difficult

144
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,880
LILIANA LI: compared to the first stage.

145
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,320
JACKSON: Now, let's start with class A.

146
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,360
PAILIU: Let's go.

147
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,560
PAILIU: Let's go.

148
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,840
♪TRAINEES: Baby you're not Bad Bad
Maybe 'cause I'm Badder♪

149
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,320
RINKA: Together.

150
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,160
KRISTA: You...Oh.

151
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,000
KRISTA: You're Thai.
RINKA: Yes, I'm Thai.

152
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,320
MIKE: Okay. So, now we got
the first nine trainees

153
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,640
MIKE: selected all the songs
in their first choices.

154
00:07:27,936 --> 00:07:30,800
MIKE: We are going to make it
a little more interesting.

155
00:07:31,392 --> 00:07:31,760
JACKSON: Really?

156
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:37,088
MIKE: The trainee that has
the highest ranking in the song

157
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,904
MIKE: will automatically become
the team leader.

158
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,840
MIKE: So, Congratulations to PAILIU,

159
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,040
MIKE: you become
the team leader of AIN'T MY FAULT.

160
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:54,160
MIKE: And QIAO YI YU, RINKA and YEAN.

161
00:07:54,624 --> 00:07:57,280
MIKE: ELYN and LU YUTING

162
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,640
MIKE: You guys are the team leaders.

163
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,720
MIKE: Congratulations!

164
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,720
JEFF: We move on to number 10 to 19.

165
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:08,560
JEFF: You go to your first choice of song.

166
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,720
JACKSON: Let's go.

167
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,320
DIDI: CHACHA.

168
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,840
LISSA: LOVE ME LIKE YOU DO is full.

169
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,600
YEAN: We're together again.

170
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,960
JEFF: Okay.

171
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,240
JEFF: So, we move on to 20 to 29.
Go to your first choice.

172
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,200
JEFF: Go to your first choice.

173
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,000
JAOYING: I'm happy.

174
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,400
LISSA: 7 RINGS.

175
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,960
EMMA: Here I come.
WANG KE: Here I come.

176
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,280
PAILIU: Welcome, lady.

177
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,560
ILENE: I choose the dance position
as my first choice

178
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,000
ILENE: because I think that's
what I'm most confident about.

179
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,960
ILENE: I can show my potential the most.

180
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,360
MINGMING: That's very Thai.

181
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,920
R-JING: Oh, yes.

182
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:10,360
JEFF: So, the last, 30 to 34,
come down and go to your first choice.

183
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,680
ILENE: PRAEW.

184
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,160
YEAN: Hello, sister.

185
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,680
NENE: So, the five of you.
First, I wanna say that

186
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,480
NENE: don't feel bad with yourselves
that you got the lowest ranks

187
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,200
NENE: because I think
this is just the beginning.

188
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,640
NENE: You can change it.

189
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,560
NENE: And this is your last chance.
Make it worth.

190
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,360
TRAINEES: WHIP?

191
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,760
PAILIU: YUI.

192
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,576
TRAINEES: R-JING

193
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,400
MIKE: Okay.
NENE: Why are you alone here?

194
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,368
JASMINE: I'm happy that everyone
gives attention to this song.

195
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,840
MIKE: Alright, guys, as you can see,

196
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,960
MIKE: for example, LOVE ME LIKE YOU DO,

197
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,160
MIKE: there are more members.

198
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,600
MIKE: So, I'll be announcing
the second rule.

199
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,920
MIKE: The second rule is

200
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,200
MIKE: The team leader has the right

201
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,440
MIKE: to decide

202
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,320
MIKE: who stays in the song
and who leaves.

203
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,760
TRAINEES: Oh, my God.

204
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,960
YEAN: No.

205
00:10:21,952 --> 00:10:24,480
PAILIU: If you ask me if it's fair or not,
I think it's fair.

206
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,480
PAILIU: But on the other hand,
I also think it's a little mean.

207
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,520
PAILIU: I was in class F before.

208
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,256
PAILIU: I was the last to choose.

209
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:35,760
PAILIU: And I had to choose the songs
that I might not be good at.

210
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,720
YEAN: A lot of people have fought
for this position.

211
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,080
YEAN: Some people's fans voted for them
to rank in the high positions

212
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,520
YEAN: for their loved ones
to have the right to choose the song

213
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,128
YEAN: that they want.

214
00:10:48,128 --> 00:10:51,560
YEAN: But when it's the decision
of one person

215
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,800
YEAN: to decide who leaves,

216
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
YEAN: I think it's a little unfair.

217
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,440
MIKE: Not just that.

218
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,440
MIKE: The person who gets rejected

219
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,120
MIKE: on their first choice

220
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,520
MIKE: will have to proceed
to their second choice right away.

221
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,248
MIKE: And if you get rejected
on your second choice,

222
00:11:09,696 --> 00:11:11,168
MIKE: you have to go to your third choice.

223
00:11:11,776 --> 00:11:13,888
MIKE: And in the worst case,

224
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,720
MIKE: if you get rejected both
on your second choice and third choice,

225
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,480
MIKE: you have to go to stand on the side

226
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,200
MIKE: and wait
until the end of the arrangement.

227
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,064
QIAO YI YU: I won't kick anyone out.

228
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,160
TEGAN: I want WHIP IT. Don't pick me.

229
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:30,720
- TEGAN: Yes, don't pick me.
- COCO: Don't pick me.

230
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,120
MIKE: RINKA, please.

231
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,200
RINKA: Three minutes.

232
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,000
JACKSON: Okay. You have four minutes.

233
00:11:41,216 --> 00:11:42,336
COCO: What?

234
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,040
KRISTA: You can choose anyone.

235
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,680
KRISTA: It's your choice.

236
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,520
MAMCÙ: It's up to you.

237
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,480
RINKA: But actually, I want to do
LOVE ME LIKE YOU DO with you.

238
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,704
TEGAN: But I don't want to.

239
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,760
TEGAN: We can in the future stage.

240
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,280
TEGAN: And outside of CHUANG,
we can pick whatever song you want.

241
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,800
TEGAN: But now, here, I don't want to
LOVE ME LIKE YOU DO.

242
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,120
TEGAN: I beg you. I'll get on my knee.

243
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,560
RINKA: Okay.

244
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,600
TEGAN: And you can decide in your brain
and say it.

245
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,680
TRAINEES: Yes, don't tell us.

246
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,720
TEGAN: You don't have to say it.

247
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,280
KRISTA: It's your choice. Anyone.

248
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,280
TEGAN: It's okay.

249
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,440
LILIANA LI: It doesn't matter
what we think.

250
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,160
KRISTA: Yes, just what you want.

251
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,600
TEGAN: Get me out of here.

252
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,080
RINKAL Okay.

253
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,720
JACKSON: Okay. Time is up.

254
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,040
JACKSON: RINKA, your decision is...

255
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,360
RINKA: The first member is LISSA.

256
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,824
JACKSON: Okay.
RINKA: Yes.

257
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,560
LISSA: I was really surprised

258
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,040
LISSA: because I didn't think
she'd want to work with me.

259
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,000
LISSA: Thank you, RINKA.

260
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,880
RINKA: The second choice is KRISTA.

261
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,680
RINKA: Yes.

262
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,720
JACKSON: Okay.

263
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,800
RINKA: And...

264
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,160
MIKE: Last one.

265
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,880
RINKA: Third choice is MAMCÙ

266
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,240
MIKE: Now, the rest of you,
please go to your second choice.

267
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,240
TEGAN: So, my first choice originally
was LOVE ME LIKE YOU DO.

268
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,160
TEGAN: But when I saw WHIP IT,

269
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,080
TEGAN: there was something in me
that told me "You have to do this song."

270
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,360
TEGAN: Like "You have to challenge yourself."

271
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,280
TEGAN: It could possibly determine
if I stay here or go.

272
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,600
JACKSON: Okay, now we have...
LOVE ME LIKE YOU DO is complete.

273
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,560
KRISTA: Let's do it.

274
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,960
LISSA: Let's make this the best song.

275
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,800
MIKE: Alright, PAILIU.

276
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,272
PAILIU: I'm so sorry... So sorry, guys.

277
00:13:29,312 --> 00:13:32,480
MIKE: Or you can say
who you want to do this song with.

278
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,960
DIDI: Pick the ones you want.
Trust yourself.

279
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,760
PAILIU: DIDI, CHACHA.

280
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,080
MIKE: CHACHA.

281
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,080
PAILIU: AKINA.

282
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,080
XUEYAO: I'm so confident

283
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,800
XUEYAO because I think

284
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,360
XUEYAO: I can do AIN'T MY FAULT.

285
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,240
XUEYAO: I'll put my energy,

286
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,080
XUEYAO: more energy to this performance.

287
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,520
XUEYAO: And I think I can do it very well

288
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,080
XUEYAO: and

289
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,600
XUEYAO: shine more than anyone

290
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,696
XUEYAO: because this is my dance style.

291
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,640
PAILIU: YUI.

292
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,920
XUEYAO: I believe next time, I may

293
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,856
XUEYAO: do well and surprise people.

294
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,360
XUEYAO: But I didn't get the chance.

295
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,520
PAILIU: And XUEYAO,

296
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,008
PAILIU: she looked at me like this.

297
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,280
PAILIU: Actually, to be fair,

298
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,440
PAILIU: it should be
the first five rankings

299
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,920
PAILIU: to be fair, right?

300
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,880
PAILIU: We had a practice before this.

301
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,760
PAILIU: And I've always
practiced with YUI.

302
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,680
PAILIU: Even if she didn't know
if she'd get this song,

303
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,576
PAILIU: she gave it her all from the beginning.

304
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,040
JAOYING: XUEYAO told me

305
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,600
JAOYING: that PAILIU said

306
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,760
JAOYING: XUEYAO didn't go to practice.

307
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,440
JAOYING: But actually, she always went.

308
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,360
JAOYING: It's like,
these things can happen

309
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,720
JAOYING: because if they go to practice
in different times,

310
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,544
JAOYING: they wouldn't know how much
the other people work.

311
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,720
JAOYING: Yes.

312
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,072
JAOYING: So, I feel like it's not

313
00:14:51,648 --> 00:14:52,768
JAOYING: that fair.

314
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,920
JACKSON: MAO MAO and XIXI,
please move on to your second pick.

315
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,360
JACKSON:JACKSON: Okay.
So, AIN'T MY FAULT is complete.

316
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:02,440
JACKSON:JACKSON: Okay.
So, AIN'T MY FAULT is complete.

317
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,040
DIDI: Yeah.

318
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,600
MIKE: And YOU WERE BEAUTIFUL,
you can only have five.

319
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,040
YEAN: Do you want to stay here?

320
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,840
LILIANA LI: Yes.

321
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,320
YEAN: Having to turn my back
and say who's gonna be with me

322
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,080
YEAN: is very difficult for me.

323
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,832
YEAN: And I feel very bad.

324
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,160
R-JING: Choose from your heart
how you want the performance to be.

325
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,720
R-JING: Choose who you want.

326
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,920
LILIANA LI: This is your time
to manipulate it

327
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,160
LILIANA LI: and benefit you.

328
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,504
R-JING: Yes, let's go.

329
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,280
JACKSON: Okay. Time is up.

330
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,680
JAOYING: I can't go.
ACARE: What can I do?

331
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,760
MIKE: YEAN, it's time to choose.

332
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,080
YEAN: JAOYING.

333
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,656
YEAN: The second one is...

334
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,360
YEAN: LILIANA LI.

335
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,360
JACKSON: The third.

336
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,920
YEAN: DUNA.

337
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,440
MIKE: One more last one.

338
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,400
YEAN: Sorry.
