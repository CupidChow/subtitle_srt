about the fans only.

about yourself?

76
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,680
MIKE: Please stand up.

77
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,480
MIKE: Do not worry.
This will not affect anything.

78
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,080
YUAN KE: Actually, I'm quite nervous.

79
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,840
LU YUTING:
But all the missions are difficult.

80
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,440
LU YUTING: So, I hope at least
I'll have enough points to survive.

81
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,680
KANOMPANG: I believe
everyone has their own timing.

82
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,480
KANOMPANG: Now may not be my time.

83
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,120
GRACE: There are a lot
of talented people here.

84
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,520
GRACE: And I'm not very good.

85
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,160
R-JING: Mm...

86
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,560
R-JING: I think anything can happen.

87
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,080
R-JING: There's nothing that...

88
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,000
R-JING: I can't be sure
that I can stay in this show.

89
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,280
JACKSON: Okay, let me just ask
few more questions.

90
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,680
JACKSON: Everybody here,

91
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,560
JACKSON: you think you'll be qualified,

92
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,960
JACKSON: but just not Top 9. Am I right?

93
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,200
TRAINEES: Yes.

94
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,560
JACKSON: See you guys later.

95
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,960
JACKSON: Okay?

96
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,120
PIMMIE: I think I can go through,

97
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,800
PIMMIE: maybe as one of the lowest ranks
that can pass.

98
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,280
JACKSON: Okay.

99
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,440
CAITH: Yeah.

100
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,800
JACKSON: How dare you?

101
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,120
JACKSON: Just kidding.

102
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,560
JACKSON: What questions
do you guys wanna ask?

103
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,920
NENE: DIDI, what do you wanna ask?

104
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,240
DIDI: I'd like to ask if the mentors

105
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,800
DIDI: think I am suitable
to be in a girl group?

106
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,280
DIDI: Because I feel like
I wish I can do better

107
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,560
DIDI: during each time and each show. So,

108
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,200
DIDI: I wanna also push myself
to be in this place

109
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,280
DIDI: and to learn more techniques.

110
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,240
JACKSON: There's never the right answer.

111
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,440
JACKSON: I was an athlete.

112
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,400
JACKSON: I was fencing. I was a fencer.

113
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,000
JACKSON: And now I'm an artist, right?

114
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,720
JACKSON: And then who knows?

115
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,080
JACKSON: Maybe what's the...
Am I really suitable for this?

116
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,640
JACKSON: Maybe five years later,
I'm going to be a swimmer.

117
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,760
JACKSON: You never know. You know?

118
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,120
JACKSON: You just never know.

119
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,240
JACKSON: Sometimes, just...

120
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,960
DIDI: Go with the flow?
JACKSON: Go with the flow.

121
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,200
NENE: I think DIDI can be everything.

122
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,440
LISSA: If I ask my friends
what do I come off as,

123
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,200
LISSA: one of the first few things
they'll say is

124
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,760
LISSA: "Oh, you're a funny girl."

125
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,480
LISSA: But I wanna come of as like,
serious, sometimes. You know.

126
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,600
LISSA: I wanna make people think

127
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,240
LISSA: So,

128
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,840
LISSA: from your perspective,

129
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,040
LISSA: do you see me...

130
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,280
TRAINEE: We see you seriously.
TRAINEE: Yeah.

131
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,280
JACKSON: I... yeah.

132
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,880
JACKSON: Oh, my God.
I've been through the same thing

133
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,120
JACKSON: but you go first, NENE.

134
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,920
LISSA: I'm an ugly crier but then...

135
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,400
ILENE: You're not an ugly crier.

136
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,200
ILENE: You're the most beautiful girl
that cries. Oh, my God.

137
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,480
LISSA: I wanna stop crying.

138
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,840
LISSA: I wanna stop crying,
so, I can ask the questions.

139
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,952
JACKSON: I want to tell you
about when I first debuted.

140
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,800
JACKSON: I've been on many variety shows.

141
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,392
JACKSON: I've been on a lot of TV shows.

142
00:07:35,808 --> 00:07:38,560
JACKSON: Sometimes I was the MC, sometimes a guest.

143
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,040
JACKSON: And I have a funny...

144
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,536
JACKSON: personality too,

145
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,480
JACKSON: which isn't a bad thing, you know?
It's a part of you.

146
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,680
JACKSON: They just saw that side of you
more than the others.

147
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,720
JACKSON: Do you get what I mean?

148
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,760
JACKSON: And in your career, you still have
ten to twenty more years until the day you die.

149
00:08:06,592 --> 00:08:10,360
JACKSON: You still have plenty of time
to let people know you.

150
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,560
JACKSON: Don't show people
every side of you at once.

151
00:08:15,744 --> 00:08:17,472
JACKSON: It must take time.

152
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,536
JACKSON: There's always the right time for it.
It depends on us.

153
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,680
NENE: When I was in the shoe,

154
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,880
NENE: people saw me as a cute girl.

155
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,880
NENE: There's a standard

156
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,480
NENE: that cute girls are not talented.

157
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,480
NENE: I tried to get rid of it.
It took time

158
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,520
NENE: but not impossible.

159
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,000
NENE: I also wanna be sexy.

160
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,040
NENE: I'm trying.

161
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,120
JACKSON: You are.

162
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,320
NENE: I've been trying
for four or five years now.

163
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,480
PAILIU: or cannot be an idol

164
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,320
PAILIU: because...

165
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,240
PAILIU: Why do I have to be sensitive?

166
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,320
NENE: I understand.
JACKSON: Why?

167
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,960
JACKSON: Cannot...
NENE: I understand.

168
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,360
PAILIU: Because some people think
I should be a pageant queen,

169
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,480
PAILIU: not an idol.

170
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,440
NENE: I wanna say that

171
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,680
NENE: seeing you shifted
from a pageant queen to do this

172
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,880
NENE: is very new.

173
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,960
NENE: I understand you, PAILIU.

174
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,360
NENE: It's not something you can do
in a short period.

175
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,920
NENE: But after you debut,

176
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,560
NENE: you still have a lot of time
to improve ourselves.

177
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,760
NENE: And people will start changing.

178
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,240
NENE: They'll see
that you do it every day.

179
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,720
NENE: You're consistent.

180
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,120
NENE: You're worth standing here.

181
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,560
NENE: Make them believe.

182
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,880
PAILIU: Thank you.

183
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,080
TRAINEES: Like this.

184
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,040
NENE: Yes.

185
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,640
NENE: Yes.

186
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,440
PAILIU: I'm new to this.
But I'm also trying.

187
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,760
PAILIU: It's not that I'm not trying.

188
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,360
PAILIU: I'm trying so hard in every way.

189
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,320
PAILIU: In the end, people will

190
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,080
PAILIU: accept me some day.

191
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,600
MIKE: How are you guys feeling
about tomorrow?

192
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,120
MIKE: I want you guys to be honest.

193
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,800
MIKE: You guys can be
really honest with me.

194
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,440
MIKE: I'm pretty sure
some of you guys have questions.

195
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,160
JAOYING: So, in this show,

196
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,880
JAOYING: actually, people under 18
can't even make a decision by themselves.

197
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,240
JAOYING: And they've been through this.

198
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,800
JAOYING: They almost can't take it.

199
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,960
JAOYING: I want you
to say something to them

200
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,720
JAOYING: because half of the trainees
are minors

201
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,280
JAOYING: who can't deal
with what they've been through.

202
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,960
JAOYING: They can't.
LILIANA LI: Yes.

203
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,440
MIKE: When I see you guys
on the first day,

204
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,880
MIKE: today is the first I see you guys

205
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,440
MIKE: and I'm like... what happened?

206
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,000
MIKE: Like seriously what happened?

207
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,600
MIKE: Like, LILIANA, you're smiling.
LILIANA LI: Yes.

208
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,520
MIKE: But I know you're not okay
on the inside.

209
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,320
LILIANA LI: Yes.

210
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,120
MIKE: Yeah.

211
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,280
MIKE: You show it by smiling
but I still know

212
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,680
MIKE: because it still shows
from your eyes.

213
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,040
MIKE: This is just the beginning.

214
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,880
MIKE: And it's just something for you guys
to see that

215
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,240
MIKE: if you guys want to be
in this industry,

216
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,720
MIKE: This is just level one.

217
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,040
MIKE: It'll get worse.

218
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,960
MIKE: And you guys gotta accept it.
There's no other way.

219
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,040
MIKE: This is the way it is.

220
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,120
MIKE: All the stress, all the emotions
that you guys are feeling right now

221
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,560
MIKE: is something that you guys
will have to go through

222
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,200
MIKE: if you guys get to debut.

223
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,880
MIKE: So, anyone got any more questions?

224
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,560
MIKE: EMMA.

225
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,600
EMMA: How can I keep my fans
to like me for a long time?

226
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,720
MIKE: You can't.

227
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,040
MIKE: There's nothing you can do.

228
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,760
MIKE: They have the right to like you.

229
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,920
MIKE: They have the right
to hate you one day too.

230
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,160
MIKE: It's always like that.

231
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,760
MIKE: It's just the way the industry is.

232
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,120
MIKE: People come and people go.

233
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,560
MIKE: I used to be like you.
I know it brings you down.

234
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,880
MIKE: I can see it in your eyes.

235
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,480
MIKE: I understand.

236
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,560
JEFF: Just one thing, one last thing.

237
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:01,080
JEFF: Just always remember
that you are good enough.

238
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,400
JEFF: Just don't care about the haters
or whatever.

239
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,200
JEFF: Just be yourself.

240
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,800
JEFF: It's okay.
Smile for me one last time, before...

241
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,960
JEFF: Okay.

242
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,120
JEFF: Let's go.

243
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,360
MIKE: You're doing great.

244
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,360
EMMA: Actually, I understand everything.
I just don't want to be pessimistic.

245
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,280
EMMA: I want to do mt best.

246
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,120
EMMA: But...

247
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,600
EMMA: There's no way
I can filter them out.

248
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,080
EMMA: I can just keep it with myself

249
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,120
EMMA: and just care about
those who like me.

250
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,760
MIKE: Tomorrow, do not give up.

251
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,000
MIKE: Go on stage with positive energy.

252
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,040
MIKE: Are you guys ready?

253
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,080
TRAINEES: Yes.

254
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,720
MIKE: It's time to fight.

255
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,680
TRAINEES: Fight!
KAYLEN: Okay.

256
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,560
RINKA: I feel like everyone is great.

257
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,640
RINKA: So, I'm quite worried
if I'll survive.

258
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,880
RINKA: But now I believe
that I'll get through it.

259
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,080
RINKA: In this situation,
I can only believe it.

260
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,640
DIDI: After all this,
I don't wanna say goodbye.

261
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,320
DIDI: Can I come visit your hometown
after work?

262
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:07,840
EMMA: Yeah!

263
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,640
EMMA: That's easy with Trip.com.

264
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,440
EMMA: You're a member, right?

265
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,360
EMMA: How's the benefit?

266
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,160
ELYN: It's not just great deals.

267
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,840
ELYN: It's double saving with Trip.com.

268
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,000
ELYN: If you book more,
membership tier can be upgraded

269
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,520
ELYN: with more benefits.

270
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,840
ELYN: I reached Diamond tier
with just eight bookings

271
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,520
ELYN: and more Trip Coins, deeper discount

272
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,840
ELYN: and two free
VIP lounge accesses yearly.

273
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,520
DIDI: So, all the Trip Coins can be spent
as discount for the next booking?

274
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,480
EMMA / ELYN: Yeah!

275
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,080
DIDI: Let's book!

276
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,000
REAINEES: Hello.

277
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,120
JACKSON: Are you guys okay?

278
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,280
TRAINEES: Okay.

279
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,160
NENE: Their faces are like... yeah,

280
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,320
NENE: I'm gonna go home.
JACKSON: KANOMPANG,

281
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,600
KANOMPANG: I wasn't famous before.

282
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,400
KANOMPANG: I'm just a simple person.

283
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,360
JACKSON: Okay.

284
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,880
JACKSON: What are you guys thinking?

285
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,840
P.AMP: I'm not worried about my ranking
that I'll go out,

286
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,400
P.AMP: go home or stay here.

287
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,760
P.AMP: But I just feel like
the way that I'm working here is...

288
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,280
P.AMP: I don't feel like I belong here.

289
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,560
JACKSON: You don't feel like
this is where you belong?

290
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,440
P.AMP: I don't feel right.

291
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,680
P.AMP: And sometimes I'm lost.
JACKSON: Okay.

292
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,960
P.AMP: I was crying
because I felt overwhelmed

293
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,400
P.AMP: with all the feelings
that happened.

294
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,520
P.AMP: It was like we knew it
from looking in each other's eyes

295
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,272
P.AMP: and we were crying
at the same time.

296
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,960
JACKSON: It's like we're in this garden.

297
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,240
JACKSON: You guys are all flowers.

298
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,200
JACKSON: We're all flowers.

299
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,920
JACKSON: Throughout the year,
there're four seasons.

300
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,600
JACKSON: And every season,
there're certain types of flowers that shine.

301
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,720
JACKSON: Do you get what I mean?

302
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:51,400
JACKSON: This is a program, a show out of
just a few months out of your life.

303
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,200
JACKSON: What I'm trying to say is
this is not the final answer.

304
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,560
JACKSON: Everyone has their own time.

305
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,520
JACKSON: Sometimes, it doesn't mean
it's this time.

306
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,400
JACKSON: Right? What's the time for me?

307
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,400
JACKSON: I think in our mind,
we're always stuck to think like

308
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,200
JACKSON: every time is my time.

309
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,800
P.AMP: From the mentors' advice,

310
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,840
P.AMO: they really gave good advices.

311
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,360
P.AMP: I've changed my views
about many things

312
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,680
P.AMP: and regained my passion
because of them.

313
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,240
DEVI: If the a dream
that I've been believing in

314
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,520
DEVI: and working hard for
since my childhood,

315
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,640
DEVI: is being questioned now...

316
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,760
DEVI: And I've been thinking lately like
"Should I give up on my dream?"

317
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,240
MIKE: You have a dream, right?

318
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,232
MIKE: Then, go get it.

319
00:15:35,264 --> 00:15:37,400
MIKE: It's never too late

320
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,240
MIKE: as long as
you still have that dream.

321
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,520
MIKE: Do not give up

322
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,320
MIKE: and just go for it.

323
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:49,400
R-JING: I wanna know if
you've been very confused about something?

324
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,280
R-JING: The worst one.

325
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,320
R-JING: And how did you get through it?

326
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,960
NENE: Confused about what?
MIKE: All the time.

327
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,840
R-JING: I want to continue.

328
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,840
R-JING: But sometimes
I think I should stop.

329
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,400
MIKE: Ah, okay.

330
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,800
MIKE: What makes you think
you have to stop?

331
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,080
R-JING: It's like...

332
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,760
R-JING: If I really like this,

333
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,120
R-JING: why am I crying this much?

334
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,920
JEFF: That's okay to be lost in come way,

335
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,000
JEFF: sometimes in this long journey.

336
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,400
JEFF: But you love singing, right?

337
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,360
JEFF: You love dancing.

338
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,480
JEFF: You love people. You love the crowd.

339
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,720
JEFF: But if you really wanna do this,

340
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,160
JEFF: just don't lose your passion
about singing and everything.

341
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,440
R-JING: In the end,
I believe that everyone here

342
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,360
R-JING: feels the same thing

343
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,840
R-JING: because we're all human.

344
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,720
R-JING: We have expectations.

345
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,760
R-JING: There's no way we don't expect.

346
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,440
JACKSON: If this is how you feel,
don't force yourself to feel happy.

347
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,880
JACKSON: Don't force it.
Just be natural about it.

348
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,760
JACKSON: Accept it.

349
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,320
JACKSON: Enjoy it.

350
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,480
JACKSON: This is how I felt
when I was lost.

351
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,360
JACKSON: This is how I felt
when I was in pain.

352
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,600
JACKSON: This is how I felt
when I was going through stuff like that,

353
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
JACKSON: things like that.

354
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,280
JACKSON: Feel it

355
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,560
JACKSON: and don't forget it.

356
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,160
JEFF: You're feeling this
because you're human.

357
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,600
JEFF: But when you go on stage,
just leave everything.

358
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,680
JEFF: Leave the ranking. Leave the vote.
Leave everything.

359
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,000
JEFF: Don't betray the stage.

360
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,360
JEFF: Just go on and do what you love
with your feelings.

361
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,880
NENE: You're great.
Be proud of yourselves.

362
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,320
PHINGPHING: I feel like
what I've been feeling for two months

363
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,880
PHINGPHING: has gone.

364
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,280
PHINGPHING: If I can say it,
I want to thank them

365
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,520
PHINGPHING: for saying that

366
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,040
PHINGPHING: because it made many of us

367
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,280
PHINGPHING: feel much better.

368
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,160
NINNINT: If I don't get through,
I'll think that

369
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,440
NINNINT: this is not my time.

370
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,720
NINNINT: This may not be my goal.

371
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,440
NINNINT: There may be another chance
or another time that's right for me.

372
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,400
ÁNH SÁNG: If I get eliminated,
it's not the end

373
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,600
ÁNH SÁNG: because outside,
we still have many chances to succeed.

374
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,880
YUAN KE: So, someone has to be eliminated

375
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,640
YUAN KE: and I may be one of them.

376
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,280
YUAN KE: But this doesn't mean
the end of our lives

377
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,200
YUAN KE: or that we can't be
on stage again.

378
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,560
(until March 10th, 2024 at 10:00AM.)

379
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,080
(Come and vote for your favorite trainee.)

380
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,896
(Who’s gonna debut will be solely determined by your vote.)

381
00:19:26,016 --> 00:19:26,960
LISSA: Sathu.

382
00:19:27,008 --> 00:19:28,288
JACKSON: Hello, trainees.

383
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,440
JACKSON: Yeah.

384
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,960
JACKSON: Congratulations everybody
for successfully completing all the tasks

385
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,520

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,040
JEFF: Yeah.
JACKSON: Yeah.

387
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,680
JACKSON: Yeah.

388
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,960
JACKSON: So, today we'll be announcing
Stage 1 elimination result.

389
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,520
JACKSON: Let's find out who'll be leaving
the show, the competition

390
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,080
JACKSON: and who'll advance to Stage 2.

391
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,440
JACKSON: From now on,
Top 9 in each elimination

392
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,120
JACKSON: will automatically
become Class A.

393
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,040
JACKSON: Before we start,

394
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,720
JACKSON: on behalf of all the trainees,
all the mentors, the show,

395
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,840
JACKSON: we wanna say thank you so much
for our viewers, our supporters

396
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,712
JACKSON: for supporting our show,

397
00:20:11,936 --> 00:20:14,040
JACKSON: voting for your favorite trainees

398
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,960
JACKSON: because without you guys,
it's hard

399
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,640
JACKSON: to be in the spotlight.

400
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,760
JACKSON: But with your support
and with your love,

401
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,960
JACKSON: all the trainees
will shine brighter than ever.

402
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,720
JACKSON: So, thank you to all our viewers.

403
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,280
JACKSON: And I want to thank everyone
for watching our show

404
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,840
JACKSON: and supporting all the trainees
to go through the missions.

405
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,000
JACKSON: Thank you.

406
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,480
JACKSON: And thank you all the viewers

407
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,400
JACKSON: for supporting this show.

408
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,960
JACKSON: Our trainees
have worked really hard

409
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,320
JACKSON: and have done well
in the performances

410
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,160
JACKSON: because all of you, viewers.

411
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,480
JEFF: Thank you everyone for voting
for the trainees

412
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,240
JEFF: no matter where you're from.

413
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,000
JEFF: Without you all,
the trainees wouldn't be able to shine

414
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,360
JEFF: and show their full potential.

415
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,960
JEFF: Without you, we can't do it.

416
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,800
JEFF : Thank you.

417
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,800
NENE: Thank you everyone for watching

418
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,080

We'll keep working.

419
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,280
NENE: Thank you.

420
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,600

for your support.

421
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,320
MIKE: All the trainees,

422
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,440
MIKE: please keep working.

423
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,184
MIKE: I'll always support you.

424
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,760
JACKSON: So, ready for today?

425
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,040
TRAINEES: Yes.

426
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,440
JACKSON: Good or bad,
it's about the journey, okay?

427
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,760
JACKSON: Let's get started.

428
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,056
YEAN: I'm gonna cry.

429
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,800
LILIANA LI: So emotional.

430
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,680
MIKE: Shall we start?

431
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,560
MIKE: The ranking is the accumulated score
given by the viewers.

432
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,720
MIKE: And after
we announce the ranking today,

433
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,600
MIKE: there'll only be 34 trainees left.

434
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,320
MIKE: As for the rest of you, we're sorry that
you guys won't be able to continue the journey with CHUANG ASIA

435
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,440
MIKE: and will be going home tonight.

436
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,760
ILENE: There'll be only a few left.

437
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,840
ILENE: Actually,
70 people are already not many.

438
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,160
ILENE: 34 are even fewer.

439
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,000
JACKSON: Okay, let's go back
to our journey during CHUANG ASIA,

440
00:22:27,104 --> 00:22:29,160
JACKSON: the Audition Stage.

441
00:22:29,472 --> 00:22:35,360
JACKSON: It was the first time to receive
evaluation from mentors and other trainees.

442
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:42,600
JACKSON: All trainees who have entered
the Top 9 during the Audition Stage,

443
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,480
JACKSON: please take
a step forward in front.

444
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,440
JACKSON: TOP 3

445
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,040
JACKSON: please stand up.
MIKE: Stand up please.

446
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,400
JACKSON: The current Top 9

447
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,680
(TOP 3&amp; TOP 9 GRAND AUDITIONS)

448
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,720
VITA: Don't tell me all pass?

449
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,240
JACKSON: during the Audition Stage,

450
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,520
JACKSON: your performances
were outstanding

451
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,680
JACKSON: and you all had
the recognition by us

452
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,680
JACKSON: and by your fellow trainees.

453
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:31,800
JACKSON: So, we'll first start announcing
the results within you.

454
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,840
JACKSON: The first Top 3 among you guys,

455
00:23:38,304 --> 00:23:40,680
JACKSON: J JAZZSPER, please step forward.

456
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,360
JACKSON: LISSA.

457
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,480
TRAINEE: LISSA.

458
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,280
JACKSON: And then we have KRISTA.

459
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01,150
JACKSON: J JAZZSPER, LISSA and KRISTA,

460
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:06,750
JACKSON: you guys are the Top 3
back during the Audition Stage.

461
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:11,510
JACKSON: Among the three of you,
who wants to know the result first?

462
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:18,830
ILENE: Let's get it over with.

463
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,190
JACKSON: Okay. LISSA.

464
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:32,350
JACKSON: Remember we talked yesterday?

465
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:38,590
JACKSON: That your choice was
you're so confident to make it into the Top 9.

466
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,640
TRAINEES: Fighting.
PANGJANG: I can't take this.

467
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,150
JACKSON: The result is...

468
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,670
LISSA: My heart has fallen down to my feet

469
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,990
LISSA: because I don't know
what will happen.

470
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,670
LISSA: I don't want to cry.

471
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,310
LISSA: I just want to know
if I get through or not.

472
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:22,230
TRAINEES: I'm happy.

473
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,950
TRAINEES: LISSA.

474
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,030
JACKSON: LISSA has always been brave.

00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,950
JACKSON: Congratulations, LISSA.

476
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,950
LISSA: I made it again, Daddy.

477
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,510
LISSA: This time, I wanna tell my dad.

478
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,990
LISSA: Dad, I actually made it.

479
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:46,950
LISSA: and I'm gonna continue to make it
to the last round.

480
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:50,030
LISSA: I will debut with CHUANG ASIA.

481
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:55,470
JACKSON: The second trainee
that I'll be announcing the result is

482
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:57,670
JACKSON: KRISTA.

483
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,550
JACKSON: Your ranking is...

484
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:07,070

00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:23,150
JACKSON: Congratulation
for the qualification.

488
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:27,350
JACKSON: And you're also
the first one to join Top 9.

489
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:36,310
KRISTA: I'm very happy to be in the Top 9

490
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:43,070
KRISTA: or how people think about me.

491
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:47,550
KRISTA: And when I'm in the Top 9,

492
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:50,350
KRISTA: I feel like people really see me.

493
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,150
KRISTA: And I'm very happy.

494
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:57,030
KRISTA: I feel like
I've done all I've done for a reason.

495
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,510
TRAINEES: Oh, my God.

496
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,350
ILENE: Very good.

497
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,056
PAILIU: You'll make it.

498
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:06,070
JACKSON: The third trainee's result
to be announced is J JAZZSPER.

499
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,750
JACKSON: Thank you so much
for your hard work.

500
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:20,670
J JAZZSPER: Unfortunately,
you did not advance to the next round.

501
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,430
JACKSON: But thank you, J JAZZSPER.

502
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,150
PAILIU: Really?

503
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:28,430
JACKSON: Please move back and join
the rest of the trainees.

504
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,830
JACKSON: Thank you so much
for your amazing performance

505
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:38,630

throughout every episode.

506
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:43,830
JACKSON: Among the Top 3, we have
two trainees that entered and qualified

507
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,270
JACKSON: to the Top 34.

508
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:48,030
JACKSON: LISSA, what do you have to say?

509
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:01,070
LISSA: A player with the most votes
gets to win.

510
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:06,390
LISSA: But behind each and every vote,

511
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,870
LISSA: I know how hard it is.

512
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:20,430
LISSA: I know how hard it is for the fans
to be trying for me, for my dream

513
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:24,870
LISSA: and how hard and difficult
they went out for me.

514
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,110
LISSA: So, from now on,

515
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:32,910
LISSA: I want to show you what this green girl
has to offer the world.

516
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,550
LISSA: But please don't take me as a joke

517
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,590
LISSA: because I'm here to prove myself.

518
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,470
LISSA: I'm here to play the game.

519
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:46,630
LISSA: And I'll show you
that I can be in the Top 9 one day.

520
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:51,630
LISSA: So, watch out for me,
this green girl.

521
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:55,190
LISSA: Please continue to send me love
and support

522
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,910
LISSA: to me,
this lucky little green girl, LISSA.

523
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:00,750
LISSA: Thank you.

524
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:01,950
JACKSON: Thank you, LISSA.

525
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,870
JACKSON: We'll be expecting
different aspects of you.

526
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:05,710
JACKSON: Thank you.

527
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:10,910
JACKSON: And the first trainee
to enter Top 9 in this stage,

528
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,870
JACKSON: KRISTA, what do you have to say?

529
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,710
KRISTA: So, ever since
I was eight or nine years old,

530
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:28,710
KRISTA: I would compete a lot
in so many singing competitions.

531
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:33,950
KRITS: And to be honest,
sometimes I feel like almost invisible.

532
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:38,150
KRISTA: But I'm very happy
that people actually see me.

533
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,950
KRISTA: It really means a lot.

534
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:44,910
KRISTA: And I think that I've gained
so much confidence since I've come here.

535
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,550
KRISTA: I have the courage to finally
look people in the eye when I'm singing.

536
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:52,030
KRISTA: And I hope
that my confidence will grow.

537
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:58,910
KRISTA: And I really really would like
to thank every single person who's supported me

538
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,110
KRISTA: and voted for me.

539
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:03,430
KRISTA: I'd like to thank my company,
True Tone Entertainment.

540
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:07,510
KRISTA: And I'd like
to thank my friends here

541
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:11,510
KRISTA: because you guys
have made my time here so fun.

542
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:15,590
KRISTA: And...
let's keep working hard together.

543
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,510
KRISTA: Thank you so much.
JACKSON: Thank you so much, KRISTA.

544
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:21,230
NENE: KRISTA, I want to encourage you
to be confident

545
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:24,270
NENE: because you're here
because of your voice and yourself

546
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,230
NENE: and I've chosen you.

547
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,550
NENE: Be confident. Everyone loves you.

548
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,350
KRISTA: Thank you, Mentor NENE.

549
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,790
R-JING: That's my daughter.

550
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:40,990
R-JING: I've raised her by myself.

551
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,990
MIKE: Okay. So, I'll be continuing
the announcement of the ranking.

552
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:53,950
MIKE: Trainees in the Top 9 who have never
battled with anyone during the Audition Stage,

553
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,030
MIKE: please step forward.

554
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:59,790
MIKE: PRAEW, MA LIYA and LILIANA.

555
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:06,070
MIKE: PRAEW, let's start with PRAEW.

556
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:10,944
MIKE: PRAEW, your ranking is...

557
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,310
MIKE: 32. Congratulations.

558
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,510
ILENE: PRAEW, good job.

559
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,310
MIKE: Good job.

560
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:34,350
PRAEW: My feeling as the first member
of MINDY to be up there is

561
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:39,950
PRAEW: at least I can keep MINDY going.

562
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:43,670
PRAEW: I feel happy, very happy.

563
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,790
ILENE: When PRAEW got through,
I was really happy.

564
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,950
ILENE: But her ranking is 32.

565
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,470
ILENE: I was like... Eh?

566
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,470
ILENE: 32?

567
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:55,190
ILENE: Oh, if PRAEW is 32, I must be out.

568
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:56,470
MIKE: MA LIYA.

569
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,510
MIKE: Unfortunately,

570
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:03,110
MIKE: you did not advance
to the next round.

571
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,310
MIKE: Thank you for all the hard work.

572
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,390
MIKE: Thank you.

573
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:10,830
JACKSON: Thank you, MA LIYA.

574
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,750
MIKE: Thank you, MA LIYA.

575
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,670
MIKE: LILIANA,

576
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,710
MIKE: I have a question for you.

577
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,470
LILIANA LI: Yes, Mentor MIKE.

578
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,630
MIKE: Throughout all the performances
that you've done,

579
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:36,390
MIKE: you're satisfied
with what you've done so far?

580
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:46,830
LILIANA LI: I feel like, so far,
all of my performances have been good or decent.

581
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:52,790
LILIANA LI: But I feel like I haven't really been
able to really show my potential and what I've got.

582
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,390
MIKE: Okay.

583
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:59,670
MIKE: And the viewers
also see your hard work.

584
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:04,270
MIKE: And they are willing to give you
that chance to prove yourself.

585
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,150
MIKE: Your ranking is

586
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,310
MIKE: 11. Congratulations.

587
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:24,110
MIKE: You did a great job.

588
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,270
TRAINEES: Oh, my God.

589
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,950
ILENE: LILIANA.

590
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,110
MIKE: Congratulations, LILIANA LI.

591
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,230
MIKE: You get to advance
to the next round.

592
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,030
LILIANA LI: I was really mind blown.

593
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:50,750
LILIANA LI: So, I really wanna
thank my fans.

594
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,910
LILIANA LI: It's because of everyone.
Without you, I wouldn't be here.

595
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,830
MIKE: PRAEW, do you want to how you feel?

596
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,510
PRAEW: Yes.

597
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,830
PRAEW: Sometimes, I get some feedbacks

598
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,910
PRAEW: that I'm a dancer, not an idol.

599
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,510
ILENE: No, you're an idol.

600
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,750
PRAEW: From getting the votes
from everyone,

601
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,230
PRAEW: and being able to stand here,

602
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,470
PRAEW: I really want to thank everyone.

603
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,110
PRAEW: And...

604
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,390
PRAEW: I'll show everyone

605
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:25,110
PRAEW: that I'm not a backup dancer

606
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,150
PRAEW: but I'll be
in the center of the stage

607
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,790
PRAEW: and will shine my way.

608
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,710
PRAEW: Please support me.

609
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,230
PRAEW: Thank you.

610
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,910
MIKE: PRAEW, you're not just a dancer.

611
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:45,510
MIKE: Don't let other people's words
bring you down, okay?

612
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,470
PRAEW: Thank you. Thank you so much.

613
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:48,710
MIKE: You did a good job.

614
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,990
MIKE: LILIANA LI, what's up?

615
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,030
LILIANA LI: Yes.

616
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,430
MIKE: How are you feeling?

617
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,750
LILIANA LI: and all the trainees.

618
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:10,190
LILIANA LI: And I'd also like
to thank my fans.

619
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:14,430
LILIANA LI: Coming to the show,
I didn't have any social media whatsoever.

620
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:18,310
LILIANA LI: I started from zero.

621
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:21,824
LILIANA LI: I'd like to say
a few things to

622
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,430
LILIANA LI: KAYLEN, AKINA and SHYE.

623
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,990
LILIANA LI: Hopefully,
by the end of this day,

624
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:34,070
LILIANA LI: you'll be able to stand up
with me on this stand.

625
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,990
LILIANA LI: But if not, that's fine.
I'll really miss you guys.

626
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:41,270
LILIANA LI: I really love you.
You've taught me a lot.

627
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:45,110
LILIANA LI: And I'm really grateful
I've met you three.

628
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,390
LILIANA LI: Also, all the trainees here,

629
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:53,350
LILIANA LI: I'm really grateful.

630
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:58,670
LILIANA LI: Finally, I wanna thank my mom.
I miss you, Mom.

631
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,710
LILIANA LI: Thank you
for always supporting me.

632
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,270
LILIANA LI: Okay. I'm gonna stop.

633
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:06,470
LILIANA LI: My personality is...

634
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,790
LILIANA LI: I was so... like, what?

635
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:18,870
LILIANA LI: Out of it...
I literally ruined my speech.

636
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,110
LILIANA LI: I couldn't speak properly.

637
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:23,310
LILIANA LI: I was like...

638
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,990
LILIANA LI: I'm sorry. This is a mess.

639
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:29,310
LILIANA LI: My personality is...

640
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,670
LILIANA LI: Okay. I'm done. Thank you.

641
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,630
LILIANA LI: The last part of my speech was

642
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:38,230
LILIANA LI: My personality is
open, lively and eloquent.

643
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,990
LILIANA LI: I'll succeed in the future.

644
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:45,390
LILIANA LI: That's me, LILIANA LI.

645
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:49,510

646
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:50,710
JEFF: Okay.

647
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:55,488
JEFF: So, now, all the trainees

648
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,110
JEFF: who participated in the battle

649
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,470
JEFF: during the Audition Stage,

650
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:04,430

to the holding area.

651
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:14,350

please come to the front.

652
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,510
JEFF: YUI, PANDA,

653
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,670

654
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,230
[Trainees who have participated
in the battle]

655
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,070
JEFF: KAYLEN.

656
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,830
JEFF: For me,
you've got a beautiful voice.

657
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,830
JEFF: And I really love your performance.

658
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,310
JEFF: And I hope to see it in the future.

659
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:58,270
JEFF: But now, unfortunately,
you did not advance to the next round.

660
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:58,950
JEFF: I'm sorry.

661
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,670
JACKSON: Thank you, KAYLEN. Thank you.

662
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,030
MIKE: Thank you KAYLEN.

663
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,830
TEGAN: KAYLEN.

664
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,270
KAYLEN: You're winning for me, okay?

665
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,710
TEGAN: This is hard.
KAYLEN: I know.

666
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,070
TEGAN: I love you. Good job.

667
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,070

KAYLEN: Okay?

669
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,750
TEGAN: It made me really sad

670
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:27,430
TEGAN: that KAYLEN couldn't
move on to the next round. It's hard.

671
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:30,030
JEFF: YUI.

672
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:33,230
JEFF: I'm sorry.
You did not advance to the next round.

673
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,790
JACKSON: Thank you, YUI.
JEFF: Thank you, YUI.

674
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:37,830
MIKE: Thank you, YUI.

675
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:42,910
TRAINEES: YUI, I love you.

676
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:06,670
JEFF: Okay, the next trainees.
Both of you, PANDA and KANOMPANG.

677
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:10,030
JEFF: You're both in the dance battle

678
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,910
JEFF: at the Audition Stage.

679
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:19,030
JEFF: So, I want you to just
take a deep breath

680
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:20,230
JEFF: once again.

681
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,430
JEFF: PANDA,

682
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,070
JEFF: Your result is...

683
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:34,030
JEFF: Congratulations.

684
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,550
JEFF: Your ranking is 31.

685
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,150
PREAM: Good job.

686
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,590
PREAM: Good job.

687
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,030
TRAINEES: Good job.

688
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:49,190
PANDA: Come with me. Hurry up.

689
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,070
PANDA: I'll go first.

690
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,030
TRAINEES: It's okay.

691
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,870
JACKSON: Congratulations, PANDA.

692
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,230
JEFF: So,

693
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,870
JEFF: between both of you,

694
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:10,070
JEFF: there is only one
who gets to go to the next round.

695
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,070
JEFF: So, I'm sorry, KANOMPANG.

696
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:15,510
JEFF: You did not get to advance
to the next round.

697
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,070
JEFF: Thank you, KANOMPANG.

698
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,110
MIKE: Thank you, KANOMPANG.

699
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:22,670
JACKSON: Thank you
for all your amazing performances.

700
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,270
TN: KANOMPANG, you did good.

701
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:26,750
KANOMPANG: KICK BACK.

702
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:27,910
KANOMPANG: I love you.

703
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:28,950
KAYLEN: I love you too.

704
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:37,230
JEFF: So, this round, we have only one trainee
who got in to the next round.

705
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:40,430
JEFF: PANDA, do you wanna say something?

706
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:42,350
PANDA: Yes.

707
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:47,630
PANDA: I want to say
that it's really hard for me to come here

708
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:51,470
PANDA: because I come out of school

709
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,870
PANDA: to be home-schooled
and chase my dream.

710
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:57,390
PANDA: And I have my parents
as my supporters.

711
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,430
PANDA: They're always by my side.

712
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:04,030
PANDA: But when I come here,
I'm all alone.

713
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:08,230
PANDA: I don't have anyone to talk to,

714
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:10,190
PANDA: to support me like my parents.

715
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:14,510
PANDA: But I'm really grateful
that I have all my friends

716
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,830
PANDA: that help me

717
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,030
PANDA: and make me improve and grow

718
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:21,390
PANDA: to be my better version of me.

719
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:25,510
PANDA: And I really wanna say thank you
to my Barbie team

720
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,230
PANDA: at the Audition Stage.

721
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,030
PANDA: They're my best friends

722
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,630
PANDA: and I don't wanna leave them.

723
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:37,590
PANDA: They're the reason
why I want to stay,

724
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,830
PANDA: and why I want to be here.

725
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:46,230
PANDA: I would like to thank my parents,
friends and mentors

726
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,630
PANDA: and fans that support me

727
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,790
PANDA: and vote for me.

728
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:50,670
PANDA: Thank you.

729
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:53,440
PANDA: I love you.

730
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:01,710
NENE: Next, we will talk
about the first performance.

731
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:05,350
NENE: It was the first performance that
was evaluated by the audience.

732
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:11,590
NENE: All the ten centers from each group,
please come down to the front.

733
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,350
TRAINEES: DUNA

734
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,150
TRAINEES: Keep going.

735
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:26,070
DUNA: I came to the front, right?

736
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:28,110
DUNA: And I saw both the trainees
who are eliminated

737
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:31,830
DUNA: and the ones who are preparing
to go on stage.

738
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:35,510
DUNA: If you're called,
it must be very exciting.

739
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,230
TRAINEES: WANG KE, keep going.

740
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,230
NENE: MINGMING

741
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:42,790
MINGMING: I’m quite scared

742
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:46,310
MINGMING: and a bit excited about who will
stay and who will go.

743
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:47,470
NENE: KITTIE

744
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:49,750
NENE: ZOI

745
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:52,550
NENE: DUNA

746
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:54,950
NENE: WANG KE

747
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,470
NENE: QIAO YI YU

748
00:42:58,910 --> 00:42:59,710
NENE: COCO

749
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:09,070
NENE: This position was earned by being
accepted and respected by the team.

750
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:13,870
NENE: Let's see what your rankings are.

751
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:19,830
NENE: For those who have never won
the MVP title,

752
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:22,030
NENE: please come out
to the Result Announcement Zone.

753
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:36,510
NENE: COCO and PREAM.

754
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:40,750
NENE: Both of them were the winners
of the AUDITIONS round.

755
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,110
NENE: But there’s only one

756
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:50,030
NENE: who can go to the second stage.

757
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:53,430
TRAINEES: There’s only one.

758
00:43:58,310 --> 00:43:59,790
NENE: Both of you, do you have anything
you want to say?

759
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:10,750
COCO: Well, now that I'm standing here,
there was a feeling of both fear and excitement.

760
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:11,830
COCO: But…

761
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:16,910
COCO: whether it's the qualifying stage
or the first stage,

762
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:24,550
COCO: to avoid future regret,
so I trained hard

763
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:26,430
COCO: and gave my full performance.

764
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,310
COCO: Even if I can't make it
to the next round, I won't regret it.

765
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:30,870
COCO: Yes, that's it.

766
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:33,750
COCO: That's why. That's it.

767
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:36,190
TRAINEES: COCO chan.

768
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:38,350
TRAINEES: Keep going.

769
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:39,310
TRAINEES: Keep pushing.

770
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:42,870
PREAM: I also feel like I've done my best.

771
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:45,550
PREAM: There's nothing that
I would ever regret.

772
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:48,470
PREAM: Whether it's me or COCO
who gets to the next round,

773
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:50,150
PREAM: I'm all okay.

774
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:51,390
PREAM: Yes, that's it.

775
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,510
ILENE: Anything can happen.

776
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:58,630
NENE: No matter what the result is,
I'm rooting for both of you.

777
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:04,830
NENE: COCO

778
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:08,608
NENE: Congratulations,
your rank is Fourteenth.

779
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:28,590
YEAN: I love you.

780
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:31,030
TRAINEES: PREAM, don't worry about it.

781
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:36,670
PANDA: It's sad.

782
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:39,710
PANDA: Because we've been together
for a very long time.

783
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:42,950
PANDA: And we practice together,

784
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,870
PANDA: eat, sleep, anything like this together.

785
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:46,390
PANDA: We did everything together.

786
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:49,390
PANDA: And if I were to stay

787
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:51,750
PANDA: and some friends aren't here,

788
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:54,270
PANDA: it would feel very quiet

789
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:55,950
PANDA: that that friend
wasn’t here any more.

790
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:01,910
NENE: PREAM, don’t give up.

791
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:04,070
MIKE: You did that very well.
NENE: You certainly did well.

792
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:05,470
ILENE: PREAM

793
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,190
NENE: The next person that
I will announce is

794
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:14,470
NENE: MINGMING

795
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:20,064
TRAINEES: MINGMING, pass, pass.

796
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:23,870
NENE: You're the one who got promoted
from Class F to Class A.

797
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:27,070
MIKE: Congratulations to MINGMING

798
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:36,310
NENE: Everyone has seen your efforts.

799
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:38,030
NENE: MINGMING

800
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,390
NENE: Congratulations,
your rank is Twenty-ninth.

801
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:45,670
TRAINEES: Yeah.

802
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:55,830
ILENE: MINGMING, you’re brilliant.

803
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:00,070
ILENE: Two have been passed.

804
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:02,950
ILENE: Two of us pass now.
The two of MINDY members could pass.

805
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:10,270
NENE: ZOI, you are the only trainee
from India.

806
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:14,990
NENE: You never learned singing
or dancing as a trainee before.

807
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:18,910
NENE: Is there anything you'd like to say
during this stressful time?

808
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:22,870
ZOI: I'm very stressed right now.

809
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:28,390
ZOI: But no matter what the result is,
I'm ready to listen.

810
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:30,430
NENE: ZOI

811
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:41,670
NENE: I’m sorry. You can’t go on.

812
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:49,950
TRAINEES: ZOI

813
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:51,150
JACKSON: Thank you, ZOI.

814
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:51,990
JEFF : Thank you.

815
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:55,190
ZOI: This is a survival show. Oh, my God!

816
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:57,750
RUAN: Because I can’t know
what will happen,

817
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:00,870
RUAN: I didn’t imagine it before.
So, it made me really worried.

818
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:03,670
CHABA: I've always been proud of you.
ZOI: Thank you.

819
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:05,630
CHABA: Don’t give up.

820
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:11,950
NENE: KITTIE, you were the lucky one
when selecting the center of THEME SONG.

821
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:16,190
MIKE: KITTIE

822
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:25,550
NENE: Let's see if luck is still
on your side or not.

823
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:33,550
NENE: I'm sorry.
You can’t go on to the next round.

824
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:36,030
NENE: Thank you, KITTIE.

825
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:37,470
TRAINEES: Huh!
MIKE: Thank you, KITTIE.

826
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:38,590
TRAINEES: Huh! What?

827
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:39,680
MIKE: Thank you very much.
TRAINEES: What?

828
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:45,750
JACKSON: Thank you for all your hard work.

829
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:47,110
JACKSON: Thank you, KITTIE.

830
00:48:49,796 --> 00:48:50,500
JACKSON: Oh, my God.

831
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:56,710
JASMINE: KITTIE?
I was very sad at that time,

832
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:58,670
JASMINE: because I'm very close to her.

833
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:01,390
JASMINE: Well, we talked to each other
if we could stay,

834
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:04,510
JASMINE: We would move to the room
of Top Class.

835
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:07,230
JASMINE: But finally KITTIE
got eliminated, so I was like...

836
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:09,030
JASMINE: I felt ill at ease.

837
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:11,030
JASMINE: I immediately ran down
to hug KITTIE.

00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:30,790
ILENE: Come here together.

1008
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:34,470
ILENE: Love you.

1009
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:35,830
PANGJANG: Love you, too.

1010
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:37,710
MIKE: XUANNING.

1011
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:40,670
XUANNING: I would like to say
that before I came here,

1012
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:44,750
XUANNING: I had been learning
Chinese dance for many years.

1013
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:47,910
XUANNING: Honestly, I was very confused

1014
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:52,390
XUANNING: whether I should step out
of my comfort zone and be here.

1015
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:55,390
XUANNING: But in the end,
I decided to be here.

1016
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:59,870
XUANNING: Because, actually,
I want more people to notice me,

1017
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:01,230
XUANNING: more people to love me.

1018
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:03,070
XUANNING: That way I will have
more opportunities,

1019
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:07,670
XUANNING: and have my stage in the future.

1020
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:10,710
XUANNING: That's why I chose to be here.

1021
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:12,390
XUANNING: Thank you, everyone.

1022
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:17,350
JACKSON: Thank you.

1023
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:18,750
MIKE: YUAN KE.

1024
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:24,470
YUAN KE: Actually, before the results were announced today, I was very nervous.

1025
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:28,710
YUAN KE: Because I felt like I didn't know where I should go.

1026
00:59:28,990 --> 00:59:34,470
YUAN KE: Maybe it's because I've always thought that I didn't have much presence on this show.

1027
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:40,230
YUAN KE: I got into F Class for the theme song, and I still got into F Class for our last performance.

1028
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:42,630
YUAN KE: To be honest, I would be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed.

1029
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:46,430
YUAN KE: But I'm the kind of person that

1030
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:51,670
YUAN KE: even if I fail 99 times, I'll try again until I succeed.

1031
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:55,870
YUAN KE: So maybe it's because of this feeling of mine.

1032
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:59,110
YUAN KE: I will slowly make everyone notice me.

1033
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:02,670
YUAN KE: I would like to thank everyone who has supported me.

1034
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:04,950
YUAN KE: I get to stay on this stage because of everyone.

1035
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:08,710
YUAN KE: This stage shines a light on me because of everyone.

1036
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:10,390
YUAN KE: Fighting.

1037
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:12,150
TRAINEES: Yeah.

1038
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:13,950
RAY: Fighting.
JACKSON: Thank you.

1039
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:15,030
MIKE: Thank you.

1040
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:19,590
JACKSON: Trainees who are still in the area below,

1041
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:23,190
JACKSON: Please come out to the announcement area.

1042
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:26,150
TRAINEE: WANG KE.

1043
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:34,310
JACKSON: From the last performance, all five of you

1044
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:39,990
JACKSON: were the center and MVP.

1045
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:43,870
JACKSON: I'm gonna start from WANG KE.

1046
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:52,270
JACKSON: Your ranking is 22th place.

1047
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:01,150
DEVI: WANG KE.

1048
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:06,830
JACKSON: QIAO YI YU, your ranking is…

1049
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:07,670
JACKSON: seventh place.

1050
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:16,150
DIDI: Lucky seven. QIAO YI YU.

1051
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:33,630
JACKSON: For the remaining three people, the results are totally different.

1052
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:35,790
JACKSON: So different.

1053
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:41,350
JACKSON: DUNA

1054
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:43,790
JACKSON: DUNA, what will you do if you get eliminated?

1055
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:52,270
DUNA: Even if I get eliminated,

1056
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:56,190
DUNA: I still have my fans who love me,

1057
01:01:57,150 --> 01:02:02,310
DUNA: and I still have my group members.

1058
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:05,430
DUNA: So, I will do my best.

1059
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:09,230
JACKSON: DUNA, your ranking is 30th place.

1060
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:16,150
GEUMHEE: DUNA.

1061
01:02:18,790 --> 01:02:22,830
DUNA: When I was called, I spaced out.

1062
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:26,230
DUNA: I was thinking…

1063
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:30,590
DUNA: If I get eliminated, I'll be really disappointed.

1064
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:34,830
DUNA: But when the others went on stage, I was also happy for them.

1065
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:36,870
DUNA: As I kept feeling that way, I got really excited.

1066
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:43,030
JACKSON: There are two people left.
But as I said just now

1067
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:45,630
JACKSON: Your result announcements are totally different.

1068
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:47,270
JACKSON: Are you ready?

1069
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:49,750
JACKSON: Your result announcements are...

1070
01:02:57,310 --> 01:02:59,630
JACKSON: I'm really sorry.

1071
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:03,670
JACKSON: There will be only one of you

1072
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:07,150
JACKSON: who will get into the Top 9.

1073
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:15,070
JACKSON: YEAN, you got eighth place.

1074
01:03:15,270 --> 01:03:16,750
JACKSON: And EMMA, you got 15th place.

1075
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:32,430
JEFF: Would you like to say something?

1076
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:34,270
JACKSON: WANG KE first.

1077
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:38,270
WANG KE: Most importantly, I would like to thank all of my fans who voted for me.

1078
01:03:39,790 --> 01:03:42,150
WANG KE: Because I never thought that

1079
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:44,310
WANG KE: I would be able to stand in this position

1080
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:46,110
WANG KE: which is so close to debut.

1081
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:48,470
WANG KE: People who know me might think that

1082
01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:51,750
WANG KE: when I joined the previous show,

1083
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:53,710
WANG KE: I was one step away from debut.

1084
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:57,110
WANG KE: But actually, the highest ranking I got last time

1085
01:03:57,150 --> 01:03:59,310
WANG KE: was 45th place.

1086
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:01,750
WANG KE: And this time I got 22nd place.

1087
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:05,190
WANG KE: So, I think I'm not far from debut now.

1088
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:08,110
WANG KE: I think the old WANG KE,

1089
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:12,110
ANG KE: no matter how much hard work she put in, she didn't get any returns.

1090
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:16,630
WANG KE: But as I joined this show, I found that my harvest season has arrived.

1091
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:21,070
WANG KE: From the first time, I got into Class A, and got the center position.

1092
01:04:21,110 --> 01:04:24,350
WANG KE: Then I got MVP and won the competition.

1093
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:26,190
WANG KE: So, I realized that I, WANG KE,

1094
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:28,110
WANG KE: can also reap the fruits of my labor.

1095
01:04:28,310 --> 01:04:29,990
WANG KE: I will try even harder.

1096
01:04:30,310 --> 01:04:33,390
WANG KE: I want everyone to know that I can make it into the Top 9.

1097
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:34,950
WANG KE: This time I want to debut.

1098
01:04:35,232 --> 01:04:36,512
WANG KE: This time I will debut.

1099
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:43,030
JACKSON: DUNA

1100
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:46,870
DUNA: We have debuted as a girl group before.

1101
01:04:46,910 --> 01:04:50,710
DUNA: That's why we thought a lot about coming on this show.

1102
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:53,590
DUNA: In the next round,

1103
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:56,470
DUNA: I'm going to show the improved image

1104
01:04:56,510 --> 01:05:00,790
DUNA: of DUNA to everyone.

1105
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:02,390
DUNA: Thank you very much.

1106
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:04,064
JACKSON: Yes. Thank you. Congratulations.

1107
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:07,870
JACKSON: EMMA

1108
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:11,030
EMMA: Before I came here, I was really worried that…

1109
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:16,670
EMMA: I would just be a high school student who can only dance

1110
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:20,510
EMMA: and isn't good at anything else.

1111
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:24,990
EMMA: I had never had any training experience before.

1112
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:29,270
EMMA: But I came here to compete with everyone.

1113
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:32,150
TRAINEES: Fighting.

1114
01:05:32,190 --> 01:05:34,110
TRAINEES: Fighting.

1115
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:37,230
EMMA: But now that I'm here, standing on this stage,

1116
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:38,990
EMMA: I'm 100% confident.

1117
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:42,150
EMMA: I think my abilities are not inferior to anyone else's.

1118
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:46,790
EMMA: I hope... I will definitely win.

1119
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:48,430
JACKSON: Thank you.

1120
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:50,470
JACKSON: YEAN

1121
01:05:51,390 --> 01:05:54,350
YEAN: Stars will always
have their own light.

1122
01:05:54,590 --> 01:05:56,990
YEAN: Even though it might not
shine here during the day,

1123
01:05:57,670 --> 01:05:59,390
YEAN: it will shine somewhere else.

1124
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:01,550
YEAN: For many years,

1125
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:03,710
YEAN: I was just a small star

1126
01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:07,150
YEAN: that didn't have enough light
for people to notice.

1127
01:06:07,790 --> 01:06:10,710
YEAN: No one noticed my existence,

1128
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:14,030
YEAN: and I was far from people's sight.

1129
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:18,630
YEAN: But today, standing here,

1130
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:20,550
YEAN: it makes me realize that

1131
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:24,990
YEAN: my patience and effort
over the past 14 years

1132
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:28,550
YEAN: have made everyone see me shine.

1133
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:33,430
YEAN: I would like to thank everyone
who sees the light in me.

1134
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:36,470
YEAN: I will do my best

1135
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:39,710
YEAN: and repay the love
that everyone has given me.

1136
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:43,110
JACKSON: Thank you.

1137
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:49,110
QIAO YI YU: Hi, everyone.
My name is QIAO YI YU. I'm 21 years old.

1138
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:52,030
QIAO YI YU: Actually,
people have asked me,

1139
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:56,950
QIAO YI YU: when I was an MVP for A class,
why I seemed

1140
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:59,990
QIAO YI YU: calm and feelingless

1141
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:03,910
QIAO YI YU: as if I wasn't happy
with the result.

1142
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:08,430
QIAO YI YU: It's not like that at all.
I actually was over the moon.

1143
01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:13,216
QIAO YI YU: But because I never
got chosen as an MVP before

1144
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:18,590
QIAO YI YU: I couldn't believe that
the result actually came out that way.

1145
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:22,270
QIAO YI YU: I never won before.

1146
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:31,790
QIAO YI YU: This is the first time I can really
feel the support from my fans.

1147
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:35,190
QIAO YI YU: Even when I can't see them nor do I
know how many of them there are,

1148
01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:39,990
QIAO YI YU: but for them
to help me got in this position,

1149
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:46,030
QIAO YI YU: I can feel their support.

1150
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:51,270
QIAO YI YU: I actually among
the Top 3 for my next goal.

1151
01:07:51,470 --> 01:07:52,870
QIAO YI YU: So, I hope that next time,

1152
01:07:53,550 --> 01:07:57,280
QIAO YI YU: when the second announcement comes,
I can achieve that goal.

1153
01:07:58,550 --> 01:08:03,910
QIAO YI YU: I want them to be
proud of who they like

1154
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:07,430
QIAO YI YU: and be able
to proudly tell everyone

1155
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:09,888
QIAO YI YU: how amazing
the person they root for are.

1156
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:12,990
JACKSON: Thank you.

1157
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:14,670
