How much are you nervous?

00:21:24,536 --> 00:21:26,486
TRAINEES: Very nervous.

201
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:29,786
MIKE: I can see that you all are nervous,

202
00:21:29,786 --> 00:21:31,536
MIKE: but you can do it very well.

203
00:21:31,536 --> 00:21:34,236
TEN: Let me compliment you first.
I really like that. It's like...

204
00:21:34,236 --> 00:21:36,236
TEN: You're the first group
to perform, right?

205
00:21:36,236 --> 00:21:39,786
TEN: You may be nervous. Some people
who are nervous will only look at the floor.

206
00:21:39,986 --> 00:21:41,636
TEN: But I really like the four of you

207
00:21:41,636 --> 00:21:45,536
TEN: that tried to do eye contact
with all the mentors

208
00:21:45,786 --> 00:21:48,436

So, I would like to compliment you on this.

209
00:21:49,086 --> 00:21:50,036
TEN: You're so brave.

210
00:21:50,386 --> 00:21:52,286
JEFF: I heard like some of you
kind of like

211
00:21:52,286 --> 00:21:58,386
JEFF: sing in like a very vocal style. You added it on
or did you design on it something?

212
00:21:58,386 --> 00:22:00,536
KRISTA: Oh yeah.
We added the improvised part.

213
00:22:00,536 --> 00:22:03,536
KRISTA: I added the improvised part.
Each of us designed it by ourselves.

214
00:22:03,536 --> 00:22:06,336
JACKSON: I wanna say...

215
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,036
NENE: I wanna...

216
00:22:08,636 --> 00:22:10,336
MIKE: Yeah, Jack. Okay, Jack.

217
00:22:10,686 --> 00:22:11,936
MIKE: Jack wanna say...

218
00:22:11,936 --> 00:22:12,886
JACKSON: I wanna say...

219
00:22:14,086 --> 00:22:15,586

220
00:22:15,986 --> 00:22:17,086
TRAINEES: Huh!

221
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:18,436

224
00:22:20,286 --> 00:22:22,786
JACKSON: It's cute. I feel like
I'm young again.

225
00:22:23,186 --> 00:22:26,336
JACKSON: And I really want to point out...

226
00:22:26,336 --> 00:22:28,036
JACKSON: Krista.

227
00:22:28,036 --> 00:22:28,886
KRISTA: Krista.

228
00:22:28,886 --> 00:22:31,636
JACKSON: You have a very good sound.

229
00:22:31,986 --> 00:22:35,136
JACKSON: In term of vocals,
you have a good color.

230
00:22:35,136 --> 00:22:37,136
JACKSON: You know, and I wanna see more.

231
00:22:39,386 --> 00:22:43,236
KRISTA: My highlight should be
in "The Voice Thailand All Stars",

232
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:48,236
KRISTA: because I think it's the point
that makes me realize I love singing.

233
00:22:48,236 --> 00:22:51,936
KRISTA: So, I want to be dedicated to
and serious with this path.

234
00:22:51,936 --> 00:22:55,936
KRISTA: I'm gonna be singing a song
that I wrote two years ago when I was 14.

235
00:22:56,886 --> 00:22:59,736
KRISTA: It's a song that I wrote
for my friend

236
00:22:59,736 --> 00:23:02,086
KRISTA: who was an incredible guitarist.

237
00:23:02,336 --> 00:23:03,086
KRISTA: But

238
00:23:04,086 --> 00:23:07,286
KRISTA: he passed away two years ago,
so I wrote this song,

239
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:09,836
KRISTA: called "Play the Guitar for Me".

240
00:23:23,286 --> 00:23:24,886
Wow.

241
00:24:57,186 --> 00:24:58,336
KRISTA: Thank you.

242
00:24:58,886 --> 00:24:59,686
TRAINEES: Bravo!

243
00:24:59,886 --> 00:25:00,836
TRAINEES: Excellent.

244
00:25:00,986 --> 00:25:03,386
ILENE: Well, I've got goosebump
during the whole song.

245
00:25:03,886 --> 00:25:06,336
KAYLEN: Oh, no!
What am I competing against?

246
00:25:06,336 --> 00:25:10,286
KAYLEN: I don't know what's happening
because her voice is so amazing.

247
00:25:10,286 --> 00:25:13,786
PANGJANG: Actually, I'm also afraid of Krista,
because she's kind of like

248
00:25:13,786 --> 00:25:16,786
PANGJANG: has her unique style,

249
00:25:17,336 --> 00:25:19,486
PANGJANG: so she's an all-kill,
something like that.

250
00:25:19,486 --> 00:25:20,886
JEFF: Would you like to watch either of
their extra shows?

251
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:23,686
MIKE: I would like to see R-Jing

252
00:25:24,336 --> 00:25:25,686
MIKE: to perform solo.

253
00:26:20,286 --> 00:26:21,586
R-JING: Thank you.

254
00:26:21,936 --> 00:26:23,186
MIKE: Thank you very much.

255
00:26:24,386 --> 00:26:28,936
NENE: R-Jing, I feel when she sang,
her voice was already stable,

256
00:26:28,936 --> 00:26:33,636
NENE: but if you were more relaxed,
and weren't that serious about it,

257
00:26:33,636 --> 00:26:36,636
NENE: I think you would sing
more powerfully. So good!

258
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:40,586
MIKE: Krista, while you were singing,

259
00:26:40,836 --> 00:26:42,736
MIKE: were you thinking of that friend?

260
00:26:42,736 --> 00:26:43,836
KRISTA: Yes, I was.

261
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:45,486
MIKE: I would like to say I can feel that.

262
00:26:46,486 --> 00:26:49,086
MIKE: I could sense your feeling
while you were singing the song.

263
00:26:49,886 --> 00:26:52,736
MIKE: I believe when you closed your eyes,
you were thinking of him.

264
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,186
MIKE: And I feel

265
00:26:55,086 --> 00:26:55,686
MIKE: it was really great.

266
00:26:56,236 --> 00:26:57,186
MIKE: Please keep this.

267
00:26:58,536 --> 00:27:00,386
KRISTA: Right now I hope that

268
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:05,136
KRISTA: wherever you are, you will be
holding your guitar and you will be

269
00:27:05,136 --> 00:27:10,536
KRISTA: playing the guitar. I hope that one day
I'll be able to hear you play the guitar again.

270
00:27:11,936 --> 00:27:16,536
MIKE: Okay, everybody, the performance
of the first group has ended.

271
00:27:16,786 --> 00:27:19,686

313
00:29:58,586 --> 00:30:00,036

while I was listening.

314
00:30:00,036 --> 00:30:01,686

315
00:30:01,686 --> 00:30:05,536

TRAINEES: Hello, we're from
Insight Entertainment.

334
00:30:47,036 --> 00:30:48,736
CHACHA: The two of us are weird.

335
00:30:48,736 --> 00:30:50,786
CHACHA: Lissa really believes
in superstition.

336
00:30:50,786 --> 00:30:55,936
CHACHA: Her everyday look has green stuff.
Anything, just green. If not,

337
00:30:55,936 --> 00:30:57,986
CHACHA: it feels like
something weird is going on.

338
00:30:58,186 --> 00:31:00,186
LISSA: Our first show on the first stage

339
00:31:00,186 --> 00:31:03,986
LISSA: will be full of fun.

340
00:31:03,986 --> 00:31:05,536
LISSA: Something that's different
from others.

341
00:31:05,536 --> 00:31:08,036
CHACHA: ♪It's our time♪

342
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,236
MIKE: Please start your performance.

343
00:32:33,486 --> 00:32:35,086
LILANA LI: Whoa!

344
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:37,086
LILIANA LI: Oh, my gosh!
This is really Thai.

345
00:32:37,836 --> 00:32:41,086
LILIANA LI: I've never seen anything
like this before. What?

346
00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:43,086
LILIANA LI: Wow.

347
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:49,586
TRAINEES: It's so fun. I'll look forward
to how the next show will be.

348
00:32:49,586 --> 00:32:54,586
TRAINEES: Hello, we're from
RK Entertainment.

349
00:32:54,586 --> 00:32:56,586
TRAINEES: We're a duo
with extremely different habits,

350
00:32:56,586 --> 00:32:57,636
TRAINEES: but can go bananas everywhere.

351
00:32:57,636 --> 00:33:00,136
TRAINEES: We are TKTN.

352
00:33:16,236 --> 00:33:17,716
WANG SHENG XI: Well,
when the music started,

353
00:33:17,769 --> 00:33:19,866
WANG SHENG XI: everybody did this.
I saw everyone near me doing this.

354
00:33:19,886 --> 00:33:21,276
WANG SHENG XI: So, I think I had to
follow the trend.

355
00:33:21,436 --> 00:33:22,869
WANG SHENG XI: Em... I pretended like
I was familiar with it.

356
00:33:22,966 --> 00:33:26,469
WANG SHENG XI: It's like the short clip
I've previously watched on my phone.

357
00:33:26,566 --> 00:33:29,236
WANG SHENG XI: It was
a very Thai-styled video clip.

358
00:33:29,586 --> 00:33:33,386
ÁNH SÁNG: I think I can't wait to see
more Thai idols performing,

359
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:37,936
ÁNH SÁNG: because they're so energetic
and give happiness for us.

360
00:33:38,586 --> 00:33:40,186
ÁNH SÁNG: I love it.

361
00:33:45,086 --> 00:33:48,536
MIKE: Okay, our next performer is

362
00:33:48,786 --> 00:33:50,536
MIKE: J Jazzsper,

363
00:33:55,936 --> 00:33:58,336
NATTY: Wow, J Jazzsper.

364
00:33:59,486 --> 00:34:01,186
ILENE: She's so piercing.

365
00:34:01,186 --> 00:34:02,286
DUNA: Ah, I'm really sorry.

366
00:34:02,286 --> 00:34:04,286
YEHAM: It seems like
our style is in a different way.

367
00:34:08,086 --> 00:34:09,486
J JAZZSPER: Hello.

368
00:34:09,486 --> 00:34:10,936
J JAZZSPER: What's up? Gang, gang.

369
00:34:11,286 --> 00:34:13,986
J JAZZSPER: Cool and pretty.
Crazy and mystery.

370
00:34:13,986 --> 00:34:16,786
J JAZZSPER: It's me, J Jazzsper
from High Cloud Entertainment.

371
00:34:16,786 --> 00:34:19,186
J JAZZSPER: And you can call me
"Pretty J Swagger."

372
00:34:26,036 --> 00:34:26,736
J JAZZSPER: Slate.

373
00:34:27,386 --> 00:34:27,886
J JAZZSPER: Action.

374
00:34:28,236 --> 00:34:31,336
J JAZZSPER: Hello, everyone, I'm J Jazzsper
from High Cloud Entertainment.

375
00:34:36,686 --> 00:34:38,886
J JAZZSPER: If talking about
a well-known song, it's "DONG",

376
00:34:38,886 --> 00:34:42,836
J JAZZSPER: a hot chart song in TikTok.
I think everyone may have heard it.

377
00:34:50,336 --> 00:34:51,486
J JAZZSPER: Something like that. Oops!

378
00:34:51,986 --> 00:34:53,936
TRAINEES: Wow!

379
00:35:55,536 --> 00:35:56,786
TRAINEES: God! So hot!

380
00:35:56,786 --> 00:35:57,836
XUANNING: So good.

381
00:35:57,836 --> 00:35:59,986
XUANNING: I feel that she alone
could control this entire stage.

382
00:36:00,086 --> 00:36:03,386
ZOI: Even for J Jazzsper,
she was so good in the rap.

383
00:36:03,386 --> 00:36:04,136
MIKE: Marvelous.

384
00:36:04,136 --> 00:36:04,536
- J JAZZSPER: Thank you.
- MIKE: Marvelous.

385
00:36:04,536 --> 00:36:05,336
J JAZZSPER: Thank you.

386
00:36:05,336 --> 00:36:06,236
MENTOR: So hot.

387
00:36:06,586 --> 00:36:08,036
TRAINEES: Oh, my God! So hot!

388
00:36:08,036 --> 00:36:10,686
QIAO YIYU: Oh! I like this song.
♪Mirror mirror mirror♪

389
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,186
NATTY: Wow.

390
00:36:12,186 --> 00:36:16,902
QIAO YIYU: I felt she had it in her!
It's better than I've ever thought.

391
00:36:16,936 --> 00:36:18,886
AKINA: Jazzsper, my girl.

392
00:36:18,886 --> 00:36:22,386
NENE: I love it, so powerful.
It's 3-singer song, but you sang it alone.

393
00:36:22,386 --> 00:36:23,786
NENE: Am I right?

394
00:36:24,086 --> 00:36:26,636
NENE: F.Hero, Milli, and Changbin.
There're three singers, but you sang it alone.

395
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:27,836
J JAZZSPER: Thank you.

396
00:36:27,836 --> 00:36:29,786
NENE: If you debut, will you contend
for your member's position?

397
00:36:30,936 --> 00:36:31,786
J JAZZSPER: No.

398
00:36:32,286 --> 00:36:34,836
NENE: So energetic. Why did you
choose this song?

399
00:36:34,836 --> 00:36:37,236
J JAZZSPER: Well, I think it is
a hit song of my record label.

400
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:40,636
J JAZZSPER: And it's the first song that the label
is proud of for going up on Billboard.

401
00:36:41,236 --> 00:36:42,186
J JAZZSPER: That's all.

402
00:36:42,186 --> 00:36:44,736
ILENE: Her voice varies
between speaking and singing.

403
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:45,986
JEFF: I would like to ask
one more thing.

404
00:36:45,986 --> 00:36:50,186
JEFF: You already had a hit song.
I've heard it before, "DONG", right?

405
00:36:50,186 --> 00:36:50,786
J JAZZSPER: That's all.

406
00:36:50,786 --> 00:36:54,186
JEFF: So, why did you give up
on that artist path

407
00:36:54,186 --> 00:36:56,486
JEFF: and choose to debut
as a girl group instead?

408
00:36:56,486 --> 00:36:58,736
J JAZZSPER: Actually, I would like to be
in a girl group before.

409
00:36:58,736 --> 00:37:01,736
J JAZZSPER: But I don't have a chance
to pursue that dream, and now

410
00:37:01,736 --> 00:37:04,736
J JAZZSPER: it's like I've waited
for this kind of chances for a long time.

411
00:37:04,736 --> 00:37:09,836
J JAZZSPER: And now I have the chance.
It's my stage of life. I have to seize for it.

412
00:37:09,836 --> 00:37:11,936
J JAZZSPER: This time I bet on everything.

413
00:37:11,936 --> 00:37:13,936
J JAZZSPER: I'd like to do it again, and

414
00:37:13,936 --> 00:37:17,486
J JAZZSPER: I think I've shed
a lot of tears over disappointment. So,

415
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:20,836
J JAZZSPER: I'd like to come back
at this point to get success back to me.

416
00:37:21,336 --> 00:37:21,836
J JAZZSPER: That's all.

417
00:37:22,636 --> 00:37:23,786
J JAZZSPER: Please give me your vote.

418
00:37:23,786 --> 00:37:24,686
J JAZZSPER: Thank you.

419
00:37:25,136 --> 00:37:26,186
PREAM: Okay.

420
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,730
MIKE: The vote starts now.

421
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:36,330
QIAO YIYU: Usually, we focus on errors
in singing, dancing, or other skills.

422
00:37:36,396 --> 00:37:38,790
QIAO YIYU: In fact, the most important thing
on the stage is to show off your spirit.

423
00:37:38,863 --> 00:37:42,330
QIAO YIYU: I think all the Thai trainees
can show this energy very well.

424
00:37:50,863 --> 00:37:51,730
MIKE: You're the MVP.

425
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:53,980
J JAZZSPER: Thank you.

426
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,080
MIKE: Okay, thank you for the performance.

427
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,130
J JAZZSPER: Thank you.

428
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,580
J JAZZSPER: This is my brand new journey,

429
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:09,930
J JAZZSPER: and I have to
learn many things.

430
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:13,130
J JAZZSPER: And thank you
for everyone's voting for me.

431
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,980
JACKSON: How's everyone feeling?

432
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,830
TRAINEES: Whoa!

433
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,180
JACKSON: We're good?

434
00:38:28,992 --> 00:38:33,180
MIKE: So, we're gonna make
an announcement.

435
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,430
MIKE: Let's have

436
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,830
MIKE: the nine trainees who've performed
just now. Please stand up.

437
00:38:44,548 --> 00:38:49,412
MIKE: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

438
00:38:49,412 --> 00:38:52,762
MIKE: Jackson, wanna do the honor of
telling them what's going on?

439
00:38:52,962 --> 00:38:55,062
JACKSON: CHUANG ASIA THAILAND.

440
00:38:56,962 --> 00:38:58,462
JACKSON: The final debut group

441
00:38:59,662 --> 00:39:00,912
JACKSON: is nine members.

442
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,110
XUANNING: But they'll pick nine people.

443
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,768
XUANNING: I think I may have some hope.

444
00:39:08,867 --> 00:39:11,627
SHYE: First, they were
very excited to vote,

445
00:39:11,627 --> 00:39:16,617
SHYE: but I think over time when, especially when
Jackson said that there will be nine people,

446
00:39:16,617 --> 00:39:20,467
SHYE: I think I could feel like
this tension in the room.

447
00:39:20,467 --> 00:39:22,187
SHYE: We know a number.

448
00:39:22,187 --> 00:39:26,067
SHYE: So, now it's like people seem
to be more competitive.

449
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:45,480
MIKE: And we're gonna be choosing
the Top 3 among the nine of you guys.

450
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,040
JACKSON: And by the way,
the Top 3, there's no order.

451
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,200
JACKSON: Lissa.

452
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,200
LISSA: At the time, I'd really like
to call my mom and say,

453
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,240
LISSA: Mom, I made it.

454
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,000
LISSA: I actually made it.

455
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,400
TEN: Okay, the second member

456
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,160
TEN: that will go into the Top 3 is...

457
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,800
TEN: Jazzsper.

458
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,840
AKINA: Her voice, the tone in her voice

459
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,680
AKINA: And so I think that really makes
her stand out as well.

460
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,240
JEFF: So, em... the last one

461
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,320
JEFF: in the Top 3...

462
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,160
JEFF: is Krista.

463
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,360
MAMCÙ: I really like her tone.

464
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,360
MAMCÙ: The first time I listened to
her singing,

465
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,920
MAMCÙ: The first time I listened to her singing,
I felt like I was listening to the original singer.

466
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,880
MAMCÙ: Good voice, very good technique.

467
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,320
KRISTA: I'm so glad and excited.

468
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,400
KRISTA: than this. I have to be
ready for everything on this stage.

469
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,200
WANG YIBING: I think that it's
the feeling of being accepted.

470
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,200
MIKE: As I said this is
just temporary, okay?

471
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,360
MIKE: So, I think it's time we move on
to the next audition.

472
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,720
MIKE: You guys ready?

473
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,680
TRAINEES: Yes!

474
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,600
MIKE: Okay, let's go!

475
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,520
NENE: Wow!

476
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,160
EMMA: but on the stage,

477
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,520
EMMA: I was like, forget everything.

478
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,600
EMMA: I just focused on my stage
and my dance solo.

479
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,760
MIKE: Next performer, please.

480
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,840
TRAINEES: D-R-E-A-M.
We are here for fun and dreams.

481
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,000
RAY/JASMINE: Hello.

482
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,480

MIKE: I have a question.

537
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,440
MIKE: DiDi.

538
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,840
MIKE: Your name kind of reminds me
of someone

539
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,680
MIKE: I heard of
when I was working in China.

540
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,440
DIDI: Uh-huh.

541
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,760
MIKE: Are you related to Ouyang Nana?

542
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,280

543
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,040

Ouyang Didi, but I know Ouyang Nana.

544
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,240

at least, heard her name once.

546
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,200

really good relationship.

547
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:33,520
DIDI: I'm studying in
Beijing Film Academy right now.

548
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:39,240
DIDI: It's always some moments that, in my age,
I feel like it's to find what you want to do.

549
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,120
DIDI: Being a 19-year-old girl

550
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,440
DIDI: And to learn from each other
and I think

551
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,480
DIDI: this is the way that I can
learn the fastest,

552
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:57,880
DIDI: and to find my dreams
and achieve them.

553
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:02,040
MIKE: OK, so I guess it's time for
the extra show,

554
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,080

ELYN: Ah, thank you.

559
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,280
MIKE: Okay.

560
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:17,480
ELYN: I was surprised that they chose me,
because it's my first ever stage with dancing and singing.

561
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,800
ELYN: But I want to believe in myself.

562
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,240
MIKE: DiDi.

563
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,160
MIKE: Please start your performance.

564
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,320
Wow.

565
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,400
Oh my gosh.

566
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,440
Wow.

567
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,360
Wow.

568
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,480
ILENE: Her ending pose is like

569
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,920
ILENE: a snail, like a swan.
It's like a swan.

570
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,680
MIKE: Thank you very much.

571
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,080

00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,600

Fighting.

ELYN: Hello, everyone. I'm Elyn.

575
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:30,640
ELYN: And I wrote this song during
my first week of stay in Bangkok,

576
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,800
ELYN: and

577
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,000
Wow.

578
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,520
Wow.

579
00:51:44,920 --> 00:52:49,040
(Music) - EN

580
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,440
MIKE: Thank you so much, Elyn.

581
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,800
ELYN: I think so.

582
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:17,920
ELYN: So, I'm a social media influencer.

583
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:25,840
(Music) - EN

584
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,040
ELYN: I've started being an influencer

585
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,600
ELYN: around the age of 12,

586
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,360
ELYN: where social media started to
become very popular.

587
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,720
AUN AUN: I've been popular on
social media for a long time.

588
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,960
AUN AUN: My clips have become virals,

589
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,000
AUN AUN: and attracted many people.

590
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:46,320
JASMINE: Now I have a TikTok channel
named "Jasmine Likes Eating Salmons."

591
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,640
JASMINE: Now I have around
4 or 5 million followers.

592
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,040
JASMINE: I can't remember that.

593
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:55,400
TEN: I knew you guys are very famous on
media, like TikTok and Instagram.

594
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:03,240
ELYN: I feel like I've been in
my comfort zone for too long,

595
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,760
ELYN: and I wanted to explore more.

596
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,000
ELYN: and

597
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,600
ELYN: even though my dance
and singing are not the best,

598
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,640
ELYN: like what Mentor NENE said,

599
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,560
ELYN: even though it's not the best,
at least it's what I love.

600
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,680
ELYN: So, I'm here because of what I love.

601
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:21,680
ELYN: Yes.

602
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,480
DIDI: Actually, I don't think I'm famous.

603
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,480
DIDI: I think it's because
since I was young, like my family...

604
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:37,800
DIDI: So, that's why a lot of people
kind of know me with that.

605
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,680
DIDI: I think whatever it is,
it has no shortcuts.

606
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,960
DIDI: Let's say today I have a chance
to sign a contract with the company,

607
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,440
DIDI: I'm just like a blank sheet.

608
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,960
DIDI: I wish I can have

609
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,600
DIDI: a big improvement during the show,

610
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:57,640
DIDI: and to do what I like,
like singing and dance.

611
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,040
MIKE: Keep it up.

612
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:02,600
MIKE: You can do it.

613
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,840
JASMINE: I'm a barista on Starbucks.

614
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,720
MIKE: Maybe she likes coffee.

615
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,240
JASMINE: Do you like coffee?

616
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:24,760
JACKSON: Yeah.

617
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,880
JASMINE: Oh! It's so good.

618
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,920
JASMINE: Because "I Love You a Latte."

619
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:32,280
JASMINE: Huh?

620
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,800
JASMINE: You don't know?
"I Love You a Latte."

621
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,240
TEN: Ah, it's latte, right?

622
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,040
JASMINE: Yes.

623
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,400
JASMINE: "I Love You a Lot."

624
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,320
NENE: Ah, I love you a lot.

625
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,240
MIKE: She's trying to say like

626
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,240
MIKE: I love you "a Lot"

627
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,280
MIKE: but it sounds like "a Latte".

628
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,080
JACKSON WANG: It's a Thai joke?

629
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:48,440
MIKE: Yeah.

630
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,680
JEFF: A latte.

631
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,160
- NENE: Anything else? Give me one.
- MIKE: Anything more?

632
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,320
JASMINE: "Are you ice?"

633
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:01,760
JASMINE: "Are you ice?"

634
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,040
JASMINE: 'Cuz "Wo Ice Ni".
[*Sounds like "I love you" in Chinese.]

635
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:12,200
JASMINE: How many states does
the heart have?

636
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,080
MIKE: How many? I'll play with you.

637
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:14,840
JASMINE: There are three states.

638
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,680
JASMINE: Solid state, liquid state,

639
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:17,560
JASMINE: and your state.

640
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,000
JASMINE: Okay.

641
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,040
JASMINE: My Wi-Fi is 4G,

642
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,720
JASMINE: but my heart is 4U.
[*For you.]

643
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,240
TEN: Heart is for you.

644
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,360
TEN: Do you know how many "YOUs"
are in front of me?

645
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,240
JASMINE: How many 'YOUs?'

646
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,440
TEN: It's only YOU.

647
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,600
MIKE: I'm gonna test her English, okay?

648
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,440
MIKE: Can you spell the word "cute"
in English, please?

649
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,320
MIKE: Cute. The word "cute" in English,
how do you spell it?

650
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,040
JASMINE: C-U-T-E.

651
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,520
NENE: Oh, my god!

652
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,720
NENE: Oh, my god!

653
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,880
JASMINE: I'm walking on air.

654
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:41,640
JASMINE: I completed my improv. I don't need
to debut now. This is the best of my ability.

655
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,920
JASMINE: Just kidding.

656
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,920
- MIKE: Hey, should we move on?
- Yes.

657
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,840
MIKE: And now it's time to vote.

658
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,120
TEN: But I feel like your singing and
dancing skills... You're still lacking.

659
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:47,880
TEN: So, I hope to see more from you
in the future.

660
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,080
DIDI: Thank you. I'll try more.

661
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:55,480
MIKE: So, the MVP of this group is...

662
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,880
MIKE: Congratulations, Elyn.

663
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,040

our culture's different, or it's not about the language.

01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:37,040
YUI: I'm pretty and cutie baby.

1006
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:38,960

COCO: Hello.

1009
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:45,320
COCO: My name is Coco, 16 years old.

1010
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:47,720
COCO: I usually look cool and calm,

1011
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:50,960
COCO: but I sudden switch like
a white tiger when I perform.

1012
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:53,160
TRAINEE: One, two.

1013
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:56,200
TRAINEE: We'll do our best.
Nice to meet you.

1014
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:57,080
Oh my gosh.

1015
01:34:58,120 --> 01:34:59,200
MIKE: Nice to meet you, too.

1016
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:00,560
RUAN: Um, I

1017
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:08,720
RUAN: and I have high expectations
for them.

1019
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:14,720
QIAO YI YU: I didn't expect Avex to choose

1020
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:15,760
QIAO YI YU: the song "Left Right."

1021
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:18,480
QIAO YI YU: I felt like
they attracted me a lot.

1022
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:20,360
QIAO YI YU: They have already completed
more than half of it.

1023
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:24,640
QIAO YI YU: They're great.
No wonder they're Avex.

1024
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:41,840
JEFF: Would you like to watch either of
their extra shows?

1025
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:43,680
MIKE: I would like to see Rei's.

1026
01:37:44,680 --> 01:37:47,160
REI: Excuse me, I have something to
tell you.

1027
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:49,120
REI: This time I'll rap,

1028
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:52,480
REI: and this is the first rap I've ever
written.

1029
01:37:52,560 --> 01:38:45,560
(Music) - EN

1030
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:51,080
MIKE: Thank you.

1031
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:53,680
REI: I felt great.

1032
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:58,120
REI: I saw everyone smile at me.

1033
01:38:58,160 --> 01:39:01,760
REI: I saw some of them making hand hearts
to me.

1034
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:03,120
REI: I'm really happy.

1035
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:05,000
REI: Um. Over the past 7 years,

1036
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:07,960
REI: everything has been going downhill.

1037
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:12,560
REI: I felt so stuck that I couldn't even
breakthrough.

1038
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:16,040
REI: I feel like I finally broke through
because of that show.

1039
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:20,240
MIKE: Actually, the reason why I chose her
to do the extra show

1040
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:23,160
MIKE: is when she's performing as a group,

1041
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:27,200
MIKE: I can't really see her, but I kinda
see something in her.

1042
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:27,640
JEFF: Yeah.

1043
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:31,640
MIKE: And I wanted to see her
solo performance and I was right about it.

1044
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:32,240
JEFF: Yeah.

1045
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:33,560
JEFF: So right.

1046
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:36,960
TEN: Akina, I used to listen to your song

1047
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:39,680
AKINA: No way.

1048
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:40,480
TEN: Faky, right?

1049
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:44,880
AKINA: Yes, I debuted 8 years ago

1050
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:47,480
AKINA: with the girl group called Faky.

1051
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:55,880
AKINA: and we had a last live just
a couple of weeks ago.

1052
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
AKINA: how much I love them

1053
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
AKINA: and how much fun I have with them.

1054
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:13,840
AKINA: As of right now, since everything
has changed so suddenly,

1055
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:23,160
AKINA: but I know that I love being
an artist.

1056
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:33,160
AKINA: And so I feel like this is my chance to
give it everything that I have and do the best that I can.

1057
01:40:39,640 --> 01:40:40,680
AKINA: A little more.

1058
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:41,280
TEN: Yes.

1059
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:46,840
AKINA: Thank you. Thank you so much.
That's crazy.

1060
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:51,320
AKINA: Thank you. I'll do my best.

1061
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:53,760

1062
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:56,520
ILENE: We're Mindy. We're a new group.

1063
01:40:56,560 --> 01:41:02,120
ILENE: We just debuted and released
2 singles.

1064
01:41:02,120 --> 01:41:05,880

a cute and cheerful concept.

1065
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:08,040
ILENE: And I believe that we can

1066
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:09,960

1067
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:11,200

1085
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:40,920

ZHANG XIANG YI: I wanna go home.

1094
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:06,680
ZOI: Mindy members are all so young,

1095
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:08,600
ZOI: but they were so good.

1096
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:10,440
ZOI: I felt like what am I doing here?

1097
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:12,600
XUANNING: The technique they showed

1098
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:17,280
XUANNING: It's a technique that even
some men cannot do.

1099
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:21,880
DUNA: Maybe because it's their debut song.
They were all so focused.

1100
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:26,520
DUNA: They worked well together like
they've been practiced for a long time.

1101
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:34,000
XUEYAO: I was so calm at first, but when
I saw this group perform...

1102
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:35,760
XUEYAO: When I saw them get on the stage
one by one,

1103
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:38,320
XUEYAO: my heart started racing like this.

1104
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:40,840
YUANKE: When I saw them perform, I felt like,
"Wow, this is what a true girl group is."

1105
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:43,280
MIKE: Jackson.

1106
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:44,360
NENE: Jackson.

1107
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:44,960
MIKE: Are you okay?

1108
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:45,640
NENE: Jackson, are you okay?

1109
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:46,240
MIKE: Jackson, are you okay?
NENE: Jackson, are you okay?

1110
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:47,880
MIKE: Jackson, are you okay?

1111
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:51,920

NENE: So many things happened here.

1113
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:07,080
NENE: Yeah.

1114
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:19,200
NENE: Looks like really cute but dances
like a boy.

1115
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:20,960
NENE: Yeah.

1116
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:23,920
TEN: I'm not sure if they're a girl group
or a boy band now.

1117
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:25,440
NENE: Yeah. They look like a boy band.

1118
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:26,160
TEN: So cool.

1119
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:30,320
JEFF: I love how you guys know
what you're good at

1120
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:32,760
JEFF: and put yourselves in positions

1121
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:34,200
JEFF: that suit you.

1122
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:37,040
JEFF: And you guys made such good use
of the entire stage like

1123
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:38,080
JEFF: you're trying to occupy every inch
of it.

1124
01:46:38,160 --> 01:46:39,240
TRAINEES: Thank you.

1125
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:41,320
TEN: I want to compliment Praew on
one thing.

1126
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:43,680
TEN: At first, I wanted to watch everyone.

1127
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:47,760
TEN: But as I watched,
I kept looking at Praew.

1128
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:49,120
PREAM: Aw.

1129
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:51,200
PREAM: I'm blushing.

1130
01:46:52,360 --> 01:46:57,320
TEN: You expressed yourself very well
like you know what you're good at.

1131
01:46:57,360 --> 01:47:00,440
TEN: When you perform on stage,
it's like you're

1132
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:03,240
TEN: letting your true self shine through.

1133
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:05,640
TEN: That's why I cannot take my eyes
off you.

1134
01:47:05,680 --> 01:47:08,720
PREAM: He said, "I cannot take my eyes
off you."

1135
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:10,000
PREAM: Aw.

1136
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:14,880
NENE: I wanna ask one. Another one
question like,

1137
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:18,200
NENE: you've already debuted, but why you
came here?

1138
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:22,560
MINGMING: We want to continue to improve
ourselves.

1139
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:26,840
MINGMING: We want to meet many talented
people through this show

1140
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:29,480
MINGMING: and want to see how much we can
truly grow.

1141
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:30,520
JEFF: Okay, but what if

1142
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:34,440
JEFF: you have to debut separately,
or if you're split into different groups?

1143
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:35,760
JEFF: What do you think about that?

1144
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,920
ILENE: because I believe
we've all tried hard

1145
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:46,000
ILENE: and trained very hard

1146
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:49,200
ILENE: for this show and for debut.

1147
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:56,800
MINGMING: Because after the show ends,
we'll continue as Mindy anyway.

1148
01:47:56,920 --> 01:47:59,840
MIKE: Overall, your group

1149
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:01,960
MIKE: is very good.

1150
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:05,520
MIKE: There are still rooms
for improvement.

1151
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:10,120
MIKE: And I believe that if you try hard,
you'll succeed.

1152
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:12,560
MIKE: Keep going.

1153
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:13,880
MIKE: And now...

1154
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:15,960
ILENE: Oh, I want to say something...

1155
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:16,360
MIKE: Okay.

1156
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:19,200
ILENE: To Jackson.

1157
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:20,000
ILENE: Um.

1158
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:26,520
ILENE: And...

1159
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:30,640
ILENE: I was really young,

1160
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:34,960
ILENE: But you're always my idol, and I...

1161
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:39,480
ILENE: You're always be my idol

1162
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:40,480
ILENE: And...

1163
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:54,800
MIKE: Thank you very much.

1164
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:55,720
MIKE: Thank you very much.

1165
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:02,880
ILENE: Did you hear?

1166
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:04,160
ILENE: Did you hear?

1167
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:07,120
ILENE: I'm gonna faint.

1168
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:10,000
ILENE: Love you, muah muah.

JEFF: to make it like more emotional.

1175
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:04,880
JEFF: I just not feel it that much.

1176
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:06,440
JEFF: You have to be in the song more.

1177
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:11,920
JEFF: It'll just make your song more attractable.
I mean everything would come out more.

1178
01:50:32,720 --> 01:50:35,400
JEFF: I think what you're missing is

1179
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:37,000
JEFF: like...

1180
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:39,560
JEFF: you cannot express yourself well.

1181
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:42,240

1182

(Music) - EN

1184
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:02,680
JEFF: I think you got that vocal skill,

1185
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:06,240
JEFF: but you have to make it stable.

1186
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:10,320
JEFF: Just improve on this and think more.
That would be good.

1187

learned one of her songs that she sings.

1195
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:33,040
LILIANA LI: When I saw her, I'm like

1196
01:51:33,080 --> 01:51:35,720

this show?"

1200
01:51:45,160 --> 01:51:47,720
MAMCÙ: songwriting and eating potatoes.

1201
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:51,240
MAMCÙ: And yeah, I'm gonna sing

1202
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:52,920

01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:08,680
TEGAN: Very unique. It's like one of those
voices you don't expect really.

1209
01:54:08,680 --> 01:54:11,480
LILIANA LI: I just love her voice. It's so good.

JASMINE: Mamcu. Her voice is so good.

1212
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:17,000
JASMINE: At first, I was thinking

1213
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:21,440
JASMINE: "She has such a good voice.
Why don't she go to The Voice?"

1214
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:23,600
JASMINE: She's very good.

1215

JASMINE: Really?

1217
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:29,280
JASMINE: She was from The Voice?

1218

1219
01:54:35,160 --> 01:54:36,400
MAMCÙ: Actually, I was

1220
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:37,520
MAMCÙ: from The Voice.

1221
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:42,000
MAMCÙ: Back then, I believed I had
a chance at winning,

1222
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:44,360
MAMCÙ: but ranking second was unexpected.

1223
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:47,440
MAMCÙ: It made me want to

1224
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:49,520
MAMCÙ: keep pushing even harder.

1225
01:54:49,600 --> 01:54:52,160
NENE: When the music started and
you did like this,

1226
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:57,320
NENE: I felt as if Beyoncé's vibes were
coming from you.

1227
01:54:57,880 --> 01:55:00,720
NENE: That's so great, like the song.

1228
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:06,600
NENE: And yeah, we know that you come from
another program.

1229
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,880
NENE: Why do you come here?

1230
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:10,680
MAMCÙ: Wearing the little skirt
for dancing and singing.

1231
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:14,000
MAMCÙ: It's my dream.

1232
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:16,680
MAMCÙ: Being able to wear a little skirt

1233
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:18,280
MAMCÙ: while singing
and dancing on this stage.

1234
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:19,320
MAMCÙ: I felt like

1235
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:20,640
MAMCÙ: I have to come here.

1236
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:21,520
NENE: And

1237
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:23,960
NENE: did you come here alone?

1238
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:26,000
MAMCÙ: Yes. I came here alone.

1239
01:55:26,120 --> 01:55:27,840
MAMCÙ: This is my first time traveling
abroad.

1240
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:30,560
-NENE: Are you alone?
-MIKE: Is this your first time in Thailand?

1241
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:34,840
MIKE: Haven't you traveled to any country
before?

1242
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:35,360
MAMCÙ: No.

1243
01:55:35,640 --> 01:55:36,520
MIKE: Really?

1244
01:55:36,520 --> 01:55:37,800
NENE: How do you feel?

1245
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:40,800
MAMCÙ: My first impression is

1246
01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:41,520
MAMCÙ: that it's very hot here.

1247
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:47,600
MAMCÙ: Yeah, it's warm.

1248
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:51,280
JEFF: The every note is perfect.

1249
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:53,040
JEFF: Yes, it's pretty good.

1250
01:55:56,640 --> 01:55:57,400
JEFF: It's pretty good.

1251
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:02,800
TEN: You told us you want to be
in a girl group, right?

1252
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:06,560
TEN: Can you show us some dance?

1253
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:11,040
MAMCÙ: I think I'm still not good at
dancing,

1254
01:56:11,080 --> 01:56:13,280
MAMCÙ: so, I didn't prepare a dance.

1255
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:16,600
MAMCÙ: I want to prepare more and show it
next time

1256
01:56:16,680 --> 01:56:20,160
MAMCÙ: in a well-prepared state.

1257
01:56:26,120 --> 01:56:27,680
MAMCÙ: Next time.

1258
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:35,720
MIKE: Let's vote.

1259
01:56:41,120 --> 01:56:43,320
YEAN: She sings very well,

1260
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:44,720
YEAN: but she doesn't dance.

1261
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:48,120
YEAN: I didn't vote for Mamcù.

1262
01:56:48,200 --> 01:56:53,920
YEAN: Because this is a competition show to become an
idol girl group, singing and dancing are must-have skills.

1263
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:58,880
YEAN: If she shows her dance a bit,
and shows that she has some skills,

1264
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:00,760
YEAN: I might vote for her.

1265
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:08,840
MIKE: MVP of this

1266
01:57:09,080 --> 01:57:09,800
MIKE: person is

1267
01:57:10,240 --> 01:57:10,880
MIKE: Mamcù.

1268
01:57:11,080 --> 01:57:13,240
MIKE: You're the MVP.

1269
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:19,920
NENE: Good job.

1270
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:23,720
MAMCÙ: After I got on stage, I felt like
I was dreaming.

1271
01:57:26,280 --> 01:57:29,840
JACKSON: Thank you so much for
Mamcù's performance.

1272
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:34,640

1273
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:43,680
TRAINEES: What?

1274
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:44,480
TRAINEES: Time for what?

1275
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:46,640
TRAINEES: Oh, probably gonna announce A, B

1276
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:47,840
TRAINEES: class?

1277
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:50,680
MIKE: We have an announcement.

1278
01:57:54,440 --> 01:57:56,840
JACKSON: We wanted the top 3.

1279
01:57:56,840 --> 01:57:58,640
JACKSON: Please stand up.

1280
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:06,440
MIKE: How did you feel about the previous
performance?

1281
01:58:06,440 --> 01:58:08,240
J JAZZSPER: I was very amazed.

1282
01:58:08,240 --> 01:58:10,640
J JAZZSPER: Foreign trainees are
very talented.

1283
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:12,280
NENE: Do you think anyone can take your
place?

1284
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:12,760
Oh.

1285
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:23,560
J JAZZSPER: I think Avex.

1286
01:58:24,840 --> 01:58:25,360
Avex?

1287
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:27,720
J JAZZSPER: I think I saw 1 rapper
from their group.

1288
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:28,800
- Ah.
- Avex.

1289
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:30,960
JACKSON: Oh, that's right because
they're both rap.

1290
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:36,160
J JAZZSPER: Oh, it's so stressful.

1291
01:58:36,160 --> 01:58:38,160
J JAZZSPER: How can I keep my position?

1292
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:40,680
J JAZZSPER: Everyone who comes on this
show wants to debut.

1293
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:42,920
J JAZZSPER: We all have the same dream,
and we have to fight for it.

1294
01:58:43,640 --> 01:58:44,160
J JAZZSPER: It's so much pressure.

1295
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:47,160
MIKE: Lissa, which show do you like the most?

1296
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:48,080
LISSA: Coco.

1297
01:58:48,760 --> 01:58:49,400
MIKE: Coco.

1298
01:58:50,640 --> 01:58:52,520
LISSA: Because I feel like I saw her
dance,

1299
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:56,080
LISSA: it was out of this word, it's still
stuck in my...

1300
01:58:56,080 --> 01:58:58,240
LISSA: It's so cool.

1301
01:59:00,360 --> 01:59:01,800
TEN: I want to ask one question.

1302
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:05,720
TEN: Krista, which vocal do you think
you can win?

1303
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:09,960
KRISTA: Win?

1304
01:59:10,120 --> 01:59:11,680
NENE: It can be your rival.

1305
01:59:11,680 --> 01:59:13,680
NENE: Like you found your enemy.

1306
01:59:14,400 --> 01:59:15,400
KRISTA: I like...

1307
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:17,840
KRISTA: I like Yean from Barbie.

1308
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:21,440
KRISTA: I feel like her voice and
everything is very talented.

1309
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:22,360
MIKE: Okay, okay.

1310
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:25,120
MIKE: We're

1311
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:27,880
MIKE: going to make announcement

1312
01:59:29,160 --> 01:59:31,720
MIKE: who gets to stay in the top 3.

1313
01:59:33,200 --> 01:59:33,720
MIKE: So,

1314
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:36,440
MIKE: J Jazzsper,

1315
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:45,240
MIKE: You get to stay.

1316
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:50,280
MIKE: Congratulation.

1317
01:59:50,280 --> 01:59:53,920
J JAZZSPER: I kept thinking that I would
definitely drop in rank,

1318
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:58,080
J JAZZSPER: but I'm glad that I was able
to maintain my position in the top 9.

1319
01:59:58,800 --> 01:59:59,560
MIKE: Krista,

1320
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:04,200
MIKE: You get to stay.

1321
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:07,520
KRISTA: I felt very surprised

1322
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:10,560
KRISTA: and proud of myself.

1323
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:12,840
MIKE: Lissa,

1324
02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:15,880
MIKE: I'm sorry.

1325
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:25,480
MIKE: You don't get to stay.

1326
02:00:30,440 --> 02:00:31,520
Fighting.

1327
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:36,280
LISSA: You didn't make it to the top 9.

1328
02:00:36,280 --> 02:00:38,000
LISSA: I was like "Why?"

1329
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:42,520
LISSA: The top 3 slipped away from me.

1330
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:43,560
LISSA: So, I tell myself

1331
02:00:44,120 --> 02:00:45,280
LISSA: "it's okay, Lissa"

1332
02:00:45,880 --> 02:00:47,440
LISSA: Keep smiling and laugh it off.

1333
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:51,560
JACKSON: We're going to announce the top 9

1334
02:00:53,120 --> 02:00:53,640
JACKSON: currently.

1335
02:00:55,680 --> 02:01:00,280
JACKSON: So, which means if there are
2 out of 3 that stays

1336
02:01:00,760 --> 02:01:02,000
JACKSON: then the latest top 9

1337
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:05,760
JACKSON: will be 7 new faces.

1338
02:01:10,480 --> 02:01:15,240
KAYLEN: Oh, they're already announcing the top 9,
so I really wasn't ready or prepared for it.

1339
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:19,840
PREAM: It was a little bit pressured.

1340
02:01:20,680 --> 02:01:21,880
JACKSON: The 3rd trainee

1341
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:24,960
JACKSON: that will join top 9

1342
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:26,480
JACKSON: is

1343
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:32,000
JACKSON: Tegan.

1344
02:01:35,960 --> 02:01:37,160
JACKSON: The 4th trainee,

1345
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:38,280
JACKSON: Kaylen.

1346
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:46,560
TEGAN: I still feel shocked.

1347
02:01:46,840 --> 02:01:49,640
TEGAN: And it feels very surreal.

1348
02:01:50,160 --> 02:01:53,000
KAYLEN: Oh, I actually have to go down
and sit there?

1349
02:01:53,120 --> 02:01:57,520
KAYLEN: Like I wasn't prepared for it.
I was very very shocked.

1350
02:01:57,520 --> 02:02:01,760
KAYLEN: I mean I was so happy that the two
of us made it to the top 9.

1351
02:02:08,160 --> 02:02:18,640
XUEYAO: Their performance style is very rare. I feel they
weren't nervous at all because they just wanted to convey emotions

1352
02:02:18,640 --> 02:02:20,640
XUEYAO: and create a relaxing atmosphere.

1353
02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:30,520
TEN: Okay, um, the 5th member is

1354
02:02:36,600 --> 02:02:37,840
TEN: Yean.

1355
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:45,760
TEN: The next member is

1356
02:02:46,240 --> 02:02:46,920
TEN: Pream.

1357
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:52,160
MIKE: Congratulation.

1358
02:02:54,040 --> 02:02:58,080
YEAN: I wanted to grab my phone and text
my mom right away to tell her, "I did it!"

1359
02:02:58,080 --> 02:02:59,560
YEAN: I was so happy.

1360
02:03:01,200 --> 02:03:03,760
PREAM: My jaw dropped in surprise for
a long time.

1361
02:03:03,760 --> 02:03:07,400
PREAM: From the announcement until
I walked down, my jaw still hung open.

1362
02:03:15,680 --> 02:03:16,680
J JAZZSPER: I like Barbie.

1363
02:03:16,680 --> 02:03:19,240
J JAZZSPER: They're very talented. I can
tell that they've practiced a lot.

1364
02:03:21,480 --> 02:03:22,920
J JAZZSPER: One of the best girl groups in
Thailand.

1365
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:27,640
JEFF: She's Thai.

1366
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:37,080
JEFF: It's Praew.

1367
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:49,400
PRAEW: Wow, I can't believe I made it
this far.

1368
02:03:49,400 --> 02:03:53,160
PRAEW: I'm so proud of myself for doing
so well

1369
02:03:53,160 --> 02:03:54,880
PRAEW: and getting in the top 9.

1370
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:09,760
LENE: She's an all-rounder because she can sing and
dance, has great facial expressions, and can rap.

1371
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:11,480
TRAINEES: Good job.

1372
02:04:13,400 --> 02:04:15,400
NENE: So, the next person.

1373
02:04:16,440 --> 02:04:19,320
NENE: Her name starts with the E.

1374
02:04:22,360 --> 02:04:22,760
NENE: That is

1375
02:04:24,240 --> 02:04:24,960
NENE: Emma.

1376
02:04:35,160 --> 02:04:37,480
JASMINE: I like Emma. She's beautiful
and a good dancer.

1377
02:04:37,960 --> 02:04:39,400
J JAZZSPER: She's talented. I love that

1378
02:04:39,400 --> 02:04:42,320
J JAZZSPER: she has passion.
She's one of the

1379
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:43,800
J JAZZSPER: people who I feel is
confident.

1380
02:04:44,440 --> 02:04:46,640
EMMA: I was really shocked because

1381
02:04:47,240 --> 02:04:53,040
EMMA: the top 9 decided by the finished
voting, right?

1382
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:58,000
EMMA: So, that much people love me. I feel
really happy and pleasure.

1383
02:04:58,720 --> 02:05:02,160
MIKE: Okay. So, the last trainee

1384
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:04,880
MIKE: that's gonna join the top 9

1385
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:06,760
MIKE: will be

1386
02:05:22,360 --> 02:05:23,080
MIKE: Coco.

1387
02:05:26,600 --> 02:05:29,120
TRAINEE: Coco.

1388
02:05:34,120 --> 02:05:39,480
COCO: I think being in the top 9 from 70
is very amazing.

1389
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:44,200
COCO: I didn't expect that I'd get to be
in the top 9.

1390
02:05:44,600 --> 02:05:48,560
COCO: I was truly shocked.

1391
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:51,560
AKINA: Coco went crazy.

1392
02:05:51,560 --> 02:05:56,680
AKINA: In that situation, I really think that
she deserved it. She did an amazing job.

1393
02:06:08,440 --> 02:06:11,760
JACKSON: We've just seen a lot of amazing
performances.

1394
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:16,080
JACKSON: A lot of candidates that we
believe had huge potential.

1395
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:19,680
JACKSON: We discussed. We have a rule.

1396
02:06:22,920 --> 02:06:27,560
JACKSON: We have another section called
the "Big Vote."

1397
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:33,560
JACKSON: We, as mentors,

1398
02:06:44,640 --> 02:06:45,920
JACKSON: and that person

1399
02:06:47,240 --> 02:06:49,360
JACKSON: will challenge the top 9.

1400
02:06:50,120 --> 02:06:52,160
ILENE: They have to compete the top 9.

1401
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:57,240
JACKSON: Big Vote is we, as experienced
mentors and leaders,

1402
02:07:07,040 --> 02:07:10,680
JACKSON: that I felt like they could've
done more.

1403
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:13,440
NENE: It won't be fun if there's no
battle.

1404
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:17,480
NENE: But from my competitor's
perspective, I believe it's more

1405
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:19,880
NENE: about competing with yourself

1406
02:07:21,480 --> 02:07:23,680
MIKE: Those who make it to the Top 9
may feel

1407
02:07:24,040 --> 02:07:25,080
MIKE: happy for only a short while,

1408
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:29,880
MIKE: because they start to get nervous
about the possibility of them losing their position.

1409
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:33,480
JEFF: Actually, Big Vote allows mentors to
pick trainees that

1410
02:07:33,480 --> 02:07:36,000
JEFF: suit for challenging with the top 9

1411
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,880
JEFF: to replace the top 9.

1412
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:44,560
JEFF: The mentors are to pick the challengers
and the rest trainees are to vote.

1413
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:49,160
JACKSON: Top 9, if you fail the challenge,

1414
02:07:49,160 --> 02:07:50,760
JACKSON: you'll get replaced.

1415
02:07:50,760 --> 02:07:51,880
Oh my gosh.

1416
02:07:53,640 --> 02:07:56,680
EMMA: A little bit worried but
really excited.

1417
02:07:57,040 --> 02:07:59,680
EMMA: It would be fun to fight against
talented people.

1418
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:08,200
PREAM: If the top 9 lose, they'll get
replaced by that person.

1419
02:08:08,200 --> 02:08:10,680
PREAM: That's brutal.

1420
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:18,720
JAOYING: Actually, the mentors are very
experienced artists.

1421
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:26,960
JAOYING: I think it's exciting and also
gives more opportunities for other trainees.

1422
02:08:27,080 --> 02:08:32,120
JACKSON: Chuang Asia Thailand. I believe
the final debut group

1423
02:08:32,600 --> 02:08:35,560
JACKSON: will be the strongest among
you guys.

1424
02:08:42,440 --> 02:08:43,680
JACKSON: under any circumstance

1425
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:48,080
JACKSON: and under any environment.

1426
02:08:48,920 --> 02:08:50,520
JACKSON: Are you guys ready for that?

1427
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:53,720
TRAINEES: Yes!

1428
02:08:53,720 --> 02:08:56,000
JACKSON: Who wants to challenge the Top 9?

1429
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:57,200
JACKSON: Please stand up.

1430
02:09:06,440 --> 02:09:07,200
MIKE: Okay.

1431
02:09:08,480 --> 02:09:09,320
MIKE: That's a spirit.

1432
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:18,680
JACKSON: Jeff, do you have anybody in mind
that you want to pick for the challenge?

1433
02:09:19,400 --> 02:09:25,240
JEFF: After all the performances, you know
I really stuck into 1 performance.

1434
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:30,160
JEFF: She has such a very impressive
voice.

1435
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:33,040
JEFF: I'd pick

1436
02:09:34,840 --> 02:09:36,080
JEFF: Mamcù.

1437
02:09:58,760 --> 02:10:00,880
JACKSON: And do you have

1438
02:10:01,400 --> 02:10:05,720
JACKSON: a pick for the person that you
want her to challenge in the Top 9?

1439
02:10:06,080 --> 02:10:07,080
JEFF: I'd pick

1440
02:10:12,440 --> 02:10:12,920
JEFF: Yean.

1441
02:10:28,080 --> 02:10:31,520
YEAN: I was so scared. When he first
called out Mamcù, I thought,

1442
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:37,080
YEAN: "Oh no, did I do something wrong
today? Why is my luck so bad?"

1443
02:10:37,080 --> 02:10:42,920
YEAN: I can tell from her singing skills
that she's a pretty even match for me.

1444
02:10:45,160 --> 02:10:49,720
JEFF: I want to see two incredible
vocals go head-to-head.

1445
02:10:50,360 --> 02:10:52,640
JEFF: And to be evenly matched,
it has to be Yean.

1446
02:10:52,640 --> 02:10:53,760
JACKSON: Okay, Ten.

1447
02:10:54,600 --> 02:11:00,720
TEN: So, my pick is gonna be one girl
from Barbie.

1448
02:11:02,440 --> 02:11:10,360
TEN: Because I feel like watching her solo performance,
she was wearing high heels, and that didn't show her full potentials.

1449
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:20,160
TEN: So, I really wanna see more of
her dancing.

1450
02:11:20,520 --> 02:11:21,440
TEN: Panda.

1451
02:11:28,480 --> 02:11:33,280
TEN: And I really want to see her
battling with

1452
02:11:37,320 --> 02:11:38,040
TEN: Pream.

1453
02:11:41,120 --> 02:11:43,400
PREAM: I thought he teased me.

1454
02:11:51,240 --> 02:11:57,280
PANDA: I was nervous and scared because

1455
02:11:57,280 --> 02:12:00,640
PANDA: she's one of my team and she's
very talented.

1456
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:10,600
TEN: Pream and Panda. They both have
really strong foundations in dancing.

1457
02:12:10,600 --> 02:12:14,200
TEN: Their styles are quite similar,
actually.

1458
02:12:14,200 --> 02:12:19,880
TEN: I'm really curious to see how much they
can improve if they're put in this situation.

1459
02:12:22,840 --> 02:12:28,680
MIKE: I guess it's my turn. There's someone
I kinda saw her potential with the dance.

1460
02:12:29,200 --> 02:12:31,520
MIKE: So, I would love to see more of
her dance.

1461
02:12:44,320 --> 02:12:45,960
MIKE: I would like to see

1462
02:12:51,800 --> 02:12:52,480
MIKE: Yui

1463
02:12:59,400 --> 02:12:59,880
MIKE: Emma.

1464
02:13:02,040 --> 02:13:05,120
MIKE: Please step forward and come to the
center stage, please.

1465
02:13:06,280 --> 02:13:11,160
MIKE: Yui and Emma have a bit similar
dancing style.

1466
02:13:16,440 --> 02:13:17,800
MIKE: and see who comes out on top.

1467
02:13:18,280 --> 02:13:23,960
EMMA: Yui might feel like she wants to win, but I
still think my abilities are quite a bit stronger.

1468
02:13:24,480 --> 02:13:29,800
YUI: My goal is to win the 1st place in
this program and debut.

1469
02:13:31,040 --> 02:13:33,200
MIKE: Nene. Your Big Vote.

1470
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:37,720
NENE: I've actually thought carefully
about this.

1471
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:42,960
NENE: I apologize to the trainees who
have already performed.

1472
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:46,280
NENE: But the person I've chosen

1473
02:13:46,600 --> 02:13:48,200
NENE: is already on stage.

1474
02:13:51,440 --> 02:13:53,360
NENE: So, the one that I pick is

1475
02:13:53,720 --> 02:13:56,400
NENE: Mamcù, same with Jeff,

1476
02:13:57,920 --> 02:13:58,920
NENE: but

1477
02:13:59,640 --> 02:14:03,720
NENE: the one I'm gonna pick from
the top 9.

1478
02:14:04,360 --> 02:14:06,000
NENE: The person

1479
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:11,040
NENE: that is suited to challenge with
Mamcù is...

1480
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:12,960
NENE: Their voices are similar.

1481
02:14:19,960 --> 02:14:22,320
NENE: Let's go. Let's do it.

1482
02:14:23,240 --> 02:14:26,080
MIKE: Mamcù, you have to fight against
both of them.

1483
02:14:27,440 --> 02:14:31,920
MAMCÙ: Me, Krista, and Yean, the three
of us are going to fight.

1484
02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:34,280
MAMCÙ: I felt I was lucky and

1485
02:14:34,280 --> 02:14:39,880
MAMCÙ: afraid at the same time.

1486
02:14:47,680 --> 02:14:49,080
JACKSON: Yeah.

1487
02:14:49,680 --> 02:14:52,520
JACKSON: I have my pick for the Big Vote.

1488
02:14:53,080 --> 02:14:57,680
JACKSON: The most powerful trainee with the
dance skills.

1489
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:00,640
JACKSON: She is

1490
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:05,680
JACKSON: Kanompang.

1491
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:09,920
JACKSON: I want to see her more

1492
02:15:30,160 --> 02:15:30,760
JACKSON: Coco.

1493
02:15:35,040 --> 02:15:36,280
NENE: I wanna see this too.

1494
02:15:37,640 --> 02:15:40,400
PAILIU: Wow. I'm excited. I wanna see
this couple.

1495
02:15:41,360 --> 02:15:45,960
PANGJANG: Phew! That was close.
ILENE: You almost got Praew in trouble.

1496
02:15:46,120 --> 02:15:47,600
TRAINEES: You almost got Praew in trouble.

1497
02:15:50,240 --> 02:15:54,800
COCO: After Barbie's performance,

1498
02:15:54,800 --> 02:15:59,040
COCO: She performed her solo and danced
like this.

1499
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:12,000
COCO: I didn't expect that I'd get to
battle with her.

1500
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,360
KANOMPANG: As I said, I like Coco too

1501
02:16:14,360 --> 02:16:18,400
KANOMPANG: because she's a good dancer but
I'm quite confident with

1502
02:16:18,400 --> 02:16:23,000
KANOMPANG: my freestyle dance skills.
I think I'm good at this.

1503
02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:28,280
JACKSON: I feel like it's gonna be a crazy battle with no mercy.
MIKE: Interesting. Yeah.

1504
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:29,800
JACKSON: How do you feel?

1505
02:16:29,800 --> 02:16:31,400
KANOMPANG: Feel so good.

1506
02:16:34,280 --> 02:16:39,360
COCO: I'm very nervous but I'll try
my best.

1507
02:16:39,800 --> 02:16:40,800
MIKE: Keep going.

1508
02:16:41,720 --> 02:16:44,720
JACKSON: Yeah, and that's it for our
Big Vote.

1509
02:16:45,080 --> 02:16:46,840
JACKSON: Can the Top 9 defend their
titles?

1510
02:16:50,320 --> 02:16:52,720
JACKSON: Dancing and vocals.

1511
02:16:56,400 --> 02:16:58,440
JACKSON: Dancing will be freestyle.

1512
02:17:07,680 --> 02:17:10,040
COCO: When I was called to compete,

1513
02:17:13,040 --> 02:17:14,600
COCO: The person that I have to
battle with...

1514
02:17:14,600 --> 02:17:17,360
COCO: Her freestyle dance is like her
ultimate move.

1515
02:17:17,360 --> 02:17:25,160
COCO: So, I'll use every skill I have
right now to fight her.

1516
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:39,480
KANOMPANG: and I think we have similar
styles.

1517
02:17:39,480 --> 02:17:42,080
EMMA: I have to win at all costs. I can't
think about losing.

1518
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:46,360
YUI: Even though I'm a little nervous,

1519
02:17:46,360 --> 02:17:48,520
YUI: I also have a strong desire to win.

1520
02:17:48,520 --> 02:17:52,320
YUI: We're about the same age.
That makes me want to win even more.

1521
02:17:52,320 --> 02:17:56,640
YUI: So, I'll get on stage with the
feeling that I have to win.

1522
02:17:56,640 --> 02:18:01,680
PANDA: I feel nervous and kinda scared.

1523
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:10,000
PANDA: because she's one of my team and
we're very close.

1524
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:13,560
PREAM: I'm a little frustrated. Me and Panda were
really frustrated at first.

1525
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:23,640
MIKE: Freestyle dance is different from their first
performance because they don't get to prepare.

1526
02:18:23,640 --> 02:18:27,160
MIKE: They have to go on stage right away
and dance to the beat.

1527
02:18:27,880 --> 02:18:30,120
MIKE: So, we get to see another side
of them.

1528
02:18:36,400 --> 02:18:40,440
MIKE: Everyone has their strengths
and weaknesses.

1529
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:42,440
(Ready to record.)

1530
02:18:43,360 --> 02:18:48,760

dance battle.

TEN: I got goosebumps.

1546
02:22:06,880 --> 02:22:08,200

02:22:15,640 --> 02:22:17,080

Wow, this is hip-hop!

1556
02:24:24,040 --> 02:24:26,800
I wish I could dance like that. That's
pretty good.

1557
02:24:26,800 --> 02:24:34,760
MIKE: That was a K.O. for all of the mentors.
Jackson, Nene, Ten, Jeff, and I were all surprised.

1558
02:24:46,280 --> 02:24:50,520

really amazing stuff.

ELYN: But Coco is really quiet.

1588
02:28:35,880 --> 02:28:40,280
ELYN: But she was completely different
personality on stage

1589
02:28:40,280 --> 02:28:42,280
ELYN: like a switch.

1590
02:28:46,400 --> 02:28:50,880
ELYN: And also very power.

1591
02:28:58,800 --> 02:29:02,680
