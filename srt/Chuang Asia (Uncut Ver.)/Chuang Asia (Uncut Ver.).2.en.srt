8
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,520
JACKSON: We've just seen
a lot of amazing performances,

9
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,360
JACKSON: a lot of candidates
that we believe that has huge potential.

10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,520
JACKSON: We discussed.

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,200
JACKSON: We have a rule.

12
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,920
JACKSON: We have another section
called the "Big Vote".

13
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,560
WANG YIBING: Wow.

14
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:26,280
JACKSON: We, as mentors, will select
trainees that're not in the Top 9.

15
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,560
JACKSON: And that person
will challenge the Top 9.

16
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,760
JACKSON: Top 9, if you fail the challenge,

17
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,320
JACKSON: you will get replaced.

18
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,000
MIKE: And the winner in this battle is

19
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,120
MIKE: EMMA.

20
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,640
MIKE: PREAM.

21
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,520
MIKE: COCO, you're the winner.

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,600
TRAINEE: Good, COCO.

23
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,880
JACKSON: Until this point, we just finished
the dance battles among three groups.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,720
JACKSON: The challenge to Top 9
has all failed.

25
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,384
MIKE: So, I think now it's time for

26
00:02:12,384 --> 00:02:13,920
MIKE: the vocal battle.

27
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,160
JACKSON: Right.

28
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,144
JEFF: The rule
for the vocal battle is that

29
00:02:18,592 --> 00:02:23,200
JEFF: you can choose the songs
that your opponents already performed,

30
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,592
JEFF: no matter from an individual
or group performance.

31
00:02:26,592 --> 00:02:32,992
JEFF: The limitation is that you only have
one hour to rehearse everything.

32
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:38,909
KRISTA: When I found out that we only have
one hour to prepare, I thought

33
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:40,829
KRISTA: it was a really hard challenge.

34
00:02:42,589 --> 00:02:44,509
KRISTA: I'm afraid it'd be too much.

35
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:48,509
KRISTA : Usually, when I learn a new song,
I have to spend some time.

36
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:52,309
KRISTA: I'd draft it to see which one's the best
or which way to improvise.

37
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:57,389
KRISTA: When I face a difficult
time signature, I feel more challenged.

38
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:01,269
YEAN: Can I have the lyrics?

39
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:04,229
MAMCÙ: I felt the strong sense
of belief at that time.

40
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:07,349
MAMCÙ: My goal is to finish the rehearsal.

41
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:08,389
MAMCÙ: Now it's

42
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:10,389
MAMCÙ: the final sprint.

43
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:12,389
MAMCÙ: Close my eyes and run for it.

44
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:13,389
MAMCÙ: Just let it be.

45
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:20,389
YEAN: Battling is the thing
that I really don't want to do.

46
00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:22,069
YEAN: But I'm not afraid of my opponent

47
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:25,829
YEAN: I'm ready to fight.
I just don't like

48
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:28,749
YEAN: the battle atmosphere
because it's quite intense.

49
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:34,189
MIKE: Who's gonna start?

50
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:36,789
JACKSON: Let's go, YEAN.

51
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:39,789
JEFF: Fighting.

52
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:41,789
- MIKE: Let's go, YEAN.
- JACKSON: Fighting.

53
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:47,029
YEAN: I chose the song Golden Hour.

54
00:03:47,029 --> 00:03:48,832
YEAN: It's the song that MAMCÙ sang.

55
00:03:49,131 --> 00:03:56,219
♪To see you shine♪

56
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:03,035
♪It's your golden hour♪

57
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:05,549
YEAN: I've never heard of that song,

58
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:08,480
YEAN: so it is risky for me.

59
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,149
YEAN: But at that moment, it was
the only song that sounded familiar to me.

60
00:04:43,007 --> 00:04:47,355
♪For the love of my life♪

61
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:50,429
YEAN: Again, please.

62
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:52,109
JACKSON: It's Okay.

63
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:54,309
- MIKE: It's okay.
- JACKSON: It's okay.

64
00:04:54,349 --> 00:04:58,149
- JACKSON: Chill.
- YEAN: It's the song I never heard of.

65
00:04:58,269 --> 00:04:58,949
JEFF: YEAN, YEAN.

66
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:00,629
NENE: I know. There's only one hour.

67
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:03,029
- YEAN: I've never heard of this song.
- JEFF: It's okay.

68
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:05,669
JEFF: You don't have to stick
to the original melody.

69
00:05:05,989 --> 00:05:08,229
- YEAH: Alright.
- JEFF: Just sing how you feel it.

70
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:09,709
JEFF: If you make a mistake,

71
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,109
JEFF: it's okay. Just keep going.

72
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:17,429
YEAN: When it was my turn to battle,
the melody I memorized one hour ago

73
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:19,029
YEAN: was all gone.

74
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:22,549
YEAN: I was so stressed
because this song is in 6/8 time,

75
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,469
YEAN: so it is very difficult
to catch the beat.

76
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:28,949
YEAN: I turned to MAMCÙ
for how she sang it,

77
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:32,109
YEAN: because I really forgot the melody.
And she helped me.

78
00:05:32,109 --> 00:05:35,136
JEFF: They only had one hour
to prepare for this song.

79
00:05:35,296 --> 00:05:39,549
JEFF: It was allowed to bring the lyrics.
But the melody is very hard to memorize.

80
00:05:39,549 --> 00:05:40,709
TRAINEES: Fighting.

81
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:43,709
TRAINEES: Fighting, YEAN.

82
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:28,509
ILENE: Let's go!

83
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:32,829
YEAN: Thank you.

84
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:35,509
YEAN: I'm sorry.

85
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:36,608
YEAN: I'm really sorry.

86
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:40,629
JEFF: No need to be sorry. That was crazy.

87
00:07:41,664 --> 00:07:43,349
NENE: I got goosebumps.

88
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:45,589
NENE: MIKE and I got goosebumps.

89
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:48,192
MIKE: Everyone got goosebumps.
I have no body hair but I still got goosebumps.

90
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:53,429
J JAZZSPER: I got goosebumps,
but not because it's cold.

91
00:07:53,429 --> 00:07:56,469
J JAZZSPER: She's the pride of Thailand,
a very talented vocalist.

92
00:07:56,469 --> 00:08:01,749
COCO: I was wondering
where that high note came from.

93
00:08:01,869 --> 00:08:03,869
COCO: She did it effortlessly.

94
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:06,669
COCO: I was really amazed.

95
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:12,949
KRISTA: I think that was
my most favorite version of Golden Hour.

96
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:17,669
MAMCÙ: I think YEAN has a powerful voice.

97
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:21,469
MAMCÙ: She has a high singing voice.

98
00:08:21,549 --> 00:08:24,269
MAMCÙ: She can sing high notes powerfully.

99
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:25,669
MIKE: Okay. Next, please.

100
00:08:26,432 --> 00:08:27,712
Wow.

101
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,269
KRISTA: I'll be singing
Golden Hour by MAMCÙ.

102
00:08:35,069 --> 00:08:37,149
TRAINEES: KRISTA, fighting!

103
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,029
JACKSON: The riffs and runs are crazy.

104
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:29,349
JEFF: Yeah! So crazy.

105
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:44,869
NENE: Her falsetto is so beautiful.

106
00:10:44,869 --> 00:10:47,469
- NENE: Her nasal falsetto is so good.
- MIKE: Yes, it's unique.

107
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:49,109
- MIKE: Her voice is very unique.
- NENE: Her falsetto and head voice are so cool.

108
00:10:49,109 --> 00:10:50,029
MIKE: I like her head voice.

109
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:50,869
NENE: Right?

110
00:10:50,989 --> 00:10:52,960
- MIKE: The word "Hour".
- NENE: Right?

111
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:56,869
ACARE: Oh, my gosh.

112
00:10:56,869 --> 00:10:57,949
ACARE: I'm gonna faint.

113
00:10:58,016 --> 00:10:59,069
MIKE: MAMCÙ.

114
00:11:00,273 --> 00:11:00,899
MIKE: Okay.

115
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:06,949
TRAINEE: Fighting.

116
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:10,549
JACKSON: Whose song did you choose?

117
00:11:10,549 --> 00:11:14,048
MAMCÙ: I chose Something's Got a Hold on Me
that YEAN sang.

118
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:18,823
♪Something’s got a hold on me, yeah♪

119
00:11:18,823 --> 00:11:20,103
♪Oh, it must be love♪

120
00:11:20,669 --> 00:11:21,349
JACKSON: Alright, it is.

121
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:22,469
JACKSON: Alright, it is.

122
00:11:22,469 --> 00:11:23,269
JACKSON: Let's go.

123
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:30,349
MAMCÙ: Sorry. Again.

124
00:11:30,349 --> 00:11:31,869
NENE: You're not ready yet?

125
00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:34,949
JACKSON: Let me know
if there's anything wrong.

126
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:39,749
MAMCÙ: I didn't hear
the beat ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

127
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,669
JACKSON: Pre-roll. Okay.

128
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,749
MIKE: I think she's nervous.

129
00:13:19,869 --> 00:13:21,749
TRAINEES: Crazy.

130
00:13:27,136 --> 00:13:30,709
TRAINEES: Very unique voice.

131
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:33,709
QIAO YI YU: Look. I got goosebumps.

132
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:37,632
WANG SHENG XI: I was amazed
by the first few lines that MAMCÙ sang,

133
00:13:37,632 --> 00:13:42,688
WANG SHENG XI: because everyone
only had one hour.

134
00:13:43,136 --> 00:13:45,600
WANG SHENG SI: I didn't expect
she'd sing this well.

135
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,069
WANG SHENG XI: If it was me,
I wouldn't even memorize the lyrics, let alone to sing.

136
00:13:49,344 --> 00:13:52,192
MIKE: It was very beautiful
and the expression was really good.

137
00:13:52,192 --> 00:13:55,149
MIKE: I can't make any more excuse
if someone asks me to learn a new song.

138
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:57,869
MIKE: I can no longer say
"How can I do this in three days?"

139
00:13:58,349 --> 00:14:00,709
MIKE: Look at the girls.
It's just one hour.

140
00:14:01,109 --> 00:14:01,189
MIKE: Wow.

141
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:01,709
MIKE: Wow.

142
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:04,589
JACKSON: I'm telling you
this vote is gonna be hard.

143
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:08,189
JACKSON: Oh, my God.
I'm so happy that we don't have to vote.

144
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:11,109
- JACKSON: So happy.
- TEN: Me too.

145
00:14:11,109 --> 00:14:12,109
JACKSON: I can't pick.

146
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:16,544
NENE: And only one hour
to practice these songs.

147
00:14:16,544 --> 00:14:18,909
NENE: You guys are so great,
really really great.

148
00:14:19,904 --> 00:14:22,112
MIKE: Yes, only one hour.

149
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:25,029
NENE: You have to be
proud of yourselves, really.

150
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:26,589
MIKE: Okay.

151
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:33,189
MIKE: Please get your voting devices ready
and let's start voting.

152
00:14:34,229 --> 00:14:35,789
JAOYING: Can I not vote?

153
00:14:35,789 --> 00:14:37,189
PHINGPHING: I don't wanna choose.

154
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:38,149
PIMMIE: Let the others decide.

155
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:41,949
MIKE: Okay. The vote starts now.

156
00:14:56,309 --> 00:14:57,789
MIKE: Thank you.

157
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:00,989
JACKSON: We'll announce
the result for this round.

158
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:05,509
JACKSON: The result is super, super crazy
and interesting.

159
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:10,109
JACKSON: Because in the previous battle
for the dance groups,

160
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:13,989
JACKSON: as challengers, no one succeeded.

161
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,669
JACKSON: And the vocal groups
make a difference.

162
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:20,669
JACKSON: First, we would like to announce

163
00:15:22,749 --> 00:15:23,669
JACKSON: MAMCÙ.

164
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:31,669
JACKSON: Congratulations,
you won the challenge.

165
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:44,429
YEAN: When MAMCÙ sang my song,
I was so amazed.

166
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:47,149
YEAN: How can I beat her?

167
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:49,669
ZOI: Yeah, she totally earned her place.

284
00:23:07,189 --> 00:23:12,589

which one do you prefer?

285
00:23:12,589 --> 00:23:18,109
WANG KE: I've acted.
But I was an extra role.

286
00:23:18,389 --> 00:23:20,789
WANG KE: I have to make a living. So,

287
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:24,389
WANG KE: I played some extra roles
on TV series.

288
00:23:24,389 --> 00:23:26,669
WANG KE: People may get to know me because

289
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:30,469
WANG KE: I've been taking training
in Korea for five years.

290
00:23:30,469 --> 00:23:33,189
WANG KE: And I competed in Produce 48.

291
00:23:33,189 --> 00:23:36,869
WANG KE: For some reasons,

292
00:23:36,989 --> 00:23:38,789
WANG KE: I couldn't make it to debut.

293
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:40,789
WANG KE: But I haven't abandoned my dream.

294
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:44,989
NENE: Everyone's been
in an idol audition show, right?

295
00:23:46,189 --> 00:23:50,389
CAITH: I used to be in JKT48,
ninth generation. The youngest girl group.

296
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:53,869
CAITH: I started singing
when I was six years old.

297
00:23:53,989 --> 00:23:56,989
CAITH: My mom and my dad
were very supportive.

298
00:23:56,989 --> 00:23:59,589
CAITH: I still have the dream
of being an idol.

299
00:23:59,589 --> 00:24:02,389
CAITH: That is my only dream, actually.

300
00:24:02,389 --> 00:24:06,669
DEVI: I was a trainee for JKT48,
and when I graduated from JKT48,

301
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:10,589
DEVI: I had a chance to go to Korea
to be a trainee.

302
00:24:10,589 --> 00:24:16,989
DEVI: I wanna be someone's inspiration
and I want to make someone happy by looking at me.

303
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:20,989
RUAN: Around two years ago,

304
00:24:21,069 --> 00:24:25,269
RUAN: I went to an audition show
in South Korea.

305
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:30,269
RUAN: I was a newbie
in dancing, singing and many things.

306
00:24:30,389 --> 00:24:33,469
RUAN: At the time,
I lacked a lot of basics.

307
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:38,269
RUAN: When that happened
and I watched an audition show,

308
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:43,269
RUAN: I wanted to try
and a lot of people supported me.

309
00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:47,549
RUAN: So, I went to the survival show
in South Korea.

310
00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:48,989
RUAN: When the show ended,

311
00:24:49,069 --> 00:24:52,109
RUAN: I got a lot of gifts
from the Thai fans.

312
00:24:52,189 --> 00:24:57,709
RUAN: At the time,
I wanted to pay them back.

313
00:24:57,749 --> 00:25:02,109
RUAN: So, I applied for this program,
thinking that I may repay them via this.

314
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:04,189
RUAN: I love you.

315
00:25:07,469 --> 00:25:09,309
JEFF: CHABA, you were a singer,

316
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:10,149
- JEFF: right?
- CHABA: Yes.

317
00:25:10,149 --> 00:25:14,429
CHABA: After the quarantine period,
I went back to Phuket.

318
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,549
CHABA: And my contract expired.

319
00:25:16,629 --> 00:25:22,509
CHABA: I want to change my image
by doing something other than rock.

320
00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:26,989
CHABA: Everyone might see me as a rocker.

321
00:25:26,989 --> 00:25:32,109
CHABA: But I actually grew up
doing my homework with Kamikaze songs.

322
00:25:32,109 --> 00:25:32,989
CHAHA: And

323
00:25:33,149 --> 00:25:34,589
CHABA: I dance along.

324
00:25:35,109 --> 00:25:37,109
JEFF: I want to say something because

325
00:25:37,149 --> 00:25:40,549
JEFF: I've seen you as an artist before.

326
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:43,109
JEFF: Maybe not just CHAB, but

327
00:25:43,189 --> 00:25:45,229
JEFF: I feel like in CHUANG ASIA,

328
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:48,869
JEFF: what I actually like
about this program

329

when performing as a group, I think you

695
00:54:19,309 --> 00:54:23,389
TEN: showed off your charm
very well and were very confident.

696
00:54:23,389 --> 00:54:27,389
TEN: But when it comes to singing and
dancing, you still need to improve a lot.

697
00:54:28,629 --> 00:54:34,189
TEN: Everyone has potential, but it's not
enough. I want you to be more determined.

698
00:54:34,429 --> 00:54:37,749
JACKSON: Yeah. I feel like
I agree with TEN.

699
00:54:37,749 --> 00:54:39,629
JACKSON: And I thought of the same thing.

700
00:54:39,829 --> 00:54:42,149
JACKSON: I mean it's pretty good start.

701
00:54:42,349 --> 00:54:44,749
JACKSON: Right? And I think
moving forward,

702
00:54:44,829 --> 00:54:46,829
JACKSON: we really need
to put in the work.

703
00:54:46,949 --> 00:54:50,229
JACKSON: And whether it's dancing,
whether it's singing,

704
00:54:50,229 --> 00:54:54,149
JACKSON: whether it's mighty sexy,
and all that aspect,

705
00:54:54,429 --> 00:54:56,149

706
00:54:57,029 --> 00:54:59,349

PAILIU: Yes.

724
00:55:53,309 --> 00:55:56,509
MIKE: Here, at CHUANG ASIA THAILAND,

725
00:55:56,549 --> 00:56:00,389
MIKE: there are a lot of young trainees
from foreign countries.

726
00:56:00,669 --> 00:56:05,269
MIKE: PAILIU, please try to introduce
yourself in Miss Grand style.

727
00:56:05,909 --> 00:56:07,629
PAILIU: Oh, my God. Wow.

728
00:56:07,629 --> 00:56:09,589
MIKE: Show us a cool one.

729
00:56:09,589 --> 00:56:10,589
MIKE: Just show us a little bit of that.

730
00:56:10,589 --> 00:56:11,709
PAILIU: Okay.

731
00:56:11,909 --> 00:56:17,629
PAILIU: Kamolwalai Prajakrattanakul,
Miss Grand Nakhon Phanom, hands prostrate.

732
00:56:20,869 --> 00:56:24,269
MIKE: Normally I've only seen it on TV,
I've just seen the real one today.

733
00:56:26,909 --> 00:56:31,469
PAILIU: I feel what I'm the most proud
of about myself from my 24 years

734
00:56:31,469 --> 00:56:33,709
PAILIU: may not be a matter of only
getting the crown.

735
00:56:33,709 --> 00:56:39,669
PAILIU: But, I feel that it is when
I was able to overcome my own fears.

736
00:56:41,269 --> 00:56:43,509
PAILIU: My mom gets sick easily.

737
00:56:43,509 --> 00:56:47,509
PAILIU: She gets sick easily and when she
does, as she used to sell only smoothies,

738
00:56:47,509 --> 00:56:51,589
PAILIU: when she was sick, she would
close the shop and rest. She didn't work.

739
00:56:51,589 --> 00:56:53,509
PAILIU: So, she would be blamed

740
00:56:54,029 --> 00:56:56,069
PAILIU: by aunthies for being lazy.

741
00:56:56,069 --> 00:56:59,669
PAILIU: This caused many people
to look down on my mom and dad

742
00:56:59,669 --> 00:57:02,189
PAILIU: because our family backgrounds
were different.

743
00:57:02,189 --> 00:57:04,789
PAILIU: I'd been participated
in the beauty pageant in order to

744
00:57:04,949 --> 00:57:08,549
PAILIU: give myself chances, earn money,
have incomes to bring home the bacon.

745
00:57:08,549 --> 00:57:09,829
PAILIU: I would like to bring

746
00:57:10,029 --> 00:57:12,229
PAILIU: more honor to my family,
to make us wealthier.

747
00:57:12,229 --> 00:57:14,949
PAILIU: I've come so far from what
I imagined, and it's like

748
00:57:15,629 --> 00:57:18,149
PAILIU: on that day that I felt like
I wanted to take care of myself.

749
00:57:18,149 --> 00:57:19,829
PAILIU: (sobs) I don't want to cry.

750
00:57:23,109 --> 00:57:27,229
PAILIU: I just feel like
I've gotten a lot further.

751
00:57:27,229 --> 00:57:29,149
PAILIU: From the way that I've never
thought I could make money,

752
00:57:30,349 --> 00:57:33,749
PAILIU: I felt that seven-digit money
for me was very hard to gain.

753
00:57:34,429 --> 00:57:40,909
PAILIU: Today it's easy for me. I thank
myself for not leaving myself on that day.

754
00:57:44,589 --> 00:57:47,109
TRAINEE: Fighting.

755
00:57:48,069 --> 00:57:49,069

758
00:57:51,829 --> 00:57:54,109
MIKE: Keep going. Never give up.

759
00:58:07,869 --> 00:58:10,629
R-JING: I mention them
with my Thai friends as K-sister.

760
00:58:10,629 --> 00:58:13,589
R-JING: K-sister means Korean sister
something like that, because

761
00:58:13,589 --> 00:58:16,589
R-JING: they are sitting in front of me,
and I'm sitting behind them.

762
00:58:16,709 --> 00:58:21,429
R-JING: There are a lot of cosmetics
behind them, and they keep doing makeup.

763
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:25,189
R-JING: After each break, they'll do
makeup, keep changing sets of the makeups.

764
00:58:25,189 --> 00:58:29,429
R-JING: Oh!, what the K-sisters use
to look stunning. They have bright faces.

765
00:58:29,469 --> 00:58:32,229
R-JING: So, I asked for some
of their cosmetics and they lent me some.

766
00:58:32,389 --> 00:58:35,669
R-JING: They gave me good advice,
what is good. Very kind. I love them.

767

ILENE: Really Korean-style.

840
01:02:48,229 --> 01:02:53,149
WANG SHENG XI: I saw all of their
movement, including the dance scales.

841
01:02:53,149 --> 01:02:54,549
WANG SHENG XI: They have exactly
the same energy and dance scale.

842
01:02:54,549 --> 01:02:58,149
WANG SHENG XI: They have the unison
in dance.

843
01:02:58,229 --> 01:03:02,229
AKINA: I think their performance
was so cute.

844
01:03:03,349 --> 01:03:05,149
AKINA: Like I just I love all this group.

845
01:03:05,149 --> 01:03:09,869
YEAN: It's so good. Dancing is good.
Line dancing is perfect. Singing is good.

846
01:03:09,989 --> 01:03:11,309
YEAN: Everyone looks pretty.

847
01:03:11,309 --> 01:03:13,869
YEAN: But, I feel like they still
lack of something.

848
01:03:13,869 --> 01:03:15,509
YEAN: Just a little bit.

849
01:03:18,349 --> 01:03:22,029
TEN: You've just debuted
a year ago, right?

850
01:03:22,349 --> 01:03:24,549
TEN: It would be great if you use
this program to look for your own concept,

851
01:03:24,749 --> 01:03:29,629
TEN: to find out your own style, just like
when you've first debuted.

852
01:03:30,749 --> 01:03:32,029
TRAINEES: Sure.

853
01:03:33,029 --> 01:03:34,989
MIKE: I'm not sure if it's just me,

854
01:03:34,989 --> 01:03:36,429
MIKE: but I feel like

855
01:03:37,069 --> 01:03:40,869
MIKE: they don't have confidence at all.

856
01:03:40,869 --> 01:03:42,029
MIKE: Why?

857
01:03:46,429 --> 01:03:49,749
WANG KE: I think they could do it.
They certainly did well .

858
01:03:50,029 --> 01:03:54,189
WANG KE: They just don't have confidence.
I want them to be more confident.

859
01:03:54,389 --> 01:03:58,349
ZOI: I expected a bit more, because
they came as a group.

860
01:03:58,549 --> 01:04:02,509
ZOI: And they have been training
with each other for one year.

861
01:04:02,509 --> 01:04:05,829
ZOI: I think they did good, but they
could have done better.

862
01:04:06,229 --> 01:04:10,029
DUNA: As you knew that

863
01:04:10,029 --> 01:04:11,949
DUNA: we are a girl group that
has already been debuted.

864
01:04:12,549 --> 01:04:17,029
DUNA: So, we're quite highly expected.

865
01:04:17,149 --> 01:04:20,829
DUNA: This might make us feel nervous.
We will try to be more earnest next time.

866
01:04:20,829 --> 01:04:23,949
DUNA: And we'll try our best
to show off our abilities.

867
01:04:24,629 --> 01:04:31,229
DUNA: First of all, it's not just
a music program, but being on stage.

868
01:04:31,429 --> 01:04:36,229
DUNA: And you got to be in front of
senior idols for the first time,

869
01:04:36,429 --> 01:04:41,029
DUNA: both JACKSON and TEN.

870
01:04:41,029 --> 01:04:43,029
DUNA: They're both K-POP idols, right?

871
01:04:43,029 --> 01:04:47,349
DUNA: So, this made us more excited
and lack of confidence.

872
01:04:47,949 --> 01:04:52,429
YEHAM: Everyone told me that the Korean team
must be brilliant for sure.

873
01:04:52,549 --> 01:04:57,029
YEHAM: On the stage, we must be cool,
have good dancing and singing.

874
01:04:57,149 --> 01:05:01,029
YEHAM: Many people said so.

875
01:05:01,349 --> 01:05:07,549
YEHAM: I felt burdened by those words
before the performance.

876
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:10,429
TEN: When we're on stage,

877
01:05:10,749 --> 01:05:15,229
TEN: it'd be great if we didn't let
those people's words

878
01:05:15,429 --> 01:05:17,549
TEN: bother us.

879
01:05:17,549 --> 01:05:22,029
TEN: You should enjoy

880
01:05:22,029 --> 01:05:24,629
TEN: being on stage.

881
01:05:25,149 --> 01:05:25,856
TRAINEES: Thank you.

882
01:05:25,856 --> 01:05:28,288
TEN: That's all.

883
01:05:28,288 --> 01:05:31,069
TEN: I want you to show
how happy you are to be on stage.

884
01:05:31,069 --> 01:05:32,229
TRAINEES: Yes.

885
01:05:32,229 --> 01:05:35,229
TEN: When I went to Korea by myself,

886
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:38,069
TEN: I felt excited, but also pressured.

887
01:05:38,069 --> 01:05:40,829
TEN: I want to tell trainees that
everything is a competition, a survival.

888
01:05:40,829 --> 01:05:43,669
TEN: Whether you are a survival program
competitor or a label trainee,

889
01:05:43,669 --> 01:05:46,829
TEN: we have to compete to debut, right?

890
01:05:46,829 --> 01:05:49,869
TEN: I think the pressure can be

891
01:05:49,869 --> 01:05:52,960
TEN: a motivation for trainees,

892
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:57,029
TEN: but we need to know how to relax
ourselves in that situation.

893
01:05:57,029 --> 01:05:59,189
TEN: Because if we are pressured
all the time,

894
01:05:59,189 --> 01:06:01,669
TEN: we can't show our full potential.

895
01:06:01,669 --> 01:06:05,149
TEN: Because the pressure can prevent us
from enjoying dancing or singing.

896
01:06:05,189 --> 01:06:05,869
MIKE: You can do it.

897
01:06:05,869 --> 01:06:06,509
JACKSON: Fighting.

898
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:07,429
MIKE: Fighting.

899
01:06:07,429 --> 01:06:11,549
MIKE: Okay. The vote starts now.

900
01:06:14,229 --> 01:06:18,029
DIDI: Everyone is like the same move,

901
01:06:18,029 --> 01:06:22,029
DIDI: the same head, the same arm,
I think they're the most consistent group.

902
01:06:22,029 --> 01:06:23,549
DIDI: And all of them.

903
01:06:30,029 --> 01:06:33,429
MIKE: And MVP of this group is

904
01:06:34,589 --> 01:06:36,749
MIKE: GEUMHEE. Congratulations.

905
01:06:37,749 --> 01:06:39,349
TRAINEE: Congratulations.

906
01:06:44,589 --> 01:06:46,629
JACKSON: Thank you. You did good.

907
01:06:46,629 --> 01:06:47,829
TRAINEES: That's all for now

908
01:06:47,829 --> 01:06:50,349
TRAINEES: from CSR.

909
01:06:50,349 --> 01:06:51,949
TRAINEES: Thank you.

910
01:06:51,949 --> 01:06:54,389
- NENE: Thank you.
- MIKE: Thank you.

911
01:06:54,549 --> 01:06:57,149
JACKSON: Hearing this makes me think of Music Bank.
[*South Korean's music show]

912
01:06:57,549 --> 01:06:59,549
JACKSON: Like morning rehearsal.

913
01:06:59,629 --> 01:07:00,829
TEN: We're gonna start the next record.

914
01:07:00,829 --> 01:07:02,829
JACKSON: That's all for now from GOT7.
Thank you.

915
01:07:07,549 --> 01:07:09,189
JEFF: Next group, please.

916
01:07:09,189 --> 01:07:15,069
TRAINEES: Wow.

917
01:07:17,629 --> 01:07:21,349
TRAINEES: Hello, we're Bad Guy.

918
01:07:21,349 --> 01:07:23,429
QIAO YI YU: My name is QIAO YI YU.

919
01:07:23,589 --> 01:07:25,549
NATTY: My name is NATTY.

920
01:07:26,429 --> 01:07:27,629
ÁNH SÁNG: I'm ÁNH SÁNG.

921
01:07:28,269 --> 01:07:29,629
LILIANA LI: I'm LILIANA.

922
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:31,829
TRAINEES: So cool.

923
01:07:32,109 --> 01:07:33,109
TRAINEES: So handsome.

924
01:07:33,749 --> 01:07:37,069
KANOMPANG: I think Bad Guy's costume was very cool.

925
01:07:37,069 --> 01:07:39,029
ACARE: Bad Guy was very cool.

926
01:07:39,029 --> 01:07:44,029
They didn't wear skirt and came out
in black suit and tie and trousers.

927
01:07:44,029 --> 01:07:45,309
Everything's so cool.

928
01:07:45,549 --> 01:07:49,789
They looked cool in a way that was hidden
in their feminine form.

929
01:07:50,749 --> 01:07:52,269
NENE: Let's start the show.

930
01:08:21,629 --> 01:08:22,629
ILENE: So cool.

931
01:09:27,909 --> 01:09:30,949
PREAM: When they danced, they had
a lot of charisma.

932
01:09:30,949 --> 01:09:35,429
PREAM: It made me think, "Wow, they're really good."
They can dance powerfully

933
01:09:35,429 --> 01:09:37,789
PREAM: and still have
a lot of facial expressions.

934
01:09:41,189 --> 01:09:42,829
PREAM: They're strong competitor.

935
01:09:42,989 --> 01:09:46,069
SEOYEON: LILIANA is very attractive.

936
01:09:46,229 --> 01:09:49,229
SEOYEON: Actually, she was sitting
in front of me

937
01:09:49,349 --> 01:09:51,109
SEOYEON: and she was always like

938
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:53,549
SEOYEON: Whoo! Whoo! Like this.

939
01:09:54,229 --> 01:09:57,149
SEOYEON: Wow! Like this.

940
01:10:12,829 --> 01:10:14,549
JACKSON: Very cool, very cool.

941
01:10:14,829 --> 01:10:18,229
JACKSON: Getting the song to practicing
until now?

942
01:10:18,229 --> 01:10:19,229
LILIANA LI: NATTY,

943
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:23,029
LILIANA LI: QIAO YI YU and me, we've practiced for 2 weeks.

944
01:10:23,349 --> 01:10:25,829
LILIANA LI: But ÁNH SÁNG came a week later.

945
01:10:25,829 --> 01:10:27,029
JACKSON: Okay.

946
01:10:27,549 --> 01:10:30,829
QIAO YI YU: I think our team style is

947
01:10:31,029 --> 01:10:34,549
QIAO YI YU: quite outstanding and unique

948
01:10:34,629 --> 01:10:38,829
QIAO YI YU: because we broke the mold
of the traditional girl group

949
01:10:38,949 --> 01:10:41,149
QIAO YI YU: to bring out more

950
01:10:41,509 --> 01:10:42,429
QIAO YI YU: tomboy style.

951
01:10:42,549 --> 01:10:44,629
ÁNH SÁNG: Hi everyone. I'm ÁNH SÁNG.

952
01:10:44,629 --> 01:10:46,829
ÁNH SÁNG: When I do the hip hop freestyle,

953
01:10:46,949 --> 01:10:50,989
ÁNH SÁNG: I can show more about myself,
my personality.

954
01:10:51,029 --> 01:10:53,509
JASMINE: ÁNH SÁNG, she's my friend.

955
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:56,589
JASMINE: We just became friends this morning
because I asked her,

956
01:10:56,629 --> 01:10:58,029
JASMINE: "Where do you come from?" in Chinese

957
01:10:58,069 --> 01:11:00,709
JASMINE: and she didn't understand
because she's from Vietnam.

958
01:11:04,669 --> 01:11:07,829
JEFF: You guys are from different countries.
How do you communicate?

959
01:11:07,829 --> 01:11:11,829
NATTY: We're like Lao Shi and teacher
to each other.

960
01:11:11,869 --> 01:11:15,069
NATTY: Like I'm a Thai language teacher.

961
01:11:15,109 --> 01:11:16,749
JEFF : Ah.
NATTY: We communicate in English

962
01:11:16,749 --> 01:11:18,469
NATTY: and I can speak a little bit Chinese.

963
01:11:18,669 --> 01:11:20,629
JEFF: So, you can speak four languages now.

964
01:11:20,669 --> 01:11:22,829
NATTY: Yes. For now, I can speak

965
01:11:22,909 --> 01:11:26,029
NATTY: Thai, Chinese, English, Vietnamese.

966
01:11:26,109 --> 01:11:27,269
NATTY: Okay.

967
01:11:28,989 --> 01:11:31,549
NATTY: And I teach them Thai

968
01:11:31,629 --> 01:11:33,829
NATTY: like, "Have you eaten?"

969
01:11:33,829 --> 01:11:35,509
TRAINEES: "Yes, we have."

970
01:11:36,149 --> 01:11:37,869
NATTY: "Are you happy today?"

971
01:11:37,949 --> 01:11:40,549
TRAINEES: "Happy, happy."

972
01:11:40,549 --> 01:11:41,709
NATTY: Yeah.

973
01:11:41,709 --> 01:11:42,909
JEFF: You're a good teacher.

974
01:11:43,109 --> 01:11:44,069
NATTY: Thank you.

975
01:11:44,429 --> 01:11:47,549
TEN: I used to, uh, I know QIAO YI.

976
01:11:47,549 --> 01:11:48,229
JACKSON: Friends?

977
01:11:48,229 --> 01:11:51,549
TEN: She is a... We met in another program.

978
01:11:51,629 --> 01:11:52,229
QIAO YI YU: Yeah.

979
01:11:52,229 --> 01:11:53,829
TEN: I'm really look...

980
01:11:53,829 --> 01:11:56,029
TEN: I was really looking forward
to your performance today.

981
01:11:56,029 --> 01:11:58,949
TEN: This is the first time I've heard
her sing.

982
01:11:59,749 --> 01:12:01,349
TEN: I'm surprised.

983
01:12:01,349 --> 01:12:02,229
QIAO YI YU: Thank you.

984
01:12:02,229 --> 01:12:06,429
QIAO YI YU: When I showed up,
I never thought TEN would remember me.

985
01:12:06,429 --> 01:12:08,949
QIAO YI YU: Because it's been two years
since that show ended.

986
01:12:09,029 --> 01:12:13,029
QIAO YI YU: And then, when I was on stage,
I saw TEN smiling at me.

987
01:12:13,149 --> 01:12:15,349
QIAO YI YU: I thought, "Oh, wow"

988
01:12:15,429 --> 01:12:18,949
QIAO YI YU: I suddenly felt a sense of closeness with him.
It's been more than two years since then.

989
01:12:18,949 --> 01:12:23,029
QIAO YI YU: And now I became his student,
and performed in front of him.

990
01:12:23,029 --> 01:12:26,349
QIAO YI YU: I was really happy and grateful.

991
01:12:26,549 --> 01:12:29,469
JACKSON: I feel like...
Cause this song is just a song right?

992
01:12:29,469 --> 01:12:34,229
JACKSON: I think their outfit
and everything is matching towards the song.

993
01:12:34,349 --> 01:12:36,229
JACKSON: I wonder what they are in

994
01:12:36,829 --> 01:12:38,629
JACKSON: like other genre or music,

995
01:12:38,749 --> 01:12:39,949
JACKSON: like

996
01:12:40,149 --> 01:12:44,029
JACKSON: r&b or pop or hip hop

997
01:12:44,029 --> 01:12:45,349
JACKSON: another field.

998
01:12:45,549 --> 01:12:47,029
JACKSON: I would really wanna see that.

999
01:12:47,149 --> 01:12:48,749
JEFF: Would you like to
see anyone's extra show?

1000
01:12:48,749 --> 01:12:53,509
JACKSON: I wanna see TEN's friend, A-YI.

1001
01:12:53,509 --> 01:12:54,496
QIAO YI YU: QIAO YI

1002
01:12:54,496 --> 01:12:55,392
JACKSON: Ah, QIAO YI.

1003
01:12:55,392 --> 01:12:56,096
LILIANA LI: A-YI.

1004
01:12:56,096 --> 01:12:57,888
A-YI

1005
01:12:58,048 --> 01:12:59,429
No, A... Yi.

1006
01:12:59,744 --> 01:13:00,960
JACKSON: No, I mean A... Yi.

1007
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,192
JEFF: I wanna see LILIANA's.

1008
01:13:04,192 --> 01:13:07,328
JEFF: Because everyone was singing
"Bad Guy" like,

1009
01:13:07,328 --> 01:13:11,029
JEFF: you have to sing
in the same heavy tone.

1010
01:13:11,029 --> 01:13:13,389
JEFF: I wanna see you sing the song
that you're good at.

1011
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:14,592
JEFF: I can't hear your vocal that much
in that song.

1012
01:13:14,592 --> 01:13:18,272
JEFF: So, I wanna see you sing the song
that really shows your vocal.

1013
01:13:18,272 --> 01:13:19,424
JACKSON: Let's start it.

1014
01:15:16,384 --> 01:15:18,080
JAOYING: I was really surprised
by LILIANA.

1015
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:22,304
JAOYING: With her look, she probably
looks like a rapper or a dancer.

1016
01:15:22,304 --> 01:15:25,312
JAOYING: But when she sang, wow.

1017
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:28,576
JAOYING: I didn't know she could sing
so well.

1018
01:15:29,029 --> 01:15:31,629
MIKE: Thank you, guys.
Thank you very much.

1019
01:15:31,909 --> 01:15:34,029
MIKE: Alright, let's do the voting.

1020
01:15:47,429 --> 01:15:51,309
MIKE: The MVP for this group is...

1021
01:15:53,709 --> 01:15:55,229
MIKE: Congratulations,

1022
01:15:55,509 --> 01:15:56,509
MIKE: LILIANA.

1023
01:16:05,429 --> 01:16:07,829
LILIANA LI: I was feeling so much.
I couldn't believe it.

1024
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:10,429
LILIANA LI: I was like, oh my god,
you got MVP. That's amazing.

1025
01:16:10,509 --> 01:16:14,048
LILIANA LI: Thank you.
Thank you so much, everybody.

1026
01:16:17,504 --> 01:16:17,984
EMMA: Hey.

1027
01:16:17,984 --> 01:16:20,512
LILIANA Li: Hey, EMMA.
I'm doing fine, I guess.

1028
01:16:20,512 --> 01:16:23,616
LILIANA Li: Theme song evaluation is coming up,
so I feel really stressed out.

1029
01:16:23,616 --> 01:16:25,280
LILIANA Li: Let's play some free fire
and relax!

1030
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,144
EMMA: Great idea!

1031
01:16:26,144 --> 01:16:28,384
EMMA: But my phone will lag
and the frame will drop

1032
01:16:28,384 --> 01:16:29,600
EMMA: when I play my games.

1033
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,392
LILIANA Li: You can use Infinix Hot 40 Pro.

1034
01:16:31,392 --> 01:16:35,072
LILIANA Li: It has the G99 gaming chipset
which makes the graphics really smooth.

1035
01:16:35,072 --> 01:16:37,824
EMMA: Really? Let me try. Oh, my God!

1036
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:39,296
LILIANA Li: Isn't it smooth?

1037
01:16:39,296 --> 01:16:40,768
EMMA: It's really smooth!

1038
01:16:41,381 --> 01:16:42,144
JACKSON: Okay. Let's go.

1039
01:16:43,981 --> 01:16:46,181
TRAINEE: Wow. Oh my god.

1040
01:16:53,981 --> 01:16:55,301
MIKE: And now,

1041
01:16:55,621 --> 01:16:59,581
MIKE: the competition between trainees
has ended.

1042
01:16:59,821 --> 01:17:04,461
MIKE: We'll now announce the current Top 9
so that everyone knows

1043
01:17:04,621 --> 01:17:06,861
MIKE: how the rankings have changed.

1044
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:10,381
PREAM: I was guessing randomly
and asked YEAN

1045
01:17:10,381 --> 01:17:13,821
PREAM: if there will be any more changes
in the Top 9.

1046
01:17:14,221 --> 01:17:19,141
MIKE: I'd like to ask these five people
to stand up when your name is called.

1047
01:17:20,181 --> 01:17:21,181
MIKE: YEAN.

1048
01:17:22,181 --> 01:17:23,181
MIKE: Please stand up.

1049
01:17:27,381 --> 01:17:28,301
MIKE: PREAM.

1050
01:17:31,901 --> 01:17:32,901
MIKE: COCO.

1051
01:17:34,181 --> 01:17:35,101
MIKE: EMMA.

1052
01:17:37,381 --> 01:17:38,381
MIKE: MAMCÙ.

1053
01:17:41,621 --> 01:17:44,461
MIKE: These five people

1054
01:17:45,101 --> 01:17:49,381
MIKE: have managed to secure their spots
in the Top 9 because they have already competed

1055
01:17:49,541 --> 01:17:50,621
MIKE: and won.

1056
01:17:51,261 --> 01:17:52,341
MIKE: Congratulations.

1057
01:17:55,581 --> 01:17:57,581
MIKE: And now, we have

1058
01:17:57,941 --> 01:17:59,941
MIKE: four more spots left

1059
01:18:00,461 --> 01:18:01,741
MIKE: in the Top 9.

1060
01:18:02,981 --> 01:18:03,981
MIKE: TEGAN.

1061
01:18:05,501 --> 01:18:06,381
MIKE: KAYLEN.

1062
01:18:06,901 --> 01:18:07,901
MIKE: JAZZSPER?

1063
01:18:08,381 --> 01:18:09,301
MIKE: PRAEW.

1064
01:18:10,101 --> 01:18:13,781
MIKE: These four people haven't battled
with anyone else yet.

1065
01:18:14,861 --> 01:18:16,221
MIKE: I would like to ask,

1066
01:18:17,061 --> 01:18:18,501
MIKE: PRAEW, do you think

1067
01:18:19,661 --> 01:18:21,621
MIKE: you will still be in the Top 9?

1068
01:18:22,981 --> 01:18:26,501
PRAEW: I think I will still be
in the Top 9.

1069
01:18:26,981 --> 01:18:27,981
MIKE: JAZZSPER?

1070
01:18:28,941 --> 01:18:32,181
J JAZZSPER: We'll have to see. I still have
a lot of abilities that I haven't shown yet.

1071
01:18:32,181 --> 01:18:33,181
MIKE: Oh.

1072
01:18:34,381 --> 01:18:35,301
MIKE: TEGAN?

1073
01:18:36,101 --> 01:18:39,981
TEGAN: I wish I could predict the future,
but I would like to believe, yes.

1074
01:18:40,501 --> 01:18:41,381
MIKE: Okay.

1075
01:18:41,701 --> 01:18:42,581
MIKE: KAYLEN.

1076
01:18:42,581 --> 01:18:45,381
KAYLEN: From the rest of the talent
that we've just saw,

1077
01:18:45,701 --> 01:18:47,901
KAYLEN: the competition has gone up,

1078
01:18:48,501 --> 01:18:53,581
KAYLEN: but I still do believe that
I can hold my spot here

1079
01:18:53,781 --> 01:18:55,981
KAYLEN: and remain in the Top 9.

1080
01:18:56,581 --> 01:18:57,501
MIKE: Okay.

1081
01:18:58,181 --> 01:19:00,181
MIKE: So, I'm gonna announce that

1082
01:19:00,701 --> 01:19:02,381
MIKE: there are only two of you

1083
01:19:02,901 --> 01:19:04,701
MIKE: that are gonna stay in the Top 9.

1084
01:19:05,581 --> 01:19:06,501
MIKE: And

1085
01:19:07,181 --> 01:19:08,501
MIKE: Congratulations,

1086
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:13,901
MIKE: KAYLEN.

1087
01:19:14,581 --> 01:19:16,181
MIKE: You get to stay.

1088
01:19:18,181 --> 01:19:19,181
MIKE: And

1089
01:19:23,581 --> 01:19:24,981
MIKE: Congratulations,

1090
01:19:26,701 --> 01:19:28,501
MIKE: JAZZSPER, you get to stay.

1091
01:19:32,901 --> 01:19:34,381
J JAZZSPER: Call an ambulance for me.

1092
01:19:34,541 --> 01:19:36,861
J JAZZSPER: Could you please call
an ambulance? I need a ventilator.

1093
01:19:36,981 --> 01:19:38,901
J JAZZSPER: Please bring a ventilator.

1094
01:19:39,181 --> 01:19:39,941
J JAZZSPER: Whew!

1095
01:19:40,341 --> 01:19:41,661
J JAZZSPER: Not out
of the rankings yet, okay.

1096
01:19:41,701 --> 01:19:43,981
MIKE: PRAEW and TEGAN,
please go back to your seat.

1097
01:19:44,781 --> 01:19:45,581
MIKE: Thank you.

1098
01:19:47,861 --> 01:19:52,381
PRAEW: We just got to stay in the Top 9.
It's not like we're gonna stay for the whole episode.

1099
01:19:52,981 --> 01:19:54,901
PRAEW: Of course, I felt regret.

1100
01:19:55,981 --> 01:20:01,421
MIKE: Okay, we have only two spots left
in the Top 9.

1101
01:20:02,181 --> 01:20:04,181
JACKSON: For this specific round,

1102
01:20:04,581 --> 01:20:06,901
JACKSON: there will be the two new members

1103
01:20:07,701 --> 01:20:10,181
JACKSON: joining the Top 9 and they are...

1104
01:20:16,381 --> 01:20:17,581
JACKSON: LILIANA LI.

1105
01:20:22,181 --> 01:20:25,981
LILIANA LI: Oh my god. I was so happy.

1106
01:20:27,101 --> 01:20:28,181
LILIANA LI: Whew!

1107
01:20:28,381 --> 01:20:30,381
JACKSON: The second trainee is...

1108
01:20:33,541 --> 01:20:34,501
JACKSON: MA LIYA.

1109
01:20:48,501 --> 01:20:50,981
JACKSON: So, this round is gonna
be something new.

1110
01:20:51,581 --> 01:20:55,101
JACKSON: Because for the four of you,
the vote that you guys have

1111
01:20:55,701 --> 01:20:57,781
JACKSON: is very very close

1112
01:20:58,581 --> 01:20:59,981
JACKSON: to rank tenth.

1113
01:21:01,781 --> 01:21:05,581
JACKSON: It's so close to a point that
it's one vote difference.

1114
01:21:08,981 --> 01:21:10,501
JACKSON: The new rule will be

1115
01:21:11,781 --> 01:21:14,781
JACKSON: rank tenth will be able to

1116
01:21:15,181 --> 01:21:18,701
JACKSON: choose anyone out of you four

1117
01:21:19,181 --> 01:21:20,181
JACKSON: to battle.

1118
01:21:20,781 --> 01:21:23,301
JACKSON: And if they win,
they get to replace you.

1119
01:21:28,101 --> 01:21:31,181
JACKSON: TEN is gonna announce
the tenth place.

1120
01:21:35,381 --> 01:21:38,501
TEN: So, the tenth member's gonna be

1121
01:21:41,981 --> 01:21:42,981
TEN: TEGAN.

1122
01:21:48,901 --> 01:21:50,581
TEGAN: I guess I was just like

1123
01:21:51,181 --> 01:21:54,981
TEGAN: in shock, like, "That was my name."

1124
01:21:55,101 --> 01:21:56,381
TEGAN: That was my name.

1125
01:21:56,581 --> 01:22:00,501
TEGAN: So, the feeling I had
in the moment was just like...

1126
01:22:01,701 --> 01:22:02,701
TEGAN: Whoa.

1127
01:22:03,781 --> 01:22:05,701
JACKSON: You will need to pick

1128
01:22:06,981 --> 01:22:08,901
JACKSON: one trainee out of the four

1129
01:22:09,181 --> 01:22:12,581
JACKSON: to continue by battling.

1130
01:22:12,981 --> 01:22:17,101
JACKSON: Whether it's vocal, whether it's dance,
anything. You get to choose.

1131
01:22:21,381 --> 01:22:23,581
JACKSON: Think about it for ten seconds.
We'll give you ten seconds.

1132
01:22:33,781 --> 01:22:36,381
TEGAN: Alright, KAYLEN,
let's give them a show.

1133
01:22:47,901 --> 01:22:49,181
JEFF: That's the spirit.

1134
01:22:53,381 --> 01:22:55,501
KAYLEN: Okay, here we go.

1135
01:22:55,581 --> 01:22:58,101
KAYLEN: I knew she was gonna
choose me to battle.

1136
01:22:58,501 --> 01:23:02,301
KAYLEN: From the second she started walking down,
I was like, "Yeah, she's gonna choose me."

1137
01:23:03,181 --> 01:23:06,701
PREAM: I guessed. I guessed.

1138
01:23:06,701 --> 01:23:07,981
- PREAM: I guessed.
- YEAN: It's a game.

1139
01:23:07,981 --> 01:23:11,381
PREAM: Yeah, it's a game.

1140
01:23:11,501 --> 01:23:16,141
YEAN: I was stunned. I didn't think she would
choose her friend. If I were her, I wouldn't choose my friend.

1141
01:23:16,381 --> 01:23:19,901
AKINA: Honestly, I feel like this is
another, like, maybe American mindset,

1142
01:23:19,981 --> 01:23:23,181
AKINA: and so I felt like
maybe TEGAN thought that

1143
01:23:23,301 --> 01:23:26,101
AKINA: they could be like
friendly rivalry, you know?

1144
01:23:26,101 --> 01:23:30,181
AKINA: Like we're battling each other,
but we love and respect each other.

1145
01:23:31,101 --> 01:23:32,781
LILIANA LI: This is gonna be, hmm...

1146
01:23:35,781 --> 01:23:37,581
LILIANA LI: It's gonna be hot
and spicy battle.

1147
01:23:37,981 --> 01:23:42,381
JACKSON: Would you like
to battle vocal, dance, or...

1148
01:23:43,381 --> 01:23:44,301
JACKSON: Rap

1149
01:23:44,781 --> 01:23:47,381
JACKSON: or martial arts or b-boy

1150
01:23:47,381 --> 01:23:48,901
- JACKSON: or...
- TEGAN: Martial arts.

1151
01:23:48,981 --> 01:23:50,781
JACKSON: Alright, it is.

1152
01:23:50,781 --> 01:23:51,301
TEGAN: Alright.

1153
01:23:51,301 --> 01:23:52,581
JACKSON: Prepare your martial arts.

1154
01:23:53,101 --> 01:23:54,701
TEGAN: No. Okay, we do vocal.

1155
01:23:55,101 --> 01:23:55,981
JACKSON: Okay.

1156
01:23:56,581 --> 01:23:59,781
LILIANA LI: You guys got this, okay?
Don't sweat it, okay?

1157
01:24:00,381 --> 01:24:01,701
JACKSON: Let's go.

1158
01:24:01,701 --> 01:24:02,381
TRAINEE: Fighting.

1159
01:24:02,381 --> 01:24:04,381
KAYLEN: So, I guessed
it was the first time

1160
01:24:05,101 --> 01:24:07,101
KAYLEN: me and her really, like,

1161
01:24:07,301 --> 01:24:11,301
KAYLEN: had to sort of compete
against each other.

1162
01:24:11,301 --> 01:24:13,781
KAYLEN: She's always
been the very competitive

1163
01:24:13,981 --> 01:24:15,781
KAYLEN: which is something
that I adore about her.

1164
01:24:15,781 --> 01:24:19,381
TEGAN: I also really respect KAYLEN
as a vocalist

1165
01:24:19,381 --> 01:24:22,301
TEGAN: and I think we both are
really strong with our vocals.

1166
01:24:22,381 --> 01:24:27,181
TEGAN: So, we both could've brought something
to the stage and in our own different way.

1167
01:24:32,581 --> 01:24:33,581
KAYLEN: Let's get it.

1168
01:24:36,501 --> 01:24:40,501
KAYLEN: Break this tension in the room.
I don't like this tension in the room here, everybody.

1169
01:24:40,501 --> 01:24:42,181
- TRAINEES: You got this!
- KAYLEN: Break this tension.

1170
01:24:42,981 --> 01:24:47,181
KAYLEN: I wanna bring, like, a fun vibe.

1171
01:24:47,181 --> 01:24:52,581
KAYLEN: I don't want the competitiveness.
I don't need the beef against performers,

1172
01:24:52,581 --> 01:24:57,381
KAYLEN: like, artists against other artists.
I don't want to bring that to the show.

1173
01:25:34,501 --> 01:25:35,181
KAYLEN: Sing.

1174
01:25:37,501 --> 01:25:38,301
KAYLEN: Sing.

1175
01:26:03,701 --> 01:26:08,101
TEGAN: I hope my decision didn't hurt
her feelings, but I hope we would have

1176
01:26:08,301 --> 01:26:10,301
TEGAN: like a really interesting battle.

1177
01:27:39,581 --> 01:27:41,101
TEGAN: Thank you very much.

1178
01:27:44,381 --> 01:27:47,581
AKINA: The situation was so tense.

1179
01:27:47,581 --> 01:27:49,501
AKINA: They're battling each other. No!

1180
01:27:49,501 --> 01:27:53,901
AKINA: To be able to break that tension
and put on such an amazing performance

1181
01:27:53,981 --> 01:27:56,981
AKINA: was really impressive to me.
They really stood out.

1182
01:27:57,181 --> 01:28:01,021
MIKE: And now, we will start voting.

1183
01:28:02,341 --> 01:28:03,781
MIKE: When everyone is ready,

1184
01:28:04,501 --> 01:28:06,261

1185
01:28:19,261 --> 01:28:22,181

1186
01:28:22,341 --> 01:28:25,741

1187
01:28:29,701 --> 01:28:30,981
MIKE: Congratulations,

1188
01:28:32,101 --> 01:28:32,981
MIKE: TEGAN.

1189
01:28:33,381 --> 01:28:34,381
MIKE: You're the winner.

1190
01:28:40,261 --> 01:28:45,501
TEGAN: Hopefully, I'll stay
in the Top 9 class with my aloha spirit

1191
01:28:45,501 --> 01:28:48,621
TEGAN: and with the little competitive drive
that I do have in me.

1192
01:28:48,621 --> 01:28:50,421
KAYLEN: I don't take anything to heart

1193
01:28:50,421 --> 01:28:52,581
KAYLEN: because I was also
watching her performance.

1194
01:28:53,101 --> 01:28:55,541
KAYLEN: I'm not surprised that

1195
01:28:55,821 --> 01:28:57,141
KAYLEN: she won that one.

1196
01:28:57,141 --> 01:29:01,261
KAYLEN: Now that she's in the Top 9,
as of right now, I hope

1197
01:29:01,261 --> 01:29:03,421
KAYLEN: let's represent Hawaii.
Show them what's up.

1198
01:29:03,421 --> 01:29:07,541
KAYLEN: You know I mean like I know
she can do it, I know she's got it.

1199
01:29:07,541 --> 01:29:11,261
KAYLEN: She just has to really believe
in herself to be able to do it

1200
01:29:11,261 --> 01:29:13,781
KAYLEN: and I think
she will succeed in that.

1201
01:29:14,221 --> 01:29:17,581
MIKE: Okay, we have finally reached
the final stage

1202
01:29:18,301 --> 01:29:19,821
MIKE: of the audition.

1203
01:29:19,821 --> 01:29:23,141
MIKE: And this is the result
of everyone's hard work.

1204
01:29:23,541 --> 01:29:24,541
MIKE: Please give yourself
a round of applause.

1205
01:29:27,741 --> 01:29:30,541
MIKE: And now, we're gonna announce

1206
01:29:30,861 --> 01:29:32,701

1213
01:29:52,621 --> 01:29:55,941
PREAM: I was about to cry.
I was so scared.

1214
01:29:55,981 --> 01:29:59,421
PREAM: Because being in the Top 9
is a lot of attention. I was so stressed.

1215
01:29:59,661 --> 01:30:01,821
PREAM: I'm afraid I'll fall
out of the Top 9.

1216
01:30:02,101 --> 01:30:05,781
LILIANA LI: I know I haven't
had the chance to fully show my potential.

1217
01:30:05,781 --> 01:30:09,181
LILIANA LI: I'm just waiting for a vocal battle
or sometime to, you know...

1218

01:30:18,981 --> 01:30:21,701

you will be assigned to Class B

1224

JACKSON: and Class F,
according to your votes

1225
01:30:30,501 --> 01:30:32,301
JACKSON: and according to your rankings.

1226
01:30:33,181 --> 01:30:36,581
ZOI: This was a huge stage.
It was difficult.

1227
01:30:36,581 --> 01:30:38,181
ZOI: It was challenging.

1228
01:30:38,381 --> 01:30:44,101
ZOI: And now that I got the chance to do it,
I think I can do better stage performances in the future.

DUNA: Now that I got into Class F,

1230
01:30:45,981 --> 01:30:49,501
DUNA: I thought that, I still haven't
shown my full potential.

1231
01:30:49,701 --> 01:30:53,101
DUNA: I need to work hard and show it.

1232
01:30:53,181 --> 01:30:58,301

can see that.

1238
01:31:12,101 --> 01:31:13,621
DIDI: I think it's a really good start
for me.

1239
01:31:13,621 --> 01:31:19,061
DIDI: 'Cause like I feel like I'm not that good
at dancing and singing right now.

1240
01:31:19,061 --> 01:31:22,941
DIDI: I feel like I wish I could,
like, grow during the show.

1241
01:31:22,941 --> 01:31:24,701
DIDI: And starts from F

1242
01:31:24,901 --> 01:31:27,581

to start from F.

and physical fitness.)

1248

1317
01:35:48,053 --> 01:35:49,453
Go to room 14?

LILIANA LI: Ah!

1319
01:35:52,053 --> 01:35:53,853
STAFF: So, you're going in for this room?

1320
01:35:53,853 --> 01:35:58,053
LILIANA LI: Yeah, what a better way
to learn Thai than to live with Thai people.

1321
01:35:58,053 --> 01:35:59,253
ILENE: It's my room.

1322
01:35:59,253 --> 01:36:00,133
STAFF: Okay.

1323
01:36:00,133 --> 01:36:01,853
DEVI: Do you have any space left?

1324
01:36:01,893 --> 01:36:02,533
LILIANA LI: Two more.

1325
01:36:02,533 --> 01:36:02,573
WANG YIBING: I got a room.

1326
01:36:02,573 --> 01:36:03,693
- DEVI: Two more?
- WANG YIBING: I got a room.

1327
01:36:03,693 --> 01:36:03,933
WANG YIBING: I got a room.

1328
01:36:03,933 --> 01:36:07,853
- DEVI: Can I?
- TRAINEES: Yeah. Okay.

1329
01:36:07,893 --> 01:36:10,493
DEVI: Yeah. We're here, Room 7.

1330
01:36:10,533 --> 01:36:11,213
ZOI: Room 7.

1331
01:36:11,333 --> 01:36:12,933
STAFF: Okay.

1332
01:36:13,133 --> 01:36:14,733
MINGMING: I'm the first international.

1333
01:36:14,733 --> 01:36:16,053
STAFF: Oh, really?

1334
01:36:16,053 --> 01:36:17,600
STAFF: Okay.

1335
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:19,413
LILIANA LI: I won't take a shower now.

1336
01:36:19,453 --> 01:36:22,453
STAFF: Why do you look upset?
You look angry.

1337
01:36:22,533 --> 01:36:27,733
LILIANA LI: I'm tired. I'm sleep-deprived.
I've already puked two times. My head hurts.

1338
01:36:27,893 --> 01:36:29,053
STAFF: Go to sleep.

1339
01:36:29,053 --> 01:36:30,853
STAFF: Go to sleep.

1340
01:36:30,853 --> 01:36:32,853
STAFF: Okay.

1341
01:36:42,053 --> 01:36:43,333
RUAN: Pink, pink.

1342
01:36:44,253 --> 01:36:45,053
ILENE: Oh my god.

1343
01:36:49,253 --> 01:36:50,133
VITA: Is it a water bottle?

1344
01:36:50,333 --> 01:36:50,933
So happy.

1345
01:36:50,933 --> 01:36:52,213
So pretty.

1346
01:36:53,533 --> 01:36:55,413
GEUMHEE: Who told you I like pink?

1347
01:36:56,453 --> 01:36:57,133
RUAN: Pink. Pink.

1348
01:37:01,133 --> 01:37:02,133
TRAINEES: Wow.

1349
01:37:03,533 --> 01:37:04,453
NATTY: TEAM WANG.

1350
01:37:04,733 --> 01:37:05,333
EMMA: TEAM WANG.

1351
01:37:05,333 --> 01:37:06,853
NATTY: Yeah, it's so cute.

1352
01:37:06,853 --> 01:37:07,733
ILENE: TEAM WANG.

1353
01:37:07,933 --> 01:37:08,933
ILENE: Wonderful.

1354
01:37:09,053 --> 01:37:10,533
DEVI: Wonderful.

1355
01:37:12,853 --> 01:37:15,133
MINGMING: It's like super good. Very good.

1356
01:37:15,133 --> 01:37:16,053
TRAINEE: Yeah.

1357
01:37:16,053 --> 01:37:17,253
DIDI: Thank you.

1358
01:37:17,253 --> 01:37:19,933
WANG KE: I love pink. I love TEAM WANG.

1359
01:37:20,253 --> 01:37:21,653
WANG KE: Thank you.

1360
01:37:21,653 --> 01:37:25,653
TRAINEES: Thank you.

1361
01:37:47,253 --> 01:37:48,133
JACKSON: Hi.

1362
01:37:52,064 --> 01:37:55,693
MIKE: announce the first task
of CHUANG ASIA.

1363
01:37:55,813 --> 01:37:56,613
MIKE: will be

1364
01:37:57,133 --> 01:37:58,933
MIKE: Theme Song Mission

1365
01:38:07,133 --> 01:38:12,013
WANG SHENG XI: SANTA dances very well
and is very handsome.

1366
01:38:12,013 --> 01:38:13,213
KANOMPANG: Whoo!

1367
01:38:13,213 --> 01:38:16,813
KANOMPANG: Of course, it wows me
because I like SANTA a lot.

1368
01:38:31,333 --> 01:38:34,533
CAITH: It's so cute and so nice.
I love the song.

1369
01:38:34,533 --> 01:38:37,933
CAITH: It's hard, actually.
But, I know I can do it.

1370
01:38:38,213 --> 01:38:41,173
XUEYAO: It's cute and a little sexy
and lively.

1371
01:38:41,173 --> 01:38:43,733
XUEYAO: I really like the song.

1372
01:38:52,813 --> 01:38:55,733
YEAN: The Theme Song is very difficult.

1373
01:38:55,733 --> 01:38:57,653
YEAN: Even though I'm a vocalist,

1374
01:38:57,653 --> 01:39:01,133
YEAN: I feel that it's hard
to sing this song well.

1375
01:39:01,173 --> 01:39:02,333
MINGMING: Oh my god.

1376
01:39:02,333 --> 01:39:03,813
MINGMING: The key is so high.

1377
01:39:03,813 --> 01:39:05,013
MINGMING: I'm gonna lose my breath.

1378
01:39:08,613 --> 01:39:14,253
SEOYEON: The center position
is very important to the team.

1379
01:39:14,293 --> 01:39:17,533
SEOYEON: I think if I train hard,
I can do it.

1380
01:39:17,533 --> 01:39:22,133
RUAN: When I see the choreography
and the lyrics, I think it is my song.

1381
01:39:22,133 --> 01:39:23,213
WANG SHENG XI: I think this is my song.

1382
01:39:23,253 --> 01:39:25,133
WANG SHENG XI: It's my style.

1383
01:39:25,173 --> 01:39:26,693
WANG SHENG XI: I can tell you
that this time

1384
01:39:26,693 --> 01:39:29,973
WANG SHENG XI: I'm gonna get back
everything that's mine.

1385
01:39:29,973 --> 01:39:31,733
WANG SHENG XI: I can't be
in class F anymore.

1386
01:39:36,013 --> 01:39:39,413
TRAINEES: Wow.

1387
01:39:39,413 --> 01:39:40,533
JACKSON: What do you think?

1388
01:39:40,533 --> 01:39:42,533
TRAINEE: Yeah.

1389
01:39:42,733 --> 01:39:43,733
JACKSON: You can do this?

1390
01:39:43,733 --> 01:39:45,533
Yes!

1391
01:39:45,533 --> 01:39:47,533
- MIKE: Yeah.
- JACKSON: You have three days to prepare.

1392
01:39:47,533 --> 01:39:49,133
Huh?!

1393
01:39:49,133 --> 01:39:50,213
ILENE: Just three days.

1394
01:39:50,213 --> 01:39:52,733
ILENE: Even though
I'm the main dancer of Mindy.

1395
01:39:52,733 --> 01:39:55,293
ILENE: I can't learn
a new choreography that fast.

1396
01:39:55,333 --> 01:39:57,533
ILENE: So, I'm very worried.

1397
01:39:57,533 --> 01:40:00,373
WANG YIBING: Really?
Are we going to do this?

1398
01:40:00,373 --> 01:40:04,573
AUN AUN: I suddenly feel worried.
It's so sudden.

1399
01:40:04,613 --> 01:40:12,373
JACKSON: After the performance, we, as mentors,
will reevaluate your class based on the videos.

1400
01:40:12,413 --> 01:40:15,093
JACKSON: It will determine
if you guys move up or move down.

1401
01:40:17,493 --> 01:40:22,893
LILIANA LI: Considering the amount of the time all of us have got
to practice that 3-minute-and-30-second dance,

1402
01:40:22,933 --> 01:40:27,093
LILIANA LI: even though
it's kind of repetitive, it's hard.

1403
01:40:27,093 --> 01:40:29,893
ELYN: For me it was hard
because I'm not a dancer.

1404
01:40:29,973 --> 01:40:34,333
ELYN: I've only practiced for one month
of dancing before I came to CHUANG.

1405
01:40:34,413 --> 01:40:38,453
ELYN: And also, I think singing is still okay
but the notes are so high.

1406
01:40:38,613 --> 01:40:42,573
TEGAN: In my opinion, I think this was
a really hard song to dance and sing.

1407
01:40:42,653 --> 01:40:48,253
TEGAN: With all the jumping and spinning,
it's like a workout or a Zumba class.

1408
01:40:48,373 --> 01:40:50,013
KAYLEN: This is my normal

1409
01:40:50,093 --> 01:40:57,184
KAYLEN: So, having to dance and sing
a whole three minutes song

1410
01:40:57,184 --> 01:41:02,573
KAYLEN: that is already very very high
was definitely a challenge.

1411
01:41:09,413 --> 01:41:15,093
LILIANA LI: Okay. So, I think for me personally,
what I'm most worried about is dance.

1412
01:41:15,293 --> 01:41:16,213
LILIANA LI: What about you guys?

1413
01:41:16,613 --> 01:41:22,493
YEAN: We divided the work.
The main dancers learn the first part.

1414
01:41:22,533 --> 01:41:26,653
YEAN: The vocalists learn
the hook part like this

1415
01:41:26,773 --> 01:41:29,213
YEAN: because it's easy.

1416
01:41:37,472 --> 01:41:43,973
RUAN: I practice my facial expression.
So, I can do better than the others.

1417
01:41:48,013 --> 01:41:49,893
RUAN: In the practice, I think

1418
01:41:50,093 --> 01:41:54,333
RUAN: a lot of people look at me.
But I don't look at them.

1419
01:41:54,653 --> 01:41:57,013
RUAN: I just look at myself in the mirror.

1420
01:41:57,173 --> 01:42:03,013
RUAN: I practice when to smile
or when to wink.

1421
01:42:03,653 --> 01:42:08,773
PIMMIE: Class F's practice is very fun
because our friends are the teachers.

1422
01:42:08,813 --> 01:42:09,973
PIMMIE: They help teach us.

1423
01:42:10,813 --> 01:42:13,213
Summer Dream Summer Dream

1424
01:42:13,213 --> 01:42:15,213
Dream Dream

1425
01:42:18,693 --> 01:42:21,693
PIMMIE: The Korean girls
are the ones teaching everyone.

1426
01:42:21,893 --> 01:42:26,493
PIMMIE: They are good dancers
and fast learners. So they teach everyone.

1427
01:42:26,493 --> 01:42:30,573
XUEYAO: It's like they didn't sleep all night to practice.
I remember they practiced until 3 or 4 AM,

1428
01:42:30,613 --> 01:42:33,493
XUEYAO: or almost 5 AM and they have to
wake up at 7 AM to put on their makeup.

1429
01:42:33,493 --> 01:42:35,173
XUEYAO: They practiced until 5 AM
before going to bed.

1430
01:42:35,253 --> 01:42:38,213
XUEYAO: The next day,
they could dance the whole song.

1431
01:42:38,213 --> 01:42:39,613
SEOYEON: The friends in the class said

1432
01:42:40,213 --> 01:42:42,373
SEOYEON: that I did the best in the class.

1433
01:42:42,493 --> 01:42:45,893
SEOYEON: And they call me
and DUNA teachers.

1434
01:42:46,173 --> 01:42:51,213
SEOYEON: So, I think I have a chance
to move to class B.

1435
01:42:53,893 --> 01:42:55,293
SEOYEON: Thank you.

1436
01:43:07,933 --> 01:43:10,093
TEGAN: Wow, guys. Yes.

1437
01:43:10,733 --> 01:43:16,013
TEGAN: I really doubted myself
to even learn it

1438
01:43:16,053 --> 01:43:21,613
TEGAN: because I've never learned to dance that long
in maybe five years or four years.

1439
01:43:21,653 --> 01:43:27,333
TEGAN: So, I didn't believe in myself that much in the beginning
but I was like, "We're gonna try."

1440
01:43:28,813 --> 01:43:29,333
TEGAN: Hey.

1441
01:43:36,013 --> 01:43:37,533
TRAINEE: Fighting.

1442
01:43:37,733 --> 01:43:42,733
TEGAN: I think there's a high possibility
that I won't be in A Class anymore.

1443
01:43:42,933 --> 01:43:48,013
TEGAN: I can't say I'm worried.
I can accept my fate whatever it will be.

1444
01:43:49,133 --> 01:43:53,613
Teacher: We start from seven and eight.

1445
01:43:53,813 --> 01:43:54,333
Teacher: Try.

1446
01:44:00,613 --> 01:44:04,013
XUEYAO: During our practice,
many trainees were exhausted,

1447
01:44:04,413 --> 01:44:06,013
XUEYAO: like JASMINE.

1448
01:44:22,533 --> 01:44:24,573
DIDI: I'll teach you. I'm here.

1449
01:44:24,573 --> 01:44:26,573
DIDI: I'll teach you, okay?

1450
01:44:26,866 --> 01:44:28,032
You're okay?

1451
01:44:30,533 --> 01:44:32,413
MINGMING: It's okay.

1452
01:44:36,059 --> 01:44:37,832
You're okay?

1453
01:44:39,973 --> 01:44:41,773
XUEYAO: I can teach you anytime.

1454
01:44:41,773 --> 01:44:42,893
DIDI: Don't cry.

1455
01:44:43,005 --> 01:44:45,248
It's okay. It's okay. Fighting.

1456
01:44:46,133 --> 01:44:47,853
DIDI: It's fine. It's fine.

1457
01:44:50,453 --> 01:44:51,493
MINGMING: We can help each other.

1458
01:45:04,613 --> 01:45:05,373
EMMA: Not like this.

1459
01:45:07,413 --> 01:45:10,013
EMMA: I teach everybody,
like every trainee.

1460
01:45:10,013 --> 01:45:12,013
EMMA: They said I was very strict.

1461
01:45:12,093 --> 01:45:15,813
EMMA: Because I know
what their problem is, you know?

1462
01:45:15,813 --> 01:45:21,293
EMMA: You teach somebody else. Then, you
can remember more about the movement.

1463
01:45:23,893 --> 01:45:26,013
WANG SHENG XI: Ms. EMMA was very strict.

1464
01:45:26,013 --> 01:45:29,373
WANG SHENG XI: She was always like,
"This part doesn't have this move."

1465
01:45:29,413 --> 01:45:30,613
WANG SHENG XI: "Come on, spread
your arms out."

1466
01:45:30,653 --> 01:45:33,613
WANG SHENG XI: And I was like, "Yes, ma'am.
I heard you."

1467
01:45:37,893 --> 01:45:41,413
DIDI: I didn't go
through anything that hard.

1468
01:45:41,453 --> 01:45:48,333
DIDI: Because I have two new friends who
helped me a lot and we worked so hard together.

1469
01:45:48,333 --> 01:45:53,293
One, two, three, four.

1470
01:45:53,453 --> 01:45:55,493
DIDI: It's EMMA and QIAO YI.

1471
01:45:59,453 --> 01:46:00,693
MINGMING: Those three days

1472
01:46:01,253 --> 01:46:02,373
MINGMING: were quite

1473
01:46:02,613 --> 01:46:03,613
MINGMING: pretty brutal,

1474
01:46:03,653 --> 01:46:05,853
MINGMING: but we made it through.

1475
01:46:06,733 --> 01:46:07,493
MINGMING: I'm happy.

1476
01:46:18,213 --> 01:46:21,333
MIKE: This is the theme song
performance, right?

1477
01:46:21,333 --> 01:46:21,813
MIKE: Alright then.

1478
01:46:22,813 --> 01:46:24,133
MIKE: Let's see the first team.

1479
01:46:30,053 --> 01:46:32,653
WANG YIBING: I told myself,
"You can do this," to cheer myself up.

1480
01:46:32,693 --> 01:46:36,413
WANG YIBING: Feel my summer dream.
Breathe in my summer dream. Hey!

1481
01:46:36,413 --> 01:46:37,493
WANG YIBING: It was very fun.

1482
01:46:37,613 --> 01:46:40,453
WANG YIBING: Because everyone was cheering up
for me from behind, like, "Yeah!"

1483
01:46:58,773 --> 01:47:00,853
NENE: For me, she danced
like she's a singer

1484
01:47:00,973 --> 01:47:03,973
NENE: and has a dancer around her like,
"Okay, dance a little bit."

1485
01:47:03,973 --> 01:47:05,973
NENE: They didn't dance in sync.

1486
01:47:05,973 --> 01:47:06,653
TEN: Yeah.

1487
01:47:06,653 --> 01:47:08,373
NENE: It's because she's singer.

1488
01:47:08,613 --> 01:47:11,453
JACKSON: We just finished
watching everyone.

1489
01:47:11,493 --> 01:47:15,253
JACKSON: You know there's
no point of us voting, you know?

1490
01:47:15,293 --> 01:47:18,053
JACKSON: JEFF is gonna make everything.

1491
01:47:18,053 --> 01:47:21,053
JACKSON: JEFF is gonna change everything.

1492
01:47:21,933 --> 01:47:24,173
TEN: Aren't we changing it right now?

1493
01:47:24,253 --> 01:47:25,893
- TEN: No?
- JACKSON: I'm just kidding, JEFF.

1494
01:47:25,933 --> 01:47:26,813
JACKSON: I'm just kidding.

1495
01:47:26,853 --> 01:47:27,933
MIKE: He's kidding.

1496
01:47:38,733 --> 01:47:43,613
MIKE: Today, we will make a very
important announcement.

1497
01:47:44,533 --> 01:47:46,333
MIKE: This is a big announcement

1498
01:47:46,496 --> 01:47:48,933
MIKE: that will change everything.

1499
01:47:50,933 --> 01:47:51,933
MIKE: Are you nervous?

1500
01:47:51,933 --> 01:47:53,213
Very nervous.

1501
01:47:53,213 --> 01:47:55,973
WANG YIBING: I'm stressed out.

1502
01:47:57,333 --> 01:47:59,933
NENE: First of all, I would like to inform that

1503
01:47:59,933 --> 01:48:06,213
NENE: the evaluation results are based on everything,
not just dancing or singing, but both.

1504
01:48:07,133 --> 01:48:08,333
MIKE: Okay.

1505
01:48:08,813 --> 01:48:15,413
MIKE: Today, we're gonna announce the evaluation
results of everyone in each class.

1506
01:48:16,333 --> 01:48:21,133
MIKE: It will affect
everyone's current position.

1507
01:48:28,413 --> 01:48:31,813
MIKE: Class A might move to Class B,

1508
01:48:33,472 --> 01:48:36,333
MIKE: or even to Class F.

1509
01:48:37,733 --> 01:48:40,333
MIKE: Class B can also move to Class F.

1510
01:48:41,413 --> 01:48:43,213
MIKE: Class F

1511
01:48:43,744 --> 01:48:46,933
MIKE: can also move up to Class B

1512
01:48:46,933 --> 01:48:48,608
MIKE: or move up to Class A.

1513
01:48:50,613 --> 01:48:55,213
MIKE: So, there's gonna be
a lot of change.

1514
01:48:59,213 --> 01:49:00,413
MIKE: Are you ready for this?

1515
01:49:01,613 --> 01:49:02,613
MIKE: Are you guys ready to hear this?

1516
01:49:02,613 --> 01:49:03,613
WANG YIBING: Yes!

1517
01:49:04,053 --> 01:49:05,493
MIKE: Yes!

1518
01:49:07,813 --> 01:49:08,992
MIKE: Okay.

1519
01:49:09,984 --> 01:49:12,800
MIKE: Let's start with Class A.

1520
01:49:19,733 --> 01:49:24,333
NENE: Here's the list of Class A trainees

1521
01:49:24,933 --> 01:49:27,133
NENE: who will be moved to Class B.

1522
01:49:27,133 --> 01:49:28,053
NENE: The first person,

1523
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:33,024
NENE: PREAM.

1524
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:46,464
WANG YIBING: Ah, she's sick.

1525
01:49:49,253 --> 01:49:54,912
PREAM: I only thought I had a 10% chance
of staying in the same class.

1526
01:49:54,912 --> 01:49:58,784
PREAM: But I was 90% sure
I would be moved to Class B,

1527
01:49:58,784 --> 01:50:02,573
PREAM: because there were people who were
better than me at both singing and dancing.

1528
01:50:02,853 --> 01:50:04,173
NENE: The second person,

1529
01:50:06,813 --> 01:50:07,968
NENE: LILIANA LI.

1530
01:50:10,493 --> 01:50:12,413

1542
01:50:37,493 --> 01:50:38,373
NENE: TEGAN.

1543
01:50:43,693 --> 01:50:44,773
MAMCÙ: Class B

1544
01:50:44,773 --> 01:50:45,693
TEGAN: Yeah.

1545
01:50:48,933 --> 01:50:52,053
MIKE: Everyone who was just called,

1546
01:50:52,253 --> 01:50:54,688
MIKE: please take a seat in Class B.

1547
01:50:58,336 --> 01:51:00,736
Come on. Can't move up.

1548
01:51:01,764 --> 01:51:03,317
Can't move up.

1549
01:51:04,281 --> 01:51:07,651
We can't move up.

1550
01:51:07,651 --> 01:51:08,785
Hey guys. Welcome.

1551
01:51:09,013 --> 01:51:12,373
PREAM: I want to be like this. It's fine.

1552
01:51:12,373 --> 01:51:15,493
MIKE: Okay, guys.

1553
01:51:15,693 --> 01:51:20,973
MIKE: There will be 12 people
who will move from Class B to Class F.

1554
01:51:27,893 --> 01:51:29,493
MIKE: The first person,

1555
01:51:29,493 --> 01:51:31,493
MIKE: KRISTA.

1556
01:51:33,653 --> 01:51:34,653
MIKE: The second person,

1557
01:51:34,933 --> 01:51:35,573
MIKE: YUI.

1558
01:51:37,853 --> 01:51:40,653
RUAN: When I heard that YUI
was moved to Class B,

1559
01:51:40,653 --> 01:51:45,373
RUAN: I was so shocked
that I couldn't say anything.

1560
01:51:48,064 --> 01:51:49,546
Oh, my God.

1561
01:51:53,773 --> 01:51:57,153
TEN: I don't feel like her dancing is lacking.
I feel like she's quite good at dancing.

1562
01:51:57,153 --> 01:52:01,653
TEN: But like what you said, her vocal is very weak.

1563
01:52:01,653 --> 01:52:07,053
MIKE: And her face looks so worried
all the time as well.

1564
01:52:07,053 --> 01:52:12,653
YUI: Even though I moved to F,
I'm still confident that I can show

1565
01:52:13,453 --> 01:52:14,653
YUI: my true ability.

1566
01:52:15,253 --> 01:52:16,453
MIKE: The third person.

1567
01:52:17,253 --> 01:52:18,173
MIKE: ELYN.

1568
01:52:23,933 --> 01:52:25,253
ELYN: I was dissatisfied.

1569
01:52:25,253 --> 01:52:30,333
ELYN: I felt like I'm letting myself down,

1570
01:52:30,333 --> 01:52:32,853
ELYN: and I'm also

1571
01:52:33,733 --> 01:52:36,853
ELYN: letting everyone else down.

1572
01:52:37,453 --> 01:52:40,053
ELYN: Don't cry.

1573
01:52:42,733 --> 01:52:44,133
ELYN: I miss my family.

1574
01:52:45,253 --> 01:52:52,093
ELYN: I don't want my friends and my family
in Malaysia to see this and be disappointed.

1575
01:52:52,733 --> 01:52:54,933
ELYN: I felt really pressured.

1576
01:52:56,733 --> 01:52:57,893

1577
01:52:58,493 --> 01:52:59,733

01:53:14,413 --> 01:53:17,573

1586
01:53:27,813 --> 01:53:29,013
Why?

1587
01:53:29,013 --> 01:53:30,693
Oh, no.

1588
01:53:30,813 --> 01:53:32,413
MIKE: The ninth person,

1589
01:53:32,893 --> 01:53:33,693
MIKE: TK.

1590
01:53:38,453 --> 01:53:40,213
MIKE: The tenth person, WANG YIBING.

1591
01:53:48,573 --> 01:53:55,013
TEN: Definitely, she needs to work on her dancing and singing,
but right now, I feel like her personality can really make people smile.

1592
01:53:55,053 --> 01:53:56,853
JACKSON: Yeah, give joy to people.

1593
01:53:57,173 --> 01:54:00,613
WANG YIBING: I didn't do very well.
I tried my best.

1594
01:54:00,653 --> 01:54:04,773
WANG YIBING: I worked really hard.
I should say this more to myself.

1595
01:54:05,533 --> 01:54:07,933
WANG YIBING: You did good! You did good!

1596
01:54:08,293 --> 01:54:10,333
MIKE: The last two people are

1597
01:54:11,213 --> 01:54:14,253
MIKE: the two people
who used to be in Class A

1598
01:54:15,573 --> 01:54:17,693
MIKE: and have moved down to Class B.

1599
01:54:18,173 --> 01:54:20,813
MIKE: They will be moving to Class F.

1600
01:54:25,853 --> 01:54:27,733
PREAM: I think it's me. It's me.

1601
01:54:28,373 --> 01:54:30,373
MIKE: The eleventh person,

1602
01:54:31,493 --> 01:54:32,493

1603
01:54:38,093 --> 01:54:40,093

MIKE: TEGAN.

1605
01:54:44,173 --> 01:54:47,373
TEGAN: You and me. We're moving.

1606
01:54:52,733 --> 01:54:59,933
MIKE: She's trying hard. She tried hard to sing
even though she was running out of breath.

1607
01:55:00,413 --> 01:55:05,613
JACKSON: I think it's negative energy for us
to say it's F. Let's just say Fantastic.

1608
01:55:05,733 --> 01:55:06,733
NENE: It's fantastic.

1609
01:55:06,733 --> 01:55:08,133
JACKSON: Let's just say Fantastic.

1610
01:55:08,213 --> 01:55:12,613
TEGAN: I definitely wouldn't like
to stay in F Class for sure.

1611
01:55:12,933 --> 01:55:17,733
TEGAN: So, I would like to move out
of F Class eventually. And also,

1612
01:55:18,013 --> 01:55:22,933
TEGAN: to just learn how to dance
and sing at the same time.

1613
01:55:22,933 --> 01:55:26,813
MIKE: Maybe, can you guys
move to Class F, please?

1614
01:55:37,053 --> 01:55:42,053
NENE: I'm gonna announce people
who will be moving from Class F to Class B.

1615

NENE: SEOYEON

1626
01:56:28,173 --> 01:56:33,973

fine, stable. I just don't see A.

1627
01:56:34,173 --> 01:56:38,173
TEN: She knows how to do it, but she can't
really pull out her personality yet.

1628
01:56:38,253 --> 01:56:39,053
NENE: Yeah.

1629
01:56:39,053 --> 01:56:41,853
SEOYEON: I was so happy that day.

1654
01:58:24,413 --> 01:58:30,413
TEN: I feel like girl fans are gonna like her though,
because she's cool but also very powerful. She can do both.

1655
01:58:30,413 --> 01:58:32,093

01:58:34,213 --> 01:58:35,733
QIAO YI YU: I felt like

1658
01:58:35,973 --> 01:58:42,813
QIAO YI YU: I received a red flower,
like a kindergarten kid

1659
01:58:42,853 --> 01:58:46,773
QIAO YI YU: who waits every day
to be praised by their teacher.

1660
01:58:46,813 --> 01:58:51,213
QIAO YI YU: I used to be a pitiful child
who never received such praise.

1661
01:58:51,493 --> 01:58:55,872
QIAO YI YU: But this time, I finally had
the chance to receive a small red flower.

1662
01:58:55,872 --> 01:58:57,693

that reward.

1663
01:58:57,733 --> 01:59:02,693

in the next competition.

Right now her moves are very clean. She suits like a group dance.

1690
02:01:04,293 --> 02:01:09,373
JACKSON: Dance, vocal, facial expression.
Every aspect is very complete.

1691
02:01:09,573 --> 02:01:15,373
MINGMING: I didn't want to get my hopes up,
because I didn't want to be disappointed like last time.

1692
02:01:15,813 --> 02:01:19,613
MINGMING: Since I didn't have high
expectations, I was surprised like,

1693
02:01:19,744 --> 02:01:23,413

02:01:23,973 --> 02:01:24,933
that I can move from F to A.

from the trainees' vote result the other day.

1702
02:02:22,253 --> 02:02:25,653

MIKE: PREAM.

1710
02:02:51,653 --> 02:03:00,533

at dancing and her voice suits the song.

1711
02:03:00,613 --> 02:03:04,973
JAOYING: She's naturally cute and bright.
So, I want to see PREAM stand in the center.

MIKE: And

1713
02:03:07,173 --> 02:03:07,733

1720
02:03:36,333 --> 02:03:38,013
MIKE: Number One

1721
02:03:38,973 --> 02:03:40,253
MIKE: MINGMING.

1722
02:03:46,653 --> 02:03:48,064
MIKE: Number Two

1723
02:03:48,192 --> 02:03:49,504

MIKE: Number Five

1729
02:04:04,896 --> 02:04:05,888
MIKE: YEAN.

1730
02:04:09,773 --> 02:04:13,173
MIKE: But her name is repeated
in the popular votes.

1731
02:04:13,693 --> 02:04:18,373
MIKE: So, here, it must be
someone else who is

1732
02:04:18,973 --> 02:04:22,133
MIKE: ranked next to YEAN, that is

1733
02:04:29,333 --> 02:04:30,053
MIKE: KANOMPANG.

1734
02:04:36,373 --> 02:04:44,013
MIKE: The five trainees, please stand
in the same place as those three guys.

1735
02:04:52,933 --> 02:04:57,173
YEAN: I don't just assume it,
but I hope it's KANOMPANG.

1736
02:04:57,253 --> 02:05:02,573
YEAN: But it's actually KANOMPANG.
I feel so happy. I screamed till I lost my voice.

1737
02:05:02,976 --> 02:05:06,253
MIKE: One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

1738
02:05:06,253 --> 02:05:08,053
MIKE: Oh, there's still one more.

1739
02:05:08,773 --> 02:05:12,373
MIKE: As you know, in this field,
talent only might not be enough

1740
02:05:12,413 --> 02:05:15,773
MIKE: because there are so many
talented people in this world.

1741
02:05:17,053 --> 02:05:19,173
MIKE: Luck is another factor.

1742
02:05:19,853 --> 02:05:20,933
MIKE: So, I think

1743
02:05:21,613 --> 02:05:24,493
MIKE: having the lucky draw
to become the last candidate,

1744
02:05:24,853 --> 02:05:26,733
MIKE: it's like giving someone a chance.

1745
02:05:27,533 --> 02:05:32,733
MIKE: Giving a chance to other trainees
who may not have been selected,

1746
02:05:33,053 --> 02:05:37,053
MIKE: but giving them a chance
to show their potential.

1747
02:05:37,333 --> 02:05:39,053
MIKE: Come out
and show off their abilities.

1748
02:05:39,653 --> 02:05:42,093
LILIANA LI: Don't tell me
they're gonna lottery.

1749
02:05:42,093 --> 02:05:43,813
MIKE: Please give me the table
of Lucky Draw.

1750
02:05:47,613 --> 02:05:50,533
LILIANA LI: I heard someone surprising like, "Whoa, lucky draw!"

1751
02:05:50,533 --> 02:05:53,013
LILIANA LI: and I think it's fair.
Qualified.

1752
02:05:53,653 --> 02:05:55,933
MIKE: May the force be with you.

1753
02:06:14,653 --> 02:06:15,520
MIKE: KITTIE.

1754
02:06:22,333 --> 02:06:25,253
KITTIE: Good luck is like having an angel
knocking at the door,

1755
02:06:25,253 --> 02:06:28,373
KITTIE: and then I'm brought
to the place I dreamed of.

1756
02:06:28,493 --> 02:06:32,533
KITTIE: I mean, I've always wanted
to stand next to them.

1757
02:06:32,573 --> 02:06:35,173
KITTIE: I want to perform
on stage with them.

1758
02:06:35,413 --> 02:06:38,933
KITTIE: And this is what
I've dreamed of all this time.

1759
02:06:39,853 --> 02:06:44,133
MIKE: Okay, all the nine people are now
standing in front of us.

1760
02:06:44,533 --> 02:06:49,253
MIKE: So, you guys are gonna have to dance
battle on the Theme Song.

1761
02:06:55,253 --> 02:06:57,653
MIKE: Then, we will choose one
to be the center.

1762
02:06:57,733 --> 02:07:05,053
MIKE: This time, the Theme Song will be more special
as it's not just recording an MV.

1763
02:07:05,133 --> 02:07:10,053
MIKE: There will be real audience.

1764
02:07:11,733 --> 02:07:13,333
MIKE: A numerous amount of them.

1765
02:07:15,533 --> 02:07:19,053
MIKE: This will be
everyone's first performance

1766
02:07:19,733 --> 02:07:21,653
MIKE: that meets the real audience.

1767
02:07:22,133 --> 02:07:23,053
MIKE: So,

1768
02:07:23,733 --> 02:07:25,813
MIKE: now we will start

1769
02:07:27,653 --> 02:07:30,400
MIKE: to choose the center
from the battle.

1770
02:07:31,693 --> 02:07:33,184

1772
02:07:38,853 --> 02:07:41,133
