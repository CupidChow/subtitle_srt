CHACHA: telling them to prepare
a little fashion thing

161
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,120

it represents them.

162
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,440

to be confused at first.

163
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,640

who organized this.

164
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,240

167
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:52,520

why you were selected.

168
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:59,840

179
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,880
DIDI: Whoever pretends if we are...

180
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,720
DIDI: picking a person randomly.

181
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,200
DIDI: And if we pick the person,
we have to dress like that person.

182
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,440
TRAINEES: Yes.

183
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:48,920

she has to be sexy.

184
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,320
EMMA: Yeah, good idea.

185
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,360

and I love dressing up and being dressed up very nicely.

188
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,080
KAYLEN: But when we discussed more
about what it would be,

189
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,720
KAYLEN: then I got a little nervous.
I got very very nervous.

190
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,640

196
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:37,440
QIAO YI YU: KAYLEN and I are similar.
If we're in the same situation, how strange can we become?

197
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,120
EMMA: It's an interesting theme.

198
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,480

201
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,760

TEGAN: So, I haven't booked yet.

203
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,000

220
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,720

I think I get that strength from her.

498
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,920
YEAN: My dad is the kind one.

499
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,760
YEAN: When my mom says
"You can't do that. You have to do this.",

500
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,280
YEAN: my dad would be like "It's okay."

501
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,920

00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,600
PANDA: It's so good
that I don't say anything

514
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,520
PANDA: because I only keep eating.

515
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,320

YUI: I'm sorry.

00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,000
YUI: It's so delicious.

00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:34,160
WANG SHENG XI: Today, YUI and I are sorry.

520
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:41,320

PANDA: When I see YEAN's parents,
I miss my parents.

531
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,280
PANDA: I know how YEAN feels

532
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:10,120

542
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:53,320

546
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:06,600
RAY: I draw myself in a school uniform
and write CHUANG SCHOOL 2024

547
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:13,040
RAY: and the greetings in each language.
There's Japanese for YUI,

548
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:19,440
RAY: I write nice to meet you.
And I have Korean and Chinese.

549
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,560
RAY: I want them to see that I try
and I want to be friends with them.

550
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:27,120
RAY: So, I try to write in their languages
so they can keep it as a memory.

551
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:33,720
WANG SHENG XI: Today, I'm so happy.
So many delicious food.

552
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:44,520
WANG SHENG XI: And today is my time in Thai school uniform
and I see in Thai drama they write something on the uniform.

553
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:52,920
WANG SHENG XI: So, I want to do that
because it's very nice to meet everyone and I wanna remember this forever.

554
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,720
WANG SHENG XI: So I want to do that
on my shirt.

555
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,800
WANG SHENG XI: Yes, it's magic.

556
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,440
TN: Don't look.

557
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,120
WANG SHENG XI: It's so small, too small.

558
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:20,240
PREEMMY: Writing the shirts makes me
feel like I'm really graduating.

559
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:25,280
PREEMMY: Because I dropped out of school

560
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,920
PREEMMY: to focus on working in this field,
I didn't graduate with my friends.

561
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,240
PREEMMY: So, it feels like, hey,

562
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,720
PREEMMY: today is like,

563
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,160
PREEMMY: The thing that I wanted to do
the most if I graduated from high school

564
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,520
PREEMMY: is writing on my friends' shirts
and have good memories.

565
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,760
PREEMMY: It's very fulfilling today.

566
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:53,920
PREEMMY: I get to graduate
from high school with CHUANG friends.

567
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,320
YEAN: Five, six, seven, eight.

568
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,120
YEAN: This is the meal
that I'll always remember

569
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:09,000
YEAN: because I have both
my family and friends.

570
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,080
YEAN: We all eat together today.

571
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:15,200
YEAN: I feel that we've developed
our relationship to another step

572
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:19,920

576
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,320
PAILIU: I'm so happy because I haven't
gone shopping for a long time.

577
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:35,200
PAILIU: We pair up differently this time:
dress-up partners and shopping partners

578
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,000
PAILIU: because we need to switch.

579
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,400

dressed won't be surprised.

580
