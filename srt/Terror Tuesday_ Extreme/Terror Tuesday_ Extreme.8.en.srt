You can call me Ple.

About 20 to 30.

Oh, let me figure out how much.

27
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:03,458
I see you're raising a child by yourself.

It's not wet in there.

Have you done your exercises?

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,041

You're going up to first grade soon.

I can't afford tutorials.

51
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:44,250
If you don't do the exercises,
how can you compete?

52
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,125
I do them every day.
Can't I watch cartoons today?

53
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,333
[Kaew] Please, Mommy, please.

54
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:51,458
Fine.

55
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:52,791
But

56
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,041
do the exercises first.

57
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:55,958
[Ple] All right?

58
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,083

00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,291

[man] Okay, let's take the next call.

67
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:48,875
Hello, girl.

68
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,875
-[woman] Hello.
-What's your name?

69
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,791
-I'm Bow.
-[man] Where are you?

70
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,791
[Bow] Ang Thong.

71
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,791
[man] What is your horror story?

72
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,583
[Bow] This incident happened to my friend.

73
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:02,500
First off, I have to tell you
that this woman was a single mom,

74
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,583
and her kid was still little.

75
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,541
People in the neighborhood

76
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:11,583
thought they were cute together
and adored them.

77
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,833
One day, there was a temple fair.

78
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:17,500
Towards the end of the fair,
this woman suddenly shouted and screamed

79
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,875
that her kid was drowning
and asked people to help.

80
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,916
But no one helped her,

81
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
so she jumped in and searched by herself.

82
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,375
[man] My gosh, no one helped her?

83
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:29,375
[Bow] No.

84
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:33,458
After a while, she found her kid's body.
Everyone felt sorry for her.

85
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,541
[man] My goodness.

86
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,333
[Bow] And when she saw her kid was dead,
she cried hysterically

87
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:41,916
and kept saying
that a ghost took her kid away. So…

88
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:47,416
What?

89
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,458

-[Bow] The scary part was…
-[Ple] When did it skip?

93
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,291
[Bow] …she smashed the TV…

94
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:06,166
…she cried hysterically
and kept saying that

95
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,041
a ghost took her kid away.

96
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,000
We asked why she thought so.

97
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:13,833
She said her kid had acted strangely
a few days before she died.

98
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,416
-[man] How?
-[Bow] She said she played with a sister.

99
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,375
I got goosebumps when I heard that.
I mean, what sister?

100
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,958
Because they lived by themselves.

101
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,375
The scary part was when she got home,

102
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,375
[distorted] she smashed the TV, and she…

00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,958
You came by so late.

108
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,458
What is the date today, dear?

109
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,208
Will you pay your rent arrears already?

110
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,375
Can I have a few more weeks?

111
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,791
I enrolled Kaew in an elementary school,

112
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,833
so it's been hectic.

113
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,666
[Ple] Things should ease up soon.

114
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,958
Ease up?

115
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,666
Things will ease up
after paying the tuition?

116
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:14,166
After enrollment, you'll also
pay for uniforms, books, and activities.

117
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,500
[Hom] Have you prepared?

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,708
So, where did you enroll her?

119
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,875

Isn't it too expensive, Ple?

122
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,208
How much can you make in a day
from this shop?

123
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:33,250
Even my kid
goes to the temple school up the alley.

124
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,958
It's a big difference in expenses.

125
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,208
Two weeks.

126
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,500
If you don't pay,
I'll move someone else in.

127
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,458
I'll pay you for sure.

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,625
Isn't the enrollment fee due next week?

145
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:19,375
I'm here to check the student's house
as per our school's regulations.

146
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,875
[man 1] You should be well aware
of the appointment date.

Triam Phadung Suksa School

154
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,166
doesn't focus only on academic excellence

155
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:04,000
because we believe that students' families

156
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:08,791
should be able
to support their development too.

157
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,791
Let's check the second floor.

158
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,833
She has her reading zone too.

-Kaew is now--
-No need.

160
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,291
This should be enough.

161
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:25,625
[man 1] My school focuses on
quality education,

162
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,833
so the upkeep fees are a little high.

163
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:33,041
I suggest you consider
other schools that are more suitable

164
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,000
for the kid and yourself.

165
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,583
But I really want her
to go to your school.

166
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,416
But the quota for first graders
is now full.

167
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,458
So, how much are the fees?

so they won't get tangled.

184
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,250
[Kaew] Mommy, what is this?

185
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,625
[joyful music playing]

186
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,208
It's the customer's.

187
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,875
I'll return it.

188
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,541
Kaew, It's past noon
and you haven't taken a bath?

189
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:04,916
-I'm waiting to take it with you. Please.
-[Ple] You're already six years old.

190
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,708
You can do it yourself.

191
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,666
-[Kaew] No, I want to take it with you.
-Kaew.

192
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,958
Stop making a scene.

193
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,625
-Neighbors will hear you. Kaew.
-[Kaew] Please.

194
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:18,625
I want to take a bath with you.

195
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:22,291
-Cut it out!
-[Kaew] I want to take a bath with you.

196
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,250
[Ple] Oops! [laughing]

197
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,208
There.

198
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:32,666
Open your eyes.

199
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,125
Does it sting? No?

200
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:45,958
[Ple] What's wrong?

201
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,541
It's too small. I don't like it.

202
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:53,333
Wear it for now. I'll buy you a new one.

203
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,500
Where are you going?

204
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:21,291
I have a gathering tonight.
I'll be back late.

205
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,541
If someone knocks on the door,
don't open it.

206
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,166
[Ple] Remember how to use this phone?

207
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,291
Be a good girl and you can watch
cartoons all day tomorrow. Okay?

-My gosh.
-Hello.

213
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,750
-I didn't think you'd come.
-Why wouldn't I?

214
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:20,500
-You didn't bring your daughter?
-No, otherwise I can't gossip.

[all laughing]

216
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:25,625
-I'll get you water.
-Here. Order whatever you want.

217
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,125
It's okay. I have eaten.

218
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,541
I missed you guys so I wanted to chat.

219
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:30,500

-Me?

221
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,541
All good. I work at home.

222
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,583
My father-in-law's furniture shop.

223
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:38,958
What about you?

224
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,458
I work at home as a business owner.

225
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,666
-Yeah?
-Yes. A laundry service.

226
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,000
-Ow!
-[woman 2] Um.

227
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,458
Is it like Sin Chai Hua Laundry?

228
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,125
-Not that big.
-[woman 2] Great.

229
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:53,000
I'll use your service for my hubby's suits
as a way to support you.

230
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:56,875
Hell no, suits and brand-name clothes
are hard to launder.

231
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,458
Shirts are fine.

232
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,250
Umm.

[woman 3 mouthing]

234
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:11,250

just let us know, okay?

235
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,458
Umm.

236
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,666
It's all good.
I'm not in trouble or anything.

Paycheck to paycheck.

238
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,041
I'm struggling a bit. It's fine.

239
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:21,583
[woman 3] I see.

240
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:26,458
[woman 2] But if you can't go on with
your shop, you have other options.

241
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:27,500
[Lookchin] Yeah.

242
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,166
[woman 3] You can apply for
a full-time job with your degree.

243
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,416
Gosh.

244
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,250
How can I do a full-time job?

245
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,000
Who would look after Kaew?

246
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,416
[woman 3] How about this?

247
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,666
How about you send your daughter
to a boarding school?

248
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,833
Meanwhile, you save up money

249
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,166
and apply for jobs abroad.

250
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:48,166
Strawberry picking and whatnot aren't bad.

251
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,625
[woman 3] It's better than living here.
there's no future.

252
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,541
[Ple] Hey, that's enough.

253
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:54,875
Listen,

254
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:59,208
I'm here to hear about you guys,
not to talk about me.

255
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,833
All right, Madam Hong?

256
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,791
How is life in Sweden?

257
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,541
[woman 4] How about your husband?

258
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,500
Everything is expensive.

259
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,375
Damn expensive.

260
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,125
Just expensive.

261
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,541
[Hong] That's all, you know.

262

What would you say
if I sent you to a boarding school?

What is a boarding school, Mommy?

310
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:48,500
It's a school
where you study and sleep at night.

311
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,250
You'll live with me during school breaks.

I'll try to when I'm free.

You always say that,

00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:43,416
Thank you.

361
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
[man 1] At first, It's a gorgeous woman…

362
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:46,875
That's all I can pay now.

363
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:49,375
[man 2] So, it's a gorgeous woman.

364
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:51,916
Just for the interest?

365
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:57,083
I put some aside for Kaew's books.
Her school's starting soon.

366
00:24:57,833 --> 00:24:59,708
[sighs] Okay, fine.

367
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:01,375
Let's go with that.

368
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,500
[man 1] Then my motorcycle wheel…

00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,625
Hey, White Girl. Is my laundry ready?

370
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:10,291
The rain got them wet. Tomorrow, okay?

371
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,250
What?

372
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:13,041
Did it rain?

373
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:16,291
Hey. It hasn't rained a single drop.

374
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:18,125

376
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:22,625

00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:26,083
[indistinct chattering]

378
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:39,375
[woman] Doesn't she feel bad for the kid?

379
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:41,000
I won't calm down.

380
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:46,375
She sent her kid to an expensive school.
No wonder she can't pay the tuition.

381
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:48,333
Where is your mom?

382
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:51,125
Call her out here now.

383
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:53,250

-[Ple] Hey!

384
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:55,833

-What's going on?

386
00:25:57,708 --> 00:26:00,041
[woman] Well, it's good that you're here.

387
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,291
Sergeant, throw her in jail.

388
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:04,000
I didn't do anything wrong.

389
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:07,375
You pawned my gold necklace
at Thong's shop.

390
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:09,083
[Thong] Ple.

391
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:13,416
Give me back the money
so I can return the gold to her, okay?

392
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,541
Well? Are you still going to deny it?

393
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:18,125
Will you give it back?

394
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:19,875
[Kaew crying]

395
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,125
I…

396
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,000
I don't have the money.

397
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:32,041
[woman] Well,

398
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:34,208
if you can't repay me,

399
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:37,166
get ready to go to jail.

400
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:40,041
[Kaew] Where are you going, Mommy?

401
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:41,166
Ma'am,

402
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,583
I'll repay as soon as I can. I promise.

403
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:46,041
Can you all leave for now?

404
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:48,875
Please do it for my kid. I beg you.

405
00:26:48,958 --> 00:26:49,791
Please.

406
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,500
-[Ple] I beg you.
-[woman] Gosh, you're a thief.

407
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:55,625
How dare you still have the nerve to beg?

408
00:26:55,708 --> 00:27:00,291
You have two days to return my money

409
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:04,916
or else I'll drag you by your neck
and throw you in jail.

410
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,666
[Kaew] Mommy, what's wrong?

411
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:13,375
Mommy, where are you going?
Mommy, give me a kiss.

412
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:16,666
Mommy, please talk with me.

413
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:20,500

Where are we going?

420
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:38,666
-Go take a bath.
-[Kaew] You're hurting me.

421
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:41,875
Aren't you coming with me?

422
00:27:41,958 --> 00:27:44,125
-Why aren't you bathing?
-Stop asking.
