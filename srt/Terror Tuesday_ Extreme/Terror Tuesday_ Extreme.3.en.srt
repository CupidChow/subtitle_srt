I'll ask him for you.

192
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,833
And if that fails,
I will have our kids stay at my dad's

193
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,041
so Win can study for the pilot exam.

194

196
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,791
He wanna be a pilot like his dad?

197
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:03,666
I guess so.

198
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:14,666

214
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,750
[Win] Do you want some?

215
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:05,875
I cooked many packs.

216

[clattering]

218
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,416
[Linda] Why do you leave the TV on?
Are you crazy?

219
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,583
Just leave it on. I'm lonely.

220
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:46,833
[chill music playing]

221
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,666
You threw a party to attract the cops

222
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,791
'cause you knew
he'd bring the money home, right?

223
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,708
[Win] Well, he doesn't love me.

224
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,083
I'm not his son.

225
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,916
So, I got him into trouble.

226
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,583
I'm sorry, sis.

227
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,875
I'm not mad at you for that.

228
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,458
He deserved it.

229
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:41,416
But couldn't you wait til I went abroad?

230
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,125
[Win] So, if you had gone abroad,

231
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,000
you wouldn't have returned, right?

232
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:53,791
No.

233
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:55,791
You wanna live here?

234
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,166
Can't we

235
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:12,333
just move elsewhere for the time being?

236
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:19,166
[Linda] Where can we go?
This is serious shit.

237
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,208
Do you know
how lucky it is that we're still alive?

238

[tense music playing]

239
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:29,875
[Win] Um.

[Win sighs]

241
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,208
[Win] Oops.

[exhales sharply]

243
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,583
Pick it up.

244
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,541
[Win] I'll do it all at once. Anyway…

245
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:48,500
the other night,

246
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,666
I wasn't messing with you.

247
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,125
I'm full. Wash it for me, okay?

248
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,541

-What?
-[Win] The noodles have vanished.

253
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:30,041
They are gone.

254
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,000
[Linda] This is not funny.

255
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:35,583
[Win] I'm not joking. They're really gone.

258
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:43,333
-[Linda] You're such a prankster.
-[Win] I haven't picked them up.

259
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:46,500
Why would I try to trick you?

260
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,125
[eerie screaming]

261
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,750
You think that will keep the ghost away?

262
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:18,125
I don't know.

263
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:19,916
Better than nothing.

264
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,125
If I were a ghost, I'd laugh.

[house lizard crying]

266
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,958
Should I put more tape?

267
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:34,916
I'll try.

268
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,041
[Linda] Whatever. I'm going to bed.

You're awake.

Yes.

276
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,875
Go eat downstairs.

277
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,000
Okay.

279
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:45,958
Hey.

280
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,625
Get Lin to go down too, okay?

But no kimchi.

289
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:31,291
Remind me to buy some, okay?
We should keep some at home.

[Linda] What's with her?

299
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:40,041
[Win] Out of the blue,
she made us breakfast.

300
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:43,083
I've grown up on milk and cornflakes.

301
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:45,875
And I've never seen her
eat food off the floor.

302
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:52,750
Can I use your phone, sis?

303
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:56,125
You haven't got it back?

304
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:59,875
Not yet. I haven't contacted anyone
since that day.

305
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,833
Please.

306
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:06,125

WHAT ARE DOOR TALISMANS?
THEY ARE USED TO PREVENT GHOSTS.

311
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:27,416
TO SCARE A WIMP.

312
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,875
TO TRAP SPIRITS IN A ROOM.

313
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,125
What is it?

314
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:38,416
Some people died in that room, sis.

315
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,000
A family of four.

316
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:44,541
[Win] They said someone in the house
put poison into their sukiyaki pot.

317
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:46,375
[Linda] What an idiot.

318
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,583
Quit listening to Terror Tuesday.

319
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:50,125
Are you okay?

320
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:52,000
See it for yourself.

321
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:58,291
SOMEONE IN THE FAM
ADDED POISON TO THEIR SUKIYAKI

322
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:09,375

[Win exhales sharply]

324
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:13,541
Let's keep an eye on her for now.
Maybe she's fine.

325
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:16,416
-She's going senile.
-She's obviously possessed.

-Where are you going?
-[woman] To buy something.

329
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,833
Buy what? Can I tag along?

330
00:28:31,916 --> 00:28:35,000
I won't be long.
Just stay home. All right?

331
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:42,333
Oh, let's have sukiyaki this evening.

332
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:43,791
[woman] It's been a while.

333

339
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:11,416
It's not good?

340
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:21,625
Just a second.

341
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:25,541
[woman] The soup isn't tasty enough,
right?

342

[chopping]

343
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,125
[yelling] What are you doing?

00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:36,791
[clanking]

345
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,125
I'm cooking

346
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:40,875
as a good housewife.

347
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:48,583
I graduated with a degree
just to be abused by you all.

348
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:51,750
So, let me serve all of you.

349
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:52,875
[laughing]

350
00:30:57,416 --> 00:30:58,916
[woman] Don't be surprised.

351
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,416
I was never as sweet to you as that bitch.

352
00:31:01,916 --> 00:31:05,083
Call her and say
I'm being an asshole to you again.

353
00:31:07,791 --> 00:31:09,250
[woman] Vent your anger.

354
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:10,958
There's no need to pretend.

355
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:12,625
The kids already know.

-[knife clanking]
-Right?

357
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,541
Both this asshole
and I are having affairs.

358
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:23,250
You already know
you aren't his son, don't you?

359
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:24,166
[yelling] Sirin!

360
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:29,875
[Sirin] He got you arrested
because he hates you.

361
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:33,625
You're not respectable,
and you've never succeeded in anything.

362
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:35,208
And this slut.

363
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:37,291
When will you stop being selfish?

364
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:41,083
You hate your brother
because you have to share your wealth.

365
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:46,541
I could have easily
used my family's money to send you abroad,

366
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:49,458
but you didn't get to go
because of his huge ego!

[laughing loudly]

368
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:05,958
Come on, say something.
