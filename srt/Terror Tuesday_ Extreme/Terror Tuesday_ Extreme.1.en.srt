I deem it a good deed on my part.

But let me stress again
what you should and shouldn't do,

and what you can't ignore
or violate in any case.

Okay.

84
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,583

00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,375
[man 3] First,

86
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,625
you must feed this doll

[man 3] Second,

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,041
put the doll back in the box
before midnight.

Never miss that deadline.

[man 3] Lastly,

95
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:04,000
don't take the doll beyond the area
marked by the sacred string

96
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,541
because that will break the binding spell.

It's bad enough that I'm sick,

but my mom is even sicker than me.

150

Making her take her meds is so hard.

00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,541
She refuses to go to the doctor.

152
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,291
She won't even consider
talking to the doctor.

Now she's turned to dark magic.

Isn't she going too far?

00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:41,083
If I see the sorcerer again,
I'll chew him out for tricking my mom.

But what if his trick
actually makes your mom happy again?

I'll chew him out for tricking my mom.

people find different ways to heal, right?
