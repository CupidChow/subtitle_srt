[man 1] You got it.

00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:14,458
What do you think?

4
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:19,541
[man 2] Not now. Oh, shit!

5
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,666
[man 1] Let's forgive each other.

That's what I said.

21
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:14,416
I'll learn until I'm good enough
to make our wedding clothes. Sound good?

Yes. Hello.

31
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,416
Hello.

32
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,416
You've been here before, right?

33
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,583
Yes, I was here with Aoi briefly.

34
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,750
So, what did you tell Aoi?

35
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,041
I said I was going out of town.

36
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:03,416
That was brilliant.
I definitely chose the right person.

37
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,250
Milk, if you work for me and work hard,
it's good work and good pay here.

38
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,041
You will earn commission too.

39
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,125
-Let's see the workspace.
-Okay.

40
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,333
Let's go.

[footsteps ascending stairs]

00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:25,333
This area is like an old dress stockroom.

43
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:28,958
Any dress that's fixable,
please fix it for me, okay?

44
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,375
-Okay.
-Um.

45
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:35,041
[woman] There are tons of them.
Feel free to dig through.

46
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,166
Many of them are still usable.

00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,000
No one has used this room
since the last person moved out.

49
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,458
So, it's a bit dusty.

50
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,458
Please clean it up for me.

51
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,250
[woman] Let's check out upstairs.

[woman] This is the storage room.

56
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,208
It's a bit of a mess.

57
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:18,875
Let's move.

[music stops]

59
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:24,291
[woman] The lights on this floor are out.
They flicker. But don't be scared.

60
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:31,250
This floor is our photography room
with lots of different themes.

61
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:34,916
Impressive, isn't it?
Aoi's shop has nothing like this.

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
[chuckles]

63
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,583
Let's go.

[door opens and squeaking]

65
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,583
This is your bedroom.
Comfortable enough, right?

66
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,333
I'll get an AC for you.

67
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:51,041
I called the technician,
but he's still busy.

68
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:55,208
The bathroom is outside.
There's a water heater in there.

69
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,875
I've also got a washing machine for you.

70
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:02,083
You'll have this whole floor to yourself.

71
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,916
It'll be like your own penthouse.
[chuckles]

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,333

feel free to do so. [chuckles]

We're open from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.
and closed on Mondays.

77
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,083
You can open it a bit later

78
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,750
since most customers
come in the afternoon.

79
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:38,958
Got it.

80
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,833
I trust you'll take good care of my shop,

81
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,458
so I'm going to Phuket
for four to five days.

82
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,375
[woman] I already bought the package.

83
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,750
So, I must go before it expires.

84
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,208
But it's my first day…

85
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:57,000
Just do it like you did for Aoi.
Nothing complicated.

86
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:00,958
But if you run into any issues,
just give me a call anytime.

87
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,875
Okay.

[Milk] Hi, Mom. What are you up to?

105
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:04,208
[mom] Nothing. I'm about to go to bed.
What's up?

106
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,666
I'm at my new job now.

107
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,416
I get free accommodation,

108
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,916
and the salary is 50% more than
may last job.

109
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,875
So, I'll send you
an extra 3,000 baht this month, okay?

110
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,083
[mom] Sure. Work hard, okay?

111
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:22,083
Don't be a burden
so she'll keep you around.

112
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,583
[Milk] Yeah, I know.

113
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,125
[mom] All right, good.

114
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,458
[Milk] Okay, I'll get to work now.

115
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:29,958
-Bye.
-[mom] Milk.

116
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:34,458
Don't try on a wedding dress for fun
or else you'll be an old maid.

117
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,625
-Bank isn't exactly reliable.
-[milk] Okay.

118
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,875
[mom] Why don't you find a rich husband
like Nan, our neighbor?

119
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:44,208
She moved to America with her hubby.
She's set for life.

120
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,916
[Milk] Mom, please.

121
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,666
Bank is working hard.

122
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,083
[mom] Huh!. How much can he make
delivering food?

123
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:57,208
You're asking for such a high dowry.
Who can afford it?

124
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,958
[mom] If he can't make
a few hundred grand,

125
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,208
how will he be able to support you?

126
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,583
Nowadays, no one
relies on their hubby for support.

127
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:09,083
I earn a living.
Why would I need him to support me?

128
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,750
[mom] I don't care. I want the dowry.

130
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,416
Mom, you keep repeating this.

131
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,625
I don't get it. Why?

[music stops]

137
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,500
[Milk] How about something like this?

[chuckles]

139
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,583
No, not quite yet.

[hangers clanking]

141
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:48,083
[Milk] How about trying on this one?

[chuckles]

143
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,083
No.

144
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,875
This one suits you perfectly.

145
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:03,625
Really?

146
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:07,833
It's pretty good.

147
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,416
"Pretty good"

148
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,375
means not good.

149
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,041
[chuckles]

150
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,666
I think these dresses are a bit too basic.

151
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,041
Do you have more options?

152
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,791
[man] If there's nothing you like,
let's go to another shop.

153
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,875
Please wait a second.

154
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,208
I'll check upstairs for you.
Just one second.

[footsteps receding]

156
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,041
They can't be good.

157
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:39,125
Otherwise, they'd be down here on display.

158
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,708
Let's take a look first.

159
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,208
Hm.

160
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,375

[eerie music playing]

166
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,666
Miss, could you breathe in for me?

167
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,875
Okay.

168
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,250
One, two, three.

169
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,125
[Milk] Uh.

170
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,708
[woman] So, is it working?

171
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,125
Well,

172
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,666
I'm afraid not.

173
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,500
The zipper is broken.

174
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,583
It's broken?

175
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,083
Oh God, what do we do now?

176
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:03,083
I like this dress.
Can you fix the size for me?

177
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:04,625
Well…

178
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:10,125
Actually, it's possible.
But it might take a while.

179
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,166
How long?

180
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:16,083
It should take about three to four weeks.

181
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:19,791
-It has a lot of intricate details.

My wedding is coming up next week.

I understand that,
but increasing the size will take a while.

184
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,583
Can you speed it up? Please do it for me.

Well…

00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,458
I can't make a promise

187
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,916
because many parts will need fixing.

188
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Why don't you lose weight, you fat pig?
The dress is pretty as it is.

189
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:50,250
Yes?

And this employee…

193
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,458
What's your name?

194
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:03,875
-Your name?
-I'm Milk.

195
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:08,041
She's Milk.
She called a customer a fat pig.

196
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:12,833
She told me to lose weight
so she wouldn't have to fix the dress.

197
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,000
[woman] Can anyone stoop lower than this?

-I didn't say that.
-Oh, yeah?

199
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,333
Then who said it, huh?

200
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:22,083
Was I hearing things?
You're so full of shit.

201
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,250
Full to the brim, bitch!

202
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,958
I'm going to post this clip to shame you.

203
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:31,000
You and the shop

[Milk] I'm so sorry.
I don't know what happened.

208
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:48,208
I'll make sure the dress is fixed in time,
and I'll give you a discount.

209
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:51,083
I don't want to lose my job.
Please help me.

210
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:53,958
Fine.

211
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,416
In one week.

212
00:12:56,916 --> 00:13:00,000
Got it. I'll have it ready in one week.

213
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,833
You've promised, okay?

214

If you don't finish it in time,

the wedding and dowry.

It's hundreds of thousands.

but not this nonsense.

all these weddings

301
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,083
are for show and so fake.

I've seen those couples with big weddings.

303
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,958
Many of them ended up getting divorce.
[yelling] So, what's the point?

304
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:49,125
Just to wear those dumb wedding clothes
and pose for pictures in a fake ceremony.

00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:02,958
Why?

We agreed on increasing the size.

368

Why is it…

369
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,416
Did you make it smaller?

370
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:57,541
Well, I did increase the size,
but I don't know why it got smaller.

371

Nah.

If that pain means I get to look pretty,

517

get proposed to by a handsome guy,

I can do the same for myself, can't I?

I've told you not to mess with my stuff.

Why would you fix a perfect dress?

Tell your customers to lose weight.
