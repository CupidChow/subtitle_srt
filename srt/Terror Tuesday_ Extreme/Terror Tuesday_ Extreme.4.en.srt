[Ton] Hello.

[man 1] When did the story
you're about to tell occur?

13
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:53,333
[Ton] It occurred around 2014 - 2015.

14
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:57,625
And then, a series of incidents
followed in 2019.

Drowning? I was just chilling.

Shit.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,250
Why did you jump in if you can't swim?

25
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:29,333
I thought you were drowning
so I tried to save you.

Today

42
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,000

You scared me.

[woman 2] I thought it was something bad.

51
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,791
You want steamed squid, right?

52
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,625
At that lady's restaurant?

I'll go to the loo first.

Yes.

she'll surely curse at you.

Have you been here?

83
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,291
Do you know how to pray to her?

84
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,208
[woman 2] Oh.

85
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,500
We come here often. No worries.

86
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:52,333
We run a villa
on the Black Hills Beach which is nearby.

87
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,708
My boyfriend came here
to do a whole new project

88
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,541
[woman 2] so I came from Bangkok
to have a look.

89
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,208
-Um.
-[woman 2] And…

90
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,458
actually,

91
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:09,166
I'm sure I met him
because of my prayer to the Goddess.

92
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,291
-[laughs] Is that so?
-[woman 2 laughs]

93
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,916
How long has it been?

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,541
[woman 2] Oh, I think

95
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:16,916
it's been almost eight years.

96
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,166
It all started in college.

97
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,458
Now, we're almost in our thirties.

98
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,375

People these days

102
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,000
don't really know
the background of this place.

103
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,333
They come to worship
just for the sake of it.

104
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,250
[woman 3] Since you come here often,

105
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:45,083
do you know the true legend
of the Black Hills Goddess?

106
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,333
You may have heard

107
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:54,166
she was a fishmonger's daughter
who fell in love with a prince,

108
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:59,250
leading to a forbidden, cross-class love.

109
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,833
Obstructed by the elders,

110
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:05,291
she decided to end her life
to escape the pain.

111
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,291
It became a famous true love story,

112
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:12,333
which has inspired lovers to come here
and make prayers until today.

113
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,250
But actually,

114
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:15,958
that's not all.

115
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,458
The prince

116
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,708
actually had a betrothed.

117
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,916
[woman 3] After he had an affair
with the Goddess,

118
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,666
he dumped her.

119
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,250
But, of course,

120
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:33,500
the prince couldn't escape
the wrong he had committed.

121
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,083
[bells chiming]

122
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:39,166
The Goddess returned to the prince
and his betrothed at their house.

123
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,750
She conjured a rainstorm

124
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,666
and used it to slash him down to the bone
like a knife.

125
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,916
[man crying in pain]

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,041
All the secrets
he had hidden from her were unveiled.

00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,125
Have you ever seen fish getting scored?

128
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,333
[woman 3] Long cuts on their skin?

129
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,291
Both got scored to death.

130
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:02,333
-[bells chiming]
-That is the true identity of the Goddess.

131
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:07,291
She is the Goddess who believes
love is a matter of life and death.

132
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,416
Sometimes she uses her power

133
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,041
to make lovers
see each other's true colors.

134
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:17,041
Think carefully before making your wishes.

135
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:20,916
Otherwise, you might see
what you don't want to see.

136

[chuckles]

137
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,208
But you already know that.

138
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,208
[woman 3] You should go
and worship her now.

in front of you, Black Hills Goddess,

142
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,458
that we'll remain steadfast in our love

143
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,000
and faithful to each other.

144
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:49,208
We will not keep any problems we may have

145
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,458
from each other.

146
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,375
May the Goddess

147
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,500
help both of us

148
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:01,458

00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,500
I love what Nat did a lot, Dao.

184
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,666
[Dao's dad] You never disappoint me, Nat.

185
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:44,416
We're ready to build
a new resort in Phuket.

186
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,000
Nat, I'll have you oversee the design
from start to finish.

187
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,791
We'll discuss the details soon, okay?

188
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,500
I have to tend to my business now.
Talk later.

189
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,625
[Dao] Bye-bye, Dad.

191
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:23,583
[Dao] Hey, babe.

192
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,041
It's on this day,

193
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,291
their wedding anniversary here.

194
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:34,625
Gosh, it has already been two years. Um.

195
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,791
[Dao] When we were fresh out of college,

196
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,291
whenever people got married,

197
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:43,958
I'd feel like

198
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,375
it was so darn soon.

199
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,833
[Dao] What was all the darn rush?

200
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,500
[chuckles]

201
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,125
Like they were afraid
to lose their partner.

202
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,041
-Babe.
-[Dao] Babe.

203
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,083
Let's stay together forever.

[suspenseful music playing]

205
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,250
[Dao] Let's run the resort together

206
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,875
until we're old, okay?

207
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,041
Love you.

208
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,916
What were you about to say?

209
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,208
It can wait.

and shut the doors before coming upstairs.

Last year, I sent my portfolio

Would you let it go?

But we're running this resort together.

306

You asked me this morning
what I was praying for.

315
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,000
I prayed

316
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,125
that I would finally know

No.

what did you tell your friends?

Can you repeat it to him?

Do you know…

why I haven't met with you much lately?

00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:40,250
Lately,

354
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:44,958
I've been feeling suffocated.

I don't know why.

I just want us
to be able to talk like we used to.

After getting married…

360
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,208
do you love each other more?

361
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,750
[Dao] If it can help us
open up to each other more,

362
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:21,250
then we must get married, right?

363
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,250
It's better than
not having him in my life.

00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:51,250
Nat.

371
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:52,708
Stop.

372
00:25:54,416 --> 00:25:57,250
Nat! I just didn't want you to leave.

373
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:00,166
[somber music continues]

374
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:03,833
[Dao crying]

375
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:09,125
[Dao sobbing]

376
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:13,666
[Dao] Babe.

377
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:18,708
Can we go back to the way we were?

378
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:22,958
I have nothing else to hide.

379
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:28,875
I have revealed it all.

380
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:34,250
[Nat] Revealed it all…

381
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:36,833
like this?

382
00:26:36,916 --> 00:26:39,250
-[horror music playing]
-[skin tearing]

383
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:40,375
[Dao crying in awe]

384
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:41,291
[Dao] Nat!

385
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:42,625
Nat!

386
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:45,958
Go away!

387
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,708
Go away!

388
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:49,375
Go away!

389
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:52,333
[music fades down]

390
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:00,958
[Dao] Dad.

391
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:08,500
What else do you two have to tell me?

392
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:09,958
[eerie music playing]

393
00:27:12,791 --> 00:27:14,333
[bells chiming]

394
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:16,125
Let's start with you, Dao.

395
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:18,458
Can you just stop?

396
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,500
No more.

397
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:21,708
[bones clacking]

398
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:26,000
If you can't think of anything,
you can start with Nat's job.

399
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:30,916
[chuckles]

400
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:34,958
[chuckles]

401
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:37,666
[chuckles]

402
00:27:38,416 --> 00:27:39,458
[music stops]

403
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:40,416
Dad.

404
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:43,500
What did the doctor say?

405
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:46,750
Oh, he said
the condition of my liver is stable.

406
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,625
Pending chemo test results.

407
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:51,291
[Dao's dad] Right.

408
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:54,125
You said you needed to talk with me.

409
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:57,666
[Dao] Well, the new position
that you are recruiting,

410
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,291
do you have anyone in mind?

411
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:04,625
Nat has been applying for jobs,
but hasn't got any offers.

412
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:05,541
Why don't you

413
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:07,541
talk to him first?

414
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,833
I can't do that.

415
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:14,000
If he finds out I get this job for him,

416
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,166
he won't like it, Dad.

417
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,000
I've talked to someone else.

418
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:20,333
Well…

419
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:24,208
shall we let him work at our resort?

420
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:28,833
So he won't be stressed out anymore.

421
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,541
[eerie music playing]

422
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,833
I feel sorry for him.

423
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:45,041
I was just worried about you back then.

424
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,958
[Dao] Can you understand that?

425
00:28:50,416 --> 00:28:51,416
[hands tapping]

426
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:55,916
[Nat] Are you saying I'm where I am today

427
00:28:57,708 --> 00:28:59,791
because you pitied me?

428
00:29:00,666 --> 00:29:04,750
Your dad had talked to me
even before you asked him that.

429
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:06,833
Am I right,

430
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,208
Dad?

431
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:12,291
[bells chiming]

432
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:15,166
[Nat] What did you say to me again?

433
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,833
Oh, right.

434
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:23,166
"Do you remember
when I began to fall ill?"

435
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:26,166
[Nat] "If something bad happens to me,

436
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,666
how will Dao survive?"

437
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:31,708
"But I know…

438
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:37,333
that you have applied for a job
in Sweden."

439
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:39,708
[Nat] "But can you

440
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:42,583
stay with Dao

441
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:45,166
for my sake

442
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,958
for the time being?"

443
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:51,000
[music swells]

444
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,333
[thunder rumbling]

445
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:03,166
[Nat] I've never gotten to go anywhere
because of you. You should know that.

446
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:06,208
Well, back then, you told me that…

447
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:08,458
[rain pouring]

448
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:09,875
they turned you down.

449
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:11,375
What should I have said?

450
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,958
Did you expect me to say
I gave up on my dream for you?

451
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:18,833
[Nat] And what happened?

452
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:21,041
Your dad recovered from his illness,

453
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:25,000
and I had already taken on
the whole project.

454
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:28,916
I applied for the job abroad

455
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:33,625
[yelling] because it was my last chance
to escape the life trapped with you!

456
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:39,833
[breathes heavily]

457
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:41,916
[sobbing]

458
00:30:43,916 --> 00:30:45,458
[thunder rumbling]

459
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:52,125
How…

460
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,625
How could I let things come this far?

461
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:59,333
[eerie music playing]

462
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:03,041
You know what?

463
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:09,125
You are not even the right one for me.

464
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:12,250
[Dao] That day,

465
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:14,958
I just needed someone.

466
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,375
[shakily] Anyone.

467
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:20,791
[thunder rumbling]

468
00:31:23,416 --> 00:31:24,750
The next thing I knew…

469
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:30,875
I got my life all tangled up with you.

470
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
[thunder rumbling]

471
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:43,708
[sighs]

472
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:46,916
[bells chiming]

473
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:51,666
But wasn't it you who prayed for him
to be stuck here with you?

474
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:56,458
-[breathes deeply]
-[music swells]

475
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,625
[Nat] What did you pray for?

476
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:01,083
Say it!

477
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:03,166
-[thunder rumbling]
-[Dao panting]

478
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,875
-[slashing]
-[Dao crying in pain]

479
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:06,000
Say it, Dao.

480
00:32:06,666 --> 00:32:07,750
[Nat] Say it!

481
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:09,375
[Dao crying]

482
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:11,625
[yelling] Say it!

483
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,000
Say it, Dao!

484
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:15,500
Say it!

485
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:17,583
[thunder rumbling]

486
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:26,500
[thunder rumbling]

487
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:29,958
[sobbing] When we started dating,

488
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:32,791
I prayed for one thing.

489
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,666
I asked the Goddess…

490
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:39,500
to do anything

491
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:42,958
to keep you with me forever.

492
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:45,000
[sobbing]

493
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:46,708
Anything at all.

494
00:32:46,791 --> 00:32:48,625
But I should've known better.

495
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:51,041
I didn't know it'd mean everything,

496
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:53,500
including your desire to study abroad

497
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:56,041
[Dao] and work in Sweden.

498
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:59,708
Without me in those plans,
everything just failed.

499
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:01,291
I recently realized that.

500
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:03,375
[eerie music continues]

501
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:04,916
[Dao] I'm sorry.

502
00:33:05,958 --> 00:33:07,125
[thunder rumbling]

503
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:10,666
I just didn't want you to leave--

504
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,083
[Nat] Why did you do that?

505
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:14,416
Why are you so selfish?

506
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:16,416
[yelling] Answer me!

507
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:18,041
[Dao] Nat!

508
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:19,041
Nat, don't!

509
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:22,000
[Nat] Give me back those eight years!

510
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,833
Why did you do that? Tell me!

511
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:26,083
Why did you do it?

512
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:27,583
Tell me, Dao.

513
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:29,958
Tell me! Why did you do it?

514
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:32,083
[Dao] Nat!

515
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:33,041
No!

516
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,125
[water splashing]

517
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:36,500
[bells chiming]

518
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:37,791
[Dao] Tell me.

519
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:39,250
[eerie music continues]

520
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:43,291
[bells chiming]

521
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:49,791
[Dao] Just now…

522
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:51,208
[bells chiming]

523
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,791
why were you facing down?

524
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:12,208
[music stops]

525
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:13,791
[Nat breathes heavily]

526
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:19,375
Why did you jump in if you can't swim?

527
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:22,666
I thought you were drowning
so I tried to save you.

528
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,708
[Dao] Damn, I got wet for nothing.

529
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:26,708
So, you have nothing else to do?

530
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:29,458
No, I'm on patrol.

531
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:31,416
[Dao] This is my family's resort.

532
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:35,250
You own this place?

533
00:34:36,166 --> 00:34:37,541
Yes, why?

534
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:40,750
Damn.

535
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:42,583
That's so cool.

536
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,500
Tell me.

537
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:48,958
Just now,

538
00:34:50,666 --> 00:34:52,291
why were you facing down?

539
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:54,791
Why? Thought you were in MV?

540
00:34:57,708 --> 00:34:59,125
I'm heartbroken.

541
00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:02,625
Are you keen to share?

542
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:10,625
She was my first girlfriend.

543
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:16,333
We'd been together since ninth grade,
and I'd always thought she'd be my last.

544
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,500
She was the one.

545
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:20,291
Definitely her.

546
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:21,416
[chuckles]

547
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:25,541
-[Nat] But she didn't feel the same way.
-Um.

548
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,583
And she got to know Best because of me.

549
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:33,416
And then my friend and my ex
left together.

550
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:37,791
[Nat] That's why I was in the pool
all by myself

551
00:35:38,541 --> 00:35:40,250
until you jumped in just now.

552
00:35:43,666 --> 00:35:44,625
Damn!

553
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:47,958
That freaking hurts.

554
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:52,708
[Dao] I can't believe
that happened in our faculty.

555
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:55,583
Actually…

556
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:03,083
I barely know what's going on there.

557
00:36:04,458 --> 00:36:06,000
[somber music playing]

558
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:07,666
[Dao] I'm just…

559
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:11,416
someone whose family owns a resort

560
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:14,208
for them to hold freshmen parties.

561
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,500
I want to know…

562
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,416
how those people

563
00:36:23,291 --> 00:36:24,833
who have a lot of friends…

564
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:28,750
feel about it.

565
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:34,375
[Dao] Actually,
I want to have friends too.

566
00:36:37,041 --> 00:36:39,041
I want to have someone to talk to.

567
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:44,375
Someone to share with.

568
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:50,416
But well,

569
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,125
I can be alone. No biggie.

570
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:58,666
Maybe it's not about the number.

571
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:04,166
If you have someone who stays with you,

572
00:37:05,541 --> 00:37:07,750
listens to you, understands you,

573
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,375
and grows with you,

574
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:12,958
that should be good enough.

575
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:55,041
[music stops]

576
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:56,833
[Nat sobbing]

577
00:37:58,291 --> 00:38:00,291
[waves swashing]

578
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:04,125
[Nat sobbing]

579
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:07,791
[waves swashing]

580
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:10,666
[Nat crying and sobbing]

581
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:23,208
[somber music playing]

582
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:28,166
[Nat crying]

583
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:36,958
[Nat crying and sobbing]

584
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,666
[car door opens]

585
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:45,333
[bells chiming]

586
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:22,958
[Dao] We'll figure it out, okay?

587
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:29,583
[chill music playing]

588
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:39,708
[car engine starts]

589
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:52,083
[man 1] Wow! The Goddess is really sacred.

590
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:56,250
Nat and Dao, if you are tuning in
to our show, you can give us a call.

591
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:59,833
And those who plan to pray
at the shrine of Black Hills,

592
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:02,083
please talk it out first

593
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:05,625
to avoid an unwelcomed visit
from the Goddess.

594
00:41:11,291 --> 00:41:12,666
[bells chiming]

595
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:15,875
[eerie music playing]

596
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,500
[somber music playing]

597
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:33,125
[horror music playing]
