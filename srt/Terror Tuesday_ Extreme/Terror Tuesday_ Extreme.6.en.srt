I think luck's on my side.

60

There's a nice thing to see
even in this shitty apartment.

61
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,625
You quit your job to trade,
so you can't just rely on luck.

62
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:49,958
What luck? I'd studied this stuff
for a year before quitting.

63
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:55,041
You could actually keep your job
and trade on the side.

Fuck! What's up?

187
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,375
[Kie] What the hell?
Why did you curse at me?

188
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,291
-Were you in bed?
-No, what's up?

189
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,625
[Kie] Your shoe bag is still in my car.
I forgot it.

190
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,208
Shit, Kie.

191
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,125
Damn, can't this wait?

192
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,000
[Kie] Why are you whispering?

193
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:10,208
The girl is messing with me.
She banged on the door just now.

194
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:13,250
[Kie] What? Why is she suddenly
giving you trouble?

195
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,500
What did you do?

196
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,625
No, but I saw them fucking.

197
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:17,625
[Kie] What?

198
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,958
What were you doing?

199
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,458
They were fighting so loud,
so I took a peek.

200
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,791
And I saw them doing it hard.

201
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,208
[Kie] Shit, they're into rough play too.

202
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,166
He must be sadistic. And what did you do?

203
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,708
I turned off the lights
to make the room appear empty.

204
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,208
[Kie] You followed the rules to a tee.

205
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,833
And you said nonsense.
How about now, bro?

206
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,000
Just shut up. I'm hanging up.

207
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,583
Shit.

Hello.

231
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,166
Someone's locked up next door.

232
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:24,875
-[guard] Which room?
-406.

233
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,875
-[guard] And your room is…
-407.

234
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,583
407… 7.

235
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,250
What's the issue?

236
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,333
Someone's locked up next door.

237
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,708
-In your room?
-Room 406.

238
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,041
No one lives in that room.

239
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,000
Can you go check?
Someone is locked up in there.

240
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:49,041
The owner of that room
moved out years ago.

241
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,791
No one is living in there.

Hello, bro.

258

[Kie] Yeah. Hey, Bird.

259
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,416
I'm passing by your place.
Do you want your shoes?

260
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,333
Well…

261
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,166
That can wait, bro. I'm…

262
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,416
I'm running an errand.

263
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,958
[Kie] Dude, are you all right?

264
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,083
You sound weird.

265
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:33,750
I...

266
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,250
Hang on a sec.

[shutter clicking]

268
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,166
[Bird] Did you see the picture I sent?

269
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,375
[Kie] Damn, it's creepy.

270
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,500
Is it the note you told me about?

271
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:56,458
Yeah.

272
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,708
I think something's fishy next door.

273
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,708
[Kie] What? Why?

274
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,625
A girl got locked up in there.

275
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,875
[Kie] Wait. Damn.

276
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,291
I'm serious.

277
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,333
I went to tell the guard,
but he kept his mouth shut.

278
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,125
[Kie] Should we report it to the police?

279
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:16,916
Let's not do that.

280
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I can get in trouble
if it becomes a big deal.

281
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,416
[Bird] I don't want trouble.

282
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,000
[Kie] The room next door
must have an owner then.

283
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,708
-Do you want me to help find out?
-[Bird] Good idea.

284
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,708
I plan to work outside tonight
before midnight.

285
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,208
[Kie] Okay. Sounds good.

[Bird] Hello.

298
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,041
What the fuck? I'm leaving.
Why are you calling?

299
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,000
[Kie] You're a fucking bastard.

300
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,416
Why don't you be straight with me?

301
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,375
Hold on. Kie, calm down. What's going on?

302
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:06,500
[Kie] I wouldn't have known
if I hadn't talked with you mom.

303
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:11,083
Calm down, bro.

304
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,583
[Kie] Calm down, my ass.

305
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:16,791
You got fired
because you were a drug addict.

306
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:19,625
What have you been blowing my money on?

307
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:22,833
The girl story must be
a drugged-up hallucination.

308
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,250
[yelling] Hallucination, my ass!

309
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:28,916
What hallucination?
Didn't you see the note I sent?

310
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,250
[Kie] Did you write it yourself, dumbass?

311
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,833
I'm so damn disappointed in you.

312
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:39,458
Shit, Kie. Listen to me.

313
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:42,541
I know what hallucination is
and what reality is.

314
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:45,166
[yelling] If you don't want to help,
fuck off!

315
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,916
[Kie] You're still talking tough?

316
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,208
I'll meet the owner of that room tomorrow.
We'll know the real story.

317

[Sakda] Oh, hello.

373
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:15,000
-Are you Kie?
-Yes. Are you Sakda?

374
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:16,541
[Sakda] Yes. Let's go to the room.

[eerie music playing]

386
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:35,708
[Kie] Well, I'm actually
not looking to rent your room.

387
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:43,833
Do you know about
the rules after midnight?

388
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:45,833
[Sakda] Why are you asking?

389
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:47,916
How did you find out?

390
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,500
Please stay calm.

391
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:52,541
My friend's been having issues
with your room.

392
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,875
Just tell me if there's anything.

393
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:57,958
But if there's nothing,
then both sides can be at ease.

394
00:29:58,041 --> 00:30:00,291
The issue isn't with my room.

395
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:02,208
It's your friend's room.

396
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:13,166
[Sakda] I used to live there with my wife.

-[Sakda] Calm down.

403
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:03,166

[door creaking]

405
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:27,541
Honey, I left something in the room.

406
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:29,666
You go first. I'll be right down.

407
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:43,208
IF YOU HEAR SOMETHING…

408
00:31:43,291 --> 00:31:44,375
Open the door!

417
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:02,375

[woman] Open the door!

422
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:17,208
[Sakda] Even though I promised Jane
I'd get a divorce,

423
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:19,916
I chose my wife in the end.

424
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:23,250
The next morning, we moved out.

425
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:25,000
Jane didn't even know.

426
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:33,791
Um. What about the girl in Room 407?

427
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,333
Not long after that,

428
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:42,000
I heard that Jane
killed herself by jumping off the balcony.
