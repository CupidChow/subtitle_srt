He hasn't come to school.

54
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:50,791
[Arisa] I haven't seen Nik
since last year's final exam.

00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:54,375
-[teacher] Is that so?
-He was high and got killed by a car.

56
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:58,041
[boy 1] Really? Did you make it up?
Where did you hear that?

57
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,541
[boy 2] You don't believe me?

58
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,875
[sighs] Hear me out.

59
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,708

00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,541
the teachers on caretaker duty at night

61
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,458
that walked past our classroom

62
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:16,666
would always see Nik here studying.

63
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:23,500
He would sit at his desk
unmoved until morning.

64
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,500
-[tense music playing]
-[boy 2] But who knows,

00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:27,541
right now,

66
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,916
he may be sitting here with us.

Come on, miss.

71
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,708

-[suspenseful music playing]

73
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,291
[boy 2] You're all scaredy-cats.

74
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,375
Hey, about him sleeping…

75
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,000
-Gosh, it's freaking cool.
-[boy 1] Yes.

[bell ringing]

78
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:01,750
He often misses school,
so his absence is normal, my dear.

79
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:06,750
[teacher] Has anyone
tried to look for him at home?

80
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:08,875
[sighs]

81
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,291
No one wants to.

82
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:15,250
People around here know that
everyone in that family has a problem.

83
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,416
-[teacher] What do you mean?
-His dad used to attend our school.

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,166
[woman 1] He was an alcoholic
and a junkie.

85
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,166
He knocked up a woman, so he dropped out.

86
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,666
His grandma isn't any better.
Everyone avoids her.

87
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,208
She's weird.

88
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,083
His family doesn't even care,

89
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,916
[woman 2] so just let him be.

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,750
Don't waste your time and energy on him.

91
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:42,291
I'm just worried
that he won't be eligible to take exams.

92
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:44,333
Um.

93
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,291
Then get him back to school.

94
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,958
That'll help you get instated.

95
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,250
-[woman 1] Is it good?
-Yes.

96
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,250
-Very good.
-Nice.

97
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,166
Oh.

98
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,375
Join us. I forgot about you.

[clattering]

122
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,875
So, what's going on with Nik?

123
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:31,416
[sighs]

124
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,375
He ran away.

125
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,666
He got addicted to drugs.

126
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,375
We didn't give him money,

127
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,750
[bird chirping]

128
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,083
so he hurt her.

129
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,583
Besides, he stole stuff in our house

130
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,208
and left with his junky friends.

131
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,708
[woman] I didn't raise him well.

132
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:55,375
[sighs] That's why he's an ungrateful kid.

133
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,166
[inhales deeply]

134
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,750

almost popped out.

A row of my teeth broke.

137
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,750
[woman] But I got good medicine,

138
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,166
so I recovered quickly.

139
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,625
Have a look.

140
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:14,500
[flies buzzing]

141
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,458
[teacher] Have you reported it
to the police?

142
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,000
[sighs]

143
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,291
[man] I did long ago,

144
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,166
but no progress.

145
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,458
[sighs]

146
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,458
[woman] We probably have to let Nik go.

147
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,708
Whether he lives or dies,

148
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,250

OIL: WAIT, I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS ONE.

157
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,375
[woman] Write a report
after you've patrolled.

158

If there are any problems,
either call me or the janitor.

[Oil] Yes, I am.

165
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,458
You've been like this since this morning.

166
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,166
Didn't you learn from college

167
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:46,583
that if you don't behave,
you can't be a good government teacher?

168

[man 1] I don't know how Kwan came.

173
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:08,000
But when I turned
to put things away in the cabinet,

174
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,625
I saw something like…

175
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:14,583
There was something like blood
inside the cabinet.

176
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,791
-[man 2] Okay.
-[man 1] It looked like a cabinet…

Hi, Mom.

[mom] How's work?

180
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,833
[Oil] You only ask about work.
How about me?

181
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,083
[mom] It's the same thing, Oil.

182
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,583
You've been busy? You haven't called me.

183
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:32,708
[Oil] I've been busy.

184
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:36,708
I have tons of homework to check
and then do a report. [grunting]

185
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:41,041
Then I have to patrol the building.
There's no budget to hire a guard.

186
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,916
I'm sick of this. It's tiring.

187
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,541
[mom] Kids nowadays always complain.

188
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:49,583
I worked much harder than you,
but I didn't say a word.

189
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:53,625
Bear with it, work hard,
and you'll become a civil servant.

190
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,250
Do it for me and your dad.

191
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,333
[Oil] Okay.

192
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,291
What if I can't make it?

193
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,875
[mom] Of course you'll make it.

194
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,541
Being a teacher is a piece of cake.

195
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,375
You just memorize stuff
and teach the kids.

196
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,333
If you can't do it,
then reconsider yourself.

197
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:10,250
[Oil] Yes?

198
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:11,625
What was it?

199
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:14,791
I can't hear you, Mom.
The signal is bad. Talk later.

200
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,125
[sighs]

201
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,250

211
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,166
-[Gon] Hello.
-Gon.

212
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,041
Are you coming?

213
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,666
Oh.

214
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,541
My wife got hit by a car.

215
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,958
-[man] Hit it, guys.
-What?

216
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,041
[Gon] Wait a sec.

217
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:24,583
I gotta go.

218
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:25,958
I'm in Chonburi.

219
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:27,291
Hey.

220
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,458

224
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,000

[wood floor creaking]

227
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,291
[boy 2] The teachers

228
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,375
that walked past our classroom

229
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,833
would always see Nik here studying.

230
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,166
[woman] He hit me in the eye socket

231
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,875
until my eyeball almost popped out.

239
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,875
[yelling] Don't come near…

240
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,375
Quiet, please.

241
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,000
It's me, Nik.

242
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,666
-What? Nik?
-[Nik] Yes.

243
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,375
I'm Nik, Pongsakorn Kongsil.

Number 15.

245
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:21,250
I heard you
when you visited my house today.

246
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,666
[thrilling music continues]

247
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:29,500
Your family said
you'd left with your junky friends.

248
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:32,333
-No.
-[Oil] Are you here to steal stuff?

249
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,083
[Nik] No, miss.

250
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,125
My dad and grandma want to kill me.

251
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,708
-What?
-[Nik] Don't tell them I'm here

252
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,375
or I'll die.

253
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,375
[wood knocking repeatedly]

254
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,208
-Miss…
-Don't touch me!

255
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,666
They are here.

256
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,208
Please help me, miss.

[man] Nik.

267

Don't bother her.

268
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:21,916
[Nik] No.

269
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,958
No, miss.

270
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:28,458
I will send Nik to serve Lord Buddha
in the Tavatimsa Heaven.

271
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:32,458
[woman] An ungrateful kid like him
needs to learn a lesson.

272
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,333
Hand him over

273
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:38,541
and you will get everything you want.
[laughing]

274
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,916
You'll be rich if you wish,
be cured if you're sick.

275
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:48,458
The deities have bestowed
their blessings upon you.

276
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:49,958
[evil laughing]

277
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,625
Ma'am, please calm down.

Come here, Nik.

279
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,125

Criminals have broken into our school.

We are being attacked.

[police] Gosh, that's far.
Can you hide for now?

315
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,125
We are hiding. Come quickly.

316

There are no officers here.

317

-They serve the higher-ups now.
-What?

318
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:31,083
You fucking cop. I'm being hunted down.

[police] Fine, go on and insult me.

320

Nik, be quiet. Listen to me.

[Nik] That hermit is not human.

349
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:07,500
He bragged that
he was the rebirth of an arahant.

350
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,208
He tricked people into buying drugs

351
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,375

-It's too much, Mom.
-No, it's not. Drink it.

358
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:49,291
He tricked my grandma
into getting him more buyers

359
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,458
as she believed
she'd get merit from guiding them.

360

372

Drink it.

373
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,791

You bastard!

377
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,583
I said drink it! Drink it!

378
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,625
Get up! Get the hell up!

379
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,041
Open your mouth!

380
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,291

382
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:50,000
-[NIk] I'd been tortured for months.
-Drink it.

383
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,500
I had hallucinations nightly
due to the drugs,

384
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,250
but I never thought of hurting them.

385

[music stops]

400
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,750
When you went to my house,

401
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:21,083
I was happy that someone still cared.

402
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,500
[Nik] So, I tried to come here…

403
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,750
because you're the only one
who can help me.

406
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,000
Okay.

407
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:55,666
I don't know how much I can help,
but I will try my best.

408
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,750
Okay?

409
00:22:58,291 --> 00:22:59,291
Okay.

-Okay. Wait for me here.

413
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:18,458
-Okay.

418
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:36,500
[Oil] Nik ran away.

419
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,250
You guys should leave.

420
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,708
He couldn't have gone too far.

[sniffing]

422
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,666
[woman] It still smells foul here.

423
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:49,875
[Num] You'd better tell us where he is.

424
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,375
I said he ran away.

425
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:53,791
Don't you understand?

426
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:57,208
Just tell us so the deities forgive you.

427
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:58,916
Please listen.

428
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:02,750
The deities you are seeing aren't real.

429
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:05,833
[Oil] They are hallucinations
induced by the drugs.

430
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:10,541
-Are you dissing the drugs of Lord Buddha?
-[Oil] No, I'm not.

431
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:12,708
Think carefully.

432
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:17,166
How could you see deities
by worshiping dead and rotten things?

433
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:21,000
[Oil] And Nik is your family.
Why are you hurting him? Right?

434
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,375
[woman] Why can't we?

435
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:28,291
Even Vessantara
gave his wife and children to Jujaka.

436
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:31,541
[yelling] How can you not know
as a teacher?

437
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:33,208
[yelling] Num!

438
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:36,000
I'm going to prove

439
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:39,166
that deities are real!

440
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:41,916
Please calm down, sir.

Drink it!

459
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:27,458

You'll never be a civil servant.

going to live?

Hey, Mom! Why did you throw it away?

554
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:56,375
It can be reattached.

Do you know why I cut your dick off?

576
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,000
[Oil] Because you're a prick.

577
00:34:51,541 --> 00:34:53,875
If you can't take responsibility,

578
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:57,625
don't go bareback
so others won't be bothered.

579

Lord Buddha, please help me.

598
00:35:53,791 --> 00:35:55,041
Lord Buddha…

-[boy 1] Is it?
-[boy 3] What is it?
