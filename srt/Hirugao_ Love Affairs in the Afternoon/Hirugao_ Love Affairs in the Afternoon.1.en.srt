00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,210
Welcome home!

4
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,590
- Mama...
- Yes?

5
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,110
I heard that yesterday's fire was an arson.

6
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,020
Arson?

7
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,430
Have they caught the culprit yet?

8
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,730
No, not yet.

9
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,890
All the residents were okay, but the building burned down.

10
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,240
They finally built that house and it burned down, it's a shame.

11
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,140
Speaking of houses, someone finally moved in.

12
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,080
What? Oh, in the new house?

13
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,880
Yeah, it's a couple with two kids.
They seem like an average family.

14
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,520
How nice to live in a new house.

15
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,630
Oh no, it's this late already!

16
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,780
Hamusuke, Hamumi, it's time to go.

17
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,640
I needed to stop by the showroom this morning.

18
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,240
Papa's off to work now.

19
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,620
Papa, I'm coming with you.

20
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,830
I'm counting on you, they're coming at 6PM.

21
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,210
Papa...

22
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,050
I'm sorry, but would you mind making dinner?
Anything is fine.

23
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,130
Meat stew, fish, salad, miso soup, or whatever is fine.

24
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,890
- That's going to take forever...
- Mama,

25
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,020
Your shoelace is loose again.

26
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,110
Ah, sorry! Mama, I'm leaving first.

27
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,440
Eh?

28
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,990
<i>Truth is, I don't want to be called "Mama".</i>

29
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:53,730
<i>My husband calls me that even though I'm childless
to make me happy.</i>

30
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,070
<i>He's not intentionally trying to hurt me.</i>

31
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,980
<i>I can't say it out loud, but...</i>

32
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,140
<i>If the house that burnt down was mine,</i>

33
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,880
<i>I probably wouldn't be that sad.</i>

34
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,480
<i>Crying's for things that are important,</i>

35
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,390
<i>And I don't feel that way about the house.</i>

36
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,400
<i>I know it's unfeeling of me.</i>

37
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,300
<i>But it can take care of everything that had piled up
because I couldn't throw them away.</i>

38
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,380
Sorry, sorry.

39
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,780
Here's your change of 695 yen. Have a nice day.

40
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,390
Welcome.

41
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,060
Do you have cold ones?

42
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,460
Umm, this one can only be at normal temperature.

43
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,360
I see. All right, that's everything then.

44
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,440
Last night's fire was quite a shocker.

45
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,300
You just moved in, right?

46
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,800
My house is right across the bridge.

47
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,260
Arson is an unforgivable act, don't you agree?
I hope the police would hurry up and catchー

48
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,630
How much is it?

49
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,360
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,640
That'll be 5,706 yen.

51
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,700
I'll swipe your card for you.

52
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,630
- Thank you very much.
- Thanks.
- Thank you very much!

53
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,800
That was kind of uncomfortable.

54
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,700
Really? She's very pretty.

55
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,920
Life is unfair, huh?

56
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,300
I want to quit this 890 yen/hour part-time job,

57
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,500
and be able to ask,

58
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,140
"How much is it?"

59
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,000
Stop chatting. Have you finished counting the bills?

60
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,500
Yes, we're almost done, Manager.

61
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,480
Ms. Sasamoto, you work till 3PM, right?

62
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,900
Yes.

63
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,010
If you stay too long, I'll take away your time card.

64
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,990
They're about to start the pork-rib time sale.

65
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,080
- Shampoo
- Bought  it.

66
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,930
- Tissue.
- Bought it.

67
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,010
- Toilet paper.
- Bought it.

68
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:38,230
- Dishwashing detergent.
- Not yet.

69
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,530
- Satoshi, I'm coming!
- Oh no!

70
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,110
It's dangerous.

71
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,450
Be carefuー! Jeez...

72
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,830
Thief!

73
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,840
Excuse us.

74
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,510
- I told you I didn't do it!
- Wait, wait.

75
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,440
Stop it!

76
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,960
It's the police! The police!

77
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,100
Hey, Rikako! Rikako!

78
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,240
The car.... The kid did it!

79
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,400
What's going on? You don't need to be so loud.

80
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,260
Hey, whatー?

81
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,520
What's your name? My name is Rikako Takigawa.

82
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,820
Right now, you are my friend.

83
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,120
- Friend?
- I'll keep a secret about the lipstick.

84
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,900
Just go with the flow.

85
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,180
- Hands off me!
- Ouch!

86
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:35,180
Ms. Sawa Sasamoto.

87
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,820
31 years old, right?

88
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,080
Yes.

89
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,870
Ms. Sasamoto, were you going to meet
Ms. Takigawa when the incident occurred?

90
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,060
Yes...

91
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,600
We'd promised to meet up,
so I was going to get her from work.

92
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,670
I just recently moved to this area.

93
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,160
Ms. Sasamoto is the first friend I've made.

94
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,880
And... all three of you were going for tea...?

95
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,280
Mr. Hagiwara is an acquaintance of hers.

96
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,700
Yes... We're all friends of friends,
so we're all friends, right?

97
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,100
Right, right?

98
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,120
Is that so?

99
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,570
Yes?

100
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,630
I got it.

101
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,990
Please wait a moment.

102
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,930
Umm... I didn't realize we'd be lying to the police.

103
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,610
I'm sorry... But it's too late now.

104
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,130
This is a cover-up for an affair, isn't it?

105
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:44,330
If you were caught together it'd be an issue,
so you dragged me into this if I'm not mistaken.

106
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,230
Unbelievable!

107
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,130
That's disgusting. Despicable.

108
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,750
You don't have to be so harsh.

109
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,130
I picked this up.

110
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,940
This red color fits you well.

111
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,170
You're mistaken.

112
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,390
I took this by mistake.

113
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,650
Here's the culprit and his teacher.

114
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,890
Excuse me.

115
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,740
I'm Kitano from Seishou Academy...

116
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,010
- What did you just say?
- So what?!

117
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,600
Stop it, you guys! Control yourselves!

118
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,990
I'm sorry. Stop it, Kinoshita.

119
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,770
I'm Kitano from Seishou Academy.

120
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,950
His parents are at work so I came in their stead.

121
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:27,100
I'm deeply sorry for the trouble  that my student has caused you.

122
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,990
Please teach him well from now on.

123
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,430
- I will.
- We're fine with settling this out of court.

124
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,730
Right?

125
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,700
Thank you very much. The culprit will also apologizeー

126
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,500
Apologize to them.

127
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,350
- Where's the toilet?
- Hey, Kinoshita!

128
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,040
- Poop.
- Kinoshita.

129
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,870
- Toilet's over there!
- Bring it on!

130
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,070
What? Hey, what, huh?!

131
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:56,090
- Cool off.
- Are you even reflecting, jackass?

132
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:01,170
Excuse me... how is your injury?

133
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,680
Oh, it's fine.

134
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,570
- I'll go with you to hospital.
- What?

135
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,160
- Let the  doctor see it.
- No, I'm fine.

136
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,800
Then I will take you home after that.

137
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,840
Sawa, why don't you go with him?

138
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,800
I'm fine.

139
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,970
I'm really okay.

140
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,800
It's no big deal. Move aside.

141
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,820
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

142
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,980
<i>Dear God, I'm sorry.</i>

143
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,320
<i>I did some thing that I shouldn't do.</i>

144
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,420
<i> I sincerely apologize, and will make amends.</i>

145
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,720
<i>But let me say one thing.</i>

146
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,360
<i>She has a perfect family, yet she's having an affair.</i>

147
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,880
<i>She will get punished.</i>

148
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,190
<i>I hope...</i>

149
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,790
<i>that her husband will discover her affair,</i>.

150
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,400
<i>and she goes to hell.</i>

151
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,280
- You fell down from a bicycle?
- On the way home after work.

152
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,750
A cat came out nowhere, and I tried to avoid it.

153
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:32,710
She may have broken a bone,
so I kept telling her that she should go to hospital.

154
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,550
Mom, I'm fine, look!

155
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:41,230
Okay,  take a break, you've worked so hard already.

156
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:45,490
I will help you until you have a baby.

157
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,130
It smells*.
[*smell of an old lady]

158
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:50,990
What do you mean by that?

159
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:55,940
- Oh, I haven't eaten this for a long time. Looks delicious.
- I know, right?

160
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:00,100
Eating healthy food is important.
This is good for making babies.

161
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,930
Sooner or later, you will see the results.

162
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:05,510
Dinner time.

163
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,520
Papa is home!

164
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,540
I wish the mice can call you "Papa".

165
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,800
Mom, those aren't mice. They're hamsters.

166
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:24,200
- Hello?
- <i>Ah, Sawa?</i>

167
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,650
<i>It's me, Rikako.</i>

168
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:35,120
Hi, how are you?

169
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,820
<i>I'm glad I asked for your number. Did you go home safely?</i>

170
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,950
- Don't worry about me.
- My husband wants to thank you. Hold on.

171
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,630
<i>Huh? Your husband?</i>

172
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:49,510
Hello, nice to meet you. Thank you for taking care of my wife.

173
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:54,000
- I didn't really do anything...
- Because of my wife,

174
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,530
you got injured, and I'm so sorry.

175
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:02,520
- Don't be.
- My wife can be ignorant at times,

176
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,790
<i>but I hope you'll continue to get along with her.</i>

177
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,960
Ignorant...

178
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,260
I'll hand over the phone to Rikako. Bye, and take care.

179
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:21,520
Sorry for calling you so suddenly.
My husband can be quite rigid at times.

180
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,270
Normally, he is not like this.

181
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,820
- Good bye.
- <i>Wait.</i>

182
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:31,070
Your part-time job ends at 3PM on Thursday, right?

183
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,460
Can you come to Yokosuka Bayside Hotel after work?

184
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,780
Why should I?

185
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:40,140
That teacher, Kitano.
We'll have to meet him about the settlement.

186
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,030
It's none of my business.

187
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:47,160
He said that he wants to apologize to you one more time.

188
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,650
I'm not going.

189
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,400
I want to meet you, too.

190
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,820
The truth is I really want to apologize to you. Okay?

191
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,860
You're suspended for a week.

192
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,650
It will be summer break soon anyway.

193
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,710
Kinoshita,

194
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,200
you still have half a year till you graduate.

195
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,600
It's none of your business.

196
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,870
Your mother,

197
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,770
- hasn't come back yet?
- It's none of your business either.

198
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:16,530
I'm not trying to comfort you with empty words, but I'm sure...

199
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,210
that your mother has her reasons.

200
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,530
- She has been taking care of you until you're 18ー
- They kissed.

201
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:26,650
- What?
- They kissed.

202
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:39,190
She had the same expression as my mom's.

203
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,250
You...

204
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,670
- That's why you did it?
- That cashier is an accomplice.

205
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:49,190
They pretended to be friends
so that she won't be caught cheating.

206
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:53,820
- Why didn't you tell the truth to the police...
- It's more interesting this way.

207
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,470
She lied without even blinking, it's seriously amusing.

208
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,880
Don't make such pathetic remarks.

209
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,410
- You're not that twisted, right?
- Oh, shut up.

210
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,660
Don't act like a passionate teacher.

211
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,980
You don't even really care.

212
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,370
Hey Kinoshita!

213
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:15,320
What should I do?

214
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,990
Oh, lipstick? You're really putting in effort, huh?

215
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:28,550
Let me be straight with you for once.

216
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,320
You are not sexy at all.

217
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,810
You meant that? Let me do it.

218
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,820
I'm not kidding.

219
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:40,570
Can't you wear something a bit more stylish?

220
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:45,770
- You have a part-time job, don't you?
- Well, I'm saving up for a house.

221
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:51,260
No matter how old men are,
they'll always want their woman to be sexy.

222
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:57,050
They want women all the time.

223
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:01,990
You need to understand men and show your power.

224
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:07,750
You've always just been average.

225
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:19,390
- You've taken a shower already?
- Yeah.

226
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,890
I fell asleep.

227
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,010
Jeez...
<i>[BONITO]</i>

- Mh?

229
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:41,090
Mom thinks I can't have children because I lack sex appeal.

230
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,840
You don't.

231
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,060
You're adorable.

232
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,390
Smooth, right?

233
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,440
It smells good.

234
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,340
Infused with aroma oils.

235
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,660
- You bought it?
- Yeah.

236
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,000
They had a cosmetics sale online.

237
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,990
You can use it, too.

238
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,990
- Thanks.
- Shall we sleep?

239
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:21,560
<i>My husband is not a homosexual.</i>

240
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,450
<i>He just wants to remain beautiful.</i>

241
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:29,590
<i>He wanted me before we got married.</i>

242
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:35,960
<i>Just because we don't have sex,
it doesn't mean that I want to leave him.</i>

243
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:41,590
<i>We get along well with each other. But...</i>

244
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:47,660
- These housewives are so messed up.
- It's over for Japan.

245
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,720
It's all because of men.

246
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,450
This happens because men don't care for their wives.

247
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,530
I don't want hear this. Stop it.

248
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,010
It's meeting time!!
<i>[BONITO - Editorial Department]</i>

249
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,820
"Wives who date multiple guys". What do you think?

250
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,760
It's not uncommon to have three or four from dating sites.

251
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,060
Oh, so tough. I like it.

252
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:09,600
Let's do that. "Wives who have affairs in broad daylight".

253
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,180
- "What kind of man for Thursday?"
- Oh, nice.

254
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,790
- Yamashita and Takamura, go find someone to feature.
- Okay.

255
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,960
- Tajima, you take care of the photography, right?
- Okay.

256
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,390
Kato, can you draw a sexier painting this time?

257
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,390
Sexier?

258
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:29,490
The last one was far too elegant.

259
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:34,840
It's lacking impact. I think it's better if it's just completely erotic.

260
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,720
I think it's more erotic without adding people in.

261
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,350
It's more erotic when a woman is lying down by herself.

262
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:46,090
I understand, but...

263
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,480
I don't want an elegant kind of erotic.

264
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,830
I want a more straight-forward,

265
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,600
expression.

266
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,050
Please do this for me.

267
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,370
Any problems with that?

268
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,400
Can you take responsibility,

269
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,730
- if you rile up the housewives with this kind of feature?
- Responsibility?

270
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,470
We are creating entertainment pieces.

271
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:13,060
It's not a textbook. It's their responsibility.

272
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:19,850
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

273
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:22,380
He takes some things too seriously.

274
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,570
You gotta admit, he is talented though.

275
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:29,280
Ah, he received some famous award when he was young, right?

276
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,570
Yeah, but his talent doesn't lie in his artistic ability.

277
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:37,780
He's only good at being an illustrator.

278
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,400
Excuse me.

279
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,560
- You...
- May I talk to you?

280
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,690
No, I'm working right now.

281
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:15,620
Rikako won't answer my phone,

282
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:20,660
- and she blocked my messages too.
- It's none of my business.

283
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,900
We will take responsibility for

284
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,250
your medical and repair expenses.

285
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,220
You're taking responsibility for this?

286
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,040
That student has some problems at home.

287
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,280
His mother is away and his father is on a business trip.

288
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,740
I talked to the principal, and I will take over for this case.

289
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:46,280
I'd love to applaud you for being a passionate teacher,
but I don't like this.

290
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:52,520
I don't feel any sincerity
if that boy or his parents are not here. Right?

291
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,440
Please take this back.

292
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,920
You are right but,

293
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,160
would you please consider this again?

294
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,900
He has a bright future ahead of him.

295
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,100
Of course, I will properly make him apologize to you.

296
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,610
Sure.

297
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:10,700
If you are willing to have a date with me, I will think again.

298
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:17,200
I'm serious. If you can spend a day with me,
I will let this go.

299
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,820
I'm seriously apologizing to you now.

300
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,870
I'm seriously inviting you, too.

301
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:23,620
Are you kidding me? This is about the student's life.

302
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,970
How can you save your student's life?

303
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,650
Instead of looking condescending,

304
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:32,770
wouldn't you be instilling resilience in your students

305
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:36,200
- by brazenly dating the victim, right?
- Excuse me.

306
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:39,050
I will contact you again.

307
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,690
- Go ahead.
- What?

308
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:51,890
Chase him and say, "I'm sorry for the way my friend behaved."

309
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:54,270
I heard it's a common scam method.

310
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:58,590
One acts like a villain, and the other like an ally of justice.

311
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,910
Why me?

312
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:03,150
I bet you thought that he was wonderful, didn't you?

313
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,010
What are you talking about?

314
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:09,260
That teacher is not bad at all. He may not be super smart,

315
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:12,300
but he's just perfect for someone innocent like you.

316
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:17,020
There's probably no point in saying this to you but I'm married.

317
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:22,840
Even better. Real love only comes after you get married.

318
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,520
Is that some sort of signature phrase?

319
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:30,700
When you choose your marriage partner, don't you prioritize financial ability, his background, and looks?

320
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,800
You may not be aware, but I'm sure you chose him for your own self-interest.

321
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,100
How rude!

322
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,300
I married my husband because I love him.

323
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,800
How old are you?

324
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,180
I'm way younger than you.

325
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,180
The police officer said you are 31 years old.

326
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,220
You already knew it.

327
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,800
Are you sure you want your life as a woman be over like this?

328
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,700
Instead of having an affair with younger men,

329
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,000
I want to build my warm family.

330
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,200
You don't get it.

331
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,830
You need to fall in love to make your warm family.

332
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:02,070
You don't make sense, I cannot comprehend your thoughts.

333
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,810
Well, let me ask you...

334
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:07,870
Did your husband try hard  to build a warm family with you?

335
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:12,030
Did he take care of you like before?

336
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:16,450
Does your husband still make your heart flutter?

337
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,930
I bet not.

338
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:22,050
In marriage, you exchange passion for tranquility.

339
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:26,100
Husbands see their wives as refrigerators after three years.

340
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,300
Refrigerator?

341
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,800
They think that when they open the door,
there is food inside all the time.

342
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,330
It is inconvenient if it breaks down,
but they don't want to keep maintaining it.

343
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:38,870
But if you have an affair,
you will be more tolerant of your husband.

344
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,740
You can happily wash his underwear.
The whole family will get along better.

345

347
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,000
That guy couldn't reach you and got worried.
He came to the supermarket.

348
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,500
I'm done with him already.

349
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:58,440

350

372
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,580
In order to protect itself from external harm,

373
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:44,550

374
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,190
Unlike most insects,

375
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,550
they are monogamous.

376
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,930
Monogamous?

377
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:58,570
It's the same as a human marriage. A specific male pairs with a specific female to raise their offspring.

378
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,890
I didn't like it.

Even if that was a joke,
how can a woman seduce a man that easily?

381
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:12,230
It's even more unforgivable when she seduces for fun.

382
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,950

<i>What are you doing?</i>

523
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,610
Are you Rikako's husband?

524
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,280
- Hello?
- It's Kato.

525
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,260
I'll open the door.

526
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,390
Everybody just got here.

527
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,210
Could you tell me where the toilet is?

528
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:20,940
Go straight, on your left.

529
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,920
You too, Sawa. Come on in.

530
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,300
You seem busy, huh?

531
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,300
My husband's coworkers came for a house-warming party.

532
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,240
Can we have a moment?

533
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:35,260
What is it?

534
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:38,360
That obsessed guy appeared in front of my house.

535
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:42,680
I'll be in trouble if he comes again. Please give him a call.

536
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,370
Hey, what happened?

537
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:47,210
Nothing. It's Sawa.

538
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,970
We were together the other day.

539
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,430
Ah, hello there!

540
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,580
Hi.

541
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,950
- Hey, let her in.
- Please come in.

542
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:00,170
- Come in,  come in.
- But I...

543
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,520
The food is ready!

544
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,750
First come, first served.

545
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,780
What?!

546
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:12,390
Please come in.

547
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,880
Amazing!

548
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,800
My husband works at a publishing company.

549
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,100
Have you heard of this magazine, "BONITO"?

550
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,930
He is the chief editor.

- Hello!

552
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:28,860
- Hello.
- Hello, I'm Hina.

553
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,500
I'm the older sis, Mana. Welcome!

554
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,770
She is my friend, Sawa.

555
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:38,210
- How old are you?
- I'm 8.

556
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:40,260
Enjoy your time here.

557
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,240
- Hello.
- Hello, I'm Hina.

558
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,030
I'm the older sis, Mana. Welcome!

559
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,960
I'm scared.

560
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,930
You two go eat something.

561
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:55,190
- Shall I call my husband?
- No.

562
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,750
Sawa, go ahead eat something.

563
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,360
Actually, I'm leaving.

564
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,670
Don't say that.

565
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,780
It's so erotic!

566
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:07,400
Hey be careful, there're kids here.

567
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:24,990
You've got to make these decisions for yourself.

568
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:29,490
If you can't graduate, you can't find any job.

569
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,200
Kinoshita, what is your answer?

570
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,810
I don't need any job.

571
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:36,420
How do you survive then?

572
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:40,420
Work with your own hands
and live off what you make.

573
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,110
That's how we live, right?

574
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,940
Mr. Kitano,

575
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:48,950
you asked me why I didn't tell the police that they lied, right?

576
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:51,740
It was so I could get money. From that woman.

577
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,230
- Kinoshita!
- Mr. Kitano.

578
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,970
What do you mean?

579
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:04,480
If I threaten that woman that I'll tell her husband,
she'll pay me lots.

580
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,120
She might even sleep with me once.

581
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,150
Cut it out!

582
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,060
You guys are too childish.

583
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,030
That's how you live.

584
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:17,110
If you're really a teacher, stop all the worthless talk about bugs.

585
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,550
Why don't you tell the truth?

586
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,620
Wait! Sit back down!

587
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,660
Sit down! Hey!

588
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:27,260
Expel me. Do whatever you want.

589
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,880
Hey, Kinoshita! Ouch!

590
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,980
-  Are you alright?
- Ouch.

591
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,850
Hey, Kinoshita!

592
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:38,290
We meet many models and actors in our line of work
all the time.

593
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:41,460
Women like you, Sawa,

594
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,240
are refreshing, right?

595
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,950
Yes, that's right!

596
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:48,060
She has the normal wife's look,

597
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,790
but it's sexier that way.

598
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,330
That's right.

599
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:53,130
Sexy?

600
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:56,750
- No, no, no...
- No, we're serious.

601
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:59,680
I don't have it.

602
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,640
I don't have it at all.

603
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,320
I'm drunk.

604
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:10,340
That's a non-alcoholic drink, Sawa.

605
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,720
I know that.

606
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:18,550
Hey, since when did you know my wife?

607
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:22,650
The day after the fire, she came to talk to me.

608
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:26,650
Now that you mention, there was fire near here recently.

609
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:29,830
I heard it was arson.

610
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:32,340
But rumors say it was actually a forced double suicide.

611
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:34,000
Forced double suicide?

612
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,420
It's highly likely that someone in the building had set it on fire.

613
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,470
Why they want to burn down their own house?

614
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:44,960
Logically speaking, debt problems, perhaps?

615
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,640
Or caretaking issues, too.

616
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,600
No, maybe it's male-female relationship problems.

617
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:57,180
Because of her husband's affair, the wife started the fire.

618
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:01,220
If it's true, then I feel sorry for their kids.

619
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:04,680
Yeah...you're right.

620
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,040
Maybe it's opposite.

621
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,650
Eh? Opposite?

622
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:13,120
Maybe the wife had an affair,
and she wanted to clean up everything.

623
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,210
Yes, that's possible, too.

624
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:21,150
It's just like the housewife we featured in our magazine.

625
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:24,110
What do you think, Kato?

626
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:28,100
Would a woman really try to cover her tracks
by doing something like that?

627
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:32,540
Women nowadays are much more cunning about their cheating.

628
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:41,370
Well, you wrote about it in your magazine.

629
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:43,820
Yeah, you're right.

630
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,190
Because your wife is so pretty,
we really thought she was having an affair.

631
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:50,540
No, no, impossible!

632
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,130
She may have the looks, but she's not capable of doing that.

633
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:54,750
What are you talking about?

634
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:57,580
Mom! Mom, there's another visitor.

635
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:00,170
His name is Hagiwara.

636
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:06,580
Who is it?

637
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:09,400
Yeah... Who could it be?

638
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,500
Wait! If you don't know who he is, then it's dangerous.

639
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,080
I'll go.

640
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,450
Ah, me too.

641
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,490
He's looking for me.

642
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:26,600
It's my younger brother.

643
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:28,490
Your brother?

644
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:32,540
Yes. I told him I came here to a party
and I asked him to pick me up.

645
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,790
Thank you for everything.

646
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:36,100
Oh.

647
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:41,830
Sorry, Sawa. I haven't had much chance to entertain you.

648
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,100
You're early, let's go.

649
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,810
Huh? What?

650
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:51,040
Stop it.

651
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:58,080
- Do we have enough beer and meat?
- Eh?

652
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,690
Something is wrong with you. Why did you come to her house?

653
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:02,510
You were the one who told me to come.

654
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:05,600
I just said that to get rid of you!

655
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,540
I need to see her.

656
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:11,630
You can't! Her daughters are at home.

657
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:16,530
What do you think is going to happen
if you show up and start a fight?

658
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,380
I don't care. In fact, I want them to have a fight.

659
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,960
So childish.

660
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,340
If you do that, she won't care about you at all.

661
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,400
Sawa?

662
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,650
- I was so surprised.
- Because you caused this to happen.

663
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:06,910
No, I was surprised that you were on my side.

664
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:13,000
I just don't want something to happen to your kids.

665
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:19,040
We can be good friends.

I'm not like you.

669
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:35,520
Are you leaving?

00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,530
I'm done.

00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:50,090
so everything looks like adultery to you.

699
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:53,670
You don't know how the world works.

700
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:56,050
I don't think you should be hanging out with her too much.

701
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:57,060
Why?

702
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:00,380
Just listen to me and you will be fine.

703
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:03,450
Hey, somebody come here and help me!

704
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,980
Nevermind, let's go together.

705
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:12,140
Cheers!

706
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:14,380
There's wine, too.

707
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:38,540
Can I help you?

708
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,720
Sorry.

709
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:49,840
Huh?

710
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:55,730
What? Mr. Kitano, where are your glasses?

711
00:50:55,730 --> 00:51:00,770
Oh, I stumbled and broke it.

712
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,410
Anyway, what happened?

713
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:10,060
I happened to pass by here, and it's brought up some memories.

714
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,380
Bye.

715
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:51,480
Sorry that I asked you to be my artist.

716
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:55,780
- Here.
- Not at all, I'm done.

717
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,750
I'm so happy.

718
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,860
If you don't like it, I'm sorry. I'm just a third-rate artist, you see.

719
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:20,030
No, you are a top artist.

720
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:24,780
Because this looks just like me.

722
00:52:58,270 --> 00:52:59,990
You went the wrong way again?

723
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:01,920
No.

724
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,990
I didn't happen to come here.

725
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:09,150
I had lied previously.

726
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:10,960
Lied?

727
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,670
Ms. Takigawa and I are not friends.

728
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:18,080
She asked me to say that we are.

729
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:21,330
You just came here to tell me about that.

730
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:24,250
That?

731
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:26,400
I don't like lying to people.

732
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,310
Have you ever lied before?

733
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:32,370
That's really mean of you.

734
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:37,410
Your shoelace is loose.

735
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:40,140
It happens a lot.

736
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:47,390
You should tie it like this.

737
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:51,470
This way, and put it in down here.

738
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:56,560
Then make a loop here, and tighten it.

739
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:59,780
It's easy. Same goes for the other one.

740
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:03,960
You try it.

741
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:09,980
Sorry, I still don't know how to tie shoelaces at this age.

742
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:15,600
Go down here, and make a loop.

<i>Adultery...</i>

744
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:22,940
<i>It is a dirty and selfish act of passion.</i>

745
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,260
It supports the back properly.

746
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:31,240
Now we can relax and spend time together.

747
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,970
