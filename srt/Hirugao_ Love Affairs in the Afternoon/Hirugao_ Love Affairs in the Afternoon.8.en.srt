1
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,620
Tell me, Sawa.

2
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,500
What?

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,780
Who made the first move?

4
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,300
- I'm not sure.
- I'm sure you can remember, right?

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,220
- Just confess already.
- Hey.

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,140
Why not? You guys look good together.
I want to know how you both met.

7
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,450
This is so embarrassing! I was the one who approached her first.

8
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,400
She was my junior in the same company.

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,990
On the way home from our year-end party, I said,
"Let's have a year-end party next time, just the two of us".

10
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,580
That sounds wonderful, Sawa.

11
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,740
- You did good job.
- I was young back then. What about you guys?

12
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:56,000
Both of you are good-looking,
I guess you fell in love and got married?

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,320
Yes... Something like that.

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,340
My husband is my prince.

15
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,180
Right, Sawa?

16
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,390
- Prince?
- I told you before.

17
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:12,880
Before we got married, I fell in love with a married man.
It was a sad romance.

18
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,740
My husband berated me and saved me
from that ditch of adultery.

19
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,080
I'm sorry!

20
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,520
I keep talking about myself.
Talking about adultery makes you uncomfortable, right?

21
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,210
Don't worry about it. I'm not that rigid.

22
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:35,390
We do silly things when we're young. In fact, your romance is so dramatic that I envy you. Our romance is pretty normal, right?

23
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,630
- Can't be helped, since we have boring personalities.
- Hey.
- Look at this.

24
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,240
- You guys look so lovey-dovey!
- Hey, stop that.

25
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,180
- Stop it.
- Yeah, please.

26
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,880
- Your place is nice, too.
- Really?

27
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,950
- I love your furniture, too.
- I work at a furniture store called Mina Furniture.
- I know that one.

28
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,910
- You have great taste.
- Thank you!

29
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:02,360
- Can I see that room, too?
- Stop it.
- It's fine.   I have nothing to hide anyway.

30
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,400
- Yay!
- Go ahead.

31
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Wow. This one, too?

32
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,220
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,920

34
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,560

40
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:56,180
Yeah. Wow.

41
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,990
Are you sure about this? If you stay here,
you can't eat any good food.

42
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,080
I know, right?

43
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,940
How about your kids?

44
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:22,100
- I want to bring them with me, but I don't think they'll follow me.
- How irresponsible of you.

45
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,650
I know. You don't need to tell me that. I'm the worst mother.

46
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,540
You're going to revolt now?

47
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:35,240
Let's eat. I'm digging in.

48
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,830
I'm a loser. I can't support you.

49
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,010
What's wrong, all of a sudden?

50
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,870
A long time ago... someone told me
that I had made her life miserable.

51
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,800
Who was it?

52
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,960
My ex-wife.

53
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,590
I didn't know that. You were married?

54
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,420
She was from a wealthy family.
Her parents were against our relationship, so we eloped.

55
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,250
She believed that I could make a name for myself someday.

56
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,720
But... I never did.

57
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:27,400
She couldn't stand living a pauper's life anymore,
so she left me three years later.

58
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,240
You can often hear such stories.

59
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,350
She told me that the time we spent together
was the worst in her life.

60
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:47,610
I... will never say that kind of thing to you.

61
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,340
I don't want to tell that to my husband either.

62
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,100
What is so funny?

63
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,600
Because it is funny.

64
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,430
We have a casual relationship,
but you're saying all this so seriously.

65
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:28,200
You're right. Our relationship was just casual.

66
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,720
You smiled for the first time.

67
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,650
I want to hug it!

68
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,750
- Is this Sawa's?
- That's right.

69
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,600
You're indeed a pro in furniture. This is such a relaxing bedroom.

70
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,800
- I'm happy to hear that.
- Don't flatter him too much. He'll let it get to his head.

71
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,970
I'm not flattering. Is that the dressing table?

72
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:25,400
- This design is simple and easy to use.
- It's so cute!

73
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,540
Why did you keep it in the drawer?

74
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,410
- I'm not sure why.
- I didn't know you have this.

75
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,970
A friend gave this to me a long time ago.

76
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,480
Is this a mountain gorilla?

77
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:44,690
- Shall we leave?
- Already?
- It's nearing dinner time and I have some work to do, too.

78
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:50,730
You're right. I forgot about the time. Sorry for disturbing you.

79
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:57,400
- I'm glad you came.
- Feel free to visit again.

80
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,510
- Thank you for having us.
- Thank you.

81
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:06,700
- It's so late already. I'll take it.
- It's fine.
- Oh, right.

82
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,970
- I forgot ask you something.
- What is it?

83
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,080
How did you know my husband's family name?

84
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,140
What?

85
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,450
You met him for the first time today.

86
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,980
I've been using my maiden name way before I got married.

87
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,980
So there's no way you'd know his family name.

88
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,380
- That is...
- Let me explain.

89
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,250

I was really surprised yesterday.

116
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,470
I didn't know you and Mr. Kitano knew each other.

117
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:36,170
I know, right? I was also surprised.

Truth is... Sasamoto and I have met before.

119
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,240
What do you mean?

120
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:51,490
In June, a student of mine broke into a car
and the police showed up. Sasamoto was in that car.

121
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,270
A car?

122
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,040
It was Rikako's car.

123
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,100
When the student tried to escape, there was a struggle
and Sasamoto got hurt in the process.

124
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,350
We then met up with Takigawa to settle it out of court.

125
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:07,000
- Oh, right. Rikako mentioned that before.
- That's right.

126
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,170
- What a small world.
- I didn't know that. What a coincidence, indeed.

127
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:17,710
That's why I knew that your husband's last name was Kitano.

128
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,670
Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

129
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:23,100
You should have told me he was the teacher back then.

130
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,130
I thought I should keep quiet about it, for his student's sake.

131

00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,850
His wife had an affair and wants a divorce.

170
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:54,150
There's no way an egoistic man like him can accept that.

171
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,410
Are you planning to stay here forever?

172
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,740
Do you think you can have a decent life here?

173
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,730
I'll go get paint.

174
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,250
- Take your time.
- Thanks.

175
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,950
I didn't know he can say, "Take your time."

176
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:25,630
He may not look like it, but he understands people's feelings.

177
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:30,090
But like you said, he doesn't have any money.

178
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:35,780
If we stay together, he either has to quit painting
and get another job,

179
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,340
Or I have to find a job.

180
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,480
You're willing to go to that extent?

181
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:47,680
I... can't go back to my husband anymore.

182
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:57,160
But I hope... that I can see my kids one more time,
and properly apologize to them.

183
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,970
I'll go over to meet your kids.

184
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:09,190
I'll make sure you can see them.
It's not good to leave things hanging like this.

185
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,330
Leave me alone.

186
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:20,060
You have no time to worry about others.
You must make sure that no one finds out about Mr. Kitano.

187
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:25,000
For someone who ran away from home,
that's not convincing enough.

188
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,880
You got that right.

189
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,170
I've lost everything, after all.

190
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,190
<i>Lost everything.</i>

191
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:45,920
<i>That was what Rikako said,
but she didn't look miserable to me at all.</i>

192
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,770
The principal has told me everything.

193
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,740
- I'm good at photography, aren't I?
- Kinoshita.

194
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,380
That woman is a housewife with a normal family.

195
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:19,390
Don't even think about hurting her.

196
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,320
You're really confident, aren't you?

197
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,630
- Even though you're doing something wrong.
- We're not doing anything inappropriate.

198
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,690
You're covering up for her now?

199
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,530
- You love her that much?
- Stop it.

200
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,820
We're not in some kind of dirty relationship like you think.

201
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,620
Can you swear on it?

202
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,150
Sure.

203
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,910
I understand.

204
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,270
I believe you.

205
00:16:53,850 --> 00:17:00,720
Because of my mom's issues, I see all adults as filthy beings.

206
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,970
Kinoshita.

207
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,320
Say, can I go to your house? I want to have a good chat with you.

208
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,230
Sure.

209
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,040
Of course you can.

210
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:19,420
How about tomorrow? I'll give you a treat.

211
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,240
Thanks.

212
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:34,780
<i>[Gorilla Mascot Gonchan-Hug]</i>

213
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,920
Chief!

214
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,270
Chief?

215
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,480
Don't cause any more trouble.

216
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,710
My mom believed that you are my lover.

217
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:59,070
- Really? I'm happy to hear that.
- I'm not happy at all.

218
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:04,250
- You're so mean.
- How should I say this...

219
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:09,540
I'm sorry if I had given you the wrong idea.

220
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:19,020
Just because we didn't sleep with each other doesn't mean that we're clean. In the first place, we weren't even together.

221
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,650
You didn't plan to have a relationship with me,

222
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:25,010
yet you wanted me to like you forever?

223
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:28,780
You wanted to use me as tool to make you confident as a man.

224
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:32,950
Is that it? Asshole.

225
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,180
- I don't mean that...
- In that case,

226
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,680
look at me for real.

227
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,270
If not, I will tell the director.

228
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:46,350
- Hey.
- See you tomorrow, Chief.

229
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,150
Mr. Sasamoto?

230
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,310
I figured it was you. What a coincidence.

231
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,900
- Hello.
- Don't worry.

232
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,560
I won't tell Sawa about what I just saw.

233
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:08,680
- No, I mean...
- In return, please treat me to some tea.

234
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,760
I have something to discuss with you.

235
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,920
Thank you.

236
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:31,610
- Sawa.
- Hi Hina, have you been well?

237
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:36,010
- Here, a present for you.
- Thank you.
- Hina.

238
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,330
What is your purpose of visiting here?

239
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:45,020
- It's regarding your mom.
- Please don't talk about my mom.

240
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:50,330
- Hina, go play somewhere else.
- No, I want to play with Sawa.

241
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:55,570
- Ms. Matsushita, please.
- Hina, let's make your picture diary together.

242
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:09,910
Mana, I don't know how to say this,

243
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,580
- but I'm sorry about what happened.
- No big deal.

244
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:19,130
Your mom wants to meet and apologize to you.

245
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:22,220
- Can you go see her?
- I won't.

246
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:30,110
- But... she is really worry about you.
- We are doing fine.

247
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:34,370
- We have a housekeeper now.
- No way.

248
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:41,830
- Your mom and the housekeeper are different, aren't they?
- Of course.

249
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:45,250
A housekeeper's food is a hundred times better

250
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,520
than that of someone who has an affair.

251
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:54,560
<i>Mana's words had hurt me, too.</i>

252
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,600
You checked on her kids?

253
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,300
As I guessed, they rejected you, right?

254
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,970
Yes.

255
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,550
I will talk to Rikako about this.

256
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,960
Wait.

257
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,090
Please make Rikako happy.

258
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,020
Please.

259
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:43,150
- What are you doing? You're that close with her?
- Rikako is me.

260
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,140
I, too...

261
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,570
may be doing the same thing.

262
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,090
Can I have this?

263
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,400
Mom, you're here again?

264
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,860
I wanted to talk to you.

265
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,550
I've brought soy pulp.

266
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:23,590
Don't you think we've been chatting too much lately?

267
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:29,500
I want to talk about... Shunshuke's affair.

268
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,130
If you're referring to that,
Shunsuke has told me it was a misunderstanding.

269
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:37,390
He told me she is just his subordinate,
and there's nothing between them at all.

270
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,020
The soy pulp looks delicious.

271
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,060
Would any man

272
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,470
admit he's having an affair when asked?

273
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,900
Maybe Shunsuke will.

274
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,680
I'm not joking.

275
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,510
- Come here and take a seat.
- What's wrong with you?

276
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:58,460
- Ouch, you're hurting me.
- I'm so sorry, Sawa!

277
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,090
Huh? Mom?

278
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:06,460
As his mom, I came here today to apologize to you.

279
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:11,200
I'm so disappointed him as my son.

280
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,660
I raised him to make sure not to become a man like his father.

281
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:21,660
I guess I was too harsh on him, and that's why he's now doing it.

282
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,400
It's all my fault.

283
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,700
I'm... really sorry.

284
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,920
Mom, please stop.

285
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,040
It's not your fault.

286
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,620
Maybe... maybe I wasn't good enough for him.

287
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,240
Sawa...

288
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,850
<i>I felt bad for my mother-in-law,</i>

289
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:50,270
<i>but in fact, I was hoping that my husband
really was having an affair.</i>

290
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,430
<i>If so,</i>

291
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:56,010
<i>it could make me feel less guilty.</i>

292
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:00,010
<i>I was so disgusted with my own selfishness,</i>

293
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:02,150
<i>that tears started welling up.</i>

294
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,570
You must be having a hard time.

295
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:17,790
I'll take care of everything. Woman to woman. We are one.

296
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,880
Mom...

297
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,920
I'm home.

298
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,950
You're here again?

299
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,200
What is it this time?

300
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,320
I'm home.

301
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,520
Hey.

302
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,300
Yes!

303
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:31,480
- Can you cut my hair?
- Me?

304
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,460
- You can, can't you?
- I've cut my kids' hair before but...

305
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,660
I'll go see your husband tomorrow.

306
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:43,020
I don't like being a thief.

307
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,000
How short do you want it?

308
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,510
- Cut it real short.
- You sure?
- Yeah.

309
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,990
Don't get mad if it turns out Mohican.

310
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,850
Your daughter...

311
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,550
said she doesn't want to see you again.

312
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,340
I see.

313
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,910
Understood.

314
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:46,020
Oops! Sorry...

315
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:50,100
- What?
- I'm kidding.

316
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,810
Hello? This is Takigawa.

317
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:07,970
Regarding this painter, Osamu Kato...

318
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,800
Dig in.

319
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:16,700
- Looks good!
- Mr. Kitano, you have a really nice wife.

320
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:21,390
Truth is... My husband helped me with this.

321
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,510
This is the first time we're inviting students so I was nervous.

322
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,590
Eat as much as you like. Here.

323
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,300
- Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you for the meal.

324
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,000
Enjoy.

325
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,260
Yum!

326
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,860
- It's been a while since I ate such good food.
- Really?

327
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,680
My mom had left us for a man.

328
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:46,240
Awful, isn't she? She just took her clothes one day,

329
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,790
and never told me anything.

330
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:53,040
If I see her again, I will make her suffer for sure.

331
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,120
Don't say that.

332
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,920
I'm sure your mom has good reason for what she did.

333
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,400
You'll be miserable by hating her.

334
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,340
Is there a good reason for her to abandon her family?

335
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,260
Of course not.

336
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:10,560
Marriage means you've promised to not love another person.

337
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,900
I think what she did was disgusting.

338
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,360
Your wife understands more than you, Mr. Kitano.

339
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,700
So you'll never have an affair, Ma'am?

340
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,800
Of course. I will love my husband forever.

341
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,190
Did you hear that?

342
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:32,160
I'm happy for you.

343
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,200
- What?
- Nothing.

344
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,580
Mr. Kitano may not look like it but he's popular with women.

345
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,940
I'm worried about him.

346
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,600
Of course he'll be fine.

347
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,800
I believe in my husband.

348
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:56,420
We will have a baby and build a happy family.

349
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,650
What a pain.

350
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:05,520
- I get irritated by overconfident women like her.
- Kinoshita.

351
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,720
- See ya.
- Hey.

352
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,430
Kinoshita!

353
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:14,440
Hey, wait! Come back.

354
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,340
You just got here. Let's talk.

355
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,290
If you're gonna have a baby then break up with your lover.

356
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:27,010
- If you do, I will forget about that picture.
- What?

357
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:30,600
- Are you sure about that?
- If he gets a divorce,

358
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,060
the baby will have to suffer.

359
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:46,540
You saw Noriko?

360
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,570
- You bumped into her?
- That's right.  We had tea together.

361
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:56,080
What? Are you jealous?

362
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,890
A little. Because Noriko is good-looking.

363
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:02,870
Are you still bothered by what my mom mentioned?

364
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:05,900
I swear I wasn't having an affair.

365
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,130
In fact, you're the one who is hiding something.

366
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:12,800
- What?
I heard...

367
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,790
that Rikako was having an affair.

368
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:20,290
And that she often asked you to be her alibi.

369
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,650
- Did Noriko tell you that?
- That's right.

370
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,960
She is worried about you.

371
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,220
She was concerned that you were being made used of
and suffering.

372
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,030
I can't believe it.

373
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,360
- She is wrong.
- You don't need to lie anymore.

374
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,100
The day I went to see the fireworks,

375
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:44,960
you told me that you went to a cake buffet.

376
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,970
I heard that was a lie.

377
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,580
Where did you go that day?

378
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,860
<i>That made me convinced.</i>

379
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:59,550
<i>Like I guessed, Noriko knew.</i>

380
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,240
<i>That's why...</i>

381
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,030
<i>she betrayed her friend.</i>

382
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,930
<i>And me, too.</i>

383
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,800
Sorry.

384
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,450
I can't tell you now.

385
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,800
Even to me?

386
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,600
This also involves Rikako's family.

387
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,510
I don't know what will happen to them.

388
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,440
I see.

389
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,120
Of course. She is your friend, after all.

390
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:41,200
But don't help cover up for her adultery anymore.

391
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,810
We don't want Mr. Takigawa to detest us.

392
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:53,090
But... I can't believe that the wife of the chief editor for an adultery magazine, is committing adultery herself.

393
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:55,780
How ironic.

394
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,550
Women are scary.

395
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:06,020
I'm glad I have a wife like you.

396
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,910
Right, Hamusuke and Mihamu?

397
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,550
<i>I don't know why,</i>

398
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,120
<i>but I feel anger towards my unsuspecting husband.</i>

399
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:21,150
<i>Rikako's husband was suspicious of her,</i>

400
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:24,960
<i>pushed her into a corner, and used violence on her.</i>

401
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,070
<i>But seeing the smile on my husband's face
also made me feel the pain.</i>

402
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,000
Your phone is ringing.

403
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,600
Oh.

404
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,080
It's Noriko.

405
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:51,190
- Hello?
- Sawa? It's me.

406
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:54,780
I said too much to your husband yesterday.

407
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:58,550
- Did you get into trouble?
- No, not at all.

408
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:03,070
I was wondering why you told him about Rikako's secret.

409
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:06,930
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. But don't worry.

410
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:10,690
I didn't tell him that you have someone you like.

411
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:16,520
As an apology, why don't you come over to my house
for dinner tonight?

412
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:20,600
- What?
- Our visitors left suddenly, so we have a lot of leftover food.

413
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:25,060
I worked hard to cook the food, so I didn't want it to go to waste.

414
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:28,490
My husband also hopes that you can come.

415
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:33,120
- Your husband said that?
- How about 7PM?

416
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,350
Alright, see you tonight.

417
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:42,850
- Welcome back. Is your student okay?
- Yeah.

418
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:45,360
I'm sorry if he made you uncomfortable.

419
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:48,100
No worries. He is a teenager, after all.

420
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,840
By the way, I just spoke to Sawa.

421
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,590
Since we have leftovers, I asked her to come, and she said yes.

422
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,250
It'll be fun.

423
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,000
<i>If...</i>

424
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,150
<i>I were his wife... I might do the same thing.</i>

425
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:11,570
<i>There is no stronger feeling than jealousy.</i>

426
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:23,810
- What's wrong? Your sound serious.
- <i>I want to you to contact him.</i>

427
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:28,690
I have something to tell him, but I can't call him directly.

428
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:31,890
- It'll be expensive.
- I will treat you to anything.

429
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,730
Tell me where Rikako is.

430
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,700
I can't tell you that.

431
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:41,000
I've decided to give her up. I just want to say goodbye to her.

432
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,460
<i>You also gave him up.</i>

433
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,170
<i>You know how important it is to say goodbye, right?</i>

434
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,140
Okay, I understand.

435
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:53,840
I will head to the school right now. Yes, got it.

436
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,270
- It's rare that your colleague is calling you.
- I know.

437
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,410
He wants to discuss about the students' career pathways.

438
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:03,190
I will be back by night.

439
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:07,300
- Come back by 7PM. Sawa and her husband will be coming.
- Yup.

440
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,700
- I'm off.
- Okay.

441
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,840
It's you again.

442
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,500
I came to see you today. Not her.

443
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,770
I was surprised when I heard that Rikako ran away from home.

444
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,850
No matter how hard I tried,

445
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:42,830
she never planned to abandon that kind of lifestyle.

446
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:48,740
I've totally lost to you. No...

447
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,570
I'm totally defeated.

448
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,560
Rikako has nowhere else to go now.

449
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,050
Don't make her cry.

450
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,820
Hello?

451
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,440
<i>What's wrong?</i>

452
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,410
I can't find nice flowers to bring to Noriko.

453
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:15,900
- So I need more time to look for them.
<i> - Okay.</i>

454
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,960
<i>You don't need to let me know that.</i>

455
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,600
Keep it a secret about what we saw, okay, Mihamu?

456
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,500
<i>We were really careful.</i>

457
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,500
<i>We walked while making sure not to be too close to each other.</i>

458
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:46,980
<i>But... this is the first time</i>

459
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,920
<i>that I felt so close to him.</i>

460
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,600
He is here.

461
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,280
Thank you for coming.

462
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:05,200
- You look decent today.
- I came here to talk about your wife today.
- Let's leave that till later.

463
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,300
I have good news. Please take a seat.

464
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,070
I want to introduce someone.

465
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:14,880
- Introduce someone?
- We've received several offers

466
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:17,930
from restaurants expanding in Europe and America,

467
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:21,810
for your paintings after seeing them. If we can pull this off,

468
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:24,710
you can show your paintings to even more people.

469
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:29,560
- You will become famous overseas, too.
- Wait a minute.
- I've always felt...

470
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:34,350
that it's a shame to have your talent being buried.

471
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:38,790
I'm glad that my eye for art is on point.

472
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:45,100
There is no other offer better than this, so I felt I have to introduce you this person. Wait here for a moment.

473
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,000
This way, please.

474
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:00,500
- She is an art dealer.
- Nice  to meet you. I am Sakura.

475
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,700
This is Kato.

476
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,610
Long time no see.

477
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,350
Aki?

478
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:09,140
Don't mind the fact that we were once married.

479
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,560
Let's just talk about business.

480
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,100
This is their offer to you.

481
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,120
Three million yen.

482
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:45,800
<i>[Recruiting Hostesses]</i>
<i>[Students, housewives, unemployed etc. are welcomed!]</i>

483
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,800
Your wife...

484
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:55,020
She knows.

485
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:58,830
She went to see my husband.

486
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,290
On the day of the fireworks.

487
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:04,460
She asked him what I was doing that day.

488
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,570
So, about her inviting you to my house tonight...

489
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:09,110
Maybe...

490
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,200
it's because she is suspecting us.

491
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:15,350
I understand.

492
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:18,610
I will cancel tonight's dinner.

493
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,350
If your husband finds out...

494
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,420
you'll be cornered.

495
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,750
I'm sorry.

496
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,090
You must be having a hard time.

497
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,590
When you told me you wanted to break up,

498
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,770
I wondered why it was so sudden.

499
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:48,110
I guess it's because you found out that Noriko is my wife.

500
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,290
From now on,

501
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,890
No matter what others say,

502
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,200
no matter what happens,

503
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,790
let's not  see each other again.

504
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,270
Forever.

505
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:14,770
Forever...

506
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,960
I'm so dumb.

507
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:31,610
Even though we broke up,

508
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,600
I thought I could see you again,
because we take the train from the same station.

509
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:43,200
Even though we're on different sides of the river,

510
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,870
if I can see your face even for an instance...

511
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,730
I thought that is enough for me.

512
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,640
I didn't know.

513
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:00,910
That seeing your face would bring me so much pain.

514
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,540
People say...

515
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:30,150
that insects do not feel any pain.

516
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:35,890
Living things feel pain...

517
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,550
because they have to watch out for enemies

518
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:42,700
and try to live as long as they can.

519
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,940
But for insects,

520
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:50,440
their life span is too short

521
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,540
for them to have the need to feel pain.

522
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,730
That is one theory.

523
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,710
When you feel sad,

524
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:04,720
or hurting,

525
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:11,130
that's just because humans have a long life span.

526
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:15,720
That's how I think.

527
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,330
<i>How disgusting.</i>

528
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:36,000
- Don't waste your time and just have sex already.
- Hang on.

529
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:41,300
- We are not like that.
- We...?

530
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,780
Who else are you talking about?!

531
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,200
<i>I've never been slapped by someone,</i>

532
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,400
<i>nor slapped someone else, in my life.</i>

533
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:04,590
<i>But...</i>

534
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:10,020
<i>when one man has two women,</i>

535
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:15,390
<i>family registers don't matter.</i>

536
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:19,410
<i>What only matters is whose love...</i>

537
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:21,600
<i>is stronger, that's all.</i>

538
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,170
Where you belong

539
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:52,470
is under the dazzling lights.

540
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,470
You will be back, right?

541
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:57,820
Bitch.

542
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,860
Please give me your husband.

543
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:02,550
You're having an affair,  aren't you?

544
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:08,900
I won't tell anyone. It's our little secret.

545
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:13,120
You knew I am his wife and got close to me, right?
How despicable!

546
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:18,000
<i>[The two of them have been cornered...]</i>
