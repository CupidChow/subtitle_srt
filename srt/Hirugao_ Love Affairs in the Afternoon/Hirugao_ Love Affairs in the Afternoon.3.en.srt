1
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,510
<i>Why am I so pathetic?</i>

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,940
<i>I was alone with a man for the first time in a while.</i>

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,020
<i>I may have been too ecstatic.</i>

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,680
<i>I want to erase everything if I can.</i>

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,540
<i>I hated myself so much that I couldn't even cry.</i>

6
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,760
Please wait!

7
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,940
Do you know what you're doing?

8
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,240
What would you do if I tell your husband?

9
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,400
You won't tell.

10
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,800
Do you think I'm scared to get fired?

11
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,500
You'll never betray me.

12
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,260
Don't even think I will be happy with those words.

13
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,740
If you mess around with men,
you will burn your fingers in time to come.

14
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,260
Living with a superficial husband
in a house that's only beautiful on the outside

15
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,200
matches you well.

16
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,790
Welcome home.

17
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,490
You're home already?

18
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,220
Yeah.

19
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,670
Sorry.

20
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,330
I was concentrating on a script for my speech.

21
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,710
You brought an umbrella out today?

22
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,990
Yes.

23
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,750
What kind of speech?

24
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:30,500
A speech for the Science department, to celebrate my appointment as associate professor. I can't turn them down.

25
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,770
Here.

26
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,190
You are coming, right?

27
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:36,940
What?

28
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,620
Just come. It's the biggest moment in my life, you know?

29
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,740
I got it.

30
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,200
- I'll go.
- Great!

31
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,260
Ah! Hey...

32
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,620
Even if I become an associate professor,

33
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,240
my name won't change, will it?

34
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,300
Everyone is used to addressing me as Orihara,
and my father will be happy, too.

35
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,900
Sure.

36
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,860
We'll go with your decision then.

37
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,700
Yay!

38
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,200
I'm hungry, let's eat.

39
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,040
Yeah.

40
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,600
Here we go.

41
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,940
Sorry, I don't have time to cook.

42
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,220
It's fine. Looks delicious.

43
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,220
It was raining so hard.

44
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,700
There was a long queue at the taxi stand.

45
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,260
Will Hamumi be okay?

46
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,560
I'm worried about her.

47
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,360
Mama?

48
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,420
Sorry!

49
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,720
What is it?

50
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,110
Hamumi.

51
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,070
Will she catch a cold?

52
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,630
Oh, right.

53
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,590
I made a lost-and-found poster. What do you think?

54
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,570
I don't think it will work.

55
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,590
She's not a dog.

56
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,730
Even someone found her, nobody knows whose hamster it is.

57
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,810
Even so, are you trying to make me feel bad?

58
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:06,710
- Of course not.
- Then don't say such ridiculous things.

59
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,870
Hamsters won't catch a cold just because they were in the rain.

60
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,270
You don't need worry. I'm sure someone had found her
and feeding her lots.

61
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:14,930
What's wrong?

62
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,850
I should be the one asking you that.

63
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,990
I can't do this anymore.

64
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,890
Sorry, Mama.

65
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,950
Why are you apologizing?

66
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,790
- Because you were mad.
- Stop it! You just want to apologize, no matter what.

67
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,590
If you think you are right, then you don't need apologize.

68
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,810
<i>I'm the worst.</i>

69
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,990
<i>After I got rejected by him, I vented my anger on my husband.</i>

70
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,070
<i>But then,</i>

71
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,090
<i>I'm glad to have somebody close by to lash out at.</i>

72
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,870
<i>Unexpectedly, I think this is</i>

73
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,050
<i>the value of being husband and wife.</i>

74
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,120
Hello?

75
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,980
<i>Good job doing your laundry.</i>

76
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,200
What do you want?

77
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,120
<i>Aren't you feeling a little down?</i>

78
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,480
You can see my expression?

79
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,800
A housewife does the same thing every day,
but each time, there's a subtle difference.

80
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,240
When I stare at the hanging laundry,

81
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,110
<i>I feel like I want to vanish...</i>

82
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,460
Yeah.. I can't say I'm fine...

83
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,900
<i>Were you dumped by Mr. Kitano?</i>

84
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,900
Please stop saying such nonsense.

85
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,630
I was also dumped.

86
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,660
<i>No matter how old you will get, it's sad.</i>

87
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,360
<i>I couldn't sleep last night.</i>

88
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,700
Really?

89
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,940
I'm surprised that you can't fall asleep at times.

90
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:20,760
In love, previous experience doesn't really help you, does it?

91
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,540
You always start from zero with a new partner.

92
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,940
Maybe that's why we fell in love...

93
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,840
But it's a good thing that things didn't go well,
don't you think so?

94
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,900
It's still an affair.

95
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,900
If everyone knows, you won't have a happy ending.

96
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,080
You're lucky to get pulled back.

97
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,700
So you mean it's fine as long as you don't get caught?

98
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,660
If that's the case...

99
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,300
it should be fine as long as you're careful.

100
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:58,780
My husband won't find out about my affair,
as long as I don't bring a man over to my household.

101
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,080
I'm not giving up.

102
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:09,610
I don't know what's the purpose of me living
if I don't have someone who will look at me.

103
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,180
I know you feel the same.

104
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,600
Why are you trying to pull me into this?

105
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,440
I won't see Kitano ever again.

106
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,580
I'm busy, so I have to get going.

107

<i>I got defensive, but...</i>

108
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,470
<i>to be honest, she may be right.</i>

109
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,400
<i>If...</i>

110
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,960
<i>I knew I would definitely not get caught,</i>

111
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,460
<i>I would go see him again.</i>

112
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,920
<i>"Why don't you understand my feelings?"</i>

113
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,030
<i>I'd ask him that, and bury into his arms, crying.</i>

114
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,440
<i>I am just like her.</i>

115
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,700

00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,340

<i>[Hirugao: Love Affairs in the Afternoon]</i>

119
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
You went out for a drink last night?

120
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,360
Yeah.

121
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,460
Our job is done so we went for barbecue and karaoke.

122
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,000
Did Kato go to the gathering too?

123
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,260
The illustrator?

124
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,600
He didn't. Why ask?

125
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,300
The last time he came here, he said our food doesn't suit him.

126
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,720
How rude he is...

127
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,980
Don't mind too much about it.

128
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,780
I don't mind...

129
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,120
I'm just curious about the kind of life he's leading.

130
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,340
Who knows.

131
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,700
Nobody knows him.

132
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,620
So are you interested in the illustrator?

133
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,660
You mentioned you wanted him to paint another portrait
of you the other day.

134
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,780
Truth is, I'm rather interested in him.

135
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,940
Because he's the dangerous type whom I've never met before.

136
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,440
Yeah, right. A high-maintenance woman like you
won't be interested in a poor guy like him.

137
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,880
That's rude. Money isn't everything.

138
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,940
My deepest desire is to have a forbidden love
and elope with him.

139
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,410
Yeah, right.

140
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,680
All done.

141
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,220
Please let it come true.

142
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,200
It's always about money.

143
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,020
Should I have wished for a handsome man instead?

144
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,940
That possibility is lower than finding
a large amount of money on the street.

145
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,500
You...

146
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,220
Don't you know how to humor people?

152
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,840
Yeah. The manager said employees
can write down their wishes, too.

153
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,980
Isn't it wrong to wish for something like  that?

154
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,460
I'm faithful.

00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,960
Well, I guess no one is going to read it.

157
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,340
Why don't you write one too, Sawa?

158
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,640
Calling me by my first name?

159
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,560
I don't have any wish to make.

160
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,240
That sounds lonely.

161
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,140
I'm not lonely, I'm happy.

162
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,180
You don't look very happy though.

163
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,760
None of your business.

164
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,830
Hey, Kei.

00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,340
- Kei!
- Goto!

166
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,020
Are you drawing on your paper?

167
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,520
- Solve it properly.
- I don't know how to.

168
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,580
Kinoshita too. Wake up!

169
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,060
- Well, you worked hard, it seems.
- Amazing!

170
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,950
What are you doing?

171
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,390
Go and pick that up.

Kinoshita!

00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,770
You don't have an umbrella?

174
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,000
I'll take you home. I was also on the earlier shift.

175
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,520
I'm good. It's no big deal anyway.

176
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,250
Sorry about what I said earlier.

177
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,670
For saying that you don't look happy.

178
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,500
Why are you being nice all of a sudden?

179
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,910
I'm sorry.

180
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,750
Sorry.

181
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,830
Nobody wants to hear that from a younger man, right?

182
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,670
Hmm...

183
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:56,890
- What does that 'hmm' mean?
- I don't know why Rikako would want to go out with you,

184
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,490
but you have this adorable and honest side.

185
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,800
What are you talking about? Even so, I'm popular.

186
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,950
A married woman took a risk to have a relationship with you.

187
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,250
So just looking good is not enough.

188
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,620
I see. So it's okay for me to be confident.

189
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,390
She did go out with me once.

190
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,270
I don't know. Maybe she was just bored.

191
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,030
You're horrible.

192
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,960
- I can say anything I want, because it's you.
- Eh?

193
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,790
Does that mean you're falling in love with me?

194
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,730
Huh?

195
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,770
I'm sorry, but I only have Rikako in my mind.

196
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:30,270
Aren't you an idiot? I can say anything
because I'm not attracted to you.

197
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,450
What the heck?

198
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,490
Isn't he the teacher from before?

199
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,680
Um, here.

200
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,450
Please excuse me for coming unannounced.

201
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,120
<i>Adultery is not a fairy tale.</i>

202
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,920
<i>Falling for another man</i>

203
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,620
<i>while being a married woman,</i>

204
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,660
<i>from a logical point of view,</i>

205
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,700
<i>is like a broken machine.</i>

206
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,680
<i>Maybe that person...</i>

207
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,110
<i>thinks that I'm a loose woman
who'd share an umbrella with any other man.</i>

208
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,880
<i>It's sad, but... </i>

209
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,300
<i>I'm relieved.</i>

210
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,220
<i>It's better that he hates me, so I won't expect anything from him.</i>

211
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,660
<i>I'll probably not meet him anymore.</i>

212
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,420
<i>Goodbye, my pathetic love.</i>

213
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:47,230
<i>Goodbye, the foolish and shameful me.</i>

214
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,520
<i>Goodbye,</i>

215
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,260
<i>Mr. Kitano.</i>

216
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,200
Hamumi?

217
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,850
Hamumi.

218
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,600
Ah!

219
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,560
I deleted it.

220
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,800
The mouse ran away, you said?

221
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,480
I accidentally let her get away.

222
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:35,380
- But just now...
- You seem really lonely, aren't ya?

223
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,720
You bought another one?

224
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,900
It's not good for him to be alone.

225
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,700
Hello there.

226
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,570
Meet your new wife.

227
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:51,110
New wife?

228
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:54,830
They're already getting along well
even though they've just met each other.

229
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,420
Look.

230
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:02,320
I guess Shunsuke is better a new wife, too.

231
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,790
Don't think that way.

232
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,690
I hope you guys make up

233
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:13,980
and have lots of children.

234
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,670
Well, I'll help you make dinner.

235
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:21,130
What time will he come home?

236
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:24,000
I bought yam again.

237
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,820
Yam, and stir-fried pork liver with chives.

238
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:31,880
Food is important. You should learn how to cook properly.

239
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,900
Mom, we may not be able to have children.

240
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,660
I didn't tell you since you were looking forward to it so much.

241
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,600
But I don't think you can have a grandchild.

242
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,970
What do you mean?

243
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,310
I was waiting for you.

244
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,210
Eh?

245
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,570
Well that...

246
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,350
I wonder...

247
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,430
What kind of problem?

248
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:23,190
Please, ask Shunsuke.

249
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,610
Thanks for your hard work.

250
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,570
You're welcome.

251
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,430
<i>Please welcome Dr. Noriko Orihara from
the Molecular Biology lab.</i>

252
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,060
<i>Dr. Orihara, over to you.</i>

253
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,870
<i>Hello, everyone. I am Orihara.</i>

254
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:00,980
<i>Regarding the topic of my research...</i>

255
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,400
Was it bad that that teacher saw us sharing an umbrella?

256
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,800
- Not really.
But...

257
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,300
Stop that unnecessary talk and keep working.

258
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,760
Good afternoon.

259
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,980
Rikako!

260
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,220
Who are you?

261
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,680
Didn't you come here to see me?

262
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,080
Could you have gotten the wrong person?

263
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,440
Do you have any bamboo for the Tanabata Festival?

264
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,100
My kids want to decorate it.

265
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,400
This way, please.

266
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,930
You are too cold to him.

267
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,730
When you meet, be flirtatious.

268
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,530
When you break up, be cruel.

269
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,880
A woman's golden rule.

270
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,630
Here you go, Madam.

271
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:56,830
Paper strips are available here, too.

272
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:02,410
Ah, it's been so long!

273
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,900
We met before, right?

274
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,400
- Hello.
- Thank you. It was delicious.

275
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,510
Glad to hear that. Our special for today
is the spicy fried chicken bento box.

276
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:15,500
Sorry, I have to cook for today.

277
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,790
My husband may not like it if we keep eating from bento boxes.

278
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:24,090
But I don't like cook at all, and I don't know how to cook either.

279
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:27,530
<i>[I wish I can divorce my husband soon. - Yukako]</i>

280
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,950
In that case...

281
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,530
you can ask this lady here for advice.

282
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:34,560
She is very good at cooking.

283
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,850
What?

284
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,410
Here it is.

285
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:42,350
If you follow this, you'll be okay.

286
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,030
How many people in your family?

287
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,450
It's just me and my husband.

288
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,390
Then you can make sweet-and-sour pork, salad,

289
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:54,880
and maybe some minced bonito, too?

290
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,880
Are you feeling unwell?

291
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:07,140
Well, when I see words like "stir-fry" and "deep-fry",
it kind of puts me off.

292
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,340
You hate cooking that much?

293
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:13,380
Don't laugh, please!

294
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,300
We decided to have dinner together at my place tonight.

295
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:21,460
- That's fast!
- My kids happen to want to celebrate the Tanabata Festival.

296
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,620
Let's do it with all three families.

297
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,780
- Three families?
- You and your husband should come, too.

298
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,260
She will bring her husband along, too.

299
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,020
Is everything okay? Was it because you couldn't reject her?

300
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:36,960
Of course not! I'll be glad to go, since I don't have to cook.

301
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,220
This time it's good.

302
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,220
I thought you would say that.

303
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,650
You feel like you sold your soul to the devil, right?

304
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,360
Of course not. I'm grateful to you.

305
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,140
You helped me make a living by hiring me.

306
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,020
That sounds creepy.

307
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,240
You're surprisingly honest today.

308
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,200
Thank you for the hard work.

309
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,270
Kato, hang on a second.

310
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:19,630
Who is this model?

311
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,000
You're curious to know?

312
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,090
It's not that I'm curious. I'm simply asking you as editor-in-chief.

313
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,430
I can't tell you.

314
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:36,650
Do you seriously want to make a living?

315
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:40,210
- Of course.
- I'm afraid you don't look like you do.

316
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,500
It seems that you don't like me ever since we met.

317
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,900
You were the one who didn't like me.

318
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:53,200
An artist is like a mother cat who just lost her kittens.

319
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,810
He thinks that everyone is his enemy.

320
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:59,150
And I'm currently hiring that aggressive cat.

321
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:01,450
If I don't like you then I can't hire you.

322
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:04,240
You should trust me a little.

323
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,630
So, who is this model?

324
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,190
I can't tell you.

325
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:26,490
I'm sorry, Kato.

326
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:29,840
Our contract ends today.

327
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,460
Then you don't need this.

328
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,160
I'll take it then.

329
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,320
Hello?

330
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:53,840
I've invited Sawa and another friend, as well as their husbands over tonight to celebrate Tanabata Festival.

331
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,460
The Tanabata Festival, huh?

332
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,000
Never mind that.

333
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,820
About that artist you said you were interested in?
I've fired him.

334
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,160
Really? You couldn't quite get along with him, right?

335
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,250
<i>Right. I feel much better now.</i>

336
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,900
<i>I gotta go.</i>

337
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:20,350
Hmm...

338
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,290
I'm not going.

339
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,050
I'm not good with strangers.

340
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:27,430
What? Let's go together!

341
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:30,090
This is my debut as a wife, you know?

342
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,790
I'll call you after work.

343
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,850
Will you be able to come?

344
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,550
Um...

345
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:42,700
I'm having a meeting with my supplier.
So I think I'll be a little late. I'll meet you there.

346
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,810
<i>Got it. Bye then.</i>

347
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,050
It was Sawa, right? What did she want?

348
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,550
She asked me to go with her to her friend's house.

349
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,970
You two get along so well.

350
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:02,830
What do you mean that you can't have kids?

351
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:10,030
If I beat around the bush, you might misunderstand,
so let me be clear.

352
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:12,550
Then be clear.

353
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:18,170
We...

354
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:23,230
- are...
- What is it, Shun?

355
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,990
Sorry. It's hard for me to say it.

356
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:30,430
- Sawa and I should settle this as a couple.
- So you're not having sex?

357
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:34,190
Just as I thought.

358
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:36,590
You guys aren't having sex, are you?

359
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,370
What? No... well...

360
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,050
Thank you.

361
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,070
Do you want to divorce her?

362
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,070
We are doing fine.

363
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:50,800
Can't you close your eyes and do it?
I heard that some men do like that?

364
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,540
What are you talking about?

365
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:56,490
If you don't anything about it,
other men will take  Sawa away from you.

366
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,950
There aren't any other men in her life.

367
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:31,180
♫ Bamboo leaves are rustling, rustling ♫

368
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:35,000
♫ Swaying close to the roof's edge ♫

369
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,960
Dinner is ready.

370
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,840
- Mana, Hina, come over here.
- Okay.

371
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,200
- Where is Dad?
- He won't be home this early, silly.

372
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,240
Then we ladies shall eat first.

373
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,700
The men will show up later.

374
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,740
Wow, your washroom is huge, too!

375
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,940
Woah!

376
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,500
It looks delicious!

377
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,500
- I'm so happy because I always eat at the school canteen.
- School canteen?

378
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,360
Are you a student?

379
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,720
I work at a university.

380
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,200
- Wow! You're a  professor?
- Professor?

381
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,370
Not a professor, but an associate professor.
There's a big difference.

382
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:12,020
But that's amazing.

383
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,600
Being a science teacher is a big deal.

384
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,210
Totally not. I studied because I didn't want to work.

385
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,290
I love my husband,

386
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:24,590
but I hate cooking and cleaning. Aren't I an awful wife?

387
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:27,050
-  Shall we all sit?
- Sure.

388
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,740
Is your husband also a professor?

389
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,300
You can say that. He's part of a research group.

390
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:03,350
Good evening!

391
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,490
Oh, hello!

392
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:08,590
You must be dreading about
hanging around your wife's friends, right?

393
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:11,050
No, not at all.

394
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,310
Well... let's go.

395
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,970
If you're looking for Sawa, she ends work at 3PM.

396
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,610
Oh.

397
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:35,010
Don't misunderstand. There's nothing between us.

398
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,050
This month's feature is interesting, isn't it?

399
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,850
"Wives who cheat in broad daylight".

400
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:46,300
It's my most popular feature.

401
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:51,490
Thought it's also criticized for encouraging housewives to do so.

402
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,740
Well, you don't have to worry about that.

403
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,350
It'll be boring if the world gets too serious.

404
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,700
Have you ever thought about working?

405
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,400
I don't think I can handle being a housewife.

406
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,400
Working is much easier, isn't it?

407
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:16,520
But a man wants to think that he's making a living
for his wife and children, right?

408
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:21,420
I don't work so that he can do his part as a father.

409
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:25,180
Even if he gets a lower paycheck.

410
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:28,320
I didn't think you'd plan that far ahead.

411
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,520
You're really perfect.

412
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:34,920
But even for Rikako, there are nights when she can't sleep.

413
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,500
Nights that are so painful that she can't sleep.

414
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,460
- Right?
- Like when?

415
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,620
Like after fighting with her husband.

416
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,090
- Ah...
- Sawa?

417
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:52,300
You wanted to say times when love isn't going well for me, don't you?

418
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,000
Love?

419
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,420
You see, I have a man I like, and is not my husband.

420
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,920
Of course, my husband doesn't know about it.

421
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,380
Totally.

422
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,460
But...

423
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:17,410
If your own wife is having an affair, then what would you do?

424
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,520
Nah... That definitely won't happen to me.

425
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:25,900
I always thought that, too.

426
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:31,150
You're scaring Mariko. I'm sorry, she's lying.

427
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:34,830
She's great at cooking, but says pretty weird things sometimes.

428
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:39,830
It's fine. We're not kids.

429
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,530
I, too,

430
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:44,090
had an affair before.

431
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:51,050
But that's all in the past. Before I got married,
I had a relationship with a married man.

432
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:55,580
He was a college professor. I fell into an abyss and got hurt.

433
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,380
The man who saved me from that is my husband now.

434
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:04,300
You're really strong. You overcame that and become wiser.

435
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,880
Sawa, you should confess about something, too.

436
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,840
It's unfair that only Rikako and I are talking about it.

437
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:15,800
- Me?
-  I don't expect you to tell us anything interesting.

438
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:21,320
I'm sure she has. I think you can be passionate, even if you don't look like it.

439
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,800
Not really...

440
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,960
I...

441
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,620
Surprisingly, you wife may be close to you,
yet you don't realize it.

442
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,100
No way.

443
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,060
I wasn't looking for her.

444
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:40,460
Then why did you come?

445
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,010
I wanted to apologize.

446
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,780
I was rude and hurt her.

447
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:51,180
How is that not looking for her?

448
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,360
You and Sawa are alike.

449
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,980
Be it a school teacher,

450
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,050
or someone's wife,

451
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:05,800
aren't there times when you'd fall
hopelessly in love with someone?

452
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,740
I liked my homeroom teacher in high school.

453
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,060
He liked me too.

454
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,250
And we started meeting up.

455
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,510
So...

456
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:22,790
- did you do it?
- We didn't do anything!

457
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,770
But rumors started to spread.

458
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:28,270
They were all lies, saying things like
we'd gone to a hotel together.

459
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:32,430
I lost all my friends after that.

460
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:35,910
After that, I was scared to make friends.

461
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:40,710
Thinking that they would leave even if we were close.

462
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:45,390
I won't leave you.

463
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:50,970
We're accomplices, after all.

464
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,390
Accomplices?

465
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,070
Could it be...

466
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,530
that you fell in love too, Sawa?

467
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,230
Aren't you going to meet her?

468
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,390
Where?

469
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:08,370
I know where your Star Vega lives.

470
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,630
- Just go there.
- Idiot.

471
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:13,510
- She has a husband.
- Idiot.

472
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,930
I know that pain so well.

473
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:20,370
It's fine if you just go see her.

474
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:23,990
- Just looking at her window makes your heart go...
- No!

475
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,970
I have an appointment with my wife.

476
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:31,930
What the hell? How boring.

477
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:35,270
In that case...

478
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:38,110
If I win you, then go see her, alright?

479
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,910
Ready? Go!

480
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:49,990
No, no, no. It's not exactly love.

481
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:53,830
I just like him a little.

482
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,910
But I've already given up.

483
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:59,490
She's boring, isn't she? Ending things all on her own.

484
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:02,750
It's the same as when you were in high school.

485
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:07,470
You did your best to hide your feelings
and didn't do anything wrong, but the rumors still started, right?

486
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:12,090
In that case, wouldn't it be better to live on your own terms.

487
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:14,730
I think so, too.

488
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:18,030
Are you sure? You must be influenced by her.

489
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,890
Back at the lab,

490
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:23,830
I researched on the probability of two people
destined to meet each other.

491
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,130
I won't go into the details,

492
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,210
but compared to the world's population,

493
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:33,310
the probability of two people destined to meet,
is one in 18 billion.

494
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:36,400
That number shows it really takes a miracle to find each other.

495
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,570
Meeting your destined one is a miracle. You should treasure it.

496
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:50,370
I'm home.

497
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:37,970
I heard you got fired.

498
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:41,970
I figured you didn't like bread, so I made a rice ball for you today.

499
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:49,330
Trying to find your way into a man's heart through cooking?
What a cheap trick.

500
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,950
Really?

501
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,930
Hey!

502
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,350
That painting is...

503
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,430
When I showed it to him, I was fired.

504
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:41,970
You have everything that a normal woman wants.

505
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:44,310
Why are you still so hungry?

506
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:51,490
You're the one who's hungry. Eat up.

507
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,380
Spicy!

508
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,980
I put poison in it.

509
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,130
Just kidding.

510
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,520
Because you said you don't like my cooking,

511
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,680
so I put in extra jalapenos.

512
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,780
You see...

513
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:36,400
I may don't look like it but I don't make advances at men.

514
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,660
Because I don't want to take away the fun from them.

515
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:46,000
But it seems like I don't need to do that to you.

516
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,760
- Here you go.
- Sure.

517
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,060
Good morning.

518
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,700
- Good morning.
- Oh!

519
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,250
Kitano came yesterday.

520
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:10,140
He was worried that he had hurt you.

521
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:36,010
Good afternoon.

522
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,450
Ouch!

523
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:20,070
Ouch...

524
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,250
Are you okay?

525
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,880
Um...

526
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,040
I'm not hurt.

527
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,180
But your forehead's turning red.

528
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,410
I'm not talking about my forehead.

529
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,990
In any case,

530
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:42,610
you don't have to worry about me.

531
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,780
Wait!

532
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,640
Well...

533
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:03,040
will you go to that park with me one more time?

534
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,200
We're not done with

535
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,300
our chat about the stag beetle.

536
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,220
- I have to go make dinner.
- Of course...

537
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,130
Just until sunset.

538
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,180
You're disgusting.

539
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,840
This time you're the one...

540
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,540
- thinking about doing it.
- I'm the one?

541
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,840
- Do what?
- Stop playing dumb!

542
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,320
You want to kiss me, don't you?

543
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,720
Why do you think that?

544
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,800
- You look like you've been wanting to do that.
- In the first place,

545
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,500
- is that how you see me?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

546
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,160
- You perverted teacher.
- What?

547
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,900
Then that would make you...

548
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,960
- A perverted part-timer... perverted wife. Perverted wife!
- You're so rude!

549
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,240
You sullen glasses guy.

550
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,200
I'm going there now.

551
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,420
<i>Fighting or whatever is fine.</i>

552
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,820
<i>I don't need kind words.</i>

553
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,620
<i>I just...</i>

554
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:17,120
<i>want to be with him a bit longer.</i>

555
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:32,870
Say something.

556
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,410
I...

557
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:43,670
am hurt.

558
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,290
You...

559
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,790
were sharing an umbrella with a man.

560
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:56,990
Sorry. I guess I'm crazy.

561
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:58,390
No!

562
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:02,490
I am...

563
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:04,930
actually...

564
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:07,710
very hurt, too.

565
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,640
So uncool.

566
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,580
He is acting like a middle school kid.

567
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:51,420
What are you going to do?

568
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,240
I wonder what I should do.

569
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,570
<i>To be honest,</i>

570
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,690
<i>I just want to go somewhere far away.</i>

571
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,200
<i>I still...</i>

572
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,360
<i>don't have the guts to go against the world yet.</i>

573
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:55,520
♫ <i>You and I met as strangers</i> ♫

574
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:00,820
♫ <i>Last night was last night, and tonight is tonight</i> ♫

575
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,520
♫ <i>Ticklish fingers</i> ♫

576
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,240
♫ <i>Counting the moles</i> ♫

577
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,760
♫ <i>Counting from one again</i> ♫

578
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:16,080
♫ <i>That's right, we're igniting each other once more</i> ♫

579
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:23,880
♫ <i>when we first meet</i> ♫

580
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:30,290
♫ <i>It's okay</i> ♫

581
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:32,810
♫ <i>If you forget about me</i> ♫

582
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:37,370
♫ <i>It's okay if you got astray</i> ♫

583
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:42,770
♫ <i>I will return time and time again</i> ♫

584
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:48,910
♫ <i>I will show you that I will return</i> ♫

585
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:51,870
♫ <i>Ba ba ba la ba</i> ♫

586
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:58,750
You just wanted someone.

587
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:02,430
Our chance will come next time.
They definitely can't turn back now.

588
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:07,090
- I bet he's suspecting you and me.
- I wonder if I'm pregnant.

589
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:10,250
- You weren't as good as you said you would be.
- You'll lose everything if he finds out.

590
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:14,900
- You're home late.
- I thought you'd reciprocate my feelings.

591
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,770
What is your wife's name?

592
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:22,300
Love makes a woman beautiful,
but an affair makes a woman strong.

593
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:25,100
Sawa, you've become strong.
