1
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,130
<i>Just for a moment. I want to be held in those arms.</i>

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:15,550
<i>Just that would be enough.  I don't want anything more than that.</i>

3
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:21,390
<i>I always thought that, but...</i>

4
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:29,500
<i>The moment he held me, I held him tight without realizing it.</i>

5
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:34,110
<i>I wanted to know him even more.</i>

6
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:40,710
<i>There's a side of me that I wasn't aware of.</i>

7
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,910
It's red.

8
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,240
What?

9
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,090
The sunset.

10
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,490
Oh.

11
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,510
Do you want a drink?

12
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,490
Thank you.

13
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,410
I guess it's obvious that the sunset's red.

14
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:09,510
No. The sunset in Mars is blue.

15
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,650
You're kidding.

16
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,310
I am not. On Earth, because of particles in the atmosphere,

17
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:20,370
the sky appears blue in the day, and red in the evening.

18
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:26,830
The atmospheric particles in Mars are the opposite. So the sky appears red in the day, and blue in the evening.

19
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,690
I had no idea.

20
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:37,590
But if the sunset is blue, I might not know when to go home.

21
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,240
We'll stay here a little while longer.... and then go home.

22
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,390
Do you have any regrets?

23
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,010
It's just that if we do more than this...

24
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,010
we can't turn back anymore.

25
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,990
You're telling me that we can still turn back now?

26
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:13,230
I... don't think I can turn back anymore.

27
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,070
It's the same for me.

28
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,090
But I may end up hurting you.

29
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,390
So uncool.

30
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,750
We've come all this way and you're now telling me that?
We're adults in our thirties, you know?

31
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,390
We're adults, that's why we're confused.

32
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,530
Let's make a bet.

33
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,050
A bet?

34
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,670
What kind of bet?

35
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,390
If the next person on that road...

36
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:03,330
See that white board? If the next person to pass that board
is a female, we'll stay as friends.

37
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:10,070
If it's a male, we'll be together.

38
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,550
I'm serious.

39
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,010
Because we can't make up our minds.

40
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,850
What if it's a Martian?

41
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,760
We'll never meet again.

42
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,530
Please stop. I'm begging you.

43
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,670
I won't forgive you.

44
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,070
Stop looking so sad.

45
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:51,480
I love you, Rikako. I'll make you happy.

46
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,390
You just want to have sex with me, right?
Then hurry up and do it.

47
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,990
Didn't you go out with me knowing that I'm married?

48
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:06,410
It's not that! I can bear with it if it's your husband.
But another man? I can't handle that.

49
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,350
Call that guy and tell him that you will break up with him.

50
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,270
Stop it! He has nothing to do with this!

51
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,330
<i>Hello? Sorry to bother you.</i>

52
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,550
<i>I'm being held hostage in a hotel by my ex-boyfriend.</i>

53
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,230
- I'm busy. I'm hanging up.
<i>- Wait! I'm not kidding.</i>

54
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:51,070
He wants me for himself and got it into his head
that we're a thing. I told him it's not like that, but...

55
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:57,960
Hey! Tell me. Hey!

56
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,570
<i>Don't you dare touch Rikako again.</i>

57
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,290
You can't boss me around.

58
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,010
<i>What did you say?!</i>

59
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,350
Rikako is my woman.

60
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,490
What did you say?

61
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,370
No one's passing by.

62
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,590
I know, right?

63
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,590
Is that a female?

64
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,410
What was it again if it's a girl?

65
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,570
So we're friends.

66
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,550
But there are guys, too!

67
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,430
All right!

68
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,830
Come over!

69
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,150
Huh?

70
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,090
Are they trying to pick the girls up?

71
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:58,490
- A bike's coming!
- It's a guy! Come this way!

72
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,970
- Come on, come on!
- He is walking ahead!

73
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,090
Come on! Come on! Come on!

74
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,350
What? He stopped.

75
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,830
What the hell?

76
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,430
Come on. Ah! They're done hitting on the girls.

77
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,550
He got rejected.

78
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,850
He got rejected. The one with the bicycle.

79
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,810
- Are they talking?
- Maybe they're friends?

80
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,630
Hey.

81
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,810
It ended up being a Martian.

82
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,970
Is it male?

83
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,250
Or female? I'm going to go ask.

84
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,630
Hey.

85
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,770
It doesn't matter.

86
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,990
Can you tell me why?

87
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,390
Even though I don't know you very well,

88
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,570
I love you so much.

89
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,130
Then why don't you start to hate me?

90
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,070
Huh?

91
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,270
You're the worst.

92
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,910
I know, right?

93
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,250
Because you're the worst kind of guy.

94
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:32,950
A scumbag, asshole, perverted teacher.

95
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:39,450
Indecisive. And cowardly.

96
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:44,570
Your clothes are out of fashion and you're boring.

97
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,450
But I know that you love stories of Martians.

98
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,550

It's fine. I'll go by myself.

But what happens if you're dragged into something dangerous?

148
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,110
Then all the more you shouldn't go.

- Yes.
- Thank you.

164
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,750
Excuse me. I met you at Rikako's house before, right?

165
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,080
Why you are here?

166
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,750

00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,400
Hold up. Who are you?

172
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:46,160
I'm nobody. Just someone who knows Rikako better than you.

173
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,090
Rikako loves me.

174
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,450

- You said there was nothing between you two!
- Tomoya!

180
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,060
Shut up, old man.

181
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,650
Stop it, Tomoya.

182
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,690
What you're doing is really pathetic.

183
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:21,040
If you don't want Rikako to hate you,
then apologize to her and leave.

184
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,090
You can't vent it on her just because
things aren't going well for you.

185
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:28,210
You don't love Rikako.

186
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,840
You're just lonely.

187
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,700
Is he really okay?

188
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,270
Shut up.

189
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,820
Shut the F-ck up!

190
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,590
I'm sorry.

191
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:10,570
I have no right to have an affair if I can't clean up my own mess.

192
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:14,460
I'll behave myself for the time being.

193
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,920
If you're really sorry then hurry up and go home.

194
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,490
Your husband is really keeping an eye on you.

195
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,910
My husband?

196
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,330
He was at the lobby when I came here.

197
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,320
He saw you?

198
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,000
No way.

199
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,640
Did my husband say I wasn't answering my phone?

200
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,950
Yes.

201
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,110
He didn't call me.

202
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,670
What?

203
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,340
That's just like him.

204
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,880
He won't call me directly.
He'll start with the people around me first.

205
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,920
It really seemed like he was worried about you.

206
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,520
Of course not.

207
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:01,800
He just wants a beautiful wife and a good mother.

208
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:08,970
He'll only be worried about the mess he has to clean up,
and the humiliation he'll face.

209
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:19,970
In that case... we should make this a perfect crime.

210
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,340
A perfect crime?

211
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:25,500
We came to this hotel for an all-you-can-eat cake buffet.

212
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,970
But you lost your phone and I couldn't find you.

213
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,820
By the time we met up and you found your phone,

214
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,440
it was already this late.

215
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,150
It's rare.

216
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,340
Are you cooperating with me?

217
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,940
Because I also want to be able to say that I was with you.

218
00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:01,000
Were you... with that teacher?

219
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,470
So that's what's going on.

220
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,520
And? How do you feel?

221
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:24,010
I'm happy. The happiest I've ever been.

222
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:28,190
Decent people like you are the scariest.

223
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,690
I'm sorry.

224
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,270
Don't apologize.

225
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,760
You've already stepped into this pit.
You have to become a bad woman.

226
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,950
If you show the slightest sense of guilt,
your husband will find out.

227
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:46,020
Rather than the fling itself, being caught is the real crime.

228
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,070
Be a wicked woman.

229
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,050
Call my husband.

230
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,370
Tell him I'm buying you dinner for helping me find my phone.

231
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,950
Now?

232
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,880
When the first hiccup happens, it's easy for loopholes to appear.

233
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,190
It's better if we're together.

234
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:13,770
I don't feel like facing my husband alone today.

235
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,620
Alright, smile.

236
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,810
Smile more.

237
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,680
I'm sorry for bothering you.

238
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,980
You should be sorry.
We missed the all-you-can-eat buffet, after all.

239
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,450
Why you do have an accent?

240
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,440
As an apology, let me treat you to dinner at my place.

241
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,990
I bet your kids are worried about you.

242
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:52,430
<i>[Timing and Subtitles brought to you by Hirugao Team@viki]</i>

243
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,160
Welcome back.

244
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,740
I'm home.

245
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,630
What's wrong?

246
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:13,780
I was planning on showering, since I was perspiring.

247
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,020
How was it?

248
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,480
How was what?

249
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,380
Collecting insects?

250
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,420
I found a jewel beetle.

251
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,640
Huh?

252
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,820
What?

253
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,650
You stink of sweat.

254
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,810
I can't help it.

255
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,390
It was a blessing in disguise.

256
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:45,500
Because you lost your cell phone,
we're now having a meal with friends.

257
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,200
But I'm kind of upset.

258
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,050
I ended up missing the buffet.

259
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,920
I'll take you there next time.

260
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,670
Your husband's so nice to you.

261
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:02,360
She's my most precious wife in the world, after all.

262
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,620
Not me and Hina?

263
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:10,610
Of course. Because you will get married and leave us someday.

264
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:14,360
Mom and Dad are together for life.

265
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,590
Yeah right. Thanks for dinner.

266
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,120
You're mad? That wasn't a joke, was it?

267
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,670
Can I play with the fireworks that Sawa gave us?

268
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,090
Oh, right. Of course.

269
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,950
Be careful with the fire! Mana, go help her with it.

270
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,570
Got it. Thank you for the meal.

271
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:29,170
- Get a bucket of water ready.
- I will.

272
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:32,280
As expected of someone in the media industry.

273
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,180
There's no way I can proclaim that my wife is the best.

274
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:42,160
If you say that, Sawa might start cheating on you.

275
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,330
What?

276
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,840
It's scary to have your wife cheating on you during the day.

277
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,770
She looks like she's never killed a bug in her life,
but she's drowning in adultery.

278
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:54,640
Don't worry. We're totally fine.

279
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,440
He's right. No way Sawa would do such a thing.

280
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,210
That's right.

281
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,480
I don't know about me, though.

282
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,790
I have a confession.

283
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:14,010
Actually, I had a date with a young man this afternoon.

284
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,490
Just kidding!

285
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,990
No way I can do that.

286
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:24,770
I envy those wives who cheat in the day. Right, Sawa?

287
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,720
Hmm?

288
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,130
Are you trying to make your husband jealous?

289
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,620
You found me out.

290
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,930
I can't lie so no way I can have an affair.

291
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,570
I know, right? It's so obvious when you lie.

292
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:42,080
Rikako's just the same.

293
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,030
<i>It felt uncomfortable to lie when I hadn't before.</i>

294
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:51,220
<i>I couldn't enjoy the meal that I was given.</i>

295
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:58,530
<i>But if I don't lie, I won't be able to meet him anymore.</i>

296
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,740
Excuse me!

297
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,430
What happened?

298
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,650
Sit down.

299
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,300
Mr. Kitano! See you tomorrow!

300
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,550
See you tomorrow!

301
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,390
See you!

302
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,810
Sorry.

303
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,730
Thank you.

304
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:37,190
You'll get in trouble if we're seen, right?

305
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,450
Yeah.

306
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,320
Everything was fine yesterday.

307
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,380
I thought you may be worried about me.

308
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,800
I'm glad.

309
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,970
Don't look at me. People are watching.

310
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,430
I thought about calling you.

311
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:05,550
But your wife may be beside you when I call.

312
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,510
Same here.

313
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,880
Is it okay if we text each other?

314
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,300
Yeah.

315
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,470
Then let's set some rules.

316
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:22,910
We won't call, and we'll erase our texts as soon as we read them.

317
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:27,700
And if there's no answer, we won't send any more texts.

318
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:33,030
I don't want to break your relationship with your wife.

319
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,650
Don't look.

320
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:49,110
We'll meet again, right?

321
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:04,860
<i>He didn't say he wants to see me.</i>

322
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,050
<i>Is it because our relationship is forbidden?</i>

323
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:15,100
<i>Or perhaps he got bored with me after that one time?</i>

324
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,210
<i>Boss, come to the reception office.</i>

325
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,560
<i>What happened?</i>

326
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,050
<i>Nobody's here.</i>

327
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:33,960
<i>Come quickly! Kiss me!</i>

328
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,880
Sorry for coming so suddenly.

329
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,570
What are you doing here?

330
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:56,460
I was just nearby.

331
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,560
I see.

332
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,850
Excuse me.

333
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:07,420
As a favor for your continuous support,
I thought I'd give these to you.

334
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,270
I hope you like them.

335
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,400
- Fireworks festival?
- Wow!

336
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,280
My company is one of the sponsors.

337
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,640
So I can get you good seats.

338
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:20,000
How about going together?

339
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,530
- What?
- Yay!

340
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,350
You? Wait a second.

341
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:27,850
You should treat your subordinate well when you have a chance.

342
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,500
I'll be going, too.

343
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,550
- Thank you.
- Wait. But Rikako will be...

344
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,520
Hooray! I wanted to go there.

345
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,060
I wanted to go, too.

346
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:39,250
The three of us will go together.

347
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,420
What about Mom?

348
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:45,990
Look. Your mom always busy taking care of us.

349
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,880
She needs some alone time. Let her rest.

350
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,590
Is that okay?

351
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:55,270
We'll eat dinner before we come back home.

352
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,850
So you should eat out, too.

353
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:03,780
Oh, right. I invited Mr. Sasamoto, too.

354
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:09,880
So... I guess Sawa won't have any plans, too.

355
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,550
You guys missed it the other time.

356
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:15,270
That hotel buffet. Why don't you try going with her again?

357
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,450
Really?

358
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:26,250
I bet my husband felt sorry for being suspicious of me.

359
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:31,050
I rarely have free time on weekends,

360
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,990
<i>so we should have some fun.</i>

361
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,590
You know what I mean, right?

362
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,510
That's just a front.

363
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,550
I know.

364
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,960
I'll text him.

365
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,590
I'll see you on Saturday.

366
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:53,870
<i>[Timing and Subtitles brought to you by Hirugao Team@viki]</i>

367
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:01,420
I want to apologize for saying too much the other day.

368
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,210
What was it about again?

369
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:11,410
Sex... not being able to have children...

370
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:14,610
You're the one who's having a hard time as a woman.

371
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:18,210
But I spoke like I was blaming you.

372
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,710
It's fine.

373
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,460
You're not mad?

374
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,500
I'm not mad.

375
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,300
Mom, you'll eat before you go, right?

376
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:32,300
We having stir-fried eggplant for dinner. Is that okay with you?

377
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,510
Of course.

378
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:36,950
Please make yourself at home.

379
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,200
Sawa...

380
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,090
Yes?

381
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:44,710
Are you using new makeup?

382
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,460
What?

383
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,950
I'm back!

384
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,640
Welcome home!

385
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,800
Your mom is here.

386
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,770
You come by a lot recently, don't you?

387
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,880
Take a shower first. I'll get your beer ready.

388
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,840
I'm getting attached to your hamsters.

389
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,910
Here.

390
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,480
What is that?

391
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,300
You named it Mihamu? That's so impromptu.
[Hamusuke - Mihamu]

392
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,460
Hey...

393
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,560
Do you have plans on Saturday night?

394
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,610
Why?

395
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:24,760
I was invited by Mr. Takigawa to the fireworks festival.

396
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,020
Do you mind if I go there with my subordinate?

397
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:30,380
Go ahead. It sounds fun.

398
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,920
Shun, you should go with Sawa!

399
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,610
Huh?

400
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,670
It's not work, right?

401
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,340
It's not about work, but...

402
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,700
You should be nice to Sawa every once a while.

403
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,340
It's fine. I don't mind.

404
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,050
But...

405
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,270
Have fun.

406
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,940
Thanks. Maybe I should have dinner first.

407
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,330
I'm hungry.

408
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,030
Fireworks is a kind of stimulation.

409
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:54,200
So the two of you should go "Bang" on special days like  that.

410
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,050
What the heck are you saying?

411
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,480
I mean...

412
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,450
I'm going to take a bath, Mama.

413
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,960
Okay.

414
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:30,650
<i>Are you busy on Saturday?</i>

415
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,530
<i>I'm free until evening.</i>

416
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,750
<i>[Sending]</i>

417
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:24,080
Mabo-pineapple.

418
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,190
<i>We won't call.</i>

419
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:40,190
<i>We'll delete our texts immediately.</i>

420
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:44,450
<i>If there's no reply, we won't text again.</i>

421
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,650
<i>We won't call.</i>

422
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,770
<i>We'll delete our texts immediately.</i>

423
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:02,750
Why don't you lie on the bed?

424
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:06,810
<i>If there's no reply, we won't text again.</i>

425
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:08,400
<i>We won't call.</i>

426
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,800
<i>If there's no reply, we won't text again.</i>

427
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,360
<i>If there's no reply...</i>
<i>[You have no new messages]</i>

428
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:30,960
<i>He still hasn't replied.</i>

429
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,490
<i>But if you having an affair, you can't blame him.</i>

430
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:39,400
<i>And you can't seek advice from anyone.</i>

431
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:44,340
<i>I slept while hugging my phone.</i>

432
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:50,350
<i>My husband didn't notice what I was doing.</i>

433
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,860
You did the laundry?

434
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,130
Once in a while. Since I've finished my thesis.

435
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:03,200
When I sent it to the professor,
he asked me to give a speech at the academic conference.

436
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,250
- That's awesome!
- I know!

437
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,100
Oh, I see.

438
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,140
<i>What if it's a Martian?</i>

439
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,500
<i>We'll never meet again.</i>

440
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,700
Hey Yuichiro, want to go to the fireworks festival tonight?

441
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,390
What?

442
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:27,240
I feel bad that I'm always busy working
even on my days off.

443
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:30,640
Let's watch the fireworks and then go eat sushi.

444
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,590
I have a meeting to discuss about  summer school.

445
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,050
Can't you take a break?

446
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,930
It doesn't have to be today, right?

447
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,580
Go with a friend.

448
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,970
I'll probably be back late anyway.

449
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:44,290
That's fine, I guess.

450
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,720
You've been a little cold towards me lately.

451
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,570
That's not true.

452
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:52,010
You're not having an affair, are you?

453
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,600
What are you talking about?

454
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,640
If you do,

455
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,590
I'll kill someone.

456
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,580
Not you,

457
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,250
but the girl you're seeing.

458
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:08,660
- What?
- I'm joking!

459
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,370
I'll be off, Mama!

460
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,940
Hamusuke and Mihamu. I'm leaving.

461
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,620
Maybe I should go, after all.

462
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:25,070
It's good to get to know your coworkers.

463
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:31,790
Actually, I don't think there will be anyone you know.

464
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:36,330
Takashima has quit, and the one whom you got along with...
what's her name?

465
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:39,930
- Have a good trip!
- See you!

466
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,840
Sorry for the wait.

467
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,410
What time are you meeting him?

468
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:24,240
I'll be going to the buffet alone, so drop me off at the hotel.

469
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,010
You're not going on a date?

470
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:31,710
I texted him, but he didn't reply.

471
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,570
There's no need to feel so down.

472
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:39,180
Men always become cold after you've had sex with them.

473
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:42,020
I think it's over.

474
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,150
Aren't you a little too quick to assume that?

475
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:51,220
I was rejected too, but he's trying to chase me again.

476
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:57,380
We have a rule that if there's no reply, we won't send any more texts.

477
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,380
Rules, huh?

478
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,470
I think he's worried about committing adultery.

479
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,980
He's such a serious person.

480
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,740
And he's a teacher, too.

481
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:14,640
Sure, there are cowardly men,

482
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,660
but serious men don't exist.

483
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,540
Open your eyes.

484
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:24,220
If he couldn't commit to this relationship because of his position,

485
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:29,470
that only means that you didn't have the charm
to make him cross that line.

486
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,160
Why don't you go confirm it?

487
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:59,780
Oh, right. I have to water the plants.

488
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,900
Nine students are taking supplementary lessons.

489
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,610
After one week, the absence count was...

490
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:10,420
Excuse me.

491
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,480
Feel free to answer it.

492
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,050
It's fine.

493
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:23,250
Absence count was two. Reason given was due to sickness.

494
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,860
Sorry.

495
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,400
Hello?

496
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,870
<i>I'm sorry.</i> I broke the rules.

497
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,570
It's fine.

498
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:43,020
<i>I didn't reply you.</i>

499
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,760
Are you busy today?

500
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,720
Not really.

501
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,720
Feel free to say no if you want.

502
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,450
I didn't know what to do.

503
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,080
We can't call each other freely.

504
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:06,780
I can't even help you if you are in danger.

505
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,020
<i>Going into this kind of relationship</i>

506
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,730
<i>made me scared.</i>

507
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,120
<i>But...</i>

508
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,070
I want to see you.

509
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,600
I'm free after 3PM.

510
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,720
It's cold!

511
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,280
<i>What happened?</i>

512
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:56,470
I'll see you at 3PM.

513
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:59,760
<i>Where are you meeting him?</i>

514
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,430
The zoo.

515
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:04,740
You're like middle schoolers.

516
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,070
It's fine, isn't it?

517
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,350
Don't be happy.

518
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,330
What?

519
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:16,950
Don't expect anything. Don't think about tomorrow.

520
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,560
What do you mean?

521
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,350
An adulterous couple is the same as any normal couple.

522
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:26,970
It makes your heart throb, it makes you blush.
You want to be with him forever.

523
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:30,040
But... There is no goal in adultery.

524
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:34,910
You will have to break up someday.
If you don't keep that in mind,

525
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,960
you will break down.

526
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,300
Don't be happy.

527
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,100
Don't expect anything.

528
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:48,600
Don't think about tomorrow.

529
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:04,390
- Open up!
- Don't do that here.

530
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:08,430
- Where can I do it then?
- Where?

531
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,200
Mr. Sasamoto.

532
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,100
Sorry for the sudden request,

533
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:18,110
but can you watch my kids for a bit?

534
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:23,490
My company called, and it seems there was a mistake
in the script, so I have to go back to the office urgently.

535
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:25,610
Don't worry. I'll take care of them.

536
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:27,990
- Are you sure?
- Thank you so much!

537
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:28,990
The two of you.

538
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:33,770
Behave yourselves, okay? I will be back soon.
I'm counting on you. Bye!

539
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,410
Your dad's busy, isn't he?

540
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:38,650
Very busy.

541
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,440
I'll leave it to you.

542
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,540
Thanks for the ride!

543
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,610
Let me know when you want to come back.

544
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:52,000
Okay.

545
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:58,900
Guess she can't do that right now, can she?

546
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,100
So, this is what he's been up to.

547
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,600
<i>An intense, burning kind of love.</i>

548
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,140
<i>I had thought</i>

549
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,550
<i>that this kind of love is non-existent.</i>

550
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:39,020
<i>But before I knew it,</i>

551
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:43,520
<i>I found myself stuck in a quagmire,
without knowing how to go forward or backward.</i>

552
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,250
Don't look at me. Look there.

553
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,200
Not me but over there. Sheesh.

554
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:07,210
<i>I don't want to hurt anyone.</i>

555
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:09,870
<i>It's not that I want to betray anyone.</i>

556
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,800
Thank you.

557
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,100
Welcome.

558
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,160
Drive. It's okay.

559
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,800
- Follow this blue one this time.
- Got it.

560
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,930
<i>That's not love.</i>

561
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:55,400
<i>That might simply be desire.</i>

562
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:57,870
<i>But...</i>

563
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,460
It hurts!

564
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,200
I thought you'd behave yourself for the time being?

565
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,400
I earned my freedom with my own hands today.

566
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,300
You know? I'm happy.

567
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,520
The happiest I've felt so far.

568
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,370
<i>Hello?</i>

569
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:24,230
<i>It's me.</i>

570
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:29,010
About tonight, Mr. Takigawa has reserved dinner for me.

571
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:31,540
<i>So I'm planning to have dinner before heading home.</i>

572
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:34,060
<i>I'll be a bit late. Is that okay?</i>

573
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:36,920
Of course.

574
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:42,230
Take your time. I'll be full from the cake buffet.

575
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:45,130
<i>Okay. Then I'll go ahead.</i>

576
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:47,670
I've got to go. Rikako is here.

577
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:56,900
<i>Now, I can't make any more excuses that it's a one-off mistake.</i>

578
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:00,960
<i>I may lose everything.</i>

579
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:04,450
<i>"You must turn back."</i>

580
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:08,050
<i>I could hear those last words.</i>

581
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:14,930
Sorry I'm late.

582
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:17,640
- Did you wait long?
- Not at all.

583
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,900
<i>At 3PM in the afternoon...</i>

584
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,050
<i>I became a wicked woman.</i>

585
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,850
♫ <i>You and I</i> ♫

586
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:55,140
♫ <i>met as strangers</i> ♫

587
00:44:55,140 --> 00:45:00,620
♫ <i>Last night was last night, and tonight is tonight</i> ♫

588
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:06,040
♫ <i>Ticklish fingers, counting the moles</i> ♫

589
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:10,530
♫ <i>Counting from one again</i> ♫

590
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:15,960
♫ <i>That's right, we're igniting each other once more</i> ♫

591
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:23,700
♫ <i>when we first meet</i> ♫

592
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:29,980
♫ <i>It's okay</i> ♫

593
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:32,660
♫ <i>if you forget about me</i> ♫

594
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:37,240
♫ <i>It's okay if you got astray</i> ♫

595
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,780
♫ <i>I will return</i> ♫

596
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:49,730
♫ <i>time and time again, I will show you that I will return</i> ♫

597
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:57,810
I think my husband is in love with someone.

598
00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:00,830
I can't imagine my life without him.

599
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:04,840
You will lose everything if your husband finds out.
You're not afraid?

600
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:08,550
- You are important to me.
- If someone finds out, we can't see each other anymore.

601
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:13,860
I want you to be happy.
I want you to make a bright, happy family.

602
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:16,500
There is no end goal in adultery.

603
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:20,120
What awaits is true hell.

604
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,620
You should end this relationship.

605
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:24,840
Everyone will end up getting hurt.
