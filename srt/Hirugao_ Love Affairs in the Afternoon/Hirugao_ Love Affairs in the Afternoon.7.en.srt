1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,800
<i>I felt like my body would rip in two.</i>

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,400
<i>But...</i>

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,300
<i>now that I've come to know his wife's face,</i>

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,900
<i>If I turn back,</i>

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,160
<i>what awaits me, is hell.</i>

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,500
<i>In the end,</i>

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,400
<i>I wasn't strong or selfish enough to be a wicked woman.</i>

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,100
It's okay to cry.

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,200
You know...

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,040
It was also painful for me when I ended things with that guy.

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,900
Let's comfort each other.

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,800
I'm sorry for being like this.

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,200
Don't say that.

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,000
Don't say such things.

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,990
When you go home with puffy eyes,

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,200
even your unfeeling husband

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,500
will know something is up.

18
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,100
I know, you don't have to tell me.

19
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,200
Pull yourself together...

20
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,800
You don't want to get caught like I did.

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,500
Couples like you guys...

22
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,700
don't play around, so things can be over really quickly.

23
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,100
You will

24
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,600
lose everything that you have.

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,840
And your husband will lose trust in you.

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,100
No matter how hard it is,

27
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,600
you have to keep it together.

28
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,300
Isn't it hard for you, Rikako?

29
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,700
If it was a normal relationship,

30
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,980
you can feel sorry

31
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,500
for yourself and cry all you want when you fall out of love.

32
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,780
You can complain to your friends,

33
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,360
and they will comfort you.

34
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,340
You could go on a trip somewhere

35
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,340
to make yourself feel better.

36
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,960
But when it comes to adultery,

37
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,700
even if you fall out of love,

38
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,500
you can't possibly let anyone know.

39
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,900
You have to go back

40
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,220
to your mundane life before you met him.

41
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,980
You have no choice but to go back,

42
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,000
as if nothing ever happened.

43
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,160
Of course it's painful...

44
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,620
But...

45
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,800
that's the very nature of adultery.

46
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,580
That's right.

47
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,320
Do the usual things

48
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,820
as always.

49
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:38,200
Do the usual things... as always.

50
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,500
Yuichiro!

51
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,360
Come and look!

52
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,160
Yuichiro!

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,700
What?

54
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,900
Come, hurry.

55
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,600
What is it?

56
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,800
My thesis

57
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,180
is being praised by Professor Nyuki.

58
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,140
Nyuki?

59
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,460
"Breakthrough in the study"? That's amazing!

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,660
Give me a reward.

61
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,600
I've decided to take it easy from now on.

62
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,900
Being an ordinary housewife is boring.

63
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,400
You and I are a married couple,

64
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,200
but we're comrades

65
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,160
in research, right?

66
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,880
We can't be compared to other people, right?

67
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,060
Yeah...

68
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,600
Take good care of me, okay?

69
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,800
I'm your precious wife.

70
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,960
Tighter.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,700
This way, please.

72
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,600
It's become sensational!

73
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Everybody's asking who painted this.

74
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,580
We keep getting a lot of queries regarding this painting.

75
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,180
As expected of you!

76
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,600
Thanks to you, our hits are through the roof.

77
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,020
I'm glad I put our personal issues aside and let you do this.
Ready?

78
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:34,800
We're ready.

79
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,600
Let's go! Come!

80
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,200
It's a historic moment for the legendary artist and brilliant editor!

81
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,260
What's the matter?

82
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,600
Smile.

83
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,240
Keep smiling.

84
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,320
What happened? You're soaked.

85
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,620
Oh my! If you don't have an umbrella

86
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,500
then you should call me.

87
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,300
But you don't have a phone, Mom.

88
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,880
Oh right, sorry....

89
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,800
I can do it myself.

90
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,100
Why don't you take a shower?

91
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,300
Today I'm making your favorite fried chicken,

92
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,500
potato soup,

93
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,940
and Hina's favorite bean salad.

94
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,500
Yay!

95
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,100
I don't like fried chicken anymore.

96
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,200
And I don't like potato soup either.

97
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,920
Did something happen?

98
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,880
Nothing happened.

99
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,900
I just hate you now.

100
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,220
Mana...

101
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,880
I'm back.

102
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,100
Welcome home.

103
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,540
It's sunset, but it's so humid...

104
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,120
Hamusuke, Mihamu, Dad is home.

105
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,420
<i>And the monotonous,</i>

106
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,820
<i>boring days have come back again.</i>

107
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,180
I've changed the newspaper recycling bag.

108
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,580
Thanks.

109
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,040
Is it the end of the month already?

110
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,100
<i>Being here like this</i>

111
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,160
<i>makes what happened with that person</i>

112
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,960
<i>seem like an illusion.</i>

113
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
<i>A fleeting dream</i>

114
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,900
<i>seen through a housewife's eyes</i>

115
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,200
<i>during her afternoon nap.</i>

116
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,580
<i>But it wasn't just a dream.</i>

117
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,660
<i>If it was just a dream,</i>

118
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,820
<i>I wouldn't have felt this much pain.</i>

119
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,100
I'm going to the convenience store.

120
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,000
What?

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,500
I'm hungry, you know?

122
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,520
I'll be back soon.

123
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,920
♫ <i>So far away</i> ♫

124
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:50,540

Hey!

133
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,760
<i>It seems...</i>

134
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,520

Sawa!

143
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,440
I'm sorry about yesterday. I was in a hurry.

144
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,300
Don't worry about it.

145
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,500
But you suddenly left the other day, too.
So I was wondering what happened.

146
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,020
Oh...

147
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,450
Thanks.

148
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,230
I wasn't feeling very well.

149
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,260
Was it because I kept talking about myself?

150
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,390
Maybe so.

151
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,910
How mean!

152
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:32,320
But thanks to confiding in you both,
things are going well with my husband.

153
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,400
- Is that so?
- Yup.

154
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,270
Like Rikako said, I didn't push him or ask him questions,

155
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,650
so he just hugged me tightly after that.

156
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,200
I'm happy for you.

157
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,200
It was just your imagination
when you said he likes someone else.

158
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,550
I'm not imagining things.

159
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,500
I feel that I'm right on the mark.

160
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,190
I'm sure he likes someone else.

161
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,810
He may have gotten close to her on impulse.

162
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,800
No way.

163
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,250
He's awkward, so he won't easily get into such a relationship.

164
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,740
You're funny, Sawa.

165
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,350
You just said that like you know my husband well.

166
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:22,450
I was just guessing.
You mentioned that he's a high school science teacher.

167
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,950
Did I...

168
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,690
tell you that he's a high school teacher?

169
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,600
Yes, you did. The other day.

170
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,300
I see.

171
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,800
I wanted to have a serious talk with you
during summer vacation.

172
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,200
Serious talk?

173
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,180
With you? For what?

174
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,200
Kinoshita.

175
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,880
You've lost something important.

176
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,980
As your teacher, I don't want you to graduate like this.

177
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,960
You haven't accepted the fact

178
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,970
that your mom has left home?

179
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,020
I've been thinking about that.

180
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,350
I'm sure your Mom hasn't forgotten about you.

181
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,680
Yeah, right.

182
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,600
She got herself a young man,
and doesn't care about me anymore.

183
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,000
You're wrong.

184
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,520
Even she's chosen to live a new lifestyle,

185
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,280
I'm sure she's regretting her decision,

186
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,220
and suffering.

187
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,080
Mr. Kitano.

188
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,710
Who are you speaking for?

189
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,670
What's that supposed to mean?

190
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,700
Why don't you ask the principal?

191
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,090
I'm off.

192
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,850
Wait.

193
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,390
Give me back my cell phone.

194
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:03,600
It's not convenient for me
because I can't get in touch with Mana and Hina.

195
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,700
If you need anything, then just use the home phone.

196
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,920
Get the girls to call the home phone, too.

197
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,430
I can't even text with my friends either.

198
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:19,930
Is there anything urgent that requires you to text your friends?

199
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,300
I'm begging you.

200
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,600
Please give me back my cell phone.

201
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,800
Oh, right. I've also cancelled all your credit cards.

202
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:37,410
From now on, use the allowance that I gave you wisely.

203
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:40,220
Let me know if it's not enough.

204
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,150
You want to lock me in for the rest of my life?

205
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,410
Your husband is not such a sly person.

206
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:48,630
Yes, you are. You took my cell phone and credit cards.

207
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,530
Just to take revenge.

208
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,530
If you don't like it,

209
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,770
then feel free to leave.

210
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:59,000
You know that I can't leave without the kids.

211
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:07,710
What's wrong? You've always been docile,
but you're now so scary.

212
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,990
No, this won't do.

213
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,950
Smile. You do have a pretty face, after all.

214
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:19,230
Listen. All you have to do is smile.

215
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,670
There's nothing else you can do besides that.

216
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,950
Do you know

217
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,000
why I can keep smiling all the time?

218
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,610
What?

219
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,460
Do you know

220
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:50,960
why I could keep quiet and do the housework every day
and raise our kids?

221
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,910
Do you know why I don't talk back

222
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,470
even though you don't listen to what I say,

223
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,930
and just leave the kids to me?

224
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,100
Or why I could send you off to work with a smile?

225
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,400
- Shut up.
- You always arrogantly say,

226
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,730
"I'm the one who's making the money."

227
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:13,810
You look down on me, and think that
I'm only a foolish woman with a pretty face.

228
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,780
Do you know why I could happily iron your clothes

229
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,680
after you came back from having fun outside with other women?

230
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,520
Enough.

231
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,070
Because I've been having an affair.

232
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,600
Because there are others

233
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,990
who would treat me nicely.

234
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,230
Apologize!

235
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:40,700
Do you realize that you haven't once apologized to me
about this?

236
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,380
If you want to remain in this house,

237
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,600
kneel down and beg me to let you stay here.

238
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm not apologizing.

239
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,120
You play around with that kind of man,

240
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,300
and you're not sorry?

241
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:00,700
It's not just that man. I've been seeing

242
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,400
other men from dating websites, too.

243
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,900
What?!

244
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,900
Compared to you, many of them had neither talent nor money.

245
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,250
I even met one who was a piece of trash.

246
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:15,620
But even if they were losers,

247
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,500
they had never

248
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,040
looked down on me like you do.

249
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,840
You're an idiot.

250
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,450
Are you a retard?!

251
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,300
They just wanted to sleep with you,
that's why they were nice to you.  Don't you get it?

252
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,500
Even so, I don't care!

253
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,030
Even if

254
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,740
they just want my body for one moment,

255
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,430
it's a hundred times better

256
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:41,330
than 15 years of not paying attention to me!

257
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,050
Leave.

258
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,900
<i>To a wife, love is a monster.</i>

259
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,330
<i>Unless they're deeply hurt,</i>

260
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,560
<i>and have lost everything,</i>

261
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,440
<i>they won't realize that.</i>

262
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,110
I've told Sawa...

263
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,910
Yeah?

264
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:18,780
about the affair.

265
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,430
Why?

266
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,280
Because...

267
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,600
I must trust my daughter-in-law,

268
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,800
and make her part of the family.
That is the only way, you know?

269
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,320
So... I figured that it's better

270
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,470
to tell her about your dad.

271
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,980
The affair that you said... was about Dad?

272
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,210
Gosh...

273
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,120
Who else do you think I'm talking about?

274
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,090
No one.

275
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,850
She's waving at you.

276
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,530
- Ignore her.
- Ignore her?

277
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,600
What are you doing here?

278
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,740
Who is she? She's definitely not your wife, right?

279
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,170
Wife? She is my mom.

280
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:15,600
Bummer. If she is your wife, I thought I'd introduce myself.

281
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,630
Seriously, cut it out.

282
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,790
Were you just playing around with me?

283
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,120
I don't know how to answer that.

284
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,140
Nothing happened between us, anyway.

285
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,930
Can you dare say we are clean just because we didn't have sex?

286
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:42,020
Nice to meet you. Mr. Sasamoto
has been taking good care of me at work.

287
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:46,610
I will make sure to support him. See you.

288
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,770
Thank you for updating me about the meeting.

289
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,540
Well... she is my subordinate.

290
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,200
Don't tell me...

291
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,900
that you... and that girl...

292
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,610
No way.

293
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,160
I won't forgive you if you really did that.

294
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,940
You are the same as your father.

295
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,740
Stop it. There's nothing between us.

296
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,680
Then look at me.

297
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,210
Look at your mom.

298
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,200
You swear... that there's nothing between you and that girl?

299
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,500
Nothing.

300
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,600
My goodness...

301
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,000
Welcome.

302
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,800
You look busy.

303
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,400
I won't forgive you!

304
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,220
I won't forgive you if you have an affair!

305
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,540
Can I borrow some money?

306
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,090
What?

307
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,330
- Does this ring a bell?
- No.

308
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,090
I have met her before.

309
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,910
But we are not in a romantic relationship.

310
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,300
Ouch, ouch. Stop!

311
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,820
A scandal is a life-and-death problem for a teacher.

312
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,240
You have no choice but to go home and apologize to him.

313
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,510
Let me call your husband to come and take you home.

314
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,890
You'll never know

315
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:15,600
how much trouble that woman will bring.

316
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,550
Wait. Maybe this is my last chance.

317
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,930
Last chance?

318
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:29,910
To divorce my husband, and live independently.

319
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,490
What are you talking about?

320
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:38,980
Rikako, you were the one who told me not to destroy my family.

321
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,390
Maybe it's your husband.

322
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,590
I bet he figured that you'd be here.

323
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,970
Coming!

324
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:12,300
Oh, you are here again? The two of you are really close.

325
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,600
I'm sorry, but I ran away from home today.

326
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,120
Ran away?

327
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,410
She is joking.
She had an argument with her husband, that's all.

328
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:26,380
I see. We all have arguments, don't we?

329
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,800
Let's eat together.

330
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,500
Is that a cake?

331
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,140
Don't be surprised. Please make tea for us.

332
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,860
But you've never brought a cake over, Mom.

333
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,260
Don't sound like I'm a stingy person.

334
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:43,400
I wanted to have a chat with you, that's why I came here.

335
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,700
A chat...

336
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,250
By the way, why did you fight with your husband?

337
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,640
Well...

338
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,930
Mom, please stop meddling in others' affairs.

339
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:55,620
Don't tell me... it was adultery?

340
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:04,900
Just as I thought. Why are all men like that?

341
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,000
All men, you said?

342
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm embarrassed to say this.
I've already told my daughter-in-law about my dead husband.

343
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,400
He had an affair. I endured it and stayed with him until he died.

344
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:24,900
- You shouldn't talk about that.
- Why not? She is also having the same problem anyway.

345
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,780
Sawa, the day when Shunsuke has an affair
may come for you, too.

346
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,300
What? Is Shunsuke having an affair?

347
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,300
No, I meant "if".

348
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,960
I was just saying as an example.

349
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,330
If that happens for real, I will take your side for sure.

350
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,550
I'll definitely make him cut off all ties with her.

351
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:47,290
- I envy Sawa for having such an understanding mother-in-law.
- Thank you.

352
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:51,850
But I feel that it's not good to endure too much.

353
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:56,300
We're only deceiving ourselves
by staying together and not divorcing.

354
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:01,200
- What about your kids?
- They're my priority, of course.

355
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:08,400
But I don't think they would want to live with parents
who only pretend to be married.

356
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:14,450
- Are you serious about divorcing? Do think twice about it.
- That's right. What will you do from now on?

357
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:18,800
You've been living a life of luxury so far.
Are you able to survive without it?

358
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,390
I did think that I wouldn't survive without it.

359
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:25,700
But when my husband slapped me today,

360
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,900
I realized that I'm not a woman who can still smile
after being slapped by my husband.

361
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,600
He slapped you?

362
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,200
I've been underestimating myself so far,

363
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,700
but I believe that if I set my mind to it, I can also get a job.

364
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,100
You're too naive!
Do you even understand what it means to work?

365
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,490
I work every day but I only make 80,000 yen a month.

366
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,540
Do you think you can raise your kids
while they continue with violin lessons?

367
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:52,630
- Sawa, cool down.
- I must say it!

368
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:55,910
She dragged me into this and made me suffer.

369
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,220
What are you saying?

370
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,110
Please keep quiet, Mom. Go home.

371
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:05,690
- I won't forgive you if you make Mana and Hina suffer.
- You're telling me to stay locked up forever?

372
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:08,690
He took my cell phone and credit cards. I even can't go out.

373
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,020
You're telling me that I have to bear with that?

374
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,640
- He's doing that besides adultery and domestic violence?
- No.

375
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,880
I'm saying you shouldn't run away and get a divorce.
You should talk to your husband and make him understand.

376
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,200
You are the naive one. By going back to your normal life

377
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,640
as if nothing ever happened, you're running away.

378
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,780
Kids will grow up eventually. They won't stay cute forever.

379
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:33,020
They have the ability to know how their parents are feeling.

380
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,680
- That's why it's better to decide right now.
- You're saying that I don't understand because I don't have kids?

381
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:42,030
- I didn't say that.
- She's right. You can start making kids from now on.
- I'm not talking about that now.

382
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:45,930
What are you saying? The way you've been speaking is...

383
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:50,320
Oops, I'm sorry. What happened?

384
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,600
- Welcome back.
- I'm home.

385
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,790
We were just chatting.

386
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:58,700
I don't think that was just chatting.

387
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,870
When we women chat among ourselves,
we tend to get over-excited.

388
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:04,330
You say that. But I don't think that's it.

389
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:10,220
I had a good time. I should leave now. See you.

390
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:19,980
I see. When women come together to chat, it can be fun, right?

391
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,500
What's so fun about that? You're really in a good mood, huh?

392
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:28,100
- What?
- Sawa, like I said earlier,

393
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,780
that wasn't an example.

394
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:35,310
I'm going home after eating this.

395
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,800
- Thanks for the cake.
- You are welcome.

396
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:42,600
<i>I've never spoken my mind so freely like that before.</i>

397
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,740
<i>For sure,</i>

398
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:47,950
<i>adultery had made me stronger.</i>

399
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:56,900
<i>I wonder if he's back to life as per normal. Or perhaps...</i>

400
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,370
- Hey there.
- Hello.

401
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:10,080
- I told you Sawa has knocked off at 3PM.
- I know that.

402
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,900
Could you pass this to her tomorrow?

403
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,660
- Love letter?
- No.

404
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,730
What's going on? You're looking so serious.

405
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,410
This is how I usually look.

406
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:27,190
I'm sorry. And thank you for your help.

407
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,340
Don't tell me that you broke up with her?

408
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,780
Sawa was also acting strangely.

409
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,520
You don't have to hide from me.

410
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:51,400
I know it's hard. Men do get affected by breakups, too.

411
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:58,370
You don't want to give her up, and want her for yourself again.

412
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,800
But...

413
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,980
Sometimes, we have to give up on that wish.

414
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,940
Sometimes, we have no choice but to give up.

415
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,000
No matter what.

416
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:22,280
I've always thought... that you were too serious and lame.

417
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,500
But you're actually cool.

418
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,990
Rikako has run away from home.

419
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,620
She may come over to your place.

420
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,770
If she shows up, please kick her out.

421
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:57,650
- I told you that I won't see her again.
- I know, right?

422
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:01,100
An artist like you is starting to gain recognition.

423
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,980
You can't afford to get involved with her anymore, right?

424
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,130
Rikako was a fashion model whom I scouted on the streets.

425
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:17,490
Ever since she was young, she had this charm
in making men go crazy about her.

426
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:20,030
Every man who passed her by

427
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,970
would surely turn back to look at her.

428
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,730
Gradually...

429
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,560
I wanted her to be mine.

430
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:38,960
At first, she had totally no interest in old men.

431
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,750
Look at me. I'm not good-looking at all.

432
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:47,480
But... As unpleasant as it sounds,

433
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:53,150
my status and family wealth were my weapons.

434
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:56,020
It was easy to bait her with those.

435
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,500
She didn't even resist.

436
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:03,200
So in a way, she was just a normal woman.

437
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,900
Yup. You can see that kind of woman everywhere.

438
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,350
Maybe you only saw her from that angle, that's why.

439
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,960
What?

440
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,400
It's nothing.

441
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,600
If you have something to say, then say it.

442
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,600
I was the one who saw your talent and displayed it to the world.

443
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,260
Who is she to you?

444
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:27,900
- What are you talking about? She's my wife, of course.
- You're wrong.

445
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,100
She's a doll.

446
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,940
You wanted a doll as your wife.

447
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:41,120
A doll who's beautiful, obedient, and whom people envy.

448
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,100
A doll whom you usually leave on the shelf, collecting dust,

449
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,740
and polish it only when you have visitors.

450
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,410
Seems like you were really into Rikako.
You were serious about her.

451
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,880
Unfortunately, I won't give her to you.

452
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,600
- You haven't made enough money for us yet.
- That's not what I want.

453
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,000
There's no place for me to put her in, but...

454
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,200
But what?

455
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:16,040
I know that she is not a doll.

456
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,600
<i>[Subtitles are brought to you by Hirugao Team @ Viki.com]</i>

457
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,340
Please fire me.

458
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,680
I won't.

459
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:39,730
I will make you work under me forever.
No matter how popular you get.

460
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,380
Hmph!

461
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,740
I'm back.

462
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:01,860
- Welcome back. You're late.
- Sorry that I didn't contact you earlier.

463
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,940
- Let me make you dinner.
- We've already eaten.

464
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:10,340
Well done, you made dinner on your own.

465
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,750
That's because I thought you'd never come back.

466
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:16,990
Why wouldn't I? Shall I cut some fruits?

467
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,780
Don't force yourself.

468
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,910
You should go back to that man.

469
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,980
What man?

470
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:29,080
I wonder who? Hina,

471
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:34,370
- Have you finished your picture diary?
- Not yet.
- Go to your room and finish it before you sleep.
- Okay.

472
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:39,550
- When you're done, I'll let you have pear with vanilla ice-cream.
- Okay.

473
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,750
What's wrong, Mana?

474
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,450
Lately...

475
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:02,900
- You've been acting strangely.
- You're the one who's acting strangely.

476
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,160
You're often home late,

477
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,590
and you were crying at that phone booth the other day.

478
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:11,850
You saw me?

479
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:15,730
- I was talking to your grandma...
- Don't lie to me!

480
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:19,090
You broke up with that man, didn't you?

481
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,650
You thought I don't know anything?

482
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,340
I knew what was going on!

483
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:29,760
You had been seeing a man.

484
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:34,160
Because on those days you met him,

485
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,300
your makeup and clothes were different.
And you also made more side dishes.

486
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:40,580
Besides...

487
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,590
you were nice to Dad, too.

488
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,560
- Mana.
- Don't touch me!

489
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,230
I was planning to keep my mouth shut.

490
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,740
If I didn't say anything...

491
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,680
If everyone could stay happy...

492
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,990
I thought I could endure with all this.

493
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:08,640
I hate you.

494
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,860
I never want to see your face again!

495
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,620
What is this?

496
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,540
In any case, I completed my mission.

497
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,690
Let's go.

498
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:56,350
<i>I'm sorry to contact you even though we agreed not to.</i>

499
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:04,450
<i>It seems that that the student who stole from the cars
saw us together in the forest park.</i>

500
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,460
<i>I will be careful not to get you into trouble.</i>

501
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,910
<i>But I'm letting you know just in case.</i>

502
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,590
<i>Take care.</i>

503
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,890
<i>P.S...</i>

504
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:36,970
<i>I can hear the buzzing sound of the cicadas.</i>

505
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,150
<i>Sincerely, Yuichirou Kitano.</i>

506
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:46,770
<i>Like his personality, his handwriting is just as well-organized.</i>

507
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,630
<i>There wasn't anything special in his letter,</i>

508
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:55,380
<i>but he ended off by talking about the cicadas.</i>

509
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,250
<i>That was enough</i>

510
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:01,660
<i>to make me happy, even though we couldn't see each other.</i>

511
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,700
What's wrong, Yuichiro?

512
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:28,420
Nothing. I just thought that the cicadas appeared early this year.

513
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:33,450
Yeah. That's because the population of large brown cicadas
is dropping, right?

514
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:36,380
- Do you have to give supplementary lessons today?
- No.

515
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:43,300
- Let's go watch a movie. It's been a while since our last date.
- Sure.

516
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:49,540
<i>This is Takigawa. Please leave a message.</i>

517
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,770
It's me.

518
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,710
Please take care

519
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:00,040
of Mana and Hina.

520
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:06,460
I've left the divorce papers on the table.

521
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:13,000
I've prepared some food and left it in the fridge.

522
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,530
As for the administrative details,

523
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:20,820
I'll discuss them with you at a later time.

524
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:36,730
- You look like you're in a good mood today.
- What?

525
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,500
Something happened lately, right?

526
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:43,010
- You didn't look too good lately.
- Nothing happened. It's been really hot lately.

527
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:47,050
- Yeah, right. Welcome!
- Welcoー

528
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:51,930
- What's wrong?
- I finished work early, so I thought I'd go home with you.

529
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:54,990
- You're finishing work soon, right?
- Yeah, but...

530
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,700
- He is my husband. She's Mineko.
- Nice to meet you, Mineko.

531
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:05,330
The movie was good, right?
This actress was perfect for the mistress role, wasn't she?

532
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,620
Yeah.

533
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,250
What do you want to eat tonight?

534
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:15,700
- Well...
- You always say "Well" to anything I ask.

535
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,400
Let's stop by the store before heading home.

536
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,680
Thanks for waiting.

537
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:35,140
It must be tiring for you to work at a place like this every day.

538
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:40,910
A place like this? I actually enjoy working here.

539
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,750
We should seriously start looking for a house soon.

540
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:50,040
What's the matter? You're acting strangely.

541
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,170
You showed up at my workplace all  of a sudden,
and now you're  talking about house-hunting.

542
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,970
You think so?

543
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:04,810
About my subordinate whom my mom met yesterday...

544
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,900
I can't say that nothing happened between us.

545
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,990
I swear I wasn't having an affair or doing anything shady.

546
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:16,490
She was the one who tried to seduce me.

547
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,200
She seduced you?

548
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,700
What's wrong, Yuichiro? Hurry up.

549
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:28,550
Sir, are you alighting?

550
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,300
It was hard for me. I couldn't treat her unkindly,
since she's my subordinate.

551
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,230
At least it's better than not being popular.

552
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,460
What are you doing? Let's go to the supermarket already.

553
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,950
- Can't we go to another supermarket?
- Why? What's wrong with that place?

554
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,590
Is someone there?

555
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:12,950
I'm glad that you're not the kind who's jealous.

556
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:20,020
- Do you remember Yamamoto?
- His wife was a really jealous person.

557
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,560
Is someone there?

558
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,200
No, it's not that.

559
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,380
Then let's go.

560
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:37,020
- Say, what sound do you think cicadas make?
- What?

561
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,830
- Isn't it "crickety crick"?
- You see,

562
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:43,760
ever since I was a kid, I only hear the buzzing sound later.

563
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,580
Huh? What do you mean?

564
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,480
What's wrong?

565
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,960
- I forgot something. Sorry, but can I go back and get it?
- Sure.

566
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,900
Sawa!

567
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,590
Sawa!

568
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:14,630
She's calling you. Is she your friend?

569
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,770
Hello.

570
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:38,870
- What a surprise. He's your husband?
- Yes.

571
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:42,400
- He's my husband. Is he your husband?
- Yup.

572
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,650
We went to watch a movie.
It's been so long since we went to the theater together.

573
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:52,130
She is Sawa. She's the friend whom I met at the supermarket.

574
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,650
Hello. Nice to meet you.

575
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:01,370
This is Noriko and Mr. Kitano.

576
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:04,230
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

577
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,770
Do you live nearby?

578
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:13,900
Yes, we do. Why don't you join us for tea?

579
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:17,180
Oh, right. Sawa lives nearby. Alright if we go to your place?

580
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:20,230
- Oh no. My place is mess.
- Let's not trouble them.

581
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:24,130
- I'm sorry.
- Why not? They can come over to our place next time.

582
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:28,040
- You're okay with that right, Sir?
- Yeah. I guess.

583
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:32,740
She may not look like it,
but my wife always keeps the house clean.

584
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:24,130
You shouldn't leave the door unlocked all the time.
Someone can steal your paintings.

585
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:29,580
I don't care.

586
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,440
I am the thief anyway.

587
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:37,590
Did my husband tell you that you had stolen me from him?

588
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:45,470
In that case, you aren't a thief anymore.

589
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,420
I've placed the divorce papers on the table and left home.

590
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,860
My husband always said

591
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,830
that I'm just a pretty face.

592
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,650
He's been telling me that I'm stupid.

593
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,270
But I guess he was right.

594
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,180
I've always...

595
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,890
pretended to be smart.

596
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,520
But my shell has finally come off.

597
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:27,760
I'm so stupid.

Just confess already.

00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:56,010
I can't go back to my husband anymore.
