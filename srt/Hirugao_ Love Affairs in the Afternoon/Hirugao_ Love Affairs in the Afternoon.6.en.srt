1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,970
It looks like you!

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,700
- Like me?
- You have that look when you're  collecting insects!

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,240
Do I really look like that?

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,650
Yes, you do.

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,740
Look at those arms!
He'd knock you out with a single punch.

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,280
Don't worry!

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,780
Gorillas are often thought to be violent

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,610
but they are very sensitive and rarely do they attack humans.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,600
Its grip is said to be over 400kg, so you probably
don't want to shake hands.

10
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,570
I'd say about... 20kg.

11
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,800
It doesn't hurt?

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,780
Of course, it hurts.

13
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,760
Sir!

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:05,170
- Over here!
- That's a very good drawing.

15
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,410
<i>I wonder</i>

16
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,170
<i>how the two of us look like to strangers.</i>

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,690
Shall we go?

18
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,160
<i>Do we look like lovers?</i>

19
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,820
<i>Or wife and husband?</i>

20
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,230
<i>No.</i>

21
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,380
<i>We are forbidden to hold hands in public.</i>

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,110
<i>We are forbidden to call each other's name in public.</i>

23
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,640
<i>If I lose sight of him,</i>

24
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,050
<i>I may never</i>

25
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,240
<i>see him again.</i>

26
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,190
It's beautiful!

27
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,800
What are you doing?

28
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,200
Come chase me when I run away.

29
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,660
I'm not shameless enough to play tag
with someone else's wife.

30
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,710
I can't remember the last time
I came to the beach without the kids.

31
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,430
Play along with me!

32
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,700
Are you alright, ma'am?

33
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,300
You're not going to help me up?

34
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,400
You look better when you're in trouble.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,400
For the first time, I thought you looked cute.

36
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,310
Pervert.

37
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,900
What are you doing?

38
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,600
You're not afraid?

39
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,200
You will lose everything
if your husband finds out.

40
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,140
I am afraid.

41
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,960
If I wasn't, I wouldn't be seeing you.

42
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,120
I can't believe it!

43
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,670
Hello?

44
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,730
This is Sasamoto.

45
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,550
The fireworks are starting.

46
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,400
Mana and Hina are waiting.

47
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,900
Are you going to make it back in time?

48
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,150
Yeah, alright.

49
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,560
<i>Oh, I'm terribly sorry to call you
when you're working.</i>

50
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,300
No, I'm the one who should apologize

51
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,430
for pushing my kids on to you.

52
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:55,320
I'll be right back after i finish work,
if you could stay with them a bit longer.

53
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,340
Sorry about that. Bye.

54
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,810
What's going on, Shun?

55
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,800
Well...

56
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,630
Did you just call me Shun?

57
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:19,600
Why not? We're not at work.
Hurry, the fireworks are starting!

58
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,050
Oops, sorry.

59
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,390
<i>I thought it might be his wife calling him.</i>

60
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,830
Hello, where are you?

61
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,270
I am by the fountain.

62
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,430
<i>I'm already on the train.</i>

63
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,600
What?

64
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,170
<i>I thought you left me and went home.</i>

65
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,760
I would never leave without telling  you.

66
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,960
<i>Just kidding! Behind you.</i>

67
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,800
<i>You're very mean.</i>

68
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,200
Are you mad?

69
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,230
I don't like women who play with men.

70
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,650
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,760
I just wanted to tease you, to scare you a little.

72
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,670
Hey, you're the one who's mean!

73
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:38,800
Likewise, I'm sorry.
I walk fast, so this happens often.

74
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,670
- So you leave your wife behind, too?
- I mean...

75
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,800
Wait.

76
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,510
Hm?

77
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,460
For you. Here.

78
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,650
You're giving this to me?

79
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,680
Take it.

80
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,900
Thank you!

81
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,930
Does it look like me?

82
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,150
- You look like this one.
- This one?

83
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,430
So adorable.

84
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,300
<i>I saw blue fireworks going up,</i>

85
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,040
<i>in the sky far away.</i>

86
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,610
Wow! Amazing.

87
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,680
<i>My husband must be watching the fireworks.</i>

88
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,150
<i>Somewhere else...</i>

89
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,620
<i>His wife may be watching them, too.</i>

90
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:57,130
<i>A joy so intense that I could throw everything else away...</i>

91
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,960
<i>and an agonizing pain so deep that I need to run away.</i>

92
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,600
Shall we go?

93
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,300
<i>Having an affair is like being on a boat,</i>

94
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,660
<i>being tossed in the waves of a storm.</i>

95
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,790
<i>On a boat that will never reach the harbor.</i>

96
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:20,390
<i>[Hirugao: Love Affairs in the Afternoon]</i>

97
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,500
Having heatstroke?

98
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,700
What? I'm fine.

99
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,200
Not you, Mama.

100
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,800
Oh, the hamsters? I think they're just bored.

101
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,700
They were eating just now.

102
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,700
I see.

103
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,900
<i>It's a typical morning.</i>

104
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,800
<i>Nothing has changed these three months.</i>

105
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,100
<i>I still make my husband's lunch.</i>

106
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,700
<i>My husband pays more attention to his hamsters than to me.</i>

107
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,700
<i>How were the fireworks?</i>

108
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,400
<i>They were pretty.</i>

109
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,700
<i>What about you, Mama?</i>

110
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,400
How was the cake buffet?

111
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,000
Delicious, I stuffed myself.

112
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,100
Especially that cheesecake.

113
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,600
<i>Just one thing has changed.</i>

114
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,600
<i>I have become a better liar.</i>

115
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,500
What are you doing?

116
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,600
The university is on summer break.

117
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,310
I have to help out with the chores, too.

118
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,330
Don't worry about it.

119
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,600
You have that report to submit, right?

120
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,100
No, I want to do it.

121
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,600
When we have a baby,

122
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:46,100
I'll become a mother, so I need to start being a better wife.

123
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,300
Besides,

124
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,700
I also read from a study that said men's fertility rate increases

125
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,300
when they have higher emotional satisfaction
towards their partner.

126
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,200
I'll cook while the university is on break, okay?

127
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,300
It's fine.

128
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,000
Let's leave things status quo.

129
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,500
Why?

130
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,700
I want you to concentrate on your research.

131
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,730
I'm off to give lessons.

132
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,700
Liar!

133
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,700
It's fine, leave it.

134
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,200
You can't call this a journal.

135
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,500
Be quiet!

136
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,400
Give it to me!

137
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,500
Don't fight. You're going to be late for cram school.

138
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,520
But she made things up, saying that both you and dad
were at the fireworks.

139
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,830
What?

140
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,700
Thank you.

141
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,300
Hina you wanted to show me
the fireworks too,  huh?

142
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,200
But dad wasn't even there.

143
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,360
Dad, too?

144
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,600
I had to leave to finish up some work during the fireworks.

145
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,120
But Sasamoto and his coworker

146
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,000
took care of these two.

147
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,400
I see. I'll have to thank him, too.

148
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,300
Yeah.

149
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,200
Come on, you're going to be late.

150
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,100
Okay.

151
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,000
I'll come pick you up if you have to come home late.

152
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,700
Summer school, huh?

153
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,720
Kids nowadays don't even get vacations. I feel bad for them.

154
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,220
They have to, since their friends are going.

155
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,030
But then again...

156
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:24,200
It's convenient for their mothers, isn't it?

157
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,800
They send their kids to cram school

158
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,600
to make time to meet with men.

159
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,470
They accept PTA* positions to have a convenient excuse
<i>[*Parent-Teacher Association]</i>

160
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,300
to leave the house.

161
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,510
Women are scary.

162
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,100
I'm talking about our magazine column.

163
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,380
Here, your handkerchief.

164
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,700
By the way, can you sweep the floor today?

165
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,000
But I sweep it every day.

166
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,100
The floor feels...

167
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,400
kind of sandy.

168
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,950
It's like some sand fell over here...

169
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,200
Maybe it's from the beach.

170
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,500
Oh, right.

171
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,800
Give me your phone.

172
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,900
Mine?

173
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,400
I want to change our cell service plan. It'll be cheaper.

174
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,000
What's wrong?

175
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,370
I'm the one who pays for it, correct?

176
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,800
You're right. Here.

177
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm going to work.

178
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,800
Have a good day.

179
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,200
My husband has found out.

180
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,400
What?

181
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,800
Tomoko.

182
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,900
My wife had your number saved under a female name,

183
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,800
but it was you who answered.

184
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,100
Those fireworks were a trap my husband had set up.

185
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:24,180
I found a GPS tracker on my car,

186
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,200
so I switched to taking a taxi.

187
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,700
But he'd already planned for that.

188
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,400
There was another GPS tracker.

189
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,000
Then did he see you...

190
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,800
Probably.

191
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,200
He took my cell phone away.

192
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,900
Hello.

193
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,400
What happened? Both of you look so serious.

194
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:16,900
Hello?

195
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,500
How is your new work coming along?

196
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm working on it now.

197
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
<i>I can't wait to see your work.</i>

198
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,540
It's my own fault.

199
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,770
I broke my own rule about going on a date on weekends.

200
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,700
And because of that...

201
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,760
What do you think

202
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,900
your husband plans to do?

203
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,800
He's quite egotistical.

204
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,100
He won't forgive anyone

205
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,100
who takes his possessions.

206
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,900
Then, will he ask for a divorce?

207
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,000
Even if he does,

208
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,100
I won't agree to it.

209
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,500
I can't make...

210
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,800
my daughters suffer.

211
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,000
You should be ready for when your husband finds out, too.

212
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Be ready?

213
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,100
Either completely deny it...

214
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,600
or accept it...

215
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,510
and apologize profusely.

216
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,590
I...

217
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,200
might leave my home.

218
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,000
It's not wise to get a divorce.

219
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,300
If your husband starts suspecting,
you should break up with your lover.

220
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,300
But I feel like I am lying to both of them.

221
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,000
Stop trying to play the damsel in distress.

222
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,600
A woman is always fast to try to leave her marriage,

223
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:39,900
but an affair to a man is just a game. It doesn't matter
how deep he's into it. He won't leave his family for you.

224
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,310
I guess...

225
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,200
I can be relieved, then.

226
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,510
I think...

227
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,210
my husband is in love with someone.

228
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,260
It's just my guess.

229
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,400
Is it a physical relationship?

230
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,000
About that...

231
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,250
I don't think so.

232
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,000
My husband is a very serious and conscientious person.

233
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:11,090
But he just seems distracted,
like he's thinking about another woman.

234
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,000
Do you know who she is?

235
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Not yet.

236
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,760
If you don't want a divorce, you shouldn't start hunting him.

237
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,600
So I should pretend not to notice anything?

238
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,300
A man will start justifying his actions
if you corner him too much.

239
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:33,160
Pretend that you didn't notice anything for a while
and be nicer to him.

240
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,600
I promise that he'll come back to you.

241
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,600
You're right.

242
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,640
He loves me so much...

243
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,200
and he promised we would be together forever.

244
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,700
You're showing off?

245
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,680
I mean, we've been together since we were students.

246
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,600
I can't imagine my life without him.

247
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,600
Is your husband a researcher, too?

248
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,400
Not really, he's a teacher.

249
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,800
My husband probably has his complaints.

250
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,800
He wanted to stay at the research lab,
but I was the one who remained instead.

251
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,580
I use my maiden name for work.

252
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:23,400
But today I'm going to try to cook for him.

253
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,900
You're trying?

254
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,500
I'll try.

255
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,500
Do you want to put your groceries in the refrigerator?

256
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,300
Is that alright?

257
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,100
Of course.

258
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,300
Thank you so much.

259
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,400
I'm sorry, I'm going home.

260
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,320
Sawa, what happened?

261
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:30,900
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

262
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,000
Can i put this in, too?

263
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,700
Go ahead.

264
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,800
Noriko...

265
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,800
So sorry, but I have something urgent to take care of.

266
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,600
What?

267
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,800
I'm sorry, but please go home today.

268
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,100
<i>Dear God...</i>

269
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,500
<i>Is this my punishment?</i>

270
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,010
Are you okay?

271
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,400
What should I do?

272
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,800
I don't know what to do anymore.

273
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,390
Sawa.

274
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,190
This relationship...

275
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,980
You should end it.

276
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,560
Since you've found out she's his wife,

277
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,330
you won't be able to control your jealousy.

278
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:12,380
You've been careful not to destroy each other's families so far.

279
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,040
But those naive thoughts

280
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,440
won't work anymore.

281
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,760
Everyone will end up getting hurt.

282
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,900
I'm here.

283
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,590
Geez... You need to be careful.

284
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,070
Your door was unlocked.

285
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,160
- Oh, Welcome.
- Hello.

286
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,320
Thank you for taking care of my daughter-in-law.

287
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,300
You feel sick or something?

288
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:52,980
She was at my house but she seemed feverish,
so I walked her home.

289
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,770
I see. Thank you very much. I'll take over from here.

290
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,830
- Really?
- She is my daughter-in-law after all.

291
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,890
Sawa, how's your fever? Are you able to eat?

292
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:07,410
In that case, I'll get going. Sawa, take care.

293
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,220
Welcome home.

294
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,200
Kato is here.

295
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,420
- I see.
- Seems like someone was here.

296
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,170
- My friends were here.
- Sawa, too?

297
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:54,720
That's right. She felt sick so I walked her home just now.

298
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,230
Listen, Rikako.

299
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,470
You should

300
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,780
take a good care of your friends.

301
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:05,320
If something happens, they will help you.

302
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,720
Let me make you some tea.

303
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,600
Forget about tea right now. Follow me first.

304
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,750
Excuse me for taking so long.

305
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,010
- Welcome.
- Take a seat.

306
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,700
Please show it to me.

307
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:45,570
What a gorgeous painting. This is the best painting so far.

308
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,300
Hey, Rikako. What do you think about this painting?

309
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:58,310
- I don't know.
- I'm asking for your opinion.

310
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:02,590
The colors are vivid, and it looks intense.

311
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,700
It's a strong painting.

312
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,800
Do you think...

313
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,590
this man is intense and strong?

314
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,740
What are you talking about?

315
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,400
Never see him again.

316
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,000
You live off my paycheck. It's  different from me having an affair.

317
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,890
You, too.

318
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:30,020
Never see my wife again.

319
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,200
You do understand

320
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,800
what I'm talking about, right?

321
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:40,780
Because of my position, I don't want to blow up this matter.
It's for my kids' sake, too.

322
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:46,890
I don't want any more trouble. If you can promise me that,
I'll act as if nothing ever happened.

323
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,880
I can forget all this.

324
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:52,160
If you can't....

325
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,370
then you'll lose your job.

326
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,000
I understand.

327
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,250
You don't need to worry. I'm not that foolish
to fall in love with someone's wife anyway.

328
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:09,330
Besides, she was the one who seduced me.
I have no attachments with her.

329
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,700
See you.

330
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:23,350
Take a bite, even if it's a little.

331
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,600
Thank you very much.

332
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:33,900
Do you know why Shunsuke loves

333
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,630
his hamsters so much?

334
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,800
No.

335
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:44,040
Shunsuke's father and I...

336
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,810
always fought with each other.

337
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:53,330
I believe that he envied having parents

338
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,000
who have a good relationship.

339
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:01,250
I think Shunsuke feels at ease

340
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,750
watching these hamsters.

341
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:08,130
What was the reason

342
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:11,050
that made you fight with your husband?

343
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,570
Adultery.

344
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:20,970
She was his client's office worker.

345
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:25,330
Did you know her?

346
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,730
Of course. Because I was concerned about that.

347
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,160
I followed him,

348
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:36,710
and saw him meeting up with her.

349
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:42,200
He looked so happy.

350
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:47,330
He had a smile on his face that I'd never seen before.

351
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,280
It made me so upset.

352
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,800
I was so upset that I could die from it.

353
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,300
It seems that they broke up after a few years.

354
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:11,400
But until the day he died, he never showed me that smile.

355
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,260
Shunsuke...

356
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,160
felt bad for me.

357
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,290
Even though he was a little boy....

358
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:26,720
he'd always been trying to protect me.

359
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,900
His issue...

360
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,560
with not having sex with you...

361
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:40,540
It could be partly due to that.

362
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:49,840
You didn't do anything wrong.
That's why I want you to be happy.

363
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,990
I want you to make...

364
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,800
a bright and happy family.

365
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:04,500
Because I couldn't do that. Oh, my.... This onion...

366
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,900
<i>My mother-in-law's confession shocked me.</i>

367
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:14,140
<i>Even now, she is hurting from her husband's affair.</i>

368
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,000
<i>My affair, too...</i>

369
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,120
<i>will hurt Noriko, just like her.</i>

370
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,600
<i>I'm trampling on her trust.</i>

371
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,800
Delicious, isn't it?  I worked hard to make this.

372
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,520
I met up with my friend today.

373
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:11,550
Everybody has their own problems.
You'll be shocked by some of them.

374
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,800
You want to hear it?

375
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,400
I decline.

376
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,400
Oh, the rice...

377
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:31,860
Looks good.

378
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,920
<i>[You have a new message from Sawa Sasamoto]</i>

379
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,320
<i>[We need to talk. Can I call you tomorrow?]</i>

380
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:52,800
[Delete mail?]
[Deleted]

381
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,720
<i>I was prepared to get punished.</i>

382
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,140
Mama.

383
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,590
You're still awake?

384
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,510
It's hot every day, isn't it?

385
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,300
Yeah.

386
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,430
- What?
- Well...

387
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,570
I mean...

388
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,000
Good night.

389
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,490
- Were you relieved?
- What?

390
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:21,920
It's nothing. Good night.

391
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,770
Well...

392
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,370
You are important to me.

393
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,860
But.. every night, I wear the same pajamas.

394
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,290
The person sleeping next to me...

395
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,500
I am... well...

396
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,420
I think it's the same for every family.

397
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:52,140
Yup.

398
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,730
I understand.

399
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:59,010
What I mean is that  I do love you.

400
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:08,140
We became one family.

401
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,440
I just wanted you to understand that.

402
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,790
Yup.

403
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,200
Pregnant?

404
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,000
I want you to lend me money for abortion.

405
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:38,130
I don't plan to tell my parents.

406
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:40,630
You guys...

407
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,970
It's not a big deal.

408
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:47,050
The sperm fertilized the egg,
and it attached itself to the uterus. That's all.

409
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:50,450
Hey. We are talking about someone's life here.

410
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,870
It hurts...

411
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,150
Goto, what's wrong?

412
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,910
Are you okay?

413
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,390
Goto?!

414
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,600
We're just kidding.

415
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,300
We just want money.

416
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,900
So, lend me some.

417
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,800
What are you saying?

418
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,340
Mr. Kitano.

419
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,850
You'd better not boss me around too much.

420
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,000
What's that supposed to mean?

421
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,200
You will find out soon.

422
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,070
I'm sorry. I think I lost my car keys.

423
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,200
Can you walk there today?

424
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,600
Did you get your cell phone back?

425
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,000
No. It's still under repair.

426
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:49,210
- I'm off.
- Take care.

427
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,600
You told Rikako's husband?

428
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,000
I told him about that painter, too.

429
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,990
Why did you do that?

430
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,490
If I tell him that,

431
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:10,220
I thought she would end things with that guy.

432
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,110
Do you understand what you did?

433
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:16,720
If they divorce because of that, what are you going to do?

434
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,930
If that happens, I will take care of her.

435
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,500
Are you really think you can do that?

436
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,960
Keeping her to yourself is not love. Don't you get it?

437
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,140
Have you ever thought about her life?

438
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,200
<i>Love is blind.</i>

439
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
<i>It makes you oblivious to everything around you.</i>

440
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,510
<i>My words to Tomoya</i>

441
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:01,170
<i>also served as a warning to myself, too.</i>

442
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,120
Hello?

443
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,840
<i>Are you free to talk now?</i>

444
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,200
Yeah.

445
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,200
Something happened?

446
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,500
No.

447
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,400
Well...

448
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,880
I know it's kind of sudden...

449
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,030
but can we stop seeing each other?

450
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,570
What?

451
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:33,480
<i>I've been thinking that this relationship
is not doing any of us good.</i>

452
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:37,320
I'm starting to be more clear-headed now.

453
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:40,480
I thought we should break up

454
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,120
before something happens.

455
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,700
<i>Let's meet and talk.</i>

456
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,120
What?

457
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,210
Let's meet and talk for now.

458
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:57,320
Sorry. I can't.

459
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,540
You are selfish.

460
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:06,650
I'm sorry.

461
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:17,780
<i> I'm sorry.   I.... did help your husband.</i>

462
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,350
<i>I told him</i>

463
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,590
<i>everything that happened so far.</i>

464
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:28,450
<i>- I'm really sorry from the bottom of my heart. But I want you to...
- I got it.</i>

465
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:32,640
I've accepted your apology. So leave.

466
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,900
Hello.

467
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:09,210
- Hello.
- Hello.

468
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,000
Sawa!

469
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,700
Sawa.

470
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,960
Hello?

471
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,900
Is it okay for you to call me?

472
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:58,000
<i>No, it's not. But I wanted to hear your voice.</i>

473
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,010
<i>I just want to confirm that it's really over.</i>

474
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:04,620
I don't plan on throwing my job away
because of an affair with a woman.

475
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:09,200
Aren't men simply playthings for your own excitement?

476
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,360
That may be true until now.

477
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,530
But I'm serious about it this time.

478
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:16,350
About you.

479
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,990
Don't make me laugh.

480
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:24,030
Good-looking men are childish and only think about themselves.

481
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:30,400
I'm tired of men who keep contacting me
and whispering sweet nothings to my ears.

482
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,720
But you...

483
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,140
You have an awful personality,

484
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,000
but you don't belong to any type.

485
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,230
You want to come here?

486
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:51,820
<i>That's if you can give up everything you have.</i>

487
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:06,180
I'm sorry.

488
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,170
I don't love you enough

489
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:11,130
to make me abandon my kids.

490
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,740
Then don't ever call me again.

491
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,100
What's wrong, sis?

492
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:01,160
- Let's stop by the convenience store.
- Yay!

493
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:16,160
Thanks for waiting.

494
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,720
It's fine.

495
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:29,980
I've been thinking long and hard.

496
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:35,530
We can't commit such a sin anymore.

497
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:41,300
I feel bad for your wife, too.
I also think that my husband is important to me.

498
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:47,530
Honestly,

499
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:51,020
I'm getting tired of this.

500
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,980
About you.

501
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:57,000
I don't love you enough to destroy my family.

502
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,900
I don't care about your excuses.

503
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,570
I understand that you want to break up with me.

504
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,740
I am...

505
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:16,950
not strong enough to have a relationship by just fooling around.

506
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,790
So... you, too.

507
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,400
Give up being a "bad teacher".

508
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,420
Go back to being a rigid teacher.

509
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,000
Our time together may be short,

510
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,800
but thank you.

511
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,730
Goodbye.

512
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,590
Please say something.

513
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,780
Say " Goodbye" to me.

514
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,890
I, too.

515
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:10,790
I felt that we can't carry on with this relationship forever.

516
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:16,450
But when I see your face, I realized that I didn't want to lose you.

517
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:22,600
"Just a little longer..."

518
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,690
"Just a little longer", was what I thought.

519
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,380
I know I'm selfish.

520
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:38,270
I made you say goodbye.

521
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:40,510
I'm sorry.

522
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:51,850
My cellphone number and address.

523
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:54,280
Erase them.

524
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,040
I'll do the same.

525
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,720
I don't want to think that you may call me again.

526
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:24,280
We go to the same train station,

527
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,680
So we may still bump into each other again.

528
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,780
But please don't call out to me.

529
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:36,070
I understand.

530
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,760
I won't call out to you, no matter what.

531
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:46,790
We'll become total strangers.

532
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,900
Let me walk you home.

533
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,620
<i>There is no end goal in adultery.</i>

534
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,610
<i>Having no goal...</i>

535
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:22,420
<i>means that it's also hard for it to end, too.</i>

536
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:29,900
<i>If I open my mouth, I'd want to take back
what I said about bidding farewell. </i>

537
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:35,480
<i>So we walked on without words.</i>

538
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,200
This is it, then.

539
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:45,370
Yup.

540
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,960
Goodbye.

541
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,160
Goodbye.

542
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,370
<i>I can't look back.</i>

543
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:14,420
<i>If I look back,</i>

544
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:18,050
<i>what awaits me is true hell.</i>

545
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:45,480
♫ <i>You and I met as strangers</i> ♫

546
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:50,880
♫ <i>Last night was last night, and tonight is tonight</i> ♫

547
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:56,310
♫ <i>Ticklish fingers, counting the moles</i> ♫

548
00:44:56,310 --> 00:45:00,810
♫ <i>Counting from one again</i> ♫

549
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:06,180
♫ <i>That's right, we're igniting each other once more</i> ♫

550
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:14,200
♫ <i>when we first meet</i> ♫

551
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:22,860
♫ <i>It's okay if you forget about me</i> ♫

552
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:27,450
♫ <i>It's okay if you got astray</i> ♫

553
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:32,800
♫ <i>I will return time and time again</i> ♫

554
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:39,440
♫ <i>I will show you that I will return</i> ♫

555
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:48,270
You know that this has to end someday, right?

556
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:50,370
Aren't you having a hard time too, Rikako?

557
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:52,700
You want to lock me in for the rest of my life?

558
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:56,500
Even if she chooses to go back,
I'm sure she is suffering and regretting.

559
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,570
A scandal is a life-and-death problem for a teacher.

560
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:02,850
I know that she is not a doll.

561
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:08,160
You... and that girl... I won't forgive you if you have an affair!

562
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,570
You have no choice but to go back to your mundane life.

563
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:13,000
If you're not strong,

564
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,190
you have no right to have an affair.
