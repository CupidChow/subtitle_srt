00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:40,000
<i>I'll come back by this weekend. I promise.</i>

2
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:45,520
<i>I liked the story of "Sleeping Beauty" when I was little.</i>

3
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,760
<i>In the forest of thorns,
Sleeping Beauty had waited a hundred years</i>

4
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,940
<i>until the prince came to save her.</i>

5
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,840
<i>I felt lonely after only three days,</i>

6
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,260
<i>and it's already too hard to bear.</i>

7
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:19,680
I'll leave once I've cleaned up.
I'll agree to any conditions you state for the divorce.

8
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,140
If I jump, I can die easily, right?

9
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,020
(laughing)

10
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,100
Cutting my wrist didn't kill me.

11
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,540
You're about to kill two lives, do you know that?

12
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,820
Stop with these lies!

13
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm not lying to you! I'm telling you that I'm really pregnant!

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,560
If you're really pregnant,
you wouldn't have wanted to kill yourself.

15
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,380
You're not that type of person.

16
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,320
You're really calm in this situation, huh?

17
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,940
That's right. This pregnancy is an absolute lie.

18
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,660
A pathetic lie.

19
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:24,040
And this? Your student did this to me.

20
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,040
- <i> - Stop!
- What the hell?
- Stop it, please!</i>

21
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,580
I thought I'd keep quiet for that boy's sake,

22
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:38,820
but I've used it for a dirty reason.

23
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,440
I'm gradually becoming the most disgusting kind of woman.

24
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,260
- Noriko...
- Don't look at me with those eyes! Just go.

25
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,560
What the heck...

26
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,180
<i>The overly-blue sky is making the sinner in me anxious.</i>

27
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,380
<i>What if that person doesn't come back?</i>

28
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,180
<i>I'll really be alone then.</i>

29
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,580
- Gorilla-Glasses.
- <i>You won't understand true pain</i>

30
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,220
<i>until you have lost everything.</i>

31
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,880
<i>I finally understood those words Rikako had said to me.</i>

32
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,260
Look after Hina for me, okay?

33
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,500
It's fine to leave us if you're just the housekeeper.

34
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,960
Dad had been kind of pushy, anyway.

35
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,360
I'm sorry, Mana.

36
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,740
I'm really sorry.

37
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,420
Make sure you lock up the house properly.

38
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,880
Hina?

39
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,940
What are you doing, Hina?!

40
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,800
Hina, hurry up and get out! Get out!

41
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,380
You'll get a fever again!

42
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:50,440
Mom will come home if I get a fever!

43
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,320
Mom!

44
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,540
Get out!

45
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:00,960
Mom! Mom!

46
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:08,040
No, Mom! Mom!

47
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:13,720
It's hard to forget that you've been betrayed before.

48
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,240
It's not something you can split in pieces and forget.

49
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,400
But you got back with Dad, didn't you?

50
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,760
That's for the sake of raising you. Deep in my heart,

51
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,840
I was hoping that he'd die soon.

52
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,400
It's painful to keep hating the person you're living with
under the same room.

53
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,280
I don't want you to go though the same experience.

54
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:50,960
Divorce her. Hurry up and eat. It's past noon alrady. Get up!

55
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,860
I'm sorry I'm late.

56
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,540
My phone died.

57
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:28,020
It's fine. That's because... I wasn't  waiting for you.

58
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,080
You're lying.

59
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,760
Yeah, I'm lying.

60
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,220
<i>Why do my tears keep falling?</i>

61
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,320
<i>Even though he had come back for me.</i>

62
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,220
<i>Even though I'm being embraced by his love.</i>

63
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,760
<i>I have become the sea.</i>

64
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,920
What's wrong?

65
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,660
Nothing. I thought you were fast asleep.

66
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,000
- Let's go.
- What?

67
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,920
- Just come with me.
- Why?

68
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,680
What are you doing?!

69
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,120
Don't be unreasonable!

70
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,640
Who's the unreasonable one here?!

71
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,660
Stop it!

72
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,880
- Stop!
- Let go!

73
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,520
- Let me go!
- Stop it!

74
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,040
You son of a...

75
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,300
Papa, I'm sorry. Please forgive me!

76
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,180
Please forgive me!

77
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,360
Please forgive me... I'm sorry.

78
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,540
You bitch!

79
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,760
You have no shame at all!

80
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,240
You shameless bitch!

81
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,580
Sawa... Sawa!

82
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,100
Apologize to Shun immediately!

83
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,340
Stop all this nonsense!

84
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:47,300
- Stop it!
- Sawa!

85
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,780
No...

86
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,320

Break up with Rikako.

109

If you don't, I will publish it.

110

For the sake of my conscience as the Editor-in-Chief.

111
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,520

- Kids, the grown ups are talking here.

That my husband and you

170
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:03,280
will never meet again. You will swear

171

Hang on a second. That man is mainly responsible,
so compensation should be substantial.

I don't want to receive any money.

177
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,150
I...

178
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,050
after thinking it through,

179
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,880
I've decided not to divorce.

180
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,500
So have I. Marriage is...

181
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,140
not a trivial matter at all.

182
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,820
The both of us will start everything over.

183
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,960
- Start over?
- We'll move to another city.

184
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,780
When and where we will move hasn't been decided.

185
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,240
I will have my husband

186
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,260
resign from the high school during the summer.

187
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,400
Wait, about the school...

188
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:10,420
Ms. Sawa, I hope that you will also resign from your job,
and move away.

189
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:17,500
As much as possible, I don't want you to see him,
even if by chance.

190
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,980
Well...

191
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,740
I understand. It would be impossible to do it immediately,

192
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,460
but we will look for a new house.

193
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,860
If you ever break this agreement,

194
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:37,940
even for a moment, I shall demand compensation of 30,000 yen a month from Ms. Sawa

195
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,620
until the day she dies.

196
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,900
Until she dies?

197
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:46,600
It's not that I want money.

198
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:54,450
There is just no other way for me to settle this.

199
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:59,450
You may think that it's cruel,

200
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:03,820
but my daughter is a victim whose husband
had been taken away from her.

201
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,340
I understand.

202
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:21,160
I promise. I will never meet Mrs. Sasamo again.

203
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,560
You're keeping your word, Yuichiro?

204
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,860
Yes.

205
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:30,260
I may sound bad to put it this way, but it was just a fling.

206
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:35,840
I have lived on the straight path for so long,
so I just wanted play around once.

207
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:41,190
So there is no reason for us to meet up again.

208
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:45,190
In truth, I was troubled that all of you had taken it so seriously.

209
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:50,410
It's a shame that it has come to this, but I am happy it's settled now.

210
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:56,820
At any rate, I never once told her openly

211
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,380
that I love her. This is the truth.

212
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,210
<i>So you're not saying you love me until then?</i>

213
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:09,050
<i>Sorry. I want to say that to you openly.</i>

214
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:21,250
Don't make me laugh. I was just alleviating my boredom, too.

215
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:27,290
I was just tired of of my job and housework,
and just wanted some excitement.

216
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:32,230
I just wanted to act out the part of the Belle de Jour*.
<i>[*Movie about a wife prostituting herself in the afternoon]</i>

217
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:37,890
So I have no intention of breaking up your family.

218
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:41,850
It's not a lasting  type of attachment.

219
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:51,870
I will never meet him. In fact, I don't want to meet him.

220
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:58,670
<i>Mr. Kitano, this is how you want things to be, right?</i>

221
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:04,580
<i>You said goodbye in a way to help me give up, right?</i>

222
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:10,560
Ms. Sawa, please sign this for both of us as well.

223
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,960
<i>Or...</i>

224
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,750
Thank you for everything.

225
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,500
Mineko.

226
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,500
What is this?

227
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,380
Could you give this to the manager, please?

228
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,300
I'm sorry for acting selfishly.

229
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:01,800
I understand. Well, good luck.

230
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,180
Hey!

231
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,780
Tomoya.

232
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,040
Tomoya. Hey, what's wrong?

233
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,000
That bastard stabbed me in the back.

234
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,340
No, I wasn't the one who made the announcement.

235
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:27,520
In fact, we are the ones who received the damage.

236
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:32,040
Yes...   Good bye.

237
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,240
Takigawa is angry.

238
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,960
And my phone hasn't stopping ringing since morning.

239
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,880
I'm sorry, for bothering you this much.

240
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,840
Why did you make such an announcement yourself?

241
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,860
I don't want to carry on living as a thief.

242
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,470
Wait, Osamu.

243
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,800
Take them.

244
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,620
That's enough.

245
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,860
Welcome back. You're late, huh?

246
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,340
Get out immediately.

247
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,020
Go back home.

248
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,100
You know, don't you?

249
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,740
The uproar about the plagiarism.

250
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,060
I have to get out of this place.

251
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,820
Then, let's go together.

252
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,380
Didn't you hear me? Get out.

253
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,620
Have you gotten sick of me?

254
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,780
That's right.

255
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,720
In that case, look and me and say it.

256
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,080
Look at me and say it!

257
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,560
I've grown to love you too much

258
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,660
Deliberately revealing the truth in order to mess everything up.

259
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,600
Nothing suits you better than this.

260
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,820
Hey.

261
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,220
Why don't we save some money and start a painting school?

262
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,580
I'll be your assistant.

263
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,940
We'll teach kids how to paint.

264
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:34,200
With canvas and crayons.

265
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:40,360
You have a scary face, but you're a child at heart.

266
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,920
I'm sure the kids would love you.

267
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,080
Let go.

268
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,900
Let go.

269
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,300
Tomoya.

270
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,260
I told you not to make Rikako cry.

271
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,320
Say something, you lying bastard!

272
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,440
Who cares about plagiarism... You!

273
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,660
I'm pissed with you for deciding to fess up all on your own!

274
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,740
Stop it!

275
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,580
If you really cared about Rikako, you'd have kept your mouth shut.

276
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,980
Keep your mouth shut and succeed!

277
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,020
Earn a ton of money and make Rikako happy!

278
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,100
Please, stop it.

279
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,100
Hey!

280
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,460
Stop!

281
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,180
- Do it!
- What?

282
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,220
What are you doing?

283
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,620
Do it!

284
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:39,520
You're not as strong as your words, are you? Cry baby.

285
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,620
You bastard!

286
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,860
Stop!

287
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,600
You're both okay, right?

288
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,980
They said his life is not in danger.

289
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,920
However...

290
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,090
However?

291
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:24,290
He sustained severe nerve damage in his right hand, and may never be able to grip properly again.

292
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:30,660
I said I would go to the police...

293
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,640
but that old man

294
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,900
stopped me from going, saying that this is a man-to-man fight.

295
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,220
That guy...

296
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,960
He started firing punches at me for real.

297
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,460
For real.

298
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,960
So I...

299
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,520
<i>You bastard!</i>

300
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,440
Guess it's time for me to admit defeat.

301
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,120
That's enough already.

302
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,440
This is what I got in the end.

303
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,220
Go home.

304
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,780
I don't want to go

305
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:48,340
feeling like I've made a woman unhappy.

306
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:00,880
I thought that was it but, I'm not strong enough to let go.

307
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,620
Because I'm a kid, I guess.

308
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,480
Rikako.

309
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,240
Go home.

310
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,160
Go back to your house.

311
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,100
Go back to being a mother.

312
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,520
Farewell.

313
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,720
I love you.

314
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:11,460
What are you saying? I was just fooling around with you.

315
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:43,850
Sawa...

316
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:06,810
<i>I was overwhelmed by their farewells to each other.</i>

317
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:14,670
<i>I wanted to at least express my true feelings in the end before saying goodbye.</i>

318
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:22,800
<i>The feelings of regret that lingered in me, drove me to where he was.</i>

319
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,080
I want to make the separation clear to her.

320
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,850
Please accept my request.

321
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,430
There are two...

322
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,590
conditions.

323
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,490
Firstly,

324
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,430
to announce that you'll resign

325
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:51,470
from your current position

326
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,140
to return to your research.

327
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:59,580
That way, we should can avoid unnecessary inquiries.

328
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:04,230
- Noted.
- Secondly,

329
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:07,510
apologise to the students.

330
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:12,680
A teacher cannot easily lower his head.

331
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,060
Regardless of justice or injustice,

332
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:21,300
a teacher has to face the students with conviction.

333
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:26,390
Those are my thoughts on the matter.

334
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,500
This is sudden,

335
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:35,030
but I will no longer be teaching at this school.

336
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:38,430
- It's you?
- As if.

337
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:42,090
I won't be here for the third year graduation ceremony.

338
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,860
What happened, Kitano?

339
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,310
What's up?

340
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:50,730
I really regret having to make this decision.

341
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,540
What a pity...

342
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,830
Everyone, please be well.

343
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,690
- We will.
- Okay.

344
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,930
I sincerely hope that the remainder of your high school education

345
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,830
will be a positive experience for each of you.

346
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:05,510
What's with this shallow greeting?

347
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,970
You had an affair and they made you quit, right?

348
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:10,910
Tell us what happened with the woman.

349
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:13,340
I will use it as reference to my mom.

350
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,770
- Good idea!
- You got that right.

351
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:18,150
Yeah, Mr. Kitano!

352
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:21,150
What's wrong?

353
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,030
Autumn...

354
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:28,800
is a really important period for entrance exams.

355
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,200
Do your best, everybody.

356
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,800
What the hell is that?

357
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,900
Answer!

358
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:45,990
I haven't learnt a damn thing from you.

359
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,920
Bringing manga to class is not allowed.

360
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,120
I'll leave this in the staff room.

361
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,740
Mr. Kitano, are you running away?

362
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:06,460
- What the heck?
- Unbelievable.
- You're leaving?

363
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,700
Thank you for everything

364
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:59,530
No way. I don't recall that.

365
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,240
<i>Hello.</i>

366
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,940
<i>This is Kitano, your Biology teacher.</i>

367
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,400
- <i>I forgot to say something.</i>
- Did you hear that?

368
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,780
<i>So I'll use this speaker to do so.</i>

369
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,500
As...

370
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:53,960
your Biology teacher,

371
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,930
I have...

372
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,140
What the hell?

373
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:04,540
- What did he forget to tell us?
- Never mind that.

374
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,480
I'm sorry.

375
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,220
I have a favor

376
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,980
to ask of you.

377
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,030
As a living being...

378
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,000
who has received life on this earth...

379
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,140
please...

380
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,200
earnestly love someone...

381
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,480
in your future ahead.

382
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,700
<i>When you love someone,</i>

383
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,200
<i>The scenery you are used to looking at,</i>

384
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,200
<i>will appear different from before.</i>

385
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:54,400
<i>You'll wish for happiness</i>

386
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,700
<i>for someone other than yourself.</i>

387
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,100
<i>You will realize</i>

388
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:05,160
<i>how happy you will be.</i>

389
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:11,100
<i>Besides in humans, love also exists</i>

390
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,100
<i>in mammals and birds,</i>

391
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,160
<i>But for humans,</i>

392
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:24,300
<i>love... is a special thing.</i>

393
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,700
<i>I, too,</i>

394
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,200
<i>after meeting a special someone,</i>

395
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,000
<i>and loving her,</i>

396
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,900
and breaking up with her,

397
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,400
<i>finally got to understand that happiness.</i>

398
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,900
<i>Just meeting and mating</i>

399
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:56,560
is not considered love.

400
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,800
That is what I think.

401
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:04,000
Mr. Kitano! Mr. Kitano, open the door!

402
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
<i>That is what I think.</i>

403
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,700
<i>Even if we're apart from each other,</i>

404
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,600
<i>we keep praying that the other person is happy.</i>

405
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
<i>That is...</i>

406
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:24,260
- Mr. Kitano!
- the love...
<i> - Get the key.</i>

407
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:27,600
that homo sapiens...

408
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,400
<i>that human beings have...</i>

409
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,250
<i>is their hearts.</i>

410
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,300
That is why I hope

411
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,910
that you will someday

412
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:56,700
love someone earnestly.

413
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,920
<i>This is what I'm asking for.</i>

414
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:08,120
- <i>I'm sorry for leaving in the middle of the school year.</i>
- Principal!

415
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,260
I'm sorry.

416
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,870
And also,

417
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,890
<i>thank you.</i>

418
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,290
<i>Goodbye.</i>

419
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:03,050
- I'll go get him.
- It's enough.

420
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:11,260
Seriously, men act like little kids, no matter how old they get.

421
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,240
Principal...

422
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,460
That's why I like adult women.

423
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,520
See you.

424
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:32,300
I apologize for the inconvenience.

425
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:39,270
Excuse me.

426
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,900
You're too serious.

427
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,030
You're lame.

428
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,840
I thought so.

429
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:11,830
I will graduate high school for sure.

430
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:15,390
But I just can't see my Mom yet.

431
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:25,150
I'm not your teacher anymore.

432
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:25,790
<i>If I could,</i>

433
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,500
<i>I would want to run up to that person.</i>

434
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,300
<i>But...</i>

435
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:36,590
<i>we are no longer allowed to see each other.</i>

436
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:39,160
<i>That fire that I saw that day</i>

437
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:43,500
<i>wasn't started to cover up an affair. That was what I thought.</i>

438
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,400
<i>The wife who had set fire to her own house</i>

439
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,900
<i>probably wanted to cut off from a love that couldn't be forgiven.</i>

440
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:57,400
<i>Because if she had gotten caught for committing this sin,</i>

441
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,780
<i>she wouldn't be able to see him again</i>

442
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:01,740
<i>even if she wanted to.</i>

443
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:26,550
I had set the fire.

444
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:35,050
We have found the reason for the fire, so please go home.

445
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:40,570
Why are you setting me free? I had set a fire.

446
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:48,160
Your husband told us that it was an accidental fire that happened while cleaning.

447
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,580
Thank goodness, it was just a small fire.  Because your husband put it out quickly.

448
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:56,180
You're wrong. He's covering for me.

449
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:02,400
Ma'am, this matter can't be pursued under the law.

450
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:06,160
A sin that doesn't lead to penalty by law,

451
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,820
has to be atoned for by yourself.

452
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:31,210
Are you hurt?

453
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:34,550
You okay?

454
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:38,990
Sit down.

455
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:10,480
Let's divorce.

456
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,500
I wanted to live with you

457
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,160
quietly

458
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,060
without having to force you to do so.

459
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,480
I thought this was marriage.

460
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:36,620
But,

461
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,500
what you wished for was different, right?

462
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:50,260
You wanted...

463
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:07,590
Sawa?

464
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:22,950
It's sad, right?

465
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,440
Why can't you understand the feelings

466
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:34,220
of the one who's closest to you?

467
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,280
Oh, right.

468
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:47,280
I don't know if it's because of the fire, but Hamumi came back.

469
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,200
She's really foolish, isn't she?

470
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,240
It's too late.

471
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:31,570
Hamusuke, Hamumi, Mihamu.

472
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:35,150
Please take care of Papa for me, okay?

473
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:39,370
Shunsuke said he may change his mind if he sees you,

474
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:42,170
so he's not taking the day off from work.

475
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:50,610
- I will put the key in the mail box.
- I haven't forgiven you.

476
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:53,270
But take care.

477
00:50:55,380 --> 00:51:00,240
I hope you both will move on.

478
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:08,460
I... enjoyed...

479
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:17,940
chatting with you. What the hell am I saying?! Jeez!

480
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:21,020
Goodness!

481
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:31,880
<i>Are you leaving?</i>

482
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:37,940
<i>Yes, I finally found an apartment and a job.</i>

483
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:39,900
It's all over, huh?

484
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:44,460
<i>Your love, and mine, too.</i>

485
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:52,500
I wonder if we will ever love someone again.

486
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,660
I...

487
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:05,200
It's going to be lonely, but I won't contact you anymore.

488
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:10,980
Me, too.

489
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:18,960
Say, has this love changed anything?

490
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,020
Yes.

491
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,300
Rikako! Rikako!

492
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,280
Yes!

493
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,640
Sorry, my husband is calling me.

494
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:36,720
So, take care.

495
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:39,600
You, too.

496
00:52:55,780 --> 00:53:00,180
<i>No, there's only one thing that changed.</i>

497
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,120
I've learned how to tie my shoes by myself.

498
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:12,100
With this, I won't stand still.

499
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,040
What's wrong?

500
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,300
Nothing.

501
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:49,480
It's off-season, but I thought I heard the sound of cicadas. I guess I was wrong.

502
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:51,460
Here you go.

503
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:53,150
Please.

504
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,300
Yuichiro!

505
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:58,820
I'm sorry.

506
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:07,580
Right now, I...

507
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:09,060
Noriko...

508
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,460
I'll be late in arriving there.

509
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:19,420
I will clean and wait for you.

510
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:20,960
See you then.

511
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,040
<i>Adultery.</i>

512
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:34,980
<i>A desire that's indecent, filthy, and irrational.</i>

513
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:38,080
Don't rush.

514
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,660
<i>A sin that makes you betray your family,</i>

515
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:43,620
<i>hurt the people around you,</i>

516
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:46,120
<i>and lose your friends.</i>

517
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,220
<i>A sin that throws you into the abyss of suffering as well.</i>

518
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:56,300
<i>♫ Drownin' away ♫</i>

519
00:54:56,300 --> 00:55:00,960

<i>Once you step foot inside,</i>

00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:09,460
<i>you'll realize that there's no way to escape or turn back.</i>

522
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:14,380
<i>It's a forbidden love that destroys everything.</i>

523
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,340
<i>♫ So far away ♫</i>

524
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:21,460

Hey!

526
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:28,600
