1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,000
I see your true colors now.

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,600
You knew I am his wife and got close to me, right?
How despicable!

3
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,000
- You're mistaken.
- Yeah, right.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,800
- You laughing at me behind my back, right?
- No.

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,100
Sawa really didn't know anything.

6
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,600
"Sawa"? Are you protecting her?!

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,400
Let's go.

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,100
- Let me go!
- Let's go home and talk.

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,160
- Stop it!
- What's going on here?

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,000
It's nothing.

11
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,200
<i>Is this what they call hell? To me,</i>

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,700
<i>it didn't feel like all this is happening for real.</i>

13
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,700
Bitch.

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,000
<i>Only the warmth from his hand protecting me</i>

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,300
<i>made me realize that this is real.</i>

16
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:17,400
<i>[Hirugao: Love Affairs in the Afternoon]</i>

17
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:24,600
I understand there was a good reason for it. But since we received a report, we can't let you go without questioning you.

18
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,200
It's exactly what you think it is.

19
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,300
My husband and this person were having an affair.

20
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,000
I see.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,700
So  you were having a discussion?

22
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,400
There is no way we can discuss about this.

23
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,700
This person was my friend, you know?

24
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,000
Mister, is this true?

25
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,000
Ms. Sasamoto, could you please explain?

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,200
She won't answer.

27
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,400
Even though she's married...

28
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,900
- this slut stole her friend's husband.
- Stop it.

29
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,700
- Don't say that kind of stuff in front of others.
- Why not?

30
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,100
Since this happened already, I will settle this openly.
I'll never forgive this woman!

31
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,500
Since there are no casualties,

32
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,700
I'll just let you off with a warning.

33
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,700
Please don't act like that again in public.

34
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,600
Let's go, Yuichiro.

35
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,400
Or you want to stay here?

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Please wait a moment.

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,400
39 years old, you said? You don't look like it.

38
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,200
Thank you.

39
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,920
Hand.

40
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,170
- What?
- Show me your hand.

41
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,410
You can lie with your looks, but not with your hands.

42
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,600
Let's see...

43
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,200
You maintained your hands well.

44
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,700
Do you have any experience working as a bar girl?

45
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,600
I don't.

46
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,540
You don't?

47
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,400
Why do you want to be a bar girl?

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
If you're just here to earn extra cash, then forget about it.

49
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,700
I...

50
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,800
had left my husband and kids,

51
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,600
to be with the man I love.

52
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,900
He's an artist,

53
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,300
and doesn't have money.

54
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,600
Ever since I got married,

55
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,300
I've lived under my highly-paid husband's salary.

56
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,100
I had a lavish life so far.

57
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,100
I don't have the skills to work as an office worker.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,570
In order to support him,

59
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,400
and for us both to survive,

60
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,600
I figured that working at a bar is all I can do.

61
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,300
Nice.

62
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,200
You can deliver such a cheap, made-up story so well.

63
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,000
You are really something.

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,800
Oh my. Was it cheap?

65
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,600
You can start work anytime. We have plenty of young girls,

66
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,000
so in exchange for your age,
use other techniques to bait customers,

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,100
and bring in the money, okay?

68
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,700
What's going on?

69
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,600
Good evening.

70
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,300
We were supposed to meet at 7PM, right?

71
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,900
Sawa went out shopping and hasn't returned.

72
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,400
So I figured she came here first.

73
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,100
I guess I'm wrong.

74
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,300
I'm so sorry.

75
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:54,200
Something urgent cropped up,
so we had canceled our dinner appointment.

76
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,600
I see. Does Sawa know?

77
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,700
- We did contact...
- Of course.

78
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,100
Because we were with your wife until just now.

79
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,900
Then why she didn't contact me?

80
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:09,700
I've called her multiple times but I can't reach her.

81
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,100
I feel bad for you.

82
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,600
- What?
- You should properly ask Sawa later.

83
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,100
Did something happen to your wife?

84
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,900
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,700
No, you don't need to apologize to me.

86
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,800
I'm so sorry.

87
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,900
Why are you apologizing?

88
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,500
Why?

89
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,800
I'm back.

90
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,600
Are they here for your art?

91
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,000
Hello. My name is Sakura. I'm an art dealer.

92
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,200
We know each other though BONITO.

93
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,010
BONITO?

94
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,000
Thank you for coming. Let me make some tea.

95
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,800
It's fine. We've already made tea ourselves.

96
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,850
Thank you.

97
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:40,550
My work involves introducing Japanese artists
to worldwide restaurants and galleries overseas.

98
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,470
I'm sure I can help him.

99
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,600
Please take care of him.

100
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,450
Of course I will. It's for Osamu's sake, after all.

101
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,300
Please stop that.

102
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,500
- Call me Kato.
- Why? We do know each other anyway.

103
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,000
Hello?

104
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,950
Yes.

105
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,370
Hold on, please.

106
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,000
It's for you.

107
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,990
- They said they're the police.
- Police?

108
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,600
Hello?

109
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,600
Yes. This is Rikako Takigawa.

110
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,000
Yes.

111
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,860
Do you remember the fire that occurred
the day before the incident?

112
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,100
Yes.

113
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,650
I saw it from my balcony.

114
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,410
Some media agencies already reported it,

115
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:52,860
but it was said that the wife had set her house on fire
after her affair  was discovered.

116
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,560
A "hirugao" wife, they call it.
<i>[A wife who cheats in broad daylight]</i>

117
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,770
She got serious.

118
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:03,200
She set her house on fire so she could leave.

119
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,400
Once people stray from the path, they will lose their way.

120
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,700
You should think things through as soon as possible.

121
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,100
Yes?

122
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,930
Sawa?

123
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm sorry.

124
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,360
It's okay.

125
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,110
She's gorgeous.

126
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,540
I can tell from your paintings.

127
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,340
I can see how much you're in love.

128
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,600
You never really did any paintings of me.

129
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Don't tease me.

130
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,600
But Rikako Takigawa, of all people.

131
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:01,400
You are really something to steal that editor-in-chief's wife.

132
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,900
Mr. Takigawa is also out of his mind by continuing to hire you.

133
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,430
Finding out who my ex-wife is,

134
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,100
is his way of taking revenge.

135
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,100
I'm happy to see you, though.

136
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,310
After we broke up, the reason why I started working with art,

137
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:25,000
was because I thought that I may see you again someday.

138
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,200
Aren't you going to say that you're happy, too?

139
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,000
It's not like we parted ways on bad terms.

140
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,900
This place...

141
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,800
looks like the atelier we rented when we were married.

142
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,500
No matter how hungry we were,

143
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:50,000
you were collecting rare overseas art books back then.

144
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,300
These, too. Right?

145
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,300
Does she know about this?

146
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,800
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

147
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,200
It's our little secret.

148
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,800
Right?

149
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,740
You and Noriko almost got into a brawl, huh?

150
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,400
It's not funny.

151
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,170
Isn't this crazy?

152
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,310
You used to say that it's impossible that you'd have an affair,

153
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:33,870
but yet you fought with your lover's wife at the library.

154
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,510
I used to say that adultery was just for fun,

155
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,750
but I threw everything away,

156
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,970
And ran off to the man I was having an affair with.

157
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,400
There's nothing that's crazier than this.

158
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,850
Three months ago,

159
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,070
I never imagined

160
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,400
that I would become like this.

161
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,400
You should end things here.

162
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:05,570
There is also merit in living a boring life.

163
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,600
You won't realize that until you lose it.

164
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,700
I've always thought so, too.

165
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,400
I shouldn't hope for passionate happiness.

166
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,900
Quiet happiness is the most precious thing.

167
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,990
That's why... I cook food,

168
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,720
make lunch, and take on a part-time job...

169
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,700
It was boring,

170
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:41,000
but I try to make myself believe that is my happiness.

171
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,200
But...

172
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,800
You want to leave your husband and be with Mr. Kitano, don't you?

173
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,400
Sawa...

174
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,400
I'm horrible, aren't I?

175
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:17,100
But... my marriage may have already fallen apart.

176
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,630
I was just pretending not to notice.

177
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,070
I just didn't have the confidence

178
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,400
to have a strong desire for something.

179
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,200
I know. I totally know how painful it feels.

180
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:37,300
But it's impossible. He won't leave his wife.

181
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,450
A woman may want to think that
the man she fell in love with is special,

182
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,400
but a special man doesn't exist.

183
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,480
Similarly, a woman can't fall in love for fun.

184
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,370
In my husband's magazine,

185
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:56,830
it stated that a "hirugao" wife will skillfully have fun

186
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:00,410
in an affair, without destroying her family.

187
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:05,420
After I became one, I finally realized that
there is no space for fun.

188
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,000
When the relationship got deeper,

189
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,600
and you start to think " Maybe I love this man",

190
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,570
you are serious about it.

191
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,200
A "hirugao" wife doesn't exist in the first place.

192
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,220
Huh? You're already home?

193
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,500
I heard dinner with the Kitanos was canceled.
You should have told me earlier.

194
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,430
I'm sorry. I wasn't able to call you.

195
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,080
Don't worry about it.

196
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,700
I guess I'll get going.

197
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,900
- Rikako.
- Yes?

198
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,600
Uh.. Well...

199
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,410
It's rude of me to say this but...

200
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,200
please stay away from Sawa from now on.

201
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,100
What are you saying? What you heard from Noriko was wrong.

202
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,500
I... don't think so.

203
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,500
Ever since you got to know Rikako,

204
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,600
you've changed.

205
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,270
It's not her fault.

206
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,710
It's okay, Sawa.

207
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,800
I'm leaving. Good night.

208
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,700
- Rikako.
- Mama!

209
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,410
I...

210
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:27,100
went to Kitano's place because
I thought you were there before me.

211
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,480
And?

212
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,600
Noriko told me

213
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,400
that she felt sorry for me.

214
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,210
Papa.

215
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,600
It's your fault, Mama.

216
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,650
You didn't inform me about the cancelation,
so it made me feel so silly.

217
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,260
We're both hungry, right?

218
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,200
Okay, let me make something tonight.

219
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:13,090
Oh, we have rice. I'll make fried rice then.

220
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:17,170
<i>My husband prevented me from confessing.</i>

221
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:20,900
<i>Was it because he wanted to protect the life he has with me?</i>

222
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:25,200
<i>Or he just wanted to avoid hearing something unpleasant?</i>

223
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:30,100
<i>Even though my feelings have changed so much,</i>

224
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,000
<i>the night ended exactly the same way, as always.</i>

225
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,850
I will give you one week.

226
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:42,100
We'll move out of here,

227
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,700
and move in to my parents' place.

228
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,200
Are you asking me to live with your parents?

229
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,210
You see,

230
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:57,100
I don't want to live in this town anymore. You understand, right?

231
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,050
I won't ask you to explain. I don't want to hear it anyway.

232
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,000
If you do what I say,

233
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,800
I'll forget about what happened.

234
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,980
You and I have high social standings,

235
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,360
so let's not divorce over such a cheap affair.

236
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,070
But...

237
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,800
don't ever see her again.

238
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,200
Don't contact her either. That's all I ask.

239
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,540
Yuichiro.

240
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,500
I love you.

241
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,200
Please give an answer to my love.

242
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,250
- Understood.
- Understood.

243
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,570
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

244
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:00,990
Alright, as usual, please work hard with a smile.

245
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,700
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

246
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,700
Good morning.

247
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,920
Ah, don't worry about that.

248
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,290
But the customers will...

249
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,990
Don't worry. We will take care of it.

250
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,000
Good morning. Did something happen?

251
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,500
I'm sorry, Sawa. Sorry!

252
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,900
What?

253
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,800
You have a minute?

254
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,880
- Are you okay?
- What?

255
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,670
There is a strange rumor going around about you.

256
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,320
I heard you had some trouble with our customer.

257
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,470
I'm sorry. It was just a personal problem.

258
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:51,810
Just a personal problem?!
A grocery store needs customers to survive.

259
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:57,880
What would people think if they find out that our employee
is having an affair with a customer's husband?!

260
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,620
We received a phone call from Ms. Noriko Kitano.

261
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,400
She said that you seduced her husband.

262
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:16,470
She said she won't blow the matter up,

263
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:21,400
but the store manager is having a big headache because of that.

264
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:27,050
Am I... being fired?

265
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:31,450
Even we want to, we can't. Because of the law.

266
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,400
Even if you're a cheater, we have no choice but to let you stay.

267
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,400
I'm so sorry.

268
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,600
Mr. Kitano.

269
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,600
Why don't you transfer school?

270
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:53,900
We have no problem if you do that during the summer vacation.

271
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:59,040
I don't want to leave my students
in the middle of the school year.

272
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:04,420
I will make sure to not to let this matter affect my students.

273
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,610
If you have such a strong sense of responsibility,

274
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:11,600
then why did you do something
that you were not supposed not to do?!

275
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,980
I heard...

276
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,580
that your wife is a researcher with a promising bright future.

277
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,000
Why...

278
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,890
despite having a beautiful and smart wife,

279
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:32,830
did you make this mistake with some other person's wife?

280
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,060
You met my wife?

281
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,950
This morning, she came and told me.

282
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,890
Though he is an educator...

283
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,900
what my husband did...

284
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,510
was...

285
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,380
really unforgivable.

286
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,560
On behalf of my husband,

287
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,620
I sincerely apologize.

288
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,400
Of course as educator,

289
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,200
but as a man as well, you should clean up the mess you created.

290
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,530
It's rare of you to invite me out for lunch.

291
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,870
Your wife didn't prepare your lunchbox for today?

292
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,690
Well...

293
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:17,150
Had an argument with your wife?

294
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,010
I wish I had.

295
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,510
Oh, it's nothing.

296
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:29,310
I'll treat you to lunch once in a while.
It's only 1,000 yen though, so hope you don't mind.

297
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:33,750
What happened?

298
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,260
What?

299
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:41,270
You look so lonely today.

300
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:46,350
I understand because I've been watching you all the time.

301
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:52,530
I wish my wife heard what you just said.

302
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:55,110
I knew something happened between you and your wife.

303
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,610
How should I put it...

304
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,910
- You have work at night?
- That's right.

305
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,910
I was not sure about it at first because of my age.

306
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:13,810
But when I said I was the model for artist Osamu Kato,
I got hired right away.

307
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:19,310
Can you work as a bar girl?

308
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:27,240
I don't know. I understand it's not easy.

309
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,970
But I will try anyway.

310
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,090
Don't say that you're not letting me work as a bar girl.

311
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,800
I won't.

312
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,550
I can't.

313
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:49,470
That's right. We need money anyway.

314
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,190
Look at this dress.

315
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:58,030
They want me to wear this. It's hard for a 39-year-old, huh?

316
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:02,950
What? Don't stare at me.

317
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,950
My job is to stare at people.

318
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,970
I see. Then feel free to stare.

319
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,610
Help me zip up.

320
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,010
Hello.

321
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,750
Sorry to disturb.

322
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,740
Hello.

323
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,890
I know this is sudden, but we need go to the High Rich Hotel.

324
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:54,780
High Rich Hotel?

325
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,130
Developers from Singapore are having a meeting there.

326
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:02,310
If things go well, they may use your paintings for the main lobby

327
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:05,550
of the shopping mall that's opening soon.

328
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,850
Hurry and get dressed.

329
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:11,460
Even artists have to do the sales.

330
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,840
Right?

331
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,030
Why don't you go there?

332
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:26,210
Don't tell me that you're going like that.
You have to wear a suit or jacket.

333
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:27,870
I don't have any.

334
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:32,250
I will get it right away then. Let's go.

335
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:34,990
Good luck.

336
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,850
I'll be borrowing him.

337
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,680
I'm sorry to say this but.... those clothes don't suit you.

338
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,890
I'm sorry for being so frank.

339
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:58,010
When Osamu starts getting popular,
customers may show up more often at the atelier.

340
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,510
Thank you very much.

341
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:05,050
I don't know anything about art, so I look forward to your advice.

342
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,530
Advise you? That's too much.

343
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,520
See you.

<i>It's a lie when people say that a woman is beautiful

345
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:32,730
<i>Love makes a woman jealous,</i>

346
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:36,230
<i>encourages her to steal from others,</i>

00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:12,720
<i>Can I stop by your place now?</i>

356
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,670
You always came without asking me anyway.

357
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:19,670
<i>I thought I should ask every once a while.</i>

358
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,660
Then... I'm sorry.

359
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,000
Could you come tomorrow instead?

360
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,090
I'm tired today. My house is a little messy, too.

361
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:34,540
Don't worry about it. I will clean the house for you.

362
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,030
<i>See you later.</i>

363
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,850
Why ask when you're bent on coming anyway?

364
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:49,950
Truth is, I'm here already.

365
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,520
I know she will be so happy.

366
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:58,150
When she's back, the food will be ready, the laundry will be done.

367
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,350
The house will also be cleaned up.

368
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:09,010
Mom! Thank you very much! Don't mention it.

369
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:20,170
Are you Mr. Sasamoto's wife?

370
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,370
- Yes.
- Hello.

371
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:27,850
My name is Misuzu Hasegawa. I am Mr. Sasamoto's subordinate.

372
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:31,530
Well, hello.

373
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,310
Please come in.

374
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:36,010
No need. Here is fine.

375
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,350
That woman.

376
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,630
But...

377
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:42,610
Firstly, please give me your husband.

378
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:49,830
I'm sure you've heard about it from your mother-in-law.

379
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:53,030
I like Mr. Sasamoto.

380
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,130
Wait a minute.

381
00:27:55,130 --> 00:28:00,160
Mr. Sasamoto is a coward. At first, I was doing it for fun.

382
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:05,820
At the age when a man starts to lose his confidence,
it's fun to toy around with him.

383
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,320
But then...

384
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,530
Seeing him always looking so serious and getting flustered,

385
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:13,790
made me start to think he's really adorable.

386
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,990
Besides...

387
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:19,930
you're having an affair,  aren't you?

388
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:26,870
- What are you talking about?
- Mr. Sasamoto knows all about it.

389
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:30,090
- He was having a hard time.
- Please stop.

390
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:32,990
You are the one who should stop.

391
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:40,290
That's all I wanted to say. Hurry up and divorce him, will you?

392
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:45,630
I am unlike you. I won't look for another man after I marry.

393
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,490
See you.

394
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,670
Mom...

395
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,570
Well...

396
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,390
Don't come near me. You filthy slut!

397
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,610
<i>Little by little,</i>

398
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:53,090
<i>my world</i>

399
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:56,450
<i>is starting to crumble.</i>

400
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:01,660
<i>Now, I kind of understand</i>

401
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:05,370
<i>why the woman had set fire to her own house</i>

402
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,950
<i>to escape from everything.</i>

403
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,510
Hello?

404
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:25,710
<i>Have you decided on the date to move out?</i>

405
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,180
No.

406
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:32,000
Why did you go to my school?

407
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,790
<i>If they find about what happened at the library,
you will have a hard time.</i>

408
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:40,650
<i>So I went there and gave an apology first.</i>

409
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:43,240
<i>It will be too late if the matter blows up.</i>

410
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:47,160
<i>I've also contacted the grocery store where that woman works.</i>

411
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,440
<i>I told them that I won't let this matter out to the public.</i>

412
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,770
<i>Yuichiro.</i>

413
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,870
<i>Hurry up and move in here.</i>

414
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,340
<i>My mom and dad are also waiting for you.</i>

415
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:06,700
This is the development project.
40 years ago, we were only a small company

416
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:12,100
We were a small company on Sentosa island. But today....

417
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,600
What are you doing? Let's go.

418
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,500
I feel like a clown.

419
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,010
You look good. You should be proud.

420
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,310
<i>And we will be joining with businesses around the world
in the coming years.</i>

421
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,400
First up in Japan...

422
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:34,600
Wow. You sure look like a world-class artist.

423
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,030
- See?
- Sakura.

424
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:41,920
We've already introduced ourselves to Mr. Laman.
I'll let you take care of  the rest.

425
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:47,940
Noted on that. I've made an appointment
to meet with Barcelona's art dealer next week.

426
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,140
Can Mr. Kato join us?

427
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:54,460
Sounds good. I'm looking forward to it.

428
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,000
What is it about Barcelona? I'm not aware of that.

429
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,800
I just said so. We have to push while you are hot.

430
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,500
What's wrong? Things are going smoothly for you.

431
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,800
- Let me think about it.
- Excuse me?

432
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,600
Do you think I can really succeed?

433
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,800
Where you belong is not in a gloomy atelier.

434
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,200
You belong under the dazzling lights.

435
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:53,000
Ladies and gentlemen, and Mr. Laman.

436
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,400
This is Mr. Kato, the artist for this painting.

437
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:20,910
Stop it. This is not that kind of bar, you know?

438
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:23,460
You think you're some big shot? You old hag.

439
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:28,070
- What?
- Excuse me.

440
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,990
Thank you.

441
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,960
Don't show your emotions. Now, move to that box.

442
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,000
Excuse me. Are you alonー

443
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:49,100
Why are you so surprised? I've been properly
watching over you all this time.

444
00:33:54,200 --> 00:34:00,600
- Welcome.
- Give me... the most expensive champagne.

445
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,860
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
- Bring me Dom Perignon, please.
- Noted on that.

446
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,110
You look comfortable in here.

447
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:12,200
- That's because I was a hostess at home, too.
- That joke is too much.

448
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,680
You are here to discuss our divorce?

449
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:19,700
I won't divorce you. I can't possibly let our girls
grow up without their mother.

450
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:34,000
Hina cried again yesterday and kept asking for her mom.

451
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,850
Don't be stubborn.

452
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:47,230
You'll be abandoned by Kato one day.

453
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:52,920
Remember that brazen woman who showed up at the atelier?
She is Kato's ex-wife.

454
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:59,210
They did divorce but I heard
they had been madly in love in the beginning.

455
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:05,000
I guess they'll start to have feelings for each other again.

456
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,300
I heard they'll be traveling overseas soon.

457
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:15,760
You introduced her to him because you wanted them
to get back together?

458
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,080
Of course not. It's purely business.

459
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,150
You're really despicable.

460
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:27,200
So... come back.

461
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,450
That kind of cheap-looking clothes don't suit you.

462
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:37,000
I only started working because
I didn't want to be a slave to your money.

463
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,700
So are you planning to fall into the abyss because of that man?

464
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,020
Open your eyes already.

465
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,360
Don't you get it yet?

466
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,210
I've opened my eyes, that's why I left you.

467
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,000
Thank you very much.

468
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Excuse me. The customer is requesting for another hostess.

469
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,300
Hasegawa tends to overreact to things.

470
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,500
Just because I looked a little tired, she told me,

471
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,800
"Your wife is having an affair, isn't she?"

472
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:19,400
Like I mentioned before, I have no feelings for her at all.
And I believe in you.

473
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:28,900
I can't believe it. But unfortunately,
my mom overheard what she had said.

474
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:32,200
My mom also likes to overreact, too.

475
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:38,760
Oh, right. Let me go speak to her now and clear things up.

476
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,300
Wait.

477
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:45,600
Oh, go ahead with dinner first. I may bring my mom to a sushi restaurant or something.

478
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,420
Wait.

479
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,000
It's not a misunderstanding.

480
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:58,360
You knew, didn't you?

481
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,850
I...

482
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:09,190
- have fallen in love with another man.
- Stop it!

483
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:17,540
Stop joking around. Okay?

484
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,030
I'm not joking.

I'm sorry.

498
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,600
- I can't...
- SHUT UP!

499
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:35,380
Mama...

500
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,500
you are nothing special,

501
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,800
but you are an adorable wife.

502
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:52,050
You make sure to do the housework.

503
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:56,520
Everyday...

504
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:01,410
you work hard at your part-time job.

505
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:07,460
We don't have any kids,

506
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:14,420
but we go grocery shopping together,

507
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:19,060
we laugh together while watching TV.

508
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,800
No matter what, we look like a perfect couple.

509
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,990
Like always...

510
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:37,000
We'll grow old together peacefully

511
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,280
with Hamusuke and Mihamu.

512
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,080
Then that will be all a lie.

513
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,700
That is not who I am.

514
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,500
I'm so sorry.

515
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,660
<i>I didn't know where I was going,</i>

516
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:15,480
<i>but I can't go back to that house anymore. That was how I felt.</i>

517
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:38,640
<i>That memorable place was still there, and hadn't changed at all.</i>

518
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:35,990
<i>That was the biggest punishment that God had given me.</i>

519
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:41,410
Barcelona? Isn't that a little too sudden?

520
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:44,880
Apparently, someone there wants to meet me.

521
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:48,010
Are you going there with Ms. Sakura?

522
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,900
No.

523
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,890
The rest of the staff are going as well.

524
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,360
She's really working hard for you, isn't she?

525
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:05,300
It's my last chance.

526
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,790
I'm off.

527
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:11,120
You're coming back, right?

528
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:14,390
Of course.

529
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:17,860
Aren't you going to ask whether I'm going to wait for you?

530
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,800
What's the matter?

531
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,060
I love you.

532
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,970
I'll get going.

533
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,430
Be careful, okay?

534
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,880
Oh, this feels great!

535
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,320
It feels like being on a field trip when I was a kid.

536
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,470
Field trips, huh?

537
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:23,860
I don't really have any good memories of it.

538
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,790
What?

539
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:29,130
Was it because you wanted to sit next to the girl you liked, but you couldn't?

540
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:30,720
How did you know?

541
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,300
It was the same with me.

542
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,380
I was never able to get that seat.

543
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,180
How about today?

544
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,700
Of course... I failed big time.

545
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:42,320
Let's go.

546
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,780
Are you angry?

547
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:45,900
Wait up!

548
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:51,890
<i>The stems of the hirugao* spread rapidly underground.</i>
<i>[*Japanese bindweed, a flower that looks like morning glories]</i>

549
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:56,240
<i>No matter how much you cut it, it keeps growing back.</i>

550
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,120
<i>That's why</i>

551
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:03,400
<i>the hirugao was treated as weeds and was disliked.</i>

552
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:09,970
<i>Even if I try to forget about him,</i>

553
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:13,190
<i>I can't give up on this adulterous love.</i>

554
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,910
<i>Someone, please tell me.</i>

555
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,400
Your lunch!

556
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:28,010
<i>Which direction are we heading to?</i>

557
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:55,270
♫ <i>You and I met as strangers</i> ♫

558
00:44:55,270 --> 00:45:00,760
♫ <i>Last night was last night, and tonight is tonight</i> ♫

559
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:06,140
♫ <i>Ticklish fingers, counting the moles</i> ♫

560
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:10,560
♫ <i>Counting from one again</i> ♫

561
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:16,000
♫ <i>That's right, we're igniting each other once more</i> ♫

562
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:24,030
♫ <i>when we first meet</i> ♫

563
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:32,650
♫ <i>It's okay if you forget about me</i> ♫

564
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:37,240
♫ <i>It's okay if you got astray</i> ♫

565
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:42,570
♫ <i>I will return time and time again</i> ♫

566
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:48,800
♫ <i>I will show you that I will return</i> ♫

567
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,760
♫ <i>Ba ba ba la ba</i> ♫

568
00:45:55,610 --> 00:46:00,020
<i>I never expected that I'd fall in love with a married man.</i>

569
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:05,270
<i>Life like this for us will not continue tomorrow,
or the days after that.</i>

570
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:07,410
I'll straighten things out with Takigawa.

571
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:09,570
This job isn't for our sake.

572
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:10,960
It's for Rikako and me.

573
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,140
You know what will happen, right?

574
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:17,180
What we're doing is definitely unforgivable.

575
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:19,600
So I intend to take full responsibility.

576
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:25,000
<i>I'm prepared for the worst. It's okay even if I die.</i>
