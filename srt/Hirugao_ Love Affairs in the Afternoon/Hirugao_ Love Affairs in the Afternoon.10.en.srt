00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,980
She hadn't come yesterday? Where did Sawa go?

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,460
She went on a trip with some friends.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,960
To where?

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,560
Well, where was it?

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,260
She ran away from home, hadn't she?

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,460
Of course not. Why would Sawa run away from home?

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,080
Because she's fallen in love with another man.

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,360
What's wrong with you, Mom? That's just your delusion.

9
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,640
Then why are you taking a break from your company?

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,060
Something terrible has happened,
that's why you're taking a break, right?

11
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,380
It's not like that. Oh, I remembered. They went to Hakone.

12
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,920
She texted me saying that
they're relaxing at a hotel by the sea.

13
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:57,420
Can't your lie be more convincing? There's only Lake Ashi and no sea in Hakone!

14
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:04,240
I heard about it. What's going to happen?

15
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,950
Is it true that Sawa is having an affair? Who is that man?

16
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,670
Hello?

17
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,830
<i>It's Kitano. Is your wife at home?</i>

18
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,160
She's not here right now.

19
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,800
I guessed as much. My husband
hadn't come home last night either.

20
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,320
Your husband, too?

21
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,230
<i>You realized it, didn't you? That they're having an affair.</i>

22
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,000
No, actually I...

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,400
I'm sorry to say this, but it's your fault.

24
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,480
<i>Because you were oblivious, your wife seduced my husband.
Am I not wrong?</i>

25
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,720
Look for them. Look for them and break them apart.

26
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,560

Hello? It's Rikako.

29
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,390
You're still on the plane, huh?

30
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:15,540
I managed to get paid in advance and bought a cellphone.

31
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,840
It's with the money that I worked for,
for the first time in 15 years.

32
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,630
That's why you're the first person I wanted to call.

33
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,610
Call me when you reach there safely.

34
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,770

00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,340

What is it?

38
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,200
It's just that... you've kind of changed.

39
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,340
I'm in a hurry.

40
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,320
Don't be so conceited.

41
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,320
I no longer have any affection toward you.
I'd just like us to be friends.

42
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,880
I don't have a habit of becoming friends
with men whom I dated in the past.

43
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,760
Anyway, what do you want?

44
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,260
Do you know

45
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,580
what happened to Sawa?

46
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,240
Sawa? Did something happen?

47
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,380
Her affair with Mr. Kitano was found out,
and she hasn't been showing up for work.

48
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,120
I haven't been able to get through to her cellphone,
so I'm worried.

49
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,880
- You weren't able to?
- I have a bad feeling.

50
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,060
I just hope nothing terrible has happened.

I've got to say there is nothing to do around here.

Oh, right. There's a forest nearby.

What?

80
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,800
You don't look like a picnic person.

81
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,140

00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,920
A walk?

But that's too normal. It's a forest, you know?

84
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:08,540
Then, an exploration? Or patrol? Or an adventure?

85
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,320
Perhaps wandering around sounds better.

86
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,590
Wandering around? That's a bit too much.
It sounds like we'll never come back alive.

Just leave.

149
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,400
All this happened because of you confronting my wife.

150
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,600
You're the one at fault for giving me a reason
to confront your wife.

151

You have a bad memory

159
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,730
It's a nicrophorus quadripunctatus.

160
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,170
Normal people won't remember that.

161
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,880
Try saying it.

162
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,200
Just try saying it.

163
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,910
Alright then, Mr. Kitano.

00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,790
But...

179
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,400
You see,

180
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,410
when we met for the first time,

181
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,100
I was a thief.

182
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,840
A thief?

183
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,190
At the grocery store,

184
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,200
I had stolen a lipstick.

185
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:47,830
Sorry. That's terrible, huh?

186
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,270
No.

187
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,410
Thanks for telling me.

188
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,910
I don't know why

189
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,200
I would do something like that.

190
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,640
My husband isn't a bad person.

191
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,530
And it wasn't like I was unsatisfied with my life.

192
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,910
Of course,

193
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:14,550
I never expected that I'd fall in love

194
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,410
with a married man.

195
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,840
It's done.

196
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,800
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's fine.

197
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,460
I wanted to do something for the boss that I love so much.

198
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,600
I'll come by tomorrow, too.

199
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,800
You're leaving?

200
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Yes, I need to go back to the office.

201
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,400
Oh, I see. Sorry that you had to come.

202
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,500
Thank you.

203
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:45,580
That's the first time you looked at my face and said "thank you".

204
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:53,290
I mean, why are you...

205
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,120
so nice to me?

206
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,200
That's because you're wonderful.

207
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,830
No, I'm not.

208
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,640
I know that myself.

209
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,030
Is that so?

210
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,220
You are good in your job.

211
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,690
But once you get away from work,

212
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,790
you showed your true self without any pretense.

213
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,080
That part of you is wonderful.

214
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,000
Boss?

215
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,090
I'm sorry.

216
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,000
Tell me again that I'm wonderful.

217
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,100
You're wonderful, Boss.

218
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,000
It hurts.

219
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,560
I wasn't unhappy with my wife either.

220
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,820
I married her because I thought she would be a good partner.

221
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,360
But...

222
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,580
as time passed, I started to think that
maybe she doesn't need me.

223
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,100
She became an assistant professor

224
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:29,940
while I couldn't stay at the research center,
so that may have made me uncomfortable.

225
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,980
I'm weak, right?

226
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,600
No.

227
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,760
Thanks for telling me.

228
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,020
Can I say something?

229
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,040
I wasn't able to say this so far,

230
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,020
since it felt wrong to say it.

231
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,960
I love you.

232
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,000
All of you.

233
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,420
I really love you.

234
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,220
I love you so much.

235
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,520
Me, too.

236
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,420
What's wrong?

237
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,120
Your ring.

238
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,100
I'll take it off.

239
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,800
No, don't.

240
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,220
You haven't broken up with him.

241
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,080
So you're not saying you love me until then?

242
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,220
Sorry.

243
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,660
I want to say that to you openly.

244
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,620
I feel the same but I already said it.

245
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,260
Sorry.

246
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,980
- When the time is right...
- Say it now.

247
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:27,420
If you say it now, you don't ever have to say it again.

248
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,180
Fine.

249
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,440
Wait. Are those words that important?

250
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,720
Of course they're important. I won't have it any other way.

251
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,380
You won't have it any other way? That's mean!

252
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:55,400
For a relationship like ours, if we don't express
our feelings to each other, it can be easily destroyed.

253
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,760
You're okay with me just walking away?

254
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,720
Go ahead, since this relationship can be easily destroyed.

255
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,440
I see. Then let's just break up.

256
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,430
I'm relieved. Goodbye.

257
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,540
I hate you!

258
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,420
Ah!

259
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,020
Ouch...

260
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,700
Let me see...

261
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,020
You're stubborn, aren't you?

262
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,200
You're stubborn, too.

263
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,200
Do you know the smaller longheaded locust?

264
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,700
That insect

265
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,700
doesn't only get on the back of another when mating,

266
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:14,020
but it always clings on its partner when going places or eating.

267
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,810
Jeez...

268
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:35,490
Say, why does the longheaded locust
always remain on its partner's back?

269
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:38,550
The reason isn't yet known,

270
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:41,990
but I think it's so that it can't be taken away by another locust.

271
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,240
It's nice that insects are honest, isn't it?

272
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,200
Sawa.

273
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,240
What?

274
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,540
Let's be together.

275
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,600
I don't know how to say it in a cool way,

276
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,470
but I want to be with you forever.

277
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,680
Thank you.

278
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,780
Please find him.

279
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:29,100
I'll bring the photographs and money. I'm counting on you.

280
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,040
Yes? You guys are...

281
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,560
- Please excuse us!
- Huh?

282
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,000
W-Wait a minute...

283
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,860
Mr. Kitano?

284
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,410
My husband has resigned from the school.

285
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:00,160
What? We didn't know that.

286
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,890
Why?

287
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:08,010
He said he's tired. After all,
you guys were apparently troublemakers.

288
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:11,980
- What?
- It's okay, another new teacher will replace him.

289
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:16,670
I don't need one! I won't forgive him.

290
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,500
He said he would stay with us till the end.

291
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,540
Kei, please stop!

292
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,180
Why is everyone abandoning me?!

293
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,440
What good will it do to act that way?

294
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,350
Shut up!

295
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,860
- Stop!
- What the hell?

296
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,040
Stop it, please!

297
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,020
I'll go home tomorrow.

298
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,960
What we're doing

299
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,720
is definitely unforgivable.

300
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,900
So I intend to take full responsibility.

301
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:07,040
I'll go home, too. I'll explain everything to my husband.

302
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,380
No.

303
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,900
Let me talk to him first.

304
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,160
Wait here for me.

305
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,760
But... what will my husband and my mother-in-law say to you?

306
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,380
That's why I want to meet them and talk.

307
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,720
You say such cool stuff.

308
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:32,180
I don't want to brag, but I'm not bad.

309
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,540
You're too much!

310
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,300
<i>I learned that</i>

311
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,840
<i>being happy would be this scary.</i>

312
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,480
<i>The selfish part of me</i>

313
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:47,100
<i>wished that the world would end just as it is at this moment.</i>

314
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,190
See you.

315
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:58,620
I've put in some rice balls.

316
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,440
I'm off.

317
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,450
Wait a minute!

318
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:15,310
It might rain, so...

319
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,480
Well then,

320
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,500
lock the doors, okay?

321
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,310
Okay.

322
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,640
What's up with that face?

323
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,740
Nothing...

324
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,390
I'll come back by this weekend.

325
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,570
I promise.

326
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,870
Is this a hostage?

327
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,940
I don't need them all the time.

328
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,720
- Ouch!
- Are you okay?

329
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,030
I'm fine.

330
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:02,030
- I was kidding.
- Jeez!

331
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,410
Okay,

332
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,560
I'm really

333
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,940
heading out.

334
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,840
Sawa.

335
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,070
Just wait for me.

336
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,220
Okay!

337
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:44,400
<i>Until he comes back,</i>

338
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,470
<i>I have to wait alone.</i>

339
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,950
<i>It's only for  three days.</i>

340
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:56,900
<i>But these three days are longer than I can imagine.</i>

341
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,930
Sawa!

342
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,600
Rikako...

343
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,260
I came to see you. Your friend is concerned about you, too.

344
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,230
Enough of all this already.

345
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,360
Sorry.

346
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,230
Where is Mr. Kitano?

347
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,300
What is this about, Shunsuke?

348
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,700
Well, Mom... About this...

349
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,300
Stop making excuses!

350
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:02,700
I feel ashamed seeing you do something pathetic
at a time like this!

351
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:07,330
You, too, taking advantage of this while his wife is away.

352
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:09,800
- This has nothing to do with her.
- Yes, it does!

353
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,800
Why are you so weak?!

354
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,140
Leave me alone!

355
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,290
I don't care anymore.

356
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,740
I feel stupid to have been so serious about everything.
To hell with work, too.

357
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,380
And I don't care about having sex with a woman I don't love.

358
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,020
How mean of you.

359
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,400
What?

360
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,700
I'm not in the wrong. You're the one who started this.

361
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,700
Sawa is the one at fault.
If you have something to say, say it to her.

362
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,990
You're the worst, bastard.

363
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,920
You couldn't do it anyway!

364
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,130
I feel much better.

365
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,940
It's better for your health

366
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,820
to say and do whatever you want.

367
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,100
Shunsuke.

368
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,390
You still don't understand?

369
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:08,380
Your wife betrayed you because you're like that.

370
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,430
Shut up, old hag.

371
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm just a useless husband whose wife has left him.

372
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It can't be helped that your son has been made a cuckold.

373
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,110
We're mother and son, after all.

374
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,500
Hello?

375
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,700
I see. Mr. Kitano went to talk to your husband?

376
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,900
I know it's not easy.

377
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,620
I guess so.

378
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:51,770
Divorce isn't easy. I haven't finalized mine yet.

379
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:55,800
What if he doesn't come back?

380
00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:02,140
If he isn't able to settle things and gets kicked out by them,

381
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,940
he won't be able to come back.

382
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,450
That may be so.

383
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:13,710
To be honest, the chances of that happening is greater,
and I'm prepared for it.

384
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:21,300
Tthe fact that he even went there for me...

385
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,660
is good enough.

386
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,380
I felt that it's okay even if I die.

387
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:34,210
Since you've come this far, then believe in Mr. Kitano.

388
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:39,820
Until you really know it's hopeless,
shouldn't you trust him and wait for him?

389
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:43,640
Indeed, my ex-girlfriend said something wise.

390
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,400
Hey!

391
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,210
I'm also telling that to myself.

392
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,520
To trust him and wait for him.

393
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:04,200
Kato is overseas right now.

394
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,400
Together with his ex-wife.

395
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,460
What?!

396
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,430
He will come back for sure.

397
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:23,530
It's no big deal for "hirugao" wives like us
to encourage each other.

398
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:32,380
I believe in him.

399
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:36,910
I'll trust him and wait for him.

400
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,420
Me, too.

401
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:46,500
For that, I'll straighten things out with Takigawa.

402
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,400
I'll go see the kids, too.

403
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,230
I am...

404
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,420
very sorry for everything.

405
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,490
Do you think apologizing would help?

406
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:11,900
Sawa said she wanted to apologize to you in person.

407
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,640
But...

408
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,110
I thought I should meet you first to apologize.

409
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,840
- I'm not asking you about that!
- Keep quiet, Mom.

410
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,490
Where is Sawa?

411
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,200
I don't understand what you're talking about.

412
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,860
Will you divorce Sawa?

413
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,870
I understand that what I am saying is absurd.

414
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,470
Please...

415
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:42,710
Let me be with Sawa.

416
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:45,770
How dare you have the cheek to say this to us!

417
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:49,140
You're the one who destroyed my son's family!

418
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:54,100
I haven't had any grandchildren yet,

419
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:58,580
but they were a loving couple. Even so...

420
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:03,560
It's really mortifying to imagine how my son is feeling.

421
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,350
I thought I took good care of her

422
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:10,680
more than other mothers-in-law do.

423
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,240
I never thought such a terrible thing would happen!

424
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,140
Everything...

425
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,620
It's my fault that all this happened

426
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:24,520
In that case, I'll demand a huge compensation from you,

427
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,910
even if I have to fight in the courts to get it!

428
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:30,390
I'll do anything

429
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:33,300
no matter how long it takes for your understanding.

430
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,450
Don't you think you've got the order wrong?

431
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,920
This kind of conversation

432
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,030
is something that the wife and the husband should discuss first.

433
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:49,700
It's ridiculous that the lover would do this first.

434
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:56,470
There's a limit to being shameless.

435
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,260
I'm very sorry.

436
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,870
I will go talk to my wife as well.

437
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:03,620
Will your wife accept it?

438
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,830
Same goes for me,

439
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:10,470
I am not planning to divorce Sawa at all.

440
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,520
Even if she sends the divorce papers,

441
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,320
I will just rip them up.

442
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,080
I'm aware that I'm asking for the impossible, but...

443
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,010
Stop making a fool out of me!

444
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:32,060
Where is Sawa?

445
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,800
Please...

446
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,770
I need Sawa.

447
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:38,730
- Do you know what you're saying?!
- You bastard!

448
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:39,450
Please!

449
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,710
Get out!

450
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:45,160
- I'm sorry!
- Get out!

451
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,190
I beg of you! Please!

452
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,510
- Get out!
- I'm sorry!

453
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,400
GET OUT!

454
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:11,290
No, the screw!

455
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,680
Eh? Where did it go?

456
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,240
Mana!

457
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,900
What happened?

458
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,780
Hina is...

459
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,060
It'll be alright. Let's let her rest a little.

460
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,420
I'm sorry.

461
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,840
For just leaving on my own.

462
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,050
It bothers me more that you came back without saying anything.

463
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,770
You're right.

464
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,520
But...

465
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,270
Until Hina gets well, I will let you stay.

466
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,030
Mom...

467
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,820
Hina.

468
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,340
Are you uncomfortable?

469
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,020
You will get well soon.

470
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,400
You came back.

471
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,450
Mana!

472
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:52,000
Can I talk to you?

473
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:55,340
I...

474
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:58,550
plan to officially get divorced from your father.

475
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,650
I came to ask you

476
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:04,050
what you plan to do.

477
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:06,550
I don't have any plans.

478
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:08,410
I don't care anymore.

479
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:11,610
I'm back!!

480
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:13,790
How's Hina?

481
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:16,680
Oh, welcome home.

482
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,700
I...

483
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,990
came so I could talk to you.

484
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:31,810
I'm so relieved. No one is better than
having Mom around when they're sick.

485
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:33,620
I'm glad

486
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,930
that you came back.

487
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:39,250
- I won't talk about the past.
- Wait!

488
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,120
I...

489
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,880
I won't change my mind about the divorce.

490
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,570
He won't return to you ever again.

491
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,540
Are you talking about his ex-wife?

492
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,600
There's also that,

493
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,750
but his success is far greater than I would have expected.

494
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:01,910
When he steps out into the world,
a festival with real celebrities awaits him.

495
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:06,220
He wouldn't want to be tied to a woman
going through a divorce like you.

496
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:29,740
It's a good gallery. I thank you for that.

497
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:38,560
What are you doing?

498
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,250
I thought you have an important call.

499
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,690
I didn't ask you to do that.

500
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:52,560
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

501
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,480
<i>Does that mean you're not coming back anymore?</i>

502
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,060
<i>If so, then let me know.</i>

503
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,070
Did she call previously?

504
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:12,250
It wouldn't be of benefit to our business, right?

505
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:16,070
Don't misunderstand this...

506
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,690
This job

507
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,990
isn't for our sake.

508
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,570
Then who is it for?

509
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,710
It's for Rikako and me.

510
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:44,670
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

511
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,870
Hello?

512
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,650
I'm sorry for not calling sooner.

513
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:52,190
I'll come back for sure.

514
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,950
Wait for me.

515
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,390
You know

516
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,400
what will happen, right?

517
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:18,310
<i>I'll come back for sure.</i>

518
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:20,010
<i>Wait for me.</i>

519
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:05,220
<i>"I want to be with someone."</i>

520
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:08,650
- <i> - "I want to love someone." </i>
- Mana?

521
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:10,430
<i>That...</i>

522
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:13,430
<i>may just be everyone's desire.</i>

523
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,590
<i>But...</i>

524
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:20,610
<i>people sometimes sacrifice their lives</i>

525
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:24,110
<i>for the sake of desire.</i>

526
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:33,590
What happened to your wrist?

527
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,410
This?

528
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:38,470
My wrist? I kind of sprained it.

529
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:43,690
Come on! I wasn't suicidal.

530
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:46,090
We're gonna live together, after all.

531
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:49,390
Noriko...

532
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,590
I'm really sorry.

533
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,270
I can no longer be with you.

534
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:03,050
It's all my fault.

535
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,990
- No matter how long it takes...
- Where are your glasses?

536
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:19,750
So, what's so good about her?

537
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:24,490
It's not like Sawa is good-looking.

538
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:27,500
She doesn't have any special talent either.

539
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:30,270
Tell me so I can understand.

540
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:48,250
I don't know what it is that I like about her.

541
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:52,800
So then, why?

542
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,890
By chance, is she some kind of demon?

543
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:58,990
I wonder if she's flirting with you in a way that women don't understand.

544
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:00,830
I'm sorry, Noriko.

545
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:04,630
That I make you say such terrible things.

546
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:11,050
When I'm with her,

547
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,870
I get a feeling of confidence.

548
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:20,450
She acts as if she needs me,

549
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:23,890
and she eagerly listens

550
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:26,170
to what I say.

551
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:29,990
Somehow...

552
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:32,890
deep inside, she makes me feel

553
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,810
that I want to do my best.

554
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:39,650
I feel like there's no limit to my power.

555
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:43,210
To put it simply,

556
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:47,860
you find it complex loving an older researcher,

557
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:50,790
but a part-time working woman

558
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:54,110
makes you feel superior and self-confident.

559
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,490
You're so small-minded.

560
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:10,370
I'm very sorry.

561
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:14,870
It's troublesome, isn't it?

562
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:18,430
No matter how small-minded a man you are,

563
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:22,450
a father is a father.

564
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:27,000
Father?

565
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,130
I...

566
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:32,270
am pregnant.

567
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:36,610
Three months, they said.

568
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:41,630
You may have some feelings of desire,

569
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:43,970
but you must put them aside,

570
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:46,030
and become a father.

571
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:51,030
Because it's not the baby's fault.

572
