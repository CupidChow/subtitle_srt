10

Almost 5PM.

13

My children will be coming home,
so I have to go meet them at 5PM.

14
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,060

18
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,670

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,100
But I'm surprised you are pretty normal.

20
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,230

I may look like I have money to burn but...

26
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,540
my husband keeps all the money.

Isn't it better if we keep our affair as commodity-based?

31

What, you're buying me out now? With that measly amount of money?

32
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,910
Commodity-based relationship?

33

00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,430
Yeah, we had sex.

36
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,620
It was a one night stand.

37
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,970
Just like what you wanted.

38
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,990
I just gave that to you. Don't return it to me.

39
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:19,040

Ma'am.

43

Do you know this bug?

44
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,780
A praying mantis?

45
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,870
It's called a tenodera aridifolia.

46
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,700
One characteristic is that the base of their sickle-shaped forelegs is yellow.

47
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,490
It's cute now that I look at it.

48
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,930
It looks like glasses.

49
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,560
But sometimes, the female will eat the male when they mate.

50
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,030
We're suddenly talking about mating now?

51
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,670
The female sees anything that moves as its prey.

52
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,480
So the male hides itself and observes the female's movements,

53
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,460
and jumps onto the female from behind
when he sees the chance.

54
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,150
But if the male hesitates for too long, or is not careful,

55
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,950
the female will twist the male's neck and bite its head off.

56
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,410
It's kind of scary.

57
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,850
It's an intense reproductive behavior.

58
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,020
Even though it has lost its head,

59
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,080
the male completes the mating process with only its body,
and dies.

60
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,260
- The female then takes the dead male...
- Excuse me.

61
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,770
That's enough.

62
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:02,710
This is all I can talk about.

63
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,740

64
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:15,210

65
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,610
Mr. Kitano! Look, a dragonfly!

66
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,200
It's an orthetrum albistylum speciosum.

67
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,270
Really?

68
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,630
When you call me "Mr. Kitano",
it feels like we're having insect-collecting lessons.

76
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,480
Please don't ask about my husband.

77
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,640
I'm sorry.

78
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,230
But, to be honest, I'm also curious about your wife.

79
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,110
What's her name? What kind of person is she?

80
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,580
Is she pretty? Or adorable?

81
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:25,120
I won't ask you anymore about your husband.

82
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,900
Never again.

83
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,830
Me, too.

84

85

86
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,680
Will you really take me there?

87
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,080
There's only speech day that day,
so I'll be free early in the afternoon.

00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,760
So what if I am?

176
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,500
You should stop. You might be found out!

177
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,350
What will you do if you meet someone shady?

178
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:17,250
I won't make you worry, Sawa.

179
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,770
Rikako, you have someone you like, don't you?

180
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:24,010
Can't you see? I was dumped.

181
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,230
He had sex and ran.

182
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:31,610
Had sex and ran...What happened? This isn't like you.

183
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:37,480
Right. It's really not like me.

184
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,950
How did I end up like this?

185
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,590
Can I ask who it was?

186
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,600
Some worthless guy.

187
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,260
He has no money, he's twisted, stingy and stubborn.

188
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,980
Why do you like that kind of person?

189
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,100
Why? Maybe because he's honest?

190
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,500
Honest?

191
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,810
Men are always lying.

192
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:06,520
Even though they don't really think so,
they always say we're cute or pretty.

193
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,320
Even though they don't want to divorce,
they ask if we want to separate.

194
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,800
Even though they have plans with a different
woman tomorrow,

195
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,820
they say they only care about you.

196
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,570
Everything is all improvised.

197
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:24,690
But he was really straightforward.

198
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:29,630
He told me that I'm a cheap woman.

199
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,210
It's my first time meeting a guy like him.

200
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:36,100
But that doesn't mean you should desperately look for
the next one on the internet.

201
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,200
You can meet someone else.

202
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,670
Like how you met Kitano?

203
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,020
What?

204
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,350
It's going well, isn't it?

205
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,160
You've become prettier.

206
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,200
It's not like that.

207
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,820
Then what is it?

208
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:04,380
Well... we are...  well... we aren't planning on having
a deep relationship.

209
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,770
" We"? Are you sticking to just pure love?

210
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,220
Don't make me laugh.

211
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,760
Whether you meet on the internet or in real life,
cheating is cheating.

212
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,400
Neither is better than the other.

213
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,830
I'm not saying it's better.

214
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:25,710
Meeting just anyone and naturally falling in love with someone
are different.

215
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,900
Do you think you fell in love naturally?

216
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,300
You would have been fine with anyone.

217
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,150
You may not realize it,

218
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:39,230
but you wanted someone, no matter who it is.

219
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,640
It was just good timing.

220
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,220
And that's when Mr. Kitano happened to appear.

221
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,790
No matter how you sugarcoat it,
the mechanism behind falling in love is the same.

222
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,080
It's not the same.

223
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:58,930
If I say more... A man's love is all about sex.

224
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:02,500
He doesn't want to be seen as a man
who only has one-night stands,

225
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,670
so he simply maintains the relationship.

226
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:07,890
The same goes for Mr. Kitano who looks honest.

227
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:12,660
And a woman's love is all about attachment.

228
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,340
Just because we don't want to give him to another woman,
we hang on to him.

229
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,330
Though you proclaim pure love, you're the same, too.

230
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,650
Stop it!

231
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,740
You're an adult woman in your thirties.

232
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,830
You should know what a man and woman wants.

233
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,340
Stop being childish and deceiving yourself.

234
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:32,410
I'm just telling you to be mentally prepared
if you plan on seeing each other.

235
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,770
You might think that way,

236
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,840
but don't make decisions about others on your own.

237
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,460
I have fallen in love with someone with my heart.

238
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,850
There's no sex involved.

239
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:48,920
I just want to be with him.

240
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,980
Laugh if you want.

241
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,010
I won't laugh.

242
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:01,530
I wouldn't be looking for a man if my goal was just for the body.

243
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,410
Sawa, you've gotten stronger.

244
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:12,550
Love makes a woman beautiful,

245
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:16,570
but cheating makes a woman strong.

246
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,210
Well, I'm feeling much more energetic.

247
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:26,220
Anyway, I've told you what I wanted to say.

248
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,830
You should stop doing dangerous things.

249
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,190
- Hello.
- Hello.

250
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,910
<i>Sure, I may be childish...</i>

251
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,180
<i>In fact, I just want to be childish.</i>

252
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:54,230
<i>I know that I have to be mentally prepared</i>

253
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,230
<i>to meet that person.</i>

254
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,540
You're late.

255
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,810
You said you were at your friend's house. Was it...

256
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,180
Takigawa?

257
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,100
Yes.

258
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,420
Don't you think she's a little arrogant?

259
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,710
Well.. I guess she is.

260
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:24,110
Really? You thought so, too?

261
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:28,230
Sawa, you are much prettier than her.

262
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,580
What's with the sudden praises?

263
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,800
It's not sudden at all.

264
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,400
You may not think so, but I'm always on your side.

265
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:44,600
So, Sawa... You can ask me anything.

266
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,080
Thank you very much.

267
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,120
But I don't really have anything right now.

268
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,980
That's not true.

269
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,550
You're worried.

270
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,150
Worried?

271
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,440
Not really.

272
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,170
Don't be hard of yourself. I know all about it.

273
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:13,370
That you both aren't having sex.

274
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:16,000
You don't need to worry about it.

275
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,750
I've looked into it,

276
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,340
and it doesn't mean that you aren't attractive.

277
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,850
You guys are just stuck in a rut. It happens to married couples.

278
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:29,390
So just be wise and give him some stimulation.

279
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:34,210
- This one said it's a good idea to go to the hotel...
- Please stop.

280
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:37,240
I know it's embarrassing,

281
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,290
but it's important.

282
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:48,320
It's for the sake of making a baby and building a happy family.
Got it?

283
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,220
Do you understand what is stimulation is?

284
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,710
I don't.

285
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,760
You just need to do something different from the norm.

286
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,650
Like wearing new pajamas,

287
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,220
or taking a bath together.

288
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,620
Mom, did you take baths together with Dad?

289
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:11,060
I... Why are you asking me that?

290
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,540
Mom, were you and Dad in love with each other till he died?

291
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:18,800
Wait a minute. It's not about married couples loving each other...

292
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,660
Then what exactly is a married couple?

293
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:30,580
What's wrong all of a sudden? Jeez... you're making me sweat.

294
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,760
Gosh...

295
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,680
It's really hot today.

296
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:41,300
It's really hot today. My, my...

297
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,090
You didn't eat the lunch your wife made with love?

298
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,820
It was strangely too sumptuous.

299
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,970
Your wife must love you a lot.

300
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:51,770
I'm so jealous.

301
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,290
I guess so.

302
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,580
So... what happened the other day...

303
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:08,640
<i>[Timing and Subtitles brought to you by Hirugao Team@viki]</i>

304
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,890
Let's not do that again.

305
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,510
- What?!
- What?

306
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:18,880
I thought you'd reciprocate my feelings.

307
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,150
Thanks for the hard work today.

308
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,150
Oh, you, too.

309
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,430
Really?

310
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,410
I'm sorry.

311
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,480
Will you go to the bar with me?

312
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:49,320
No. Because I am your boss.

313
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,040
And you are... my subordinate.

314
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,980
We'll just be drinking.

315
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,380
I won't do anything. I swear.

316
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,590
Thanks for the meal.

317
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:09,160
<i>I was relieved that my husband isn't home yet.</i>

318
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,380
<i>I had dinner alone, as a way to repent for my sin.</i>

319
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,060
Wow!

320
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,790
Nice bar, isn't it?

321
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:19,300
This cocktail bar was featured in the magazines.

322
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,460
You're really knowledgeable about such nice restaurants.

323
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,360
Thank you very much.

324
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,720
There's an empty table. What the...?

325
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:37,470
Hello. What a coincidence. If you'll excuse us...

326
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:40,760
Good evening. Thank you for taking care of our chief.

327
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,010
Well, well, Sasamoto.
Looks like there's something going  on with you, too.

328
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:48,260
Oh, no, I won't do such things. Are you working?

329
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:53,590
This is good timing. Could you give me your thoughts on this?

is important. It's related to the body, after all"]</i>

330
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:56,600
This is my neighbor, Takigawa.

331
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,610
He's the editor-in-chief of BONITO magazine.

332
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,160
Feel free to ask us anything.

333
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:08,300
I see. Thanks. Take a look at this picture.

334
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,800
Oh, it's La Perla.

335
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,200
This is really expensive.

336
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,650
It's a popular underwear for intimidate dates.

337
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:23,230
I know, right? There's nothing we can do
about wives cheating in broad daylight.

338
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:27,610
They buy such expensive underwear
using the money their husbands made.

339
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,210
They should be executed.

340
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,450
What?

341
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:39,190

00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,670
Are you going to take a bath?

00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:00,980
Welcome home.

347
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,860
I'm home.

348
