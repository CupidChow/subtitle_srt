1
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,700
<i>Unlike other insects, it is monogamous.</i>

2
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,250
It's the same as a human marriage.

3
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,050
Do you want to get divorced?

4
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,040
Divorce?

5
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,360
Lately you're always facing the other way.

6
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,820
Oh, I see! You're talking about the hamsters.

7
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,060
Don't say that. It sounds heartless. Right?

8
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,190
Who burned down that house?

9
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,480
Are you talking about that fire?

10
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,380
I heard that somebody in that family did it.

11
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,120
Because the inside of the house was all locked up.

12
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,300
Why would someone want to burn down their own house?

13
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,880
Beats me.

14
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,440
Maybe she has a secret that nobody will understand.

15
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,820
What?

16
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,040
I'm wondering if you also have some secrets?

17
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,980
What are you talking about?

18
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,760
Just kidding.

19
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,000
Hamusuke, Hamumi, Daddy will be back soon.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,190
It's really bright out today.

21
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,100
Can you give me the sunscreen lotion?

22
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,000
Sure.

23
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,970
Here you go.

24
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:59,630
Not this one, I want the one with SPF 50.

25
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,390
Forget it. It's fine.

26
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:08,610
- Be careful on your way.
- See you.

27
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,400
Good morning, Ms. Sawa.

28
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,100
Mom. what is it?

29
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,070
- Keisuke has...
- It's you I want to speak to.

30
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,780
What?

31
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,820
This is your mother.

32
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,140
It doesn't look like her at all.

33
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,980
Mom, why aren't you angry about that?

34
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,830
Enough already. Hurry up!

35
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,280
Do you have the print out, Mana?

36
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,940
Do you really think he's talented?

37
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,600
Of course he is, that's why I asked him to work for me.

38
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,180
Don't say anything about your father's work. You'll be late.

39
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,920
- Hurry up.
- Don't hire that guy again, please.

40
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,540
The drawing looks too scary.

41
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,260
Can you ask him to redraw it?

42
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,400
Isn't it annoying? Being drawn like that.

43
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,360
Let it go already.

44
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,840
He just wants to pick a fight with me.

45
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,680
A fight?

46
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,660
Have a nice day.

47
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,620
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

48
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,200
Hey, Rikako! Rikako!

49
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,160
Hey!

50
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,400
Rikako! Come on!

51
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,000
Rikako!

52
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,150
Didn't you use to play J-League soccer?

53
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,190
And you quit while you were still a benchwarmer.

54
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:49,030
I can't give up on you.

55
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,390
I told you we are done.

56
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:03,670
Rikako, why are you doing this to me?

57
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:11,010
If I love you any more than this,
I'll have to leave my husband.

58
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,090
Then leave him. Let's live together.

59
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,240
Are you okay with it?

60
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,050
Absolutely!

61
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,930
I want to take my daughters with me.

62
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,800
Are you happy to help me raise them?

63
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,290
Huh? Yeah...

64
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:33,410
I'm the one who's unfaithful, so if I divorce my husband,
I can't get child support.

65
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,300
We have to find a place to live.

66
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,380
I want at least a two-bedroom apartment.

67
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,860
I can't live with you in the house where you live now.

68
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:52,000
I have elderly parents,
and you'll need you take care of them, too.

69
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,780
Do you understand?

70
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,380
I want you to know what it means to live with me.

71
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,920
Are you testing me?

72
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,980
Sorry, I was mean to you.

73
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,940
Good bye.

74
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,700
Are you just playing games with me?

75
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,800
That's right. A pastime of an unsatisfied wife.

76
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,440
Just for your younger body.

77
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,940
I'm tired of it already.

78
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,960
They dote on you so much,
yet they give you such plain names.

79
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,300
What do you want to talk about?

80
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,400
The name of Shunsuke...

81
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,360
Mom, it's almost time for me to go to my part-time job.

82
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,960
Well, it's not something very important.

83
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:56,200
Who was that guy?

84
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,140
Who?

85
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:03,460
You were talking to a man, just the two of you.

86
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,120
There are a lot of housewives having affairs recently.

87
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,420
It's not that I'm doubting you,

88
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,460
but I thought it wouldn't hurt to ask.

89
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,160
You know, deep inside,

90
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,380
I was wondering if you're also having an affair.

91
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,560
It's human nature, right?

92
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,380
I did say "affair" on purpose.

93
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,540
<i>My heart is beating so fast,</i>

94
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,200
<i>and I'm sweating too.</i>

95
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:39,240
<i>If my sly mother-in-law found out I'm having an affair,
she'll verbally abuse me even more.</i>

96
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,200
<i>And that feminine husband of mine,</i>

97
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,580
<i>may really beat me up like a real man.</i>

98
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:51,250
<i>Just like in high school.</i>

99
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:56,000
<i>We only spoke a little to each other.</i>

100
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,020
<i>We didn't do anything wrong.</i>

101
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:05,080
<i>In the first place, I didn't even have the confidence or courage.</i>

102
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,980
What are you doing?!  Break it up!

103
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,540
Go back to your classrooms!

104
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,410
But inside of my head,

105
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,720
I couldn't forget him ever since that day.

106
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,880
Inside my fantasies,

107
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,720
I was hugging him and kissing him,

108
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,720
teasing him, being affectionate with him, and playing with him.

109
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:35,700
I can't believe how uninhibited I was. I felt so carefree.

110
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:42,430
<i>[Hirugao: Love Affairs in the Afternoon]</i>

111
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,840
So your mother-in-law had a misunderstanding?

112
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,800
She saw me talking to a friend.

113
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,180
And she thought that man
is the one you're having an affair with?

114
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,020
Seriously, she's ridiculous.

115
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,740
How can I have an affair?

116
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,160
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

117
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,960
Hello.

118
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,160
You don't have to look so bothered.

119
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,480
But I am.

120
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,720
I'm your friend.

121
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,430
That'll be 3.27 million yen.

122
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,550
You're off at 3PM, right? I'll wait for you.

123
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,390
We have nothing to talk about.

124
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,170
3PM is a wonderful timing, no?

125
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,550
It's not afternoon, evening or night either.

126
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,230
A carefree time where you need not be anywhere else.

127
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,850
It's my favorite time of the day.

128
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,410
Is that right?

129
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:47,190
For me, it's a tedious time for laundry and dinner prep.

130
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,390
You can go back before 5PM to prepare dinner.

131
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,350
Are you really that slow?

132
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,810
Thank you so much.

133
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,200
I'll wait for you, Sawa.

134
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,530
Good job.

135
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,540
See you.

136
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,560
That's it.

137
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,060
Welcome!

138
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,280
May I take your order?

139
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,360
No, it's fine.

140
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,540
Ah!

141
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,780
Sorry, I was late.

142
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,960
Why are you here?

143
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:49,400
I got a call from Ms. Takigawa.
She said that you wanted to talk about the case.

144
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,540
Eh?

145
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,780
Your paintings are beautiful.

146
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,200
I'm not so interested in them, though.

147
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,680
In fact,

148
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,720
I want to see the crude ones you painted.

149
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,770
I was thrilled...

150
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,380
by that drawing you did of me the other day.

151
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,400
It felt like you saw through the real me.

152
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:19,020
I just drew what I saw.

153
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,340
So you say.

154
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,700
Did you come to complain to me?

155
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,420
Nope.

156
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,040
Can you do me a favor?

157
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:36,560
Could you draw a portrait of me one more time?

158
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,640
Of course I'll pay you.

159
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,960
Because you're a professional.

160
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,980
I came here without telling my husband.

161
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:58,050
I'm turning 40 soon.

162
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,200
Since I was young,

163
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,940
I was told that I'm pretty,

164
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,310
and I often got my way with my looks.

165
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:15,000
My husband always tells me I only have the looks.

166
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,120
The life of a woman whom men perceive as beautiful

167
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,780
is totally different from one who isn't perceived as such.

168
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,720
But beauty doesn't last forever.

169
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,400
I want a picture of myself while I'm still beautiful.

170
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,980
I want you to depict me as I truly am.

171
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,200
I refuse.

172
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,760
I don't feel you are pretty.

173
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,700
A professional can't draw without feeling a connection to the subject.

174
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,640
Being cold just has the opposite effect.

- I think Ms. Takigawa did it on purpose.
- What?

177
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,920
There are people who only view human relationships

179
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,480
That's true.

180

But I don't think it'll happen to us.

181
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,020
Oh, I'm not talking about you.

182
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,040
Maybe you haven't noticed yet,

183
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,960
but I'm married.

184
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,780
I'm 31 years old, and have been married for five years.

185
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,120
My husband is seven years older than I am,
and we have no children.

186
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,760
No house, and I have a part-time job.

187
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,160
What a surprise.

188
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,840
I thought you were single.

189
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,580
Ah, you are good at flattery.

190
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,260
No, I'm not.

191
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,000
You don't look like a housewife.

192
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,460
Or rather, it doesn't look like you can cook
and do the housework.

193
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,100
May I ask you something?

194
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,980
Yes.

195
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,140
I have been thinking about this for some time.

196
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:32,600
You're surprisingly a straightforward person.
Don't you get disliked by people?

197
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,400
Right, they don't like me.

198
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,620
You admitted.

199
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,720
Students and coworkers don't like me much.

200
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,030
I don't have any problems with that, though.

201
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,730
That's not good.

202
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:52,020
You're cuter if you say,
"I'm worried that my students don't like me".

203
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,640
Especially with girls.
Don't you find it hard to get along with them?

204
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,460
Yes.

205
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,960
I'm surprised that I could even get married.

206
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:04,580
Huh? You're married?

207
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,100
Is that weird?

208
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,960
No, it's not weird,

209
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,360
it's just that you don't look like you can support your family.

210
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,580
I'm 33 years old, and married for two years.
My wife is a year older than me.

211
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,190
- Do you have children?
- No.

212
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:22,570
- House?
- I'm paying the loan.

213
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,130
Let me tell you something.

214
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,600
I found cicadas at my balcony this morning.

215
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,690
This early!

216
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,800
Living creatures are so interesting.

217
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,700
Ever since you told me that even bugs have family,
I haven't been able to stop thinking about it.

218
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,800
I'm surprised that you're a very kind person.

219
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,230
You don't have to say, "I'm surprised".

220
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,130
Is that right? Sorry.

221
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,720
Oh, it's 5PM, I have to go.

222
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,980
- Eh?
- I need to prepare dinner before my husband comes home.

223
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,220
And I have to do ironing.

224
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,070
Because I'm a housewife.

225
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,960
- Good bye
- Hey!

226
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,160
Would you like to exchange contact numbers?

227
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,000
Sure.

228
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,280
Let's see...

229
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,280
What's going on?

230
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,460
Here you go.

231
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,180
Another man again...

232
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,990
I ordered iced coffee.

233
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:28,010
<i>[Kitano]</i>
<i>[Sasamoto]</i>

234
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,720
<i>[Noriko]</i>

235
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,440
Excuse me.

236
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,580
- Hello?
- Yuichiro, are you still at school?

237
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,100
No.

238
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,450
I have something on today.

239
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:45,160
Shall we eat out tonight?

240
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,540
I want to tell you something.

241
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,490
I got promoted to associate professor.

242
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,560
They've recognized your efforts. Congrats!

243
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,780
I don't want to be a lecturer my whole life,
so I'm really glad.

244
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,920
You don't like it?

245
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,380
That your wife has become associate professor.

246
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,990
Don't be silly.

247
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,800
I quit doing research of my own accord.

248
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:23,600
But I'm impressed that you succeeded in being one.
After everything that you've been through.

249
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,020
Maybe because I'm a woman.

250
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,910
No.

251
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,740
Who is he?

252
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,800
- He's a mere acquaintance.
- Mere?

253
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,620
What did you do?

254
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,300
I didn't do anything.

255
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,720
Really, there is nothing going on.

256
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,780
He's a neighborhood acquaintance.

257
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:50,980
Why would you separately go meet a man
who's just a neighborhood acquaintance?

258
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,560
I'm quite dumb, so I don't understand.

259
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,980
What?

260
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,250
The man you were talking with, and the man you had coffee with, are two different people?

261
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,950
- Yeah.
- What's going on?

262
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:05,500
See? I'm not dumb, am I?

263
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,070
Or maybe you're dumb too, because you have my blood.

264
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:13,210
Enough talk about whether you're dumb.
You're making me confused.

265
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,750
Just like what I'm telling you now.

266
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,230
The man who had tea with Sawa today,

267
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:33,270
And the man who was talking with Sawa the other day,
are my friends.

268
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,240
Please don't misunderstand her.

269
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,630
Sorry, you came here just for this.

270
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,110
Mom, you understand now, right?

271
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:45,050
I didn't misunderstand her at all in the first place.

272
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,490
Indeed.

273
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:51,640
Sawa is not the kind of person
who'll meet a man behind your backs.

274
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,410
If she really is, I wouldn't have become friends with her.

275
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:59,890
I just moved here last month.

276
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:04,120
Sawa was very kind to me, and I'm so thankful.

277
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,790
Please excuse me.

278
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:12,760
If you don't mind, would you like to have some?

279
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,060
Wow, looks so delicious!

280
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,570
Shall we have it together? You too, Mom.

281
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,450
I've got to go home and eat.

282
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,780
Why? You're alone anyway.

283
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,880
I will eat with your late father. I've been with him for 38 years, you know?

284
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,250
- I've been giving him offerings everyday.
- Mom.

285
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,160
I guess we're even now?

286
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,940
I'm not going to say thanks.

287
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,760
Because of you, I got misunderstood.

288
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,720
How was it with Mr. Kitano?

289
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,230
Enough already.

290
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,420
You should be thankful for this friendship.

291
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,660
You and I are not friends.

292
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,280
I don't fall in love with just anyone.

293
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,120
I don't really know why,

294
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,870
but I could tell you how I really feel.

295
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,090
The same goes for you, right?

296
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,850
The elevator is here.

297
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,670
Bye.

298
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:18,330
The erotic painting you did the other day had rave reviews.

299
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,810
If I keep drawing those, they'll get bored.

300
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,380
They may get bored, but it would have an impact.

301
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,200
What can I say about this?

302
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,100
Paintings like these will be thrown away in a month.

303
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,750
Okay, I got it.

304
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,580
Hang on.

305
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,820
May I ask you a question?

306
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,760
What is it?

307
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:50,430
Kato, why do you always come back to me with a painting
that's different from what I ordered?

308
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,060
Forget it.

309
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,980
Shall we go for a drink?

310
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:01,610
I want to have a good chat with you for once.

311
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,760
My treat.

312
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,410
Sorry, I can't go.

313
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:10,080
Why don't you bring your wife out instead of me?

314
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,120
She feels lonely and angry.

315
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,450
What are you talking about?

316
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,350
What do you know about my wife?

317
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:22,850
Or... wait. Did she tell you anything?

318
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:29,750
No. I could kind of tell what she was thinking
when I was painting.

319
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,480
Artists are really cool, huh?

320
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,800
I'm not an artist anymore.

321
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:40,030
But I don't want to be a slave to money.

322
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,020
Hey, wait!

323
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,750
I don't like the way that you talk to me.

324
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,720
Mr. Takigawa!

325
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,040
Whether to use you or not, it all depends on me.

326
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,850
- Wham! One shot.
- Hey, hey.

327
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,460
Let's all get drunk!

328
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,280
It's dangerous!

329
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,000
Let's go home.

330
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:11,360
Okay, bounce, bounce.

331
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,820
I don't feel good.

332
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,150
You drink too much, Noriko.

333
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,900
Where's this supermarket?

334
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,430
- What?
- It's not the one you always go to.

335
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:36,090
It's close to high school, they have good lunches.

336
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,580
Don't fall sleep over there.

337
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,130
Go to bed.

338
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:42,620
Get up!

339
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,640
No, don't wanna.

340
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,890
- That's not it. No.
- Come on. Hold on to me.

341
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:52,360
Aw, Yuichiro. Don't be jealous.

342
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,210
It's because of your support
that I could succeed in my research.

343
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:08,030
She is so pretty.

344
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,590
Who?

345
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,400
Rikako.

346
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,430
She is a good cook. And smart, too.

347
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,460
I'm glad that you found a good friend.

348
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,500
Were you surprised?

349
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,230
About what?

350
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,090
When you heard that I was having tea with a man.

351
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,610
Did you feel jealous?

352
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,510
Of course not.

353
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,490
I have 100% trust in you.

354
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:35,690
It's not that you trusted me.
You just felt that I'm not popular with men.

355
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,840
I think you are popular.

356
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,390
You had been popular before you left your job, right?

<i>[Timing and Subtitles brought to you by Hirugao Team@viki]</i>

358
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,070
What's the matter?

359
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,970
I want you to be jealous.

360
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,070
Huh?

361
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:11,130
Because you married the popular girl.

362
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,190
Can't you be more worried?

363
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,010
Sometimes, I wish we can get along better.

364
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:32,990
Is that so?

365
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:41,140
I think I caught a cold.

366
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,180
Maybe the aircon blew on you too much.

367
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,770
Maybe.

368
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,060
Yes?

369
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,490
Please sign over here.

370
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,110
Sure.

371
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:05,050
Thank you.

372
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:18,030
Hamusuke? Hamumi?

373
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,390
Hamusuke!

374
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,650
Hamumi!

375
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,110
Hamusuke!

376
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,010
Hamumi!

377
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:33,620
Hamusuke, Hamusuke.

378
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,620
Hamusuke, where are you? Hamusuke!

379
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,550
What happened?

380
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,380
Sorry, Hamusuke ran away.

381
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,210
What?

382
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:46,490
Hamusuke!

383
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,120
No, it's Hamumi!

384
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,340
The door was opened.

385
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,440
What did you do? I told you to be careful!

386
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,700
Don't be so mad!

387
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,110
If she ran away, she will die.

388
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:01,840
You're always so careless! And disorganized!

389
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,270
Sorry that I'm disorganized.

390
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,390
You're the refined one, so that balances out!

391
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,430
So you're blaming me now?

392
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:10,590
If you think the hamster is so important,
then you can marry the hamster.

393
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:13,410
- Hey!
- Caring for hamsters is way more convenient.

394
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,690
They're not expensive to keep, they won't argue
and they won't make you angry.

395
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,550
- Stop it! You're in the wrong!
- Shut up!

396
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:21,400
I'm not your Mom!

397
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,060
Hey!

398
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:31,410
<i>This is my first time running away from home
ever since I got married five years ago.</i>

399
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,550
<i>But there is no place I can go to.</i>

400
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,060
<i>I want to try calling that man.</i>

401
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,530
<i>But I'm not brave.</i>

402
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,500
<i>I wonder if that hamster had successfully got away.</i>

403
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,750
Let's begin the morning assembly.

404
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,460
Part-timers, please hurry up.

405
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,840
Okay.

406
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,920
Even the part-timers would be pissed off.

407
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,520
- Good morning
- Good morning.

408
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,620
Let me introduce a new employee to you.

409
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,290
This is Tomoya Hagiwara.

410
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,500
I'm Hagiwara, nice to meet you all.

411
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,340
Nice to meet you.

412
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:22,310
- Today is July 2nd,  Wednesday...
- Look at that...

413
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:32,020
What happened?

414
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,810
I want to work hard for Rikako.

415
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:40,230
I quit my previous job.

416
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,420
I can meet her if I work here.

417
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:46,970
You're crazy. You're acting like a stalker.

418
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,890
I look forward to your guidance.

419
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:52,830
This is really wrong.

420
00:27:52,830 --> 00:28:00,490
There are lots of cute girls to choose from.
Why are you interested in someone's wife?

421
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:03,320
It has to be Rikako.

422
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,960
I can't give up until I know everything about Rikako.

423
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,310
Move over, please.

424
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:29,020
Did you fight with your wife, Chief?

425
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,630
That is not a  bento from a 'loving wife', so...

426
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,840
Nobody is here.

427
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,470
I'm not an idiot.

428
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,910
It's nothing like that.

429
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,200
Please, don't worry.

430
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,790
It won't be anything serious.

431
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,670
Because I like married men.

432
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:49,180
It's easy since you don't have to worry about marrying me.

433
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:57,670
<i>[Timing and Subtitles brought to you by Hirugao Team@viki]</i>

434
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,380
What are you doing here?

435
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,260
Nothing.

436
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:18,010
I was just thinking how unbelievable it is that someone
would burn down the house they worked so hard to buy.

437
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:23,150
Hey, let's drink something at my place.

438
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,960
The kids are still not back.

439
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,860
We have some time to ourselves.

440
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:34,100
Sometimes, having a family feels suffocating, don't you think?

441
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,560
I've already seen my future.

442
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,200
There's no way I can run away from here.

443
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,840
Here you go.

444
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:47,710
All the more so if it's a fine one.

445
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:52,400
It sounds like that you're also tempted
to set fire to your own house.

446
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:57,840
I do. I've thought about wanting to destroy everything.

447
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,450
I don't actually do it, though.

448
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:03,770
Because a family is precious and cannot be replaced.

449
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:07,750
You saying that a family is precious isn't convincing at all.

450
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:11,130
I do think my husband and daughters are precious to me.

451
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,680
See? They are satisfied.

452
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,570
You have amazing confidence.

453
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,390
I hope it won't crumble, though.

454
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,340
What do you mean?

455
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:21,530
There's this guy named Tomoya
who started working at my supermarket.

456
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:25,080
He started working there
so that he can face you as a working man.

457
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,320
I see. I guess going out with me wasn't in vain for him.

458
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,640
I don't intend to get back together.

459
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,470
But I'm glad that the guy I dated is growing up.

460
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:39,410
I'll be praying that he doesn't start stalking you at least.

461
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:42,990
Don't you want to destroy it?

462
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:46,090
Don't you want to throw away your current life?

463
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,940
I have no such thought.

464
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:51,610
It's not something I can throw away that easily.

465
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,720
Then I'm sorry.

466
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,480
I have a great husband, adorable children,
and a wonderful house.

467
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,230
I'd be an idiot to have an affair.

468
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,560
You're happy?

469
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,650
Yes. I'm happy.

470
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,520
Liar.

471
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,670
I'm not lying.

472
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:13,420
I don't need any luxuries. I just want to spend
the rest of my life happily with my husband.

473
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,300
Liar.

474
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,270
You two didn't look very lovey-dovey.

475
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:20,620
It's none of your business. Weー

476
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,280
We love each other.

477
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,200
Liar.

478
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,660
You're so insistent.

479
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:30,140
You do know that your husband
doesn't love you anymore, don't you?

480
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:36,340
You're just pretending not to know
because you don't want to live on your own.

481
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:40,340
Why are you telling me this?

482
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,690
Because I was like you.

483
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:53,350
It's better to be honest with yourself.

484
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,910
It'll all explode one day.

485
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,530
I won't be fooled by you.

486
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:00,700
We love each other.

487
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,100
Really? Because you understand each other?

488
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,260
Yes. We understand each other.

489
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:08,850
If you can just hold each other,
you can understand each other's hearts?

490
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:13,030
Yes. As long as we can hold each other.

491
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,030
I'm going to the restroom.

492
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:22,360
Go this way.  It's closer.

493
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,600
Wait... What are you doing?

494
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,270
Found it! Mr. Kitano.

495
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,770
Why are you calling him with my phone?

496
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:01,030
I won't talk to him.  I'll just let it ring once and hang up.

497
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,400
This is not a game.

498
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,590
You can do the same to me. Call him with my phone.

499
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,070
There is a guy who I want to fall for me.

500
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,830
He is pretty hard to get. The harder it is to get him,

501
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,160
the more it makes me forget my boring life.

502
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,670
I'm not planning on throwing away
the life I have now either.

503
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:19,620
But am I really wrong to wish for a stimulation
and realize that I'm alive?

504
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,860
It's better than being frustrated and taking it out on my family,

505
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,850
or get addicted to gambling and being in debt.

506
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:27,750
If you think I'm trying to trick you,
try it out yourself.

507
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:31,260
Let it ring only once and hang up.

508
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,520
Your everyday will change.

509
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,790
Yuichiro! You're phone rang just once.
One of your female students?

510
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,360
You're probably right.

511
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:22,870
Kneel over here.

512
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,210
Okay.

513
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:41,340
Good. You did well.

514
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:49,660
If you refuse to be my friend,
then why not be my accomplice?

515
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:01,810
Nana, Hina, greet our visitor, please.

516
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,020
Good evening.

517
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,620
- Good evening.
- This way.

518
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,340
Excuse me.

519
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,810
- I'm home.
- Welcome home.

520
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,180
Did you quarrel?

521
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,740
- What?
- You look like you did.

522
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,040
- Nana.
- You are so sharp.

523
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,540
We had our first quarrel this morning.

524
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:26,200
Your first one? You must get along well.

525
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,020
No, no. It's not like that...

526
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,800
It's Dad.

527
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,940
- I'm home.
- Welcome home.

528
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,520
Are you really okay with this?

529
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,480
You don't know them very well, right?

530
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,060
She is my good friend.

531
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:44,820
They might not be suitable for us.

532
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,000
- Welcome home, Dad.
- Thank you for inviting us.

533
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,400
Good evening, I'm Sasamoto.

534
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,360
I'm Takigawa. Good evening.

535
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,400
Wow...

536
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,640
I'm so honored.

537
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,540
- I'm working in the PR department of Minowa Furniture...
- Ms. Sawa.

538
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:02,900
- Your cell phone is ringing.
- Oh, thanks for telling me.

539
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,460
I always read your magazines.

540
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,240
<i>[Yuichiro Kitano]</i>

541
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,980
Aren't you going to answer it?

542
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,620
Why?

543
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,640
You feel uncomfortable?

544
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,440
You're both still in high school.

545
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,560
So you have to take responsibility for yourselves.
Stop touching him like that.

546
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,140
Refrain from doing that.

547
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,340
<i>Hello? This is Kitano.</i>

548
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:40,440
<i>Did you call me?</i>

549
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,860
- What do you mean by "that"?
- Having sex.

550
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:47,640
<i>If you need anything, you can contact me anytime.</i>

551
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,900
We just kissed, that's it.

552
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,540
What age can we take responsibility for ourselves then?

553
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,000
You adults are the ones who're more irresponsible.

554
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Keep your hands off.

555
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,480
<i>If you need anything,</i>

556
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,320
<i>you can contact me anytime. Hello? This is Kitano.</i>

557
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,240
<i>Did you call me? If you need anything,</i>

558
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,200
<i>you can contact me anytime.</i>

559
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,400
Excuse me, where is the bento section?

560
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,530
Nurture your love properly.

561
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:14,550
I don't love her.

562
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,990
We just wanted to do it.

563
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:20,060
Same goes for her. Right?

564
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:24,290
Yeah, that's right. It's just sex.

565
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:27,380
I'm thinking of comparing my taste buds with my husband's.

566
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:30,910
Is he fussy about food?

567
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:34,390
Surprisingly, he loves meat.

568
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,200
Hello?

569
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:56,390
Hello, this is Sasamoto.

570
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,200
I called you by mistake yesterday.

571
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,980
Is that so?

572
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,410
<i>Sorry to have caused you trouble.</i>

573
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,030
No problem.

574
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,520
I'm sorry.

575
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,440
<i>Hello?</i>

576
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,800
Yes?

577
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,580
Did I hear crying?

578
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,340
No, I'm not crying.

579
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,000
The cicadas, I mean.

580
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,800
The cicadas are crying, right?

581
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,580
You're right.

582
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,600
They're crying.

583
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:17,040
I called you the other day.

584
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,840
Is that so?

585
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:22,920
You knew it was me?

586
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,260
Kato, you like me, don't you?

587
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,580
If you don't have any feelings for me,

588
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,940
wouldn't you have called me back?

589
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,980
Because I'm the wife of your client.

590
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:48,820
Have you decided to draw a portrait of me?

591
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,020
It's going to be expensive.

592
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,160
I know that.

593
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,120
We'll start with a rough sketch.

594
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,940
This way.

595
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,840
Here? It's so pretty.

596
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,610
Please stand over there.

597
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,460
Over here?

598
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,940
Take off your clothes, please.

599
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:50,720
What's wrong?
You want to me to draw you as you truly are, right?

600
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,940
Hurry up.

601
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,870
I can't, I can't! It's impossible!

602
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,330
It's okay!

603
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,090
If you don't touch it, you won't understand it.

604
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:25,130
But...

605
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:28,850
Even within the same species, Stag beetles can differ in their mandibles

606
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:31,710
and the way their teeth grow, depending on their size.

607
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:32,990
Look.

608
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:36,890
It's called individual variation.

609
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:40,730
Their shape depends on the environment they were in
at the larvae stage.

610
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:45,000
They can generally be classified into three groups.
Big, medium,

611
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,900
and small-toothed.

612
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:50,030
This is bad...

613
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:52,710
I have a umbrella.

614
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,390
Let's run over there.

615
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:59,770
Sure.

616
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:02,940
Sorry.

617
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,300
It's getting heavier.

618
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,500
- Oh no!
- Hurry!

619
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,900
Okay!

620
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,720
Are you okay, Mr.Kitano?

621
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,020
Yeah, over there.

622
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,580
You're right.

623
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:19,610
You're a fast runner.

624
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:21,710
I was in the track and field club.

625
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:24,090
You aren't good at running?

626
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:29,150
Since when I was kid,
I never once caught a butterfly or dragonfly.

627
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:31,150
Really?

628
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,230
Oh!

629
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:34,910
Your shoelace has come loose.

630
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:35,970
I see.

631
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:37,610
You hold this.

632
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:50,510
<i>Men are sly creatures.</i>

633
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:54,530
<i>Though they knock on the door,</i>

634
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:57,370
<i>they don't plan to open it on their own.</i>

635
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:00,630
<i>A woman unlocks the door,</i>

636
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:05,010
<i>and if she doesn't gently call out to him with, "I'm right here",</i>

637
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,890
<i>he will pretend that nothing happened,</i>

638
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:10,490
<i>and pass her by.</i>

639
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:20,090
<i>All the more so</i>

640
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,670
<i>if the door is a forbidden one.</i>

641
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:55,420
♫ <i>You and I met as strangers</i> ♫

642
00:44:55,420 --> 00:45:00,720
♫ <i>Last night was last night, and tonight is tonight</i> ♫

643
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:06,220
♫ <i>Ticklish fingers, counting the moles</i> ♫

644
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:10,600
♫ <i>Counting from one again</i> ♫

645
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,300
♫ <i>That's right</i> ♫

646
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,060
♫ <i>we're igniting each other once more</i> ♫

647
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:24,020
♫ <i>when we first meet</i> ♫

648
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:32,700
♫ <i>It's okay if you forget about me</i> ♫

649
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:37,340
♫ <i>It's okay if you got astray</i> ♫

650
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:42,660
♫ <i>I will return time and time again</i> ♫

651
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:50,000
♫ <i>I will show you that I will return</i> ♫

652
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:59,160
It's still an affair. I won't see Kitano ever again.

653
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,420
So you're not having sex?

654
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:03,060
I don't make advances at men.

655
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,800
I know you want him so bad.

656
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,740
- Who is this model?
- I can't tell you.

657
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,160
Just come. It's the biggest moment in my life, you know?

658
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,400
- Ready, go!
- Sorry. It's impossible, after all.

659
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,940
- Rikako!
- Who are you?

660
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,660
When you meet, be flirtatious.

661
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,320
When you break up, be cruel.

662
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,480
Nights that are so painful that she can't sleep.

663
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,800
Right?
