1
00:04:09,105 --> 00:04:10,105
Hey!

2
00:04:10,261 --> 00:04:11,561
Why are you spacing out?

3
00:04:13,165 --> 00:04:15,448
Your ice cream is melting.

4
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,293
Who are you fantasizing about?

5
00:05:22,842 --> 00:05:24,093
She’s so beautiful.

6
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,919
Let’s go.

7
00:05:45,524 --> 00:05:47,159
Aren’t you afraid
of getting caught?

8
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,580
Oh shit!

9
00:05:57,501 --> 00:05:58,943
You’re weird.

10
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,086
Of all the places to masturbate,

11
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,738
why do you have to do that here?

12
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,140
Hey, that’s not true.

13
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,741
I’m not masturbating.

14
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,224
Look!

15
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:11,105
That’s the evidence.

16
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:15,108
Uh...

17
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,405
This is nothing.

18
00:06:33,818 --> 00:06:34,818
You smoke?

19
00:06:44,387 --> 00:06:46,196
Is it true?

20
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:50,508
That you are the kind of student

21
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,718
that’s super horny?

22
00:06:53,763 --> 00:06:55,514
Uh...

23
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:57,100
Huh?

24
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,616
Who said that?

25
00:06:59,609 --> 00:07:00,609
That’s not true.

26
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,490
That’s what they say.

27
00:07:26,927 --> 00:07:28,242
That’s what I’ve heard.

28
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,074
Is it because of me?

29
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,626
Uh...

30
00:07:43,555 --> 00:07:44,849
Do you like me?

31
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,940
Mayumi...

32
00:07:56,407 --> 00:07:57,654
What are you doing?

33
00:07:58,414 --> 00:07:59,414
Ma’am.

34
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:02,256
Nothing. I saw
Lance masturbating.

35
00:08:02,326 --> 00:08:03,326
Hey!

36
00:08:03,363 --> 00:08:04,363
That’s not true!

37
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,383
- Hi ma’am!
- Clean this up.

38
00:08:22,859 --> 00:08:23,859
Yes ma’am.

39
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:29,281
Shit!

40
00:08:29,853 --> 00:08:32,033
I can’t believe what
you did, Mayumi.

41
00:08:32,488 --> 00:08:34,626
You actually reported
Lance to Ma’am Barda.

42
00:08:36,387 --> 00:08:37,680
What can I do?

43
00:08:38,443 --> 00:08:39,558
It's tough.

44
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:42,738
Lance might get
the bushes pregnant.

45
00:08:44,131 --> 00:08:45,131
[scoffs]

46
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,931
Shut it, you idiots.

47
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,401
Stop?

48
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,605
You’re the man!

49
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,196
You’re something else.

50
00:08:51,727 --> 00:08:54,141
You jacked off at the
back of the school.

51
00:08:57,846 --> 00:08:58,871
Okay then.

52
00:08:58,896 --> 00:09:00,296
I’ll go ahead at the computer shop.

53
00:09:00,454 --> 00:09:01,474
Better be there.

54
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,459
We’ll do five on five with Chester.

55
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:04,887
Hey!

56
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:05,938
Okay, bro.

57
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:07,168
I’ll try.

58
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,109
Here.

59
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,403
Huh?

60
00:09:31,551 --> 00:09:32,660
You clean this up.

61
00:09:33,065 --> 00:09:35,188
You like me, right?
There you go.

62
00:09:37,866 --> 00:09:39,451
[sighs]

63
00:10:04,795 --> 00:10:05,795
She's something else, huh?

64
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,595
Mayumi seems always
have her own world.

65
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:15,987
It’s like she would vanish,
if you touch her.

66
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,866
Like smoke.

67
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,577
Cut it out.

68
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,400
You’re talking nonsense.

69
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,456
Am I wrong?

70
00:10:24,827 --> 00:10:25,827
Look at her.

71
00:10:27,683 --> 00:10:29,043
She doesn’t have any social media.

72
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:31,083
Nothing at all, bro.

73
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,347
Maybe because...

74
00:10:39,976 --> 00:10:41,448
She just wants some privacy.

75
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,428
Or maybe she’s running from something?

76
00:10:46,071 --> 00:10:47,071
Because...

77
00:10:48,859 --> 00:10:50,200
I heard something.

78
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:52,511
She’s from Manila.

79
00:10:52,596 --> 00:10:53,596
Kicked out.

80
00:10:54,461 --> 00:10:55,879
Huh? Why?

81
00:10:56,143 --> 00:10:57,143
Beats me.

82
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,680
Rumors.

83
00:11:00,012 --> 00:11:02,793
Some say she punched
a guidance counselor.

84
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,537
Others say,

85
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,669
she cuts classes
to hang out in bars.

86
00:11:09,678 --> 00:11:10,678
But,

87
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:11,949
look at her.

88
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:14,381
She looks...

89
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:15,965
kind.

90
00:11:16,924 --> 00:11:19,303
What? Bro, that’s just her face.

91
00:11:19,552 --> 00:11:21,679
There’s something there, believe me.

92
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,307
Looking at her,

93
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,186
whenever you go down on each other,

94
00:11:30,017 --> 00:11:31,268
you’ll be the one left crying.

95
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,233
[laughing]

96
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:34,692
Hey!

97
00:11:35,771 --> 00:11:37,824
My girl messaged me.

98
00:11:39,675 --> 00:11:40,675
What’s that?

99
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,993
BimBam, it’s a dating app.

100
00:11:43,763 --> 00:11:46,056
This girl that I’m chatting with,
I wanna see her.

101
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,286
But she wants a double date.

102
00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:50,808
Come with me.

103
00:11:51,397 --> 00:11:52,397
I’ll pass.

104
00:11:52,474 --> 00:11:53,963
It’s not my thing.

105
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,001
Come on, it will be quick.

106
00:11:56,026 --> 00:11:57,361
We’re just grabbing a bite.

107
00:11:57,862 --> 00:11:59,334
And those are college students.

108
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,385
They’re mature.

109
00:12:00,415 --> 00:12:01,415
Yummy.

110
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,710
Huh?

111
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,157
Come on, it’s just one date.

112
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,182
Help me out.

113
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:07,767
Come on.

114
00:12:14,971 --> 00:12:16,223
Shit, let’s get out of here.

115
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,277
Let’s go, bro.

116
00:12:17,957 --> 00:12:20,409
Come on, you can’t
refuse me anymore.

117
00:12:20,881 --> 00:12:21,881
Let’s go.

118
00:12:22,718 --> 00:12:23,718
Hurry!

119
00:12:24,038 --> 00:12:26,248
You can’t pass on this.
You’ll come with me.

120
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:28,881
Let’s go there.

121
00:12:37,753 --> 00:12:40,502
- Hey, come on, let’s go home.
- Later!

122
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,194
I need to be early tomorrow.

123
00:12:42,737 --> 00:12:44,029
My mom will kill me.

124
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,698
Just come here!

125
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,623
We’re already here.

126
00:12:47,694 --> 00:12:48,694
Come on!

127
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,360
- Hi.
- Hi!

128
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,280
Mi, this is Bry.

129
00:13:01,305 --> 00:13:02,505
The one that I told you about.

130
00:13:02,535 --> 00:13:03,786
Ah...

131
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:04,939
And this one?

132
00:13:04,964 --> 00:13:06,366
Is he the Mr. Jack Off Guy?

133
00:13:06,513 --> 00:13:07,513
Huh?

134
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:08,809
Ah, yes.

135
00:13:08,874 --> 00:13:09,874
This is Lance.

136
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,975
But he’s kind, he’s in
the science club.

137
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,709
He’s so handsome.

138
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,337
Super cute!

139
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,563
Are you game?

140
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,588
Nerdy and handsome.

141
00:13:18,618 --> 00:13:19,618
Nerdy.

142
00:13:19,864 --> 00:13:20,865
Let’s do shots.

143
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,058
Uhm... I don’t drink-

144
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,012
- Let’s go!
- Let's drink!

145
00:13:25,756 --> 00:13:27,473
Why are you doing this?

146
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:28,973
Come on.

147
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,185
Do you drink this?

148
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,281
Yeah, that’s my thing.

149
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,806
Are you okay?

150
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,938
My head hurts.

151
00:14:13,345 --> 00:14:14,805
Just barf it out later.

152
00:14:14,892 --> 00:14:16,101
I need to go home.

153
00:14:16,141 --> 00:14:18,803
My dad might get mad.

154
00:14:19,503 --> 00:14:20,706
Let’s go, bro.

155
00:14:21,086 --> 00:14:22,086
Let’s go home.

156
00:14:22,722 --> 00:14:25,349
Just tell them you’re
doing a school project.

157
00:14:25,374 --> 00:14:26,382
Yeah.

158
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,533
They won’t mind.

159
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:28,730
Just lie.

160
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,403
Mm-hm.

161
00:14:33,452 --> 00:14:35,120
You wanna go inside?

162
00:14:35,877 --> 00:14:37,643
Wow!

163
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:41,190
You guys are too much for me.

164
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:42,549
[laughing]

165
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,633
[laughing]

166
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,033
Enjoy, enjoy.

167
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,307
Enjoy, girl!

168
00:14:52,881 --> 00:14:54,800
- Bye.
- Bye.

169
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,147
Go get ‘em.

170
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,075
You’re the quiet one
in your batch, huh?

171
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:16,807
Not really.

172
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:19,253
Just a little bit. Slight.

173
00:15:19,787 --> 00:15:22,539
Quiet, but cute.

174
00:15:27,773 --> 00:15:28,773
Are you a virgin?

175
00:15:29,454 --> 00:15:31,017
Umm...

176
00:15:31,323 --> 00:15:32,556
Mm-hm.

177
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,353
But you’re already 18, right?

178
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:42,349
You can explore.

179
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,062
You can experiment.

180
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:52,910
Mimi.

181
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,079
Why?

182
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,040
Just relax.

183
00:16:02,372 --> 00:16:03,372
Relax.

184
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:03,209
Acceleration is directly
proportional to the net force.

185
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,169
And inversely proportional to mass.

186
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,933
But when it comes to vacuum,

187
00:21:08,096 --> 00:21:09,848
no matter how heavy it is,

188
00:21:10,918 --> 00:21:12,483
it will fall on the same rate.

189
00:21:13,266 --> 00:21:14,773
There’s no resistance.

190
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:17,863
Just like Mr. Candaba.

191
00:21:22,622 --> 00:21:23,709
Lance!

192
00:21:23,751 --> 00:21:24,751
Sir.

193
00:21:24,815 --> 00:21:28,277
Do you want to share some
experiences, or an example?

194
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,916
Umm...

195
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:35,116
Sir, just like love.

196
00:21:37,122 --> 00:21:39,041
[people laughing]

197
00:21:40,207 --> 00:21:41,207
Love?

198
00:21:41,724 --> 00:21:43,510
How is that related to physics?

199
00:21:43,624 --> 00:21:44,653
Umm...

200
00:21:44,685 --> 00:21:46,020
Just like vacuum,

201
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,749
if there’s no resistance,

202
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:49,930
anyone...

203
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:51,394
is prone to falling.

204
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,688
[laughing]

205
00:21:55,637 --> 00:21:57,332
You kids,

206
00:21:57,357 --> 00:22:00,876
you always relate love to anything.

207
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:02,145
Anyway,

208
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,781
we’re doing a project.

209
00:22:04,848 --> 00:22:06,360
A Newtonian experiment.

210
00:22:06,385 --> 00:22:07,469
By partner.

211
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:09,517
It’s up to you who you
want to be paired with.

212
00:22:09,694 --> 00:22:10,694
Okay?

213
00:22:10,824 --> 00:22:11,824
Go!

214
00:22:12,785 --> 00:22:13,785
Hey!

215
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,709
- What?
- Let’s be partners.

216
00:22:15,828 --> 00:22:16,828
Hey!

217
00:22:17,276 --> 00:22:18,276
Where are you going?

218
00:22:23,101 --> 00:22:24,101
Mayumi?

219
00:22:25,994 --> 00:22:27,244
Do you have a partner?

220
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:31,885
If you want,

221
00:22:33,397 --> 00:22:34,631
we can be partners.

222
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:48,433
Hey!

223
00:22:54,278 --> 00:22:55,278
Mayumi.

224
00:22:55,718 --> 00:22:56,718
Umm...

225
00:23:01,476 --> 00:23:02,476
Sorry.

226
00:23:02,729 --> 00:23:03,729
Are you ready?

227
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:05,879
It depends.

228
00:23:06,032 --> 00:23:07,033
Where will we work?

229
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,554
Oh! I know a place.

230
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:11,990
Coffee shop.

231
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,015
Just nearby.

232
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,103
I don’t have any money.

233
00:23:16,783 --> 00:23:17,867
It’s my treat.

234
00:23:19,456 --> 00:23:20,456
Leave it to me.

235
00:23:21,048 --> 00:23:22,392
I don't like owing anybody.

236
00:23:30,084 --> 00:23:31,851
Oh! Mayumi.

237
00:23:34,709 --> 00:23:36,460
If you want, we can go to my house.

238
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:38,624
If...

239
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:39,960
that’s okay with you.

240
00:23:42,602 --> 00:23:43,602
It’s fine.

241
00:23:45,231 --> 00:23:46,231
Let's go?

242
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,135
Come on.

243
00:23:53,212 --> 00:23:54,212
Here we are, Mayumi.

244
00:23:59,093 --> 00:24:00,261
- Lance!
- Come in.

245
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,355
Is that you?

246
00:24:02,346 --> 00:24:03,441
Yes, dad!

247
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:06,069
Who’s this with you?

248
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,445
Hello.

249
00:24:08,074 --> 00:24:09,804
Hi, Dad.

250
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,327
Dad, this is Mayumi.

251
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:15,479
She’s in my class.

252
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:16,662
Hello.

253
00:24:17,228 --> 00:24:20,304
We’re just doing a school project.

254
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:21,887
Mayumi.

255
00:24:21,912 --> 00:24:24,041
This is my dad, Ian.

256
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:25,673
Hi.

257
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,424
You’re so beautiful.

258
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,716
Thank you.

259
00:24:28,897 --> 00:24:30,332
You’re a good match for my son.

260
00:24:31,209 --> 00:24:32,919
- Dad!
- Are you his girlfriend?

261
00:24:33,073 --> 00:24:34,950
Oh! No, we’re just classmates.

262
00:24:36,758 --> 00:24:39,094
Come on now, Lancelot.

263
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:41,037
You could have told me that
we’ll be having a beautiful guest.

264
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,957
I could’ve cooked
something special.

265
00:24:44,336 --> 00:24:47,047
[nervous laughter]

266
00:24:49,748 --> 00:24:51,896
You smell awful!

267
00:24:52,415 --> 00:24:53,425
Ouch!

268
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,993
I’m so sorry about
that, he’s a growing boy.

269
00:24:55,018 --> 00:24:56,736
He still doesn’t know his basic hygiene.

270
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:57,833
He’s a big kid.

271
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,761
Come on!

272
00:25:00,889 --> 00:25:02,098
I prepared dinner.

273
00:25:02,123 --> 00:25:03,484
Let’s go, Mayumi. Come in.

274
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,266
Ouch!

275
00:25:06,526 --> 00:25:07,963
Come on in, Mayumi.

276
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:10,373
Have a seat.

277
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:11,599
Mayumi, sit down.

278
00:25:11,624 --> 00:25:13,960
You take a bath first!

279
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,435
I brought snacks!

280
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,479
Oh, hey, Dad.

281
00:25:21,504 --> 00:25:23,272
Just put it there.

282
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,691
Mayumi, your parents don’t
mind you being out late?

283
00:25:26,716 --> 00:25:28,626
- No.
- Okay.

284
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,259
I’ll leave this to you.

285
00:25:30,546 --> 00:25:31,695
It’s already my bedtime.

286
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:34,157
Okay, Dad. Good night!

287
00:25:34,182 --> 00:25:35,182
I love you.

288
00:25:35,954 --> 00:25:36,954
Got it!

289
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,113
Umm... Mayumi, I’m sorry.

290
00:25:45,225 --> 00:25:46,685
This is the only place I could think of.

291
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:49,126
Because there are a lot of
mosquitoes in the living room.

292
00:25:53,462 --> 00:25:54,986
Your dad is very nice.

293
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:56,888
Ah, yes.

294
00:25:58,915 --> 00:26:00,549
He’s always been like that.

295
00:26:01,307 --> 00:26:02,307
But,

296
00:26:02,689 --> 00:26:04,691
sometimes he’s a bit overdramatic.

297
00:26:10,391 --> 00:26:11,841
Where’s your mom?

298
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:18,541
Umm...

299
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:20,911
Is she gone?

300
00:26:22,987 --> 00:26:23,987
A long time ago.

301
00:26:24,858 --> 00:26:26,459
She got sick.

302
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,128
Umm, by the way,

303
00:26:35,818 --> 00:26:36,818
Mayumi,

304
00:26:38,894 --> 00:26:40,732
I really want to be a doctor.

305
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:43,767
But,

306
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,859
we don’t have enough money.

307
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:53,278
Maybe I’ll just study
engineering instead.

308
00:26:54,752 --> 00:26:56,638
That’s what my dad
also wants for me to take.

309
00:26:58,847 --> 00:27:00,285
Then be a doctor.

310
00:27:02,298 --> 00:27:03,808
We really can’t afford it.

311
00:27:04,814 --> 00:27:05,899
And maybe,

312
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:08,177
I probably can’t make it.

313
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:12,756
How about you?

314
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,721
What are your plans for college?

315
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,575
Let’s finish this,
it’s getting late.

316
00:27:25,251 --> 00:27:26,251
Alright.

317
00:27:47,087 --> 00:27:53,385
That’s what’s needed for the
force and gravity to connect.

318
00:28:04,965 --> 00:28:05,965
You know what,

319
00:28:06,806 --> 00:28:08,808
you’re lucky with your dad.

320
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,026
Yeah, I’m used to it.

321
00:28:15,051 --> 00:28:16,427
He’s always been like that.

322
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,570
But,

323
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,716
sometimes he’s overreacting.

324
00:28:24,478 --> 00:28:26,229
I’m not used to that.

325
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:28,905
For someone to take care of me.

326
00:28:29,614 --> 00:28:31,007
Or for someone to
ask if I had dinner yet.

327
00:28:40,104 --> 00:28:42,412
I’m used to being
scolded by my dad.

328
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,379
But at least, I know
that he cares.

329
00:28:47,566 --> 00:28:48,684
You’re lucky.

330
00:28:49,078 --> 00:28:50,518
Someone cares
for you like your dad.

331
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:57,776
Mayumi.

332
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:04,868
I don’t know what’s special about you.

333
00:29:07,687 --> 00:29:10,839
But whenever I am with you,

334
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:14,626
I feel...

335
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:20,589
Like there’s something
falling in me that I can’t stop.

336
00:29:26,134 --> 00:29:27,227
You’re so cheesy.

337
00:29:35,243 --> 00:29:36,644
Don’t stop it.

338
00:29:40,261 --> 00:29:42,674
You don’t need to
hold yourself back.

339
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,178
It’s like what you’ve said,

340
00:29:45,795 --> 00:29:47,644
physics is like love.

341
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:53,575
Resistance slows down.

342
00:29:54,014 --> 00:29:56,005
The things that
are meant to fall.

343
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:50,848
How about...

344
00:30:51,757 --> 00:30:53,920
we start the experiment now?

345
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:50,680
Hey!

346
00:38:50,705 --> 00:38:52,498
You wanna talk about it?

347
00:38:52,826 --> 00:38:53,826
No.

348
00:38:54,354 --> 00:38:57,561
Shit, man, I thought we had
our physics class earlier,

349
00:38:57,619 --> 00:38:59,259
But somehow it turned
into spoken poetry.

350
00:38:59,672 --> 00:39:00,937
You're something else!

351
00:39:01,098 --> 00:39:03,275
Bro, I was just explaining.

352
00:39:03,361 --> 00:39:04,457
Explained?

353
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:08,696
The way you and Mayumi look
at each other tells me otherwise.

354
00:39:09,202 --> 00:39:10,745
Something happened, I know it.

355
00:39:11,187 --> 00:39:12,522
What are you talking about?

356
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,809
- Nothing.
- Bullshit.

357
00:39:15,115 --> 00:39:16,795
Nothing? Or you just
don’t want to say it?

358
00:39:17,921 --> 00:39:20,283
Lance, I’m your best friend.

359
00:39:20,865 --> 00:39:21,865
Just tell me.

360
00:39:22,729 --> 00:39:24,515
Wow, man!

361
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,790
Whatever, I don’t care what you think.

362
00:39:27,251 --> 00:39:28,251
Hey!

363
00:39:28,582 --> 00:39:29,721
Just tell me.

364
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,824
- It’s nothing.
- Something happened, right?

365
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,787
- No.
- Bullshit.

366
00:39:42,973 --> 00:39:43,973
Oh?

367
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:46,066
- What are you planning?
- Come on.

368
00:39:47,765 --> 00:39:48,765
Hey!

369
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:51,971
Excuse me.

370
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,240
Sorry.

371
00:40:09,618 --> 00:40:10,989
Hey, what are you doing?

372
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:18,148
Hey!

373
00:40:19,323 --> 00:40:20,323
Mayumi!

374
00:40:20,898 --> 00:40:22,224
Hey! Mayumi!

375
00:40:22,326 --> 00:40:23,326
What?

376
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:25,564
Why did you steal that?

377
00:40:27,365 --> 00:40:28,783
Why? Nobody saw us.

378
00:40:28,808 --> 00:40:30,297
It’s only one piece.

379
00:40:34,524 --> 00:40:35,524
That’s not right.

380
00:40:36,146 --> 00:40:37,948
They might have CCTV.

381
00:40:38,766 --> 00:40:40,527
Why? Are you going to report me?

382
00:40:44,228 --> 00:40:45,228
No.

383
00:40:46,994 --> 00:40:47,994
It’s just...

384
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:50,614
This is wrong.

385
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,241
Wanna try?

386
00:40:53,516 --> 00:40:55,318
So you can share my crime?

387
00:40:59,418 --> 00:41:00,418
Mayumi!

388
00:41:07,238 --> 00:41:08,238
Are you mad?

389
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:10,634
No, Mayumi.

390
00:41:11,383 --> 00:41:14,011
I just don’t like this kind of behavior.

391
00:41:19,097 --> 00:41:22,201
We might get
caught by the owner.

392
00:41:25,417 --> 00:41:26,417
Fine.

393
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,537
Return it.

394
00:41:49,554 --> 00:41:50,554
Mayumi!

395
00:41:50,823 --> 00:41:51,823
Mayumi!

396
00:41:52,081 --> 00:41:53,081
Mayumi! Wait.

397
00:41:53,353 --> 00:41:54,354
What?

398
00:41:54,571 --> 00:41:55,571
Mayumi!

399
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,640
Mayumi!

400
00:41:59,393 --> 00:42:00,393
Hold on.

401
00:42:01,374 --> 00:42:02,374
Come on.

402
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,780
Because,

403
00:42:05,151 --> 00:42:06,151
earlier,

404
00:42:06,922 --> 00:42:08,174
we were okay.

405
00:42:08,207 --> 00:42:09,207
But now,

406
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:11,016
you’ve gone cold.

407
00:42:11,733 --> 00:42:12,821
I’m fine.

408
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,194
You can’t fool me, Mayumi.

409
00:42:15,907 --> 00:42:17,033
I know you.

410
00:42:17,808 --> 00:42:19,101
What’s with the cold shoulder?

411
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,607
And earlier you were like...

412
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:22,972
You’re different.

413
00:42:23,147 --> 00:42:24,599
Maybe I’m really different.

414
00:42:25,642 --> 00:42:27,583
What do you mean?

415
00:42:28,723 --> 00:42:30,418
You don’t know me, Lance.

416
00:42:31,369 --> 00:42:33,121
You don’t even know
what mess I’m in.

417
00:42:35,007 --> 00:42:36,007
Then tell me!

418
00:42:36,281 --> 00:42:37,876
I will listen, Mayumi.

419
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:41,902
You wouldn’t understand.

420
00:42:42,555 --> 00:42:44,528
No! I’ll try to understand.

421
00:42:44,868 --> 00:42:45,913
And,

422
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,940
Mayumi, even if you
don’t tell me everything,

423
00:42:48,957 --> 00:42:49,976
I’ll listen.

424
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:51,859
I’ll understand.

425
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:55,488
Mayumi.

426
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,199
Mayumi!

427
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:19,797
Mayumi.

428
00:43:24,403 --> 00:43:25,403
My father...

429
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:27,767
He left with another woman.

430
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:31,283
He went away with another girl.

431
00:43:33,629 --> 00:43:34,629
Since then,

432
00:43:36,066 --> 00:43:37,568
my mother just seems to be lost.

433
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,493
She’s home all the time.

434
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,440
But it seems like she’s not there.

435
00:43:48,178 --> 00:43:49,798
She’s drunk everyday.

436
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,140
When she’s not asleep,

437
00:43:55,743 --> 00:43:56,994
she’s just yelling.

438
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:01,680
Sometimes,

439
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:03,097
she just hits me.

440
00:44:04,192 --> 00:44:05,192
Sometimes,

441
00:44:06,702 --> 00:44:07,943
she beats me up.

442
00:44:10,974 --> 00:44:11,974
Sometimes,

443
00:44:14,501 --> 00:44:16,211
I need to calm her down.

444
00:44:20,857 --> 00:44:22,317
I thought I’m used to it.

445
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:27,758
But when the house is silent,

446
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:32,836
there’s still voices
inside my head.

447
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,847
My whole life,

448
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:49,005
I feel that no one
cares about me.

449
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,191
Sorry.

450
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,115
I don’t know why
I’m saying this to you.

451
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,451
Don’t worry.

452
00:45:06,641 --> 00:45:08,383
You just need
someone by your side.

453
00:45:10,076 --> 00:45:11,388
I’m here for you.

454
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,705
I’ll be there for you
through all your problems.

455
00:45:14,638 --> 00:45:15,638
And...

456
00:45:17,824 --> 00:45:19,051
I’ll be with you.

457
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,221
Who says I want to be with someone?

458
00:45:26,212 --> 00:45:27,212
No one.

459
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,519
But I’d still do it, anyways.

460
00:45:42,791 --> 00:45:44,334
There’s nothing new about that.

461
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:46,994
- What happened to him?
- He’s staring blankly again.

462
00:45:47,059 --> 00:45:48,059
Hey, bro!

463
00:45:48,818 --> 00:45:50,578
- Hey!
- Hey, bro.

464
00:45:50,723 --> 00:45:53,083
- You always seem out of it.
- What’s with you?

465
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,073
I think you need some “totnak”.

466
00:45:57,343 --> 00:45:59,381
That’s what I’m saying!

467
00:46:00,233 --> 00:46:01,791
Why don’t you try Mayumi?

468
00:46:01,867 --> 00:46:04,186
- Just maybe.
- Just once.

469
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:06,865
Huh? I don’t understand.

470
00:46:07,178 --> 00:46:08,469
What are you talking about?

471
00:46:08,503 --> 00:46:09,713
Don’t be so ignorant.

472
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:10,810
And...

473
00:46:10,886 --> 00:46:12,531
What’s “totnak”?

474
00:46:12,872 --> 00:46:15,148
You did the group
project last night, right?

475
00:46:16,376 --> 00:46:18,337
Maybe you already hit the jackpot?

476
00:46:20,453 --> 00:46:21,740
Have you checked it out?

477
00:46:22,052 --> 00:46:23,729
Are you talking about me?

478
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,801
- Mayumi.
- Mayumi!

479
00:46:26,164 --> 00:46:28,218
Give our bro a chance.

480
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:29,243
Hey!

481
00:46:30,428 --> 00:46:31,916
Don’t you feel sorry for him?

482
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,328
Don’t be shy, bro!

483
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:36,709
Mayumi.

484
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,260
Holy shit!

485
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,496
There. Chance.

486
00:47:01,954 --> 00:47:04,867
- Alright!
- You’re awesome!

487
00:47:05,804 --> 00:47:08,979
Teach me your moves, boss!

488
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,287
It’s beautiful here.

489
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:11,930
This place is something else.

490
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,826
No place like here.

491
00:48:23,306 --> 00:48:25,074
There really is no place else,

492
00:48:25,585 --> 00:48:26,585
when I’m with you.

493
00:48:29,429 --> 00:48:30,489
So cheesy!

494
00:48:34,766 --> 00:48:35,766
It’s true.

495
00:48:52,714 --> 00:48:53,714
It’s beautiful here.

496
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,469
Why do you smoke, anyway?

497
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:10,614
It started last year.

498
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,731
I tried it with my classmates.

499
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,118
Wanna try?

500
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,830
No, I don’t smoke,

501
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,791
You know,

502
00:49:21,149 --> 00:49:22,776
this is my way of coping.

503
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:25,997
Forget what?

504
00:49:27,094 --> 00:49:28,094
Everything.

505
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,366
Stuff at home,

506
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:31,676
All my troubles,

507
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:33,729
And all the questions.

508
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,672
Even myself.

509
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:54,104
Hey!

510
00:53:54,438 --> 00:53:55,606
What the hell?

511
00:53:55,789 --> 00:53:56,957
Stop that!

512
00:54:35,762 --> 00:54:38,890
Ma’am, we caught your daughter.

513
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:40,826
We’ll leave her to you.

514
00:55:10,997 --> 00:55:13,941
Hey! You’re late again!
You didn’t shower again?

515
00:55:14,005 --> 00:55:15,215
It’s time to change!

516
00:55:22,293 --> 00:55:24,329
Lance! How was the woods?

517
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:25,755
You’re my idol, bro!

518
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,852
You’re the best!
Teach me your ways!

519
00:55:27,877 --> 00:55:29,837
But seriously, are you and Mayumi together?

520
00:55:31,757 --> 00:55:33,204
You don’t know anything.

521
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:35,650
We know everything!
You hit the jackpot!

522
00:55:35,675 --> 00:55:37,427
We’ve seen this before!

523
00:55:37,565 --> 00:55:39,007
You’re something else!

524
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:40,597
Alright!

525
00:55:42,523 --> 00:55:43,774
That was wild!

526
00:56:00,068 --> 00:56:01,444
I didn’t know you smoke.

527
00:56:04,307 --> 00:56:05,403
Isn’t it obvious?

528
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:07,920
Let me have some.

529
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,077
You know,

530
00:56:15,934 --> 00:56:17,624
ever since you transferred here,

531
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:21,316
I thought you were
some goody two shoes.

532
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:26,407
We all have our
dirty secrets in life.

533
00:56:29,025 --> 00:56:30,025
Shit!

534
00:56:31,258 --> 00:56:32,258
Deep.

535
00:56:33,442 --> 00:56:34,599
Does Lance know this?

536
00:56:35,438 --> 00:56:37,670
Why are you always
talking about Lance?

537
00:56:38,599 --> 00:56:39,600
He likes you.

538
00:56:40,143 --> 00:56:42,113
You’re an innocent angel in his eyes.

539
00:56:43,259 --> 00:56:45,678
Aren’t you afraid that
he might think otherwise?

540
00:56:52,031 --> 00:56:53,031
Angel?

541
00:56:54,325 --> 00:56:55,326
Innocent?

542
00:56:55,899 --> 00:56:56,899
[scoffs]

543
00:57:02,491 --> 00:57:03,491
What do I care?

544
00:57:05,161 --> 00:57:07,394
I don’t even have plans
to have a boyfriend.

545
00:57:08,733 --> 00:57:10,985
To have a husband, to have kids,

546
00:57:11,445 --> 00:57:12,696
Or even a family.

547
00:57:13,517 --> 00:57:14,961
They’re not part of my plans.

548
00:57:15,772 --> 00:57:16,972
So what’s your plan?

549
00:57:19,746 --> 00:57:21,388
To have plenty of money.

550
00:57:22,576 --> 00:57:27,308
Lots and lots of money.

551
00:57:31,993 --> 00:57:32,994
You know what?

552
00:57:33,952 --> 00:57:36,124
I just realized...

553
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:39,122
You and Lance are not it.

554
00:57:41,684 --> 00:57:43,227
I think we match better.

555
00:57:46,147 --> 00:57:47,147
Dumbass.

556
00:57:48,099 --> 00:57:49,225
[laughs]

557
00:58:02,694 --> 00:58:03,694
Hey! Hey!

558
00:58:04,952 --> 00:58:05,982
What’s with you?

559
00:58:06,007 --> 00:58:07,133
You’re drunk already?

560
00:58:13,249 --> 00:58:15,278
You know what, you are cute.

561
00:58:27,471 --> 00:58:30,072
You really are a wild girl, huh?

562
00:58:31,704 --> 00:58:34,065
Maybe that’s why Lance
goes crazy over you.

563
00:58:35,222 --> 00:58:36,223
Shit.

564
01:01:10,738 --> 01:01:12,398
- You asshole! Damn you!
- Lance!

565
01:01:14,238 --> 01:01:15,408
Damn you!

566
01:01:15,688 --> 01:01:17,008
What's your problem?

567
01:01:17,647 --> 01:01:18,894
Why? Are you two together?

568
01:01:19,691 --> 01:01:20,691
This guy?

569
01:01:20,944 --> 01:01:22,654
What’s the matter
with you? Stop it!

570
01:01:23,106 --> 01:01:25,908
I don’t need to explain
myself to anyone.

571
01:01:27,006 --> 01:01:28,006
Shit!

572
01:01:28,711 --> 01:01:29,711
Damn it!

573
01:01:31,207 --> 01:01:32,394
But, you told me.

574
01:01:38,225 --> 01:01:39,305
I thought we were together.

575
01:01:40,716 --> 01:01:42,706
But you chose this asshole?

576
01:01:44,495 --> 01:01:45,495
Damn you!

577
01:01:45,847 --> 01:01:46,847
Screw you!

578
01:01:52,725 --> 01:01:53,945
I thought we were together.

579
01:01:54,589 --> 01:01:55,945
I thought you liked me?

580
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,635
I don’t even know what I want.

581
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:46,947
Dear Lance,

582
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:48,410
Hi!

583
01:03:48,744 --> 01:03:51,765
Maybe when you get
the chance to read this,

584
01:03:52,428 --> 01:03:54,430
I might have already left town.

585
01:03:55,928 --> 01:03:58,519
I have escaped the
mess in our house.

586
01:03:58,911 --> 01:04:00,931
I’ve distanced
myself with the pain.

587
01:04:02,216 --> 01:04:03,624
I just wanted to disappear.

588
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,635
I’m sorry for everything
that I’ve done.

589
01:04:10,189 --> 01:04:11,607
Actually,

590
01:04:12,054 --> 01:04:15,193
I still don’t really
know what I want.

591
01:04:15,606 --> 01:04:17,937
I’m afraid of a lot
of things, Lance.

592
01:04:18,492 --> 01:04:20,250
I just want peace.

593
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:24,485
With all the turmoil and
voices inside my head.

594
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:27,877
And even with our
short time together,

595
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:30,992
You have proved that

596
01:04:31,163 --> 01:04:34,222
I can believe in one thing
that I thought wasn’t true.

597
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:37,582
That I can be loved.

598
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:40,126
Even if just for a while,

599
01:04:40,151 --> 01:04:42,445
I can say that I loved you.

600
01:04:42,956 --> 01:04:44,255
But for now,

601
01:04:44,919 --> 01:04:47,087
There’s something
more important to think of.

602
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:49,135
More than love.

603
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:52,513
I hope one day,
when we meet again,

604
01:04:52,839 --> 01:04:55,433
We’ll reach our dreams
without being in pain.

605
01:04:56,091 --> 01:04:57,476
Thank you, Lance.

606
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,060
Take care of yourself.

607
01:04:59,343 --> 01:05:00,343
Mayumi.

608
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:25,974
There are people, who, even for
the short time you’ve been with them,

609
01:06:26,097 --> 01:06:28,318
are unforgettable.

610
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:32,418
Like Mayumi.

611
01:06:34,717 --> 01:06:36,969
I couldn’t understand
what she was thinking,

612
01:06:37,931 --> 01:06:40,340
But I loved her.

613
01:06:41,458 --> 01:06:44,431
I felt the burden
that she was carrying.

614
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:47,837
Even if she wouldn’t
say anything.

615
01:06:49,730 --> 01:06:51,815
And even if we
didn’t end up together,

616
01:06:53,044 --> 01:06:54,879
I wouldn’t blame her.

617
01:06:58,347 --> 01:06:59,785
I’ve learned that,

618
01:06:59,983 --> 01:07:02,861
Not all love needs
to be reciprocated.

619
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:04,979
Sometimes,

620
01:07:05,542 --> 01:07:09,379
It’s enough to love
with all your heart.

621
01:07:11,196 --> 01:07:12,864
Even for just a while.
