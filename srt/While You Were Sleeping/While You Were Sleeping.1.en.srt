I...

4
00:01:12,534 --> 00:01:13,807
...believe in you.

5
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,343
Because it's me...

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,613
...I can believe in you.

8
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:51,781
This makes no sense. This makes no sense.

9
00:01:51,866 --> 00:01:53,980
This is impossible.

10
00:02:15,471 --> 00:02:17,214
What is it? Did you dream again?

11
00:02:18,342 --> 00:02:19,506
What is this smell?

12
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:21,125
Hey. Stop lighting up things like this.

13
00:02:21,215 --> 00:02:22,809
Open up the window and air out this place.

14
00:02:23,267 --> 00:02:24,601
Is this a room for a human being?

15
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,079
This is a pigpen.

"On the road. Nightime. Winter.
I hugged man I've never seen before"

It's impossible!

18
00:02:30,249 --> 00:02:32,400
What's impossible?
Look at this if you have eyes.

19
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:33,916
This is a pigpen.

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,029
This is why I can't eat pork.
Because it smells like you.

21
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:38,257
That's not it.

22
00:02:38,342 --> 00:02:40,167
I hugged a man I just met in my dreams.

23
00:02:40,252 --> 00:02:41,583
And I'm the one who hugged him first.

24
00:02:41,668 --> 00:02:42,501
You know, don't you?

25
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:44,357
I'm not the type to hit on a man first.

26
00:02:44,442 --> 00:02:45,583
Of course I do.

27
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:47,216
How would you hit on
a man looking like that?

28
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,801
If you have a conscience at least...

29
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:50,786
Mother.

30
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:51,915
Are you sure you're my mother?

31
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,339
Can you please toll the bell for your mom?

32
00:02:54,432 --> 00:02:55,712
Ernest Hemingway.

33
00:03:06,223 --> 00:03:07,625
What does he look like?

34
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,822
Was he handsome?

35
00:03:09,734 --> 00:03:11,416
What can I do about it if he's handsome?

36
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:12,617
I have a boyfriend.

37
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:14,483
You went on a blind date once and
went out with him just twice...

38
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:15,604
...but he's your boyfriend already?

39
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:17,435
You might marry him if you
go out with him three times.

40
00:03:17,534 --> 00:03:19,201
I hate two timers...

41
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,650
...so don't talk
about the man in my dream.

42
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:21,568
Never.

43
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:23,803
He'll come into your life
even if you don't want him to.

44
00:03:23,934 --> 00:03:27,089
Your dream always comes true.

45
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:28,575
I said it's not like that.

46
00:03:34,567 --> 00:03:35,680
I heard that someone is moving
in across from our house.

47
00:03:35,776 --> 00:03:37,001
I guess they're moving in today.

48
00:03:38,334 --> 00:03:40,222
Handsome brothers.

49
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:42,601
Are they brothers?

50
00:03:43,029 --> 00:03:44,449
Take this over to them.

51
00:03:44,534 --> 00:03:46,149
Who brings people rice cakes just
because they move in these days?

52
00:03:46,234 --> 00:03:46,777
It's old fashioned.

53
00:03:46,862 --> 00:03:49,536
It's not old fashioned.
It's being kind.

54
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:52,215
Hurry up and go.

55
00:03:59,327 --> 00:04:00,367
It's that man.

56
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:02,518
The man that I hugged in my dream.

57
00:04:02,603 --> 00:04:03,307
What?

58
00:04:12,517 --> 00:04:14,350
Hello. I just moved across the street.

59
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:15,113
Please leave.

60
00:04:15,198 --> 00:04:17,159
And please stop coming to our
house like this in the future.

61
00:04:17,244 --> 00:04:19,334
We refuse any greetings or kindnesses.

62
00:04:19,434 --> 00:04:20,495
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:23,923 --> 00:04:26,016
Jeez. What in the world?

64
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,435
Hey. I told you that people
don't accept rice cakes.

65
00:04:29,534 --> 00:04:31,243
You didn't smile, did you?

66
00:04:31,328 --> 00:04:32,067
I smiled. I smiled.

67
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:34,338
I smiled like a fool.

68
00:04:35,258 --> 00:04:36,068
Really?

69
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:39,279
It's not easy to be that rude.

70
00:04:39,534 --> 00:04:40,101
Was it a woman?

71
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:40,783
Yes.

72
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:43,683
You should date her.
I think she's perfect for you.

73
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:50,968
Hey.

74
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:01,563
Mom. You should've told me
if you were going to use the car.

75
00:05:01,648 --> 00:05:03,166
I'm going to be late if I take the bus.

76
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:09,674
Mom. Mom.

77
00:05:10,334 --> 00:05:11,678
It's that man. It's that man.

78
00:05:12,268 --> 00:05:14,300
The man from my dream.

79
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,065
Miss. Could you please move over?

80
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,934
-I can't fall for him.
-Okay?

81
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:20,066
Hang up for now.

82
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:24,039
Let's calm down.

83
00:05:24,601 --> 00:05:26,500
I'm not interested in him at all.

84
00:05:26,585 --> 00:05:27,760
Not at all.

85
00:05:32,868 --> 00:05:34,033
Why is he sitting next to me?

86
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,356
There are three spaces to my left
and four spaces to my right...

87
00:05:36,441 --> 00:05:38,501
Why is he sitting next to me
when there are a lot of spaces?

88
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:41,701
Is he hitting on me?

89
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:42,983
No.

90
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:45,234
Don't jump to conclusions.
I can't embarrass myself.

91
00:05:48,851 --> 00:05:49,782
He's coming closer to me.

92
00:05:50,772 --> 00:05:53,039
I'm not jumping to conclusions
or embarrassing myself.

93
00:05:55,934 --> 00:05:57,223
He's coming closer to me again.

94
00:05:57,751 --> 00:06:00,962
If I'm careless, I'll become a woman
that he knows from being his neighbor.

95
00:06:01,047 --> 00:06:03,066
Then I'll become his lover
from a woman that he knows.

96
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:05,170
-I'm not interested in you.
-There's space for you to seat now.

97
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:10,403
What are you talking about?

98
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:12,216
What in the world?

99
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,642
-She thinks that he's hitting on her.
-My gosh!

100
00:06:21,184 --> 00:06:22,850
Miss. You should ride
the bus across the street.

101
00:06:22,934 --> 00:06:24,283
The next stop is the final stop.

102
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:25,168
I know that.

103
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:27,144
Why can't I get on
the bus before the final stop?

104
00:06:30,175 --> 00:06:33,301
-What in the world?
-So embarrassing.

105
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:40,267
We refuse any greetings or kindnesses.

106
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:41,467
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,978
That woman's voice...

108
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:52,834
That is the voice from the intercom.
That rude woman...

109
00:06:52,934 --> 00:06:53,945
Jeez!

110
00:06:54,408 --> 00:06:55,658
It's okay. It's okay.

111
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,750
This isn't embarrassing at all.

112
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,338
You did well.

113
00:07:01,144 --> 00:07:02,318
I told him first.

114
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,168
Mom. I think that dream
is going to come true.

115
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:08,235
Did you fall for that man already?

116
00:07:08,334 --> 00:07:09,717
Is the door of your
heart an automatic door?

117
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:12,068
How does it open even
before it's knocked on?

118
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:13,195
It just opens wide.

119
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,784
No. He's attracted to me.

120
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:16,871
How do you know?

121
00:07:16,956 --> 00:07:19,739
Why did he sit so close to me?

122
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:22,334
You said he did that
to make space for the girls?

123
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,535
He's a total pro.

124
00:07:24,634 --> 00:07:26,568
Gosh. He's quite skilled.

125
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:29,651
From what I can see,
you're clueless when it comes to men.

126
00:07:32,782 --> 00:07:33,750
Let me pay the bill.

127
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,926
One order of pork belly and kimchi stew.

128
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:38,116
It's 17,000 won.

129
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,028
Okay.

130
00:07:43,052 --> 00:07:45,031
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

131
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:54,001
-Thank you.
-Yes. I enjoyed the meal.

132
00:07:58,647 --> 00:07:59,379
What's wrong?

133
00:07:59,934 --> 00:08:00,933
Do you know him?

134
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:03,358
I had a dream about three months ago.

135
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,253
That man with the band aid on his hand...

136
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:09,568
He tried to smoke hen it was snowing.

137
00:08:09,715 --> 00:08:13,071
But he caught fire as soon as
he uses his lighter.

138
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:15,182
When?
Where?

139
00:08:15,267 --> 00:08:16,434
I don't know that.

140
00:08:16,534 --> 00:08:18,650
The hand with that
band aid used the lighter.

141
00:08:18,734 --> 00:08:20,943
Then it will happen soon. My gosh!

142
00:08:22,247 --> 00:08:23,274
Mister.

143
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,025
Mister.

144
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,925
Let me have
your cigarettes and lighter.

145
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:30,559
Why?

146
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,573
Smoking is bad for you.
It causes cancer.

147
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:36,093
If I smoke or not,
what does that have to do with you?

148
00:08:36,178 --> 00:08:37,115
Move away.

149
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,110
Mister. You'll die if you smoke.

150
00:08:39,195 --> 00:08:41,347
Are you women crazy?

151
00:08:41,432 --> 00:08:43,623
Move away. I said move.

152
00:08:48,847 --> 00:08:50,181
Listen to me!

153
00:08:50,266 --> 00:08:52,268
I told you that you'll die if you smoke.

154
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:53,768
Just let me fool you and listen to me.

155
00:08:53,853 --> 00:08:55,666
What bad luck I have...

156
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:07,143
Hey. I took this away from him.
Will this be enough?

157
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:10,483
Forget it. It's no use.

158
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,134
That was his choice.
It's his fate.

159
00:09:13,234 --> 00:09:14,104
How can you say that?

160
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:15,613
If we know that,
we should try to change it.

161
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:31,555
We can't change it.

162
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,978
Who would believe me?

163
00:09:42,501 --> 00:09:44,801
How can I tell him that
I saw him in my dream?

164
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:46,735
Where did that lighter go?

165
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,122
But my dream always comes true.

166
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:51,324
If you want to live...

167
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,900
...you must listen to
what I'm saying no matter what.

168
00:09:57,611 --> 00:09:59,565
Who would believe such crazy words?

169
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,903
Father didn't believe it either and died.

170
00:10:07,706 --> 00:10:09,876
We can't change fate.

171
00:10:11,421 --> 00:10:13,144
We can't change it
just because we know it.

172
00:10:38,434 --> 00:10:44,434
"While You Were Sleeping"

173
00:10:47,372 --> 00:10:48,916
I'll have this cake.

174
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,732
And please include
as many candles as possible.

175
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:52,867
Whose birthday is it?

176
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,001
Today is Prosecutor Jung's
first day at work.

177
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,209
So, we should celebrate.

178
00:10:57,294 --> 00:10:58,835
Why do we have to celebrate
out of the blue?

179
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,126
Look at this.

180
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:01,517
We should celebrate.

181
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:02,435
Let's celebrate.

182
00:11:02,534 --> 00:11:04,201
We should make it a national holiday.

183
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,617
He looks smart.

184
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:06,502
Don't you think so?

185
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:09,135
Prosecutor Jung looks really smart,
doesn't he?

186
00:11:09,507 --> 00:11:10,968
I really like him.

187
00:11:12,634 --> 00:11:13,765
Look at him.

188
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,906
I'm so disappointed in you, Hyangmi.

189
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,578
When you used to work with me,
you used to say that about me?

190
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:20,895
Are you already saying that about
Prosecutor Jung instead of me?

191
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,543
Oh my gosh, Prosecutor Lee...

192
00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:24,686
No, Attorney Lee.

193
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,434
I'll pay for everything.

194
00:11:26,534 --> 00:11:27,550
That's okay.

195
00:11:27,634 --> 00:11:28,734
You don't need to do that.

196
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:29,692
That's okay.

197
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:31,901
Its Prosecutor Jung's first day at work.

198
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,934
I should congratulate him too.

199
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:34,528
Do you know our
Prosecutor Jung Jaechan?

200
00:11:34,613 --> 00:11:35,495
Of course.

201
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:38,335
I was his tutor long time ago.

202
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,750
Prosecutor Jung doesn't
look like he'd be tutored.

203
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,001
What are you talking about?

204
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,500
He was the last in his whole school
all the time.

205
00:11:44,601 --> 00:11:45,316
Really?

206
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,367
Really?

207
00:11:46,598 --> 00:11:47,807
That's unexpected.

208
00:11:49,273 --> 00:11:50,893
Okay. What does this mean?

209
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:51,450
Read it.

210
00:11:51,534 --> 00:11:53,075
"13 years ago."

211
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,213
This is so easy.

212
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,767
"Just" means right now
and "ice" means ice.

213
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,961
If you put them together, "just ice".

214
00:12:01,046 --> 00:12:02,935
Freeze right now.

215
00:12:04,518 --> 00:12:05,667
No way.

216
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,583
He was that stupid.

217
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:10,700
No. If he's an idiot prosecutor,
you'll have a hard time.

218
00:12:11,393 --> 00:12:12,623
No way.

219
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,730
He's still a prosecutor,
so he can't be that stupid.

220
00:12:25,265 --> 00:12:26,448
I hate that.

221
00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:28,628
Hey. Prosecutor Jung.

222
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,187
Yoobum?

223
00:12:39,398 --> 00:12:40,367
Was it two years ago?

224
00:12:40,775 --> 00:12:41,846
When I first started
working as a prosecutor...

225
00:12:41,931 --> 00:12:44,049
...I received an award from
the Director of Prosecutor General...

226
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:46,165
...for my work on Hamba case
and serial murder case.

227
00:12:46,395 --> 00:12:50,016
I just put my spoon on
the table you prepared...

228
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,258
...but I received an award for it.

229
00:12:51,343 --> 00:12:52,705
Oh my gosh. That's not true.

230
00:12:53,665 --> 00:12:56,401
I'm Investigator Choi Damdong.

231
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:57,926
Yes. It's nice to meet you.
I'm Jung Jaechan.

232
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:58,667
And this is...

233
00:12:58,767 --> 00:13:00,913
I'm Assistant Moon Hyangmi.

234
00:13:01,222 --> 00:13:02,582
Yes. It's nice to meet you.

235
00:13:09,783 --> 00:13:10,614
What are you doing here, Yoobum?

236
00:13:10,699 --> 00:13:11,501
What do you mean?

237
00:13:11,601 --> 00:13:15,181
You returned home in glory,
so I should come and congratulate you.

238
00:13:15,304 --> 00:13:17,568
Then the two of you met
as a tutor and student.

239
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:20,116
But now you're meeting again
as a prosecutor and a lawyer.

240
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,106
Is that right?

241
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:22,852
I just came to say hello.

242
00:13:22,937 --> 00:13:24,369
I thought we can help each other a lot.

243
00:13:24,454 --> 00:13:25,345
Do you remember?

244
00:13:25,831 --> 00:13:26,668
Win-win?

245
00:13:28,634 --> 00:13:29,568
Just a moment.

246
00:13:30,534 --> 00:13:32,248
Yes. Did you get my text?

247
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,614
I want you to make some time on the 14th.

248
00:13:35,354 --> 00:13:37,383
What do you mean why?
It's Valentine's Day.

249
00:13:38,512 --> 00:13:41,068
Remember the restaurant that
you wanted to go to?

250
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:42,315
I actually know the place.

251
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,867
Jaechan. Do you know
what win-win means?

252
00:13:49,098 --> 00:13:49,869
Win-win?

253
00:13:50,385 --> 00:13:51,493
Is it Chinese?

254
00:13:52,968 --> 00:13:53,941
What that means is...

255
00:13:54,026 --> 00:13:57,103
Your father told me that
he'll raise my tutor fee...

256
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,417
...10,000 won every time you
go up one place at your school.

257
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:00,926
You should forget about that money.

258
00:14:01,171 --> 00:14:03,275
I can't go up no matter what.

259
00:14:06,411 --> 00:14:08,288
We can just fabricate your report card.

260
00:14:10,465 --> 00:14:11,550
What...

261
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:13,374
My father is a police officer.

262
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:14,320
If we get caught...

263
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:16,517
...he'll put both of us in jail.

264
00:14:16,601 --> 00:14:18,491
We just have to raise it slowly
without letting him catch on.

265
00:14:18,785 --> 00:14:21,611
Hey. If you go up 30 places,
I'll earn 300,000 won.

266
00:14:21,813 --> 00:14:22,962
I'll give you half.

267
00:14:24,326 --> 00:14:26,372
You said you wanted to buy a motorcycle.

268
00:14:26,457 --> 00:14:28,578
When are you going to
buy it with your allowances?

269
00:14:29,747 --> 00:14:30,858
It's good for me since I'll make money...

270
00:14:30,943 --> 00:14:32,506
...and it's good for you since
you'll be able to buy your motorcycle.

271
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,435
Your father will be happy
since your grades are going up.

272
00:14:36,551 --> 00:14:38,420
This is good for everyone.

273
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:40,413
That's what is called win-win.

274
00:14:44,273 --> 00:14:46,181
So you have to come no matter what.
Do you understand?

275
00:14:46,801 --> 00:14:47,520
Okay.

276
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:48,954
Hey.

277
00:14:49,434 --> 00:14:50,884
Make some time soon.

278
00:14:50,968 --> 00:14:52,769
I'll take you to a great sushi place.

279
00:14:52,868 --> 00:14:53,535
I'm going.

280
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:54,501
Bye.

281
00:14:54,613 --> 00:14:57,788
-Bye.
-Bye.

282
00:15:25,886 --> 00:15:26,959
So...

283
00:15:28,234 --> 00:15:29,530
In the end...

284
00:15:29,714 --> 00:15:31,551
...mom died because of me.

285
00:15:32,062 --> 00:15:33,320
Because of...

286
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,795
...the accident that I caused.

287
00:15:37,214 --> 00:15:38,629
Hongjoo...

288
00:15:39,987 --> 00:15:42,875
Please tell me that it's just a dream.

289
00:15:47,323 --> 00:15:49,154
Wake me up please.

290
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,950
Come to your senses.

291
00:16:14,763 --> 00:16:16,142
What do I do?

292
00:16:26,534 --> 00:16:32,168
"Aunt. Long hair. Mom's will..."

293
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:39,701
"Because of the accident
that I caused..."

294
00:16:52,968 --> 00:16:53,908
Hongjoo.

295
00:16:53,993 --> 00:16:55,247
Eat and wash up.

296
00:16:57,014 --> 00:16:57,631
Hey.

297
00:16:57,801 --> 00:16:59,489
Your eyes. Why are they so puffy?

298
00:16:59,574 --> 00:17:00,461
Did you cry?

299
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:02,629
No. It's because I ate ramyeon
last night before I went to bed.

300
00:17:02,714 --> 00:17:03,963
I'm going to wash up first.

301
00:17:04,477 --> 00:17:05,991
Eat before you wash up.

302
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,094
A big explosion occurred.

303
00:17:09,634 --> 00:17:11,756
Self-service gas station in Osun-dong.

304
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:15,367
A man who got out of a SUV
put a cigarette in his mouth.

305
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:19,367
With the gas pump in his hand
he approaches the gas tank.

306
00:17:19,452 --> 00:17:21,034
And the moment he lit his lighter...

307
00:17:21,138 --> 00:17:23,639
...the fire started from the oil
mist from the gas tank.

308
00:17:23,734 --> 00:17:26,401
The gas station is engulfed immediately.

309
00:17:26,501 --> 00:17:29,805
Due to the accident,
37 year old Mr. Kim died at the scene...

310
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,517
That's the man from the last time, right?

311
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:34,486
The man that you told not to smoke...
Isn't he?

312
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:40,826
Hongjoo!

313
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,052
Hongjoo.

314
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,465
Let go.
Let go.

315
00:17:46,911 --> 00:17:48,133
Let go.

316
00:17:48,265 --> 00:17:49,710
What's wrong with you?

317
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,850
It happened to him exactly like my dream.

318
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,310
I know, but there was
nothing we could do.

319
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,734
It won't change.

320
00:18:01,734 --> 00:18:04,383
Mom. What do I do? Mom...

321
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:09,448
Mom. What do I do? Mom.

322
00:18:10,485 --> 00:18:11,455
Hongjoo.

323
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,047
Mom.

324
00:18:17,025 --> 00:18:19,932
I'm going to die because
of the accident you caused?

325
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,401
And you don't know
when it's going to happen?

326
00:18:30,633 --> 00:18:33,067
We'll have to put a flower here.

327
00:18:35,577 --> 00:18:37,099
-My gosh.
-You're laughing?

328
00:18:37,662 --> 00:18:39,302
Is this situation funny to you, Mom?

329
00:18:39,387 --> 00:18:41,938
You saw that my dream came true
about that smoking man, didn't you?

330
00:18:42,023 --> 00:18:44,610
My dream has never changed once.

331
00:18:44,695 --> 00:18:47,028
Is that why you cut off
your hair like this?

332
00:18:47,113 --> 00:18:49,358
Did you think that your dream will
change if you change your hair?

333
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,468
I'm not going to grow
my hair from now on.

334
00:18:52,067 --> 00:18:53,834
I had a long hair in my dream.

335
00:18:54,455 --> 00:18:56,068
I didn't know...

336
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:59,751
My daughter looked
pretty because of her hair.

337
00:19:00,384 --> 00:19:01,492
Mom!

338
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,823
My goodness. Don't worry.

339
00:19:06,241 --> 00:19:08,640
I won't die in vain like that.

340
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:11,016
You're the only one I have in this world.

341
00:19:11,968 --> 00:19:14,105
So, don't leave me alone.

342
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:16,388
Okay?

343
00:19:18,422 --> 00:19:20,025
My baby...

344
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,765
I think it's best to put
a flower in your hair.

345
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,032
Mom.

346
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:23,222
Here's your flower.

347
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:28,961
Thank you.

348
00:20:29,046 --> 00:20:36,502
"February 14th, 2016."

349
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,304
What are you doing?

350
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,478
Hey. Are you on a date?

351
00:20:46,723 --> 00:20:47,624
Yoobum.

352
00:20:48,057 --> 00:20:50,099
Wow. Did you buy a car too?

353
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:52,488
What are you doing here?

354
00:20:52,573 --> 00:20:53,860
I'm on a date.

355
00:20:53,945 --> 00:20:55,133
-What about you?
-Well...

356
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,834
Well. Me too.

357
00:20:56,934 --> 00:20:57,662
Yoobum.

358
00:20:57,747 --> 00:20:58,850
Yes. You're here.

359
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:00,813
You cut your hair.

360
00:21:03,723 --> 00:21:04,506
Oh?

361
00:21:04,832 --> 00:21:05,466
Oh!

362
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,581
What?

363
00:21:08,064 --> 00:21:09,322
Do you two know each other?

364
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,336
Well...

365
00:21:15,646 --> 00:21:17,743
But how do you know him, Yoobum?

366
00:21:17,987 --> 00:21:20,146
Wait. The two of you are dating?

367
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,154
Yes.

368
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:23,162
We're dating, right?

369
00:21:23,247 --> 00:21:23,842
Excuse me?

370
00:21:25,225 --> 00:21:25,858
Yes.

371
00:21:26,377 --> 00:21:28,624
Hey. Do you and your girlfriend
want to join us?

372
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,234
-No.
-We can't.

373
00:21:31,397 --> 00:21:32,219
It's fine if you don't want to.

374
00:21:32,304 --> 00:21:33,750
It's cold. Let's go.

375
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,817
Yes. You should go.

376
00:21:34,901 --> 00:21:35,467
Go.

377
00:21:35,552 --> 00:21:36,462
We'll go first.

378
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:40,132
Jaechan, you even got a car.
You're all grown up.

379
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:41,576
We're going to go first.

380
00:21:43,462 --> 00:21:44,851
Was it when he was in junior high school?

381
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:46,572
I bought him a motorcycle.

382
00:21:47,197 --> 00:21:49,130
I think it's been over 10 years ago.

383
00:21:49,237 --> 00:21:50,709
Jaechan is all grown up.

384
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:55,947
Didn't you steal that motorcycle?

385
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:59,060
No. I bought it with my money.

386
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:02,701
I didn't give you enough allowance
for you to buy a motorcycle.

387
00:22:02,801 --> 00:22:04,402
"Winter 2003."

388
00:22:04,486 --> 00:22:05,777
I earned it.

389
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:06,648
You earned it?

390
00:22:07,194 --> 00:22:08,850
From where? How?

391
00:22:08,934 --> 00:22:09,624
Sir.

392
00:22:10,025 --> 00:22:11,036
We'll question him.

393
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,536
Why can't you answer me?

394
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:14,956
Did you steal it?

395
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,269
No. My report card...

396
00:22:18,901 --> 00:22:19,934
Report card?

397
00:22:28,234 --> 00:22:29,883
We fabricated my report card.

398
00:22:30,434 --> 00:22:33,318
Yoobum said that he'd get more
pay for tutoring me if we do that.

399
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:35,336
We split that in half.

400
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:40,463
Gosh. Why did you lie about that?

401
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:44,148
Your father was so proud of
you for getting good grades.

402
00:22:44,835 --> 00:22:46,672
Just say that you're sorry.

403
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,967
But father... The accident was...

404
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:55,240
-Chief.
-Chief...

405
00:23:32,205 --> 00:23:33,285
Is something wrong?

406
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,409
You keep looking at
your phone since earlier.

407
00:23:35,524 --> 00:23:38,483
I think I have to go home early today.

408
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:40,736
My mom isn't answering my texts.

409
00:23:40,821 --> 00:23:42,951
Is your mother not feeling well?

410
00:23:43,036 --> 00:23:44,747
It's not like that.

411
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:47,141
But something doesn't feel right.

412
00:23:50,676 --> 00:23:53,130
I blew out the candle.

413
00:23:53,885 --> 00:23:56,731
And turned off the stove.

414
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,539
The door...

415
00:24:03,911 --> 00:24:05,313
I didn't lock the door.

416
00:24:05,398 --> 00:24:05,944
Excuse me?

417
00:24:07,193 --> 00:24:09,848
I forgot to lock the door.
I have to go home.

418
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:13,056
Hongjoo.

419
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:22,967
Mom. Answer the phone.

420
00:24:24,951 --> 00:24:26,098
Just a moment, Hongjoo.

421
00:24:26,229 --> 00:24:27,500
Have you driven on the snow before?

422
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:29,201
No, I haven't.

423
00:24:29,973 --> 00:24:31,100
What do I do?

424
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:32,338
Should I take a taxi?

425
00:24:33,316 --> 00:24:34,983
Can I get a taxi right now?

426
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,417
Let me have your key. I'll drive.

427
00:24:39,616 --> 00:24:40,300
But...

428
00:24:40,385 --> 00:24:41,826
I drove on a road like this many times.

429
00:24:41,911 --> 00:24:43,069
Let me have it. I'll drive.

430
00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:19,916
Excuse me.

431
00:25:32,216 --> 00:25:33,499
Why isn't she answering the phone?

432
00:25:33,584 --> 00:25:35,085
Should I call the police?

433
00:25:37,249 --> 00:25:38,537
I'm sure everything is fine.

434
00:25:39,616 --> 00:25:40,445
Hello.

435
00:25:40,821 --> 00:25:41,556
Mom?

436
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,976
Why did you call me so many times?

437
00:25:48,182 --> 00:25:52,031
No. I left my phone at a cafe by accident.

438
00:25:52,116 --> 00:25:53,716
That's why I couldn't answer the phone.

439
00:25:55,658 --> 00:25:57,108
You fool.

440
00:25:57,563 --> 00:25:59,391
I answered it because I found it.

441
00:25:59,749 --> 00:26:01,840
A nice young man found it for me.

442
00:26:01,925 --> 00:26:03,285
Don't lose your cell phone.

443
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,472
Answer the phone right away if I call you.

444
00:26:06,986 --> 00:26:08,300
I'll be home soon.

445
00:26:11,749 --> 00:26:13,532
I'm relieved.

446
00:26:13,616 --> 00:26:15,783
Have you always been close to your mother?

447
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,029
No.

448
00:26:22,954 --> 00:26:23,949
Yoobum.

449
00:26:27,412 --> 00:26:28,378
If...

450
00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:32,405
If I get into an accident...

451
00:26:34,078 --> 00:26:35,916
...will you protect my mom?

452
00:26:36,015 --> 00:26:38,063
What are you talking about? What accident?

453
00:26:38,371 --> 00:26:39,257
No.

454
00:26:39,526 --> 00:26:40,732
Not right now.

455
00:26:41,153 --> 00:26:43,126
But I might cause
an accident in the future.

456
00:26:44,732 --> 00:26:45,570
Okay.

457
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:49,686
I'll protect you and
your mom no matter what.

458
00:26:49,783 --> 00:26:50,509
Is that good?

459
00:26:53,141 --> 00:26:56,281
But are you really okay?
You don't look so well.

460
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:14,466
Mom...

461
00:28:17,332 --> 00:28:18,029
Mom...

462
00:28:18,823 --> 00:28:20,897
-She's regaining her consciousness.
-Mom.

463
00:28:20,982 --> 00:28:22,416
She's waking up!

464
00:28:23,478 --> 00:28:25,108
Miss. Are you awake?

465
00:28:25,193 --> 00:28:28,087
Where's my mom right now?

466
00:28:31,481 --> 00:28:32,677
Yoobum...

467
00:28:35,374 --> 00:28:36,160
Hongjoo.

468
00:28:37,196 --> 00:28:39,101
Nam Hongjoo. Can you see?

469
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,207
Can you see how many I'm holding up?

470
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:46,538
Where's mom?

471
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:01,940
My hair...

472
00:29:04,216 --> 00:29:05,430
Why is my hair...

473
00:29:10,102 --> 00:29:10,987
Aunt.

474
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:13,304
What day is it today?

475
00:29:13,549 --> 00:29:14,474
Today?

476
00:29:15,726 --> 00:29:17,304
Today is Christmas Eve.

477
00:29:20,961 --> 00:29:24,396
Christmas has passed.

478
00:29:25,443 --> 00:29:26,950
And it's been three months.

479
00:29:27,042 --> 00:29:30,899
Miss. You were in
the hospital for 10 months.

480
00:29:34,729 --> 00:29:35,565
Aunt.

481
00:29:37,382 --> 00:29:38,420
Where's mom?

482
00:29:39,534 --> 00:29:40,775
Later...

483
00:29:42,366 --> 00:29:44,975
I'll tell you when you
come to your senses.

484
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,609
I'm totally fine.

485
00:29:48,015 --> 00:29:49,054
Tell me right now.

486
00:29:53,883 --> 00:29:56,350
You should've woken up a little sooner.

487
00:29:56,977 --> 00:30:01,779
Your mom held on as best as
she could to see you wake up...

488
00:30:03,962 --> 00:30:05,770
What are you talking about?

489
00:30:07,767 --> 00:30:09,307
What happened to mom?

490
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:13,411
Because of the accident you caused...

491
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:17,756
...someone died.

492
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:21,553
My son!

493
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:26,024
Bring back my son!

494
00:30:30,982 --> 00:30:32,897
My baby...

495
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,203
Please wake up.

496
00:30:35,428 --> 00:30:37,102
I'll make you delicious food.

497
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,771
To come up with the settlement
money for the death...

498
00:30:40,248 --> 00:30:41,757
...the young man and your hospital bill...

499
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:45,534
...your mom sold the house
and the restaurant.

500
00:30:45,988 --> 00:30:48,151
She worked day and night without rest.

501
00:30:50,334 --> 00:30:52,490
She wanted to save you...

502
00:30:53,149 --> 00:30:56,017
But due to over exhaustion...

503
00:31:15,182 --> 00:31:16,228
She passed away?

504
00:31:16,985 --> 00:31:18,257
Yes.

505
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:43,416
"To my daughter, Hongjoo...
1 and 2. Cancel the fixed deposit."

506
00:31:43,516 --> 00:31:49,583
"3. Claim the life insurance.
4. Don't blame yourself."

507
00:31:52,716 --> 00:31:53,712
This is a dream.

508
00:31:55,649 --> 00:31:56,744
This is a dream, isn't it?

509
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:58,826
Tell me that this is a dream.

510
00:32:02,649 --> 00:32:04,122
I have to wake up.

511
00:32:04,816 --> 00:32:06,291
Why can't I wake up?

512
00:32:09,687 --> 00:32:12,697
Please tell me that this is a dream.

513
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,254
Hongjoo.

514
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:17,901
I don't want to dream.

515
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:21,472
Aunt.

516
00:32:23,037 --> 00:32:24,609
Come to your senses.

517
00:32:25,182 --> 00:32:27,349
You might have to go to court.

518
00:32:28,982 --> 00:32:30,248
What are you talking about?

519
00:32:31,052 --> 00:32:32,452
Why do I have to go to court?

520
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:35,946
I didn't drive so why do I have to?

521
00:32:36,395 --> 00:32:37,741
You didn't drive?

522
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,725
Why do you keep telling me
that I caused the accident?

523
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,594
I didn't drive.

524
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:45,792
I didn't cause the accident.

525
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:54,706
"Kiyoung Hospital"

526
00:32:55,649 --> 00:32:56,832
Suspect questioning...

527
00:32:57,085 --> 00:32:58,168
What's going on?

528
00:32:58,253 --> 00:33:01,096
You know that woman who
woke up after 10 months?

529
00:33:01,181 --> 00:33:03,089
She's being questioned here.

530
00:33:03,174 --> 00:33:04,249
At the hospital ward?

531
00:33:04,462 --> 00:33:05,550
They're here.

532
00:33:05,825 --> 00:33:07,352
I think that person is the prosecutor.

533
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:09,688
-Are you the guardian?
-No.

534
00:33:22,164 --> 00:33:23,330
Miss Nam Hongjoo.

535
00:33:23,415 --> 00:33:25,471
Do you understand that you're
being questioned for violating...

536
00:33:25,556 --> 00:33:27,487
...the Special Case Concerning
Traffic Accident Act?

537
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,459
You have the right to remain silent...

538
00:33:29,544 --> 00:33:32,524
...and refuse to answer any questions
that may be used against you.

539
00:33:32,697 --> 00:33:36,147
Refusing to answer questions
will not be used against you.

540
00:33:38,526 --> 00:33:39,551
Because it's me...

541
00:33:40,717 --> 00:33:42,287
...I can believe in you.

542
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,767
You have the right to an attorney...

543
00:33:48,852 --> 00:33:50,328
...and have an attorney
present during questioning.

544
00:33:55,182 --> 00:33:56,019
Yes.

545
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:00,417
February 14th, 2016.

546
00:34:00,502 --> 00:34:03,232
You were driving home
in your mother's vehicle.

547
00:34:03,317 --> 00:34:04,950
You hit Mr. Han Wootak
who was crossing the crosswalk...

548
00:34:05,035 --> 00:34:07,199
...at the intersection in
Sango-don and killed him.

549
00:34:07,288 --> 00:34:08,125
Is that right?

550
00:34:09,788 --> 00:34:11,449
I didn't drive.

551
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:15,920
Mr. Lee Yoobum who was
in the car with me was driving.

552
00:34:16,075 --> 00:34:18,856
Yes. That's what you
told the detective.

553
00:34:19,615 --> 00:34:22,660
Yes, but he didn't believe me.

554
00:34:28,415 --> 00:34:31,236
That's why I called Mr. Lee Yoobum
and questioned him.

555
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:33,862
What did he say?

556
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:36,140
When I asked him if he drove that day...

557
00:34:40,718 --> 00:34:42,070
That's what I regret the most.

558
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:44,115
I should've driven that day.

559
00:34:44,637 --> 00:34:46,099
I tried to stop her.

560
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,071
I told her that she shouldn't drive
because the road was slippery.

561
00:34:48,156 --> 00:34:51,085
She said she had to hurry because
her mom didn't answer the phone.

562
00:34:51,951 --> 00:34:53,262
How could I let her leave on her own?

563
00:34:53,663 --> 00:34:54,697
That's why I got in the car.

564
00:34:54,782 --> 00:34:55,827
I got in her car because
I was worried about her.

565
00:34:57,317 --> 00:34:59,666
That's a lie. That's a lie.

566
00:34:59,751 --> 00:35:03,452
I'm certain that
Yoobum was the one who drove that day.

567
00:35:05,885 --> 00:35:09,641
We tested the blood on
the driver's seat airbag...

568
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,376
...and your DNA was found.

569
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,393
That's impossible.

570
00:35:14,574 --> 00:35:18,861
The black box video shows you
getting rescued from the driver's seat.

571
00:35:18,946 --> 00:35:21,686
Lee Yoobum was taken out
from the passenger seat.

572
00:35:21,965 --> 00:35:25,119
I swear that I didn't drive.

573
00:35:25,184 --> 00:35:28,108
Then how can you explain your DNA
on the airbag and the black box video?

574
00:35:28,681 --> 00:35:30,795
I'm sure someone tempered with them.

575
00:35:37,251 --> 00:35:39,938
Hongjoo. Hongjoo.

576
00:35:44,598 --> 00:35:46,544
I was unconscious at
the time of the accident.

577
00:35:47,289 --> 00:35:49,614
I'm sure someone moved me to the
driver's seat when I was unconscious.

578
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:53,117
And he got rid of his blood on the
airbag and put my blood on it instead.

579
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:55,520
Then he moved to the passenger seat.

580
00:36:06,486 --> 00:36:08,850
The person you're referring to is...

581
00:36:08,935 --> 00:36:10,184
Nobody else but Yoobum.

582
00:36:11,384 --> 00:36:13,736
He probably framed me so that he'd live.

583
00:36:13,826 --> 00:36:15,544
He probably framed you.

584
00:36:17,769 --> 00:36:18,832
You're speculating.

585
00:36:21,417 --> 00:36:23,715
We believe in evidence than speculation.

586
00:36:24,331 --> 00:36:27,456
Unfortunately, the evidence
is not on your side.

587
00:36:32,034 --> 00:36:33,327
Then what do I have to do?

588
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,894
There's nothing I can do.

589
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:42,925
All the evidence is pointing to you.

590
00:36:43,427 --> 00:36:45,155
It will be better for
you to admit your crime.

591
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:49,007
That's the only way for
you to receive consideration.

592
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:53,277
Even when I wasn't the one
who caused the accident?

593
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:56,547
The victim's family demands your apology.

594
00:36:57,351 --> 00:36:58,816
If you keep denying it...

595
00:36:59,098 --> 00:37:01,285
...it might affect your
punishment negatively.

596
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:23,942
"Lee Yoobum"

597
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,615
The number you have dialed
is unavailable...

598
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:48,240
If something bad happens to you
because of me, I don't think I can live.

599
00:37:49,784 --> 00:37:51,836
You're the only one I have in this world.

600
00:37:52,451 --> 00:37:54,639
So, don't leave me alone.

601
00:37:55,784 --> 00:37:56,791
Okay?

602
00:38:18,957 --> 00:38:19,847
Miss Nam Hongjoo.

603
00:38:20,419 --> 00:38:21,432
What are you doing?

604
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,868
Don't come any closer!

605
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:27,320
I'm going to jump if you come closer.

606
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:28,425
Please come down first.

607
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:30,533
Come down so that
we can talk about it calmly.

608
00:38:30,618 --> 00:38:32,517
What will change if I come down?

609
00:38:32,973 --> 00:38:36,797
I told you that it
snowed on Valentine's Day.

610
00:38:37,584 --> 00:38:41,960
That's why Yoobum drove
instead of me and someone died.

611
00:38:43,317 --> 00:38:46,381
Yoobum switched
me to the driver's seat!

612
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,062
No matter how many times
I say it no one would believe me.

613
00:38:51,752 --> 00:38:52,897
What more can I say?

614
00:38:55,664 --> 00:38:57,134
I'll believe in you.

615
00:39:04,938 --> 00:39:06,095
I'll believe in you...

616
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:08,379
...so, please come down.

617
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,191
How I wish...

618
00:39:21,851 --> 00:39:23,719
... this is a dream.

619
00:39:27,518 --> 00:39:29,133
If it's your dream...

620
00:39:34,101 --> 00:39:35,273
Thank you.

621
00:39:37,631 --> 00:39:39,069
For saying that you'll believe in me.

622
00:39:41,014 --> 00:39:42,013
Miss Nam Hongjoo.

623
00:39:44,261 --> 00:39:45,118
No!

624
00:40:04,037 --> 00:40:04,835
No!

625
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:22,477
Why is this dream so realistic?

626
00:40:25,317 --> 00:40:28,651
"February 14th, 2016"

627
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:38,736
Are you awake?

628
00:40:38,821 --> 00:40:40,972
What's wrong with you?
That was so scary.

629
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,506
Why are you up so early?

630
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,308
I had a strange dream.

631
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:46,977
It was terrible and so real.

632
00:40:47,062 --> 00:40:48,346
What kind of dream was it?

633
00:40:51,289 --> 00:40:54,068
The woman across the street was in it.

634
00:40:54,933 --> 00:40:57,650
I knew it when you
said that she was rude.

635
00:40:57,735 --> 00:40:59,859
That's the beginning of
a classic romantic comedy.

636
00:40:59,971 --> 00:41:02,667
She's in your dream already.

637
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:04,168
It's progressing well.

638
00:41:04,355 --> 00:41:05,613
What genre was your dream?

639
00:41:05,698 --> 00:41:06,530
Romantic comedy?

640
00:41:06,707 --> 00:41:07,681
Melodrama?

641
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:09,279
Was it perhaps X-rated?

642
00:41:12,494 --> 00:41:14,405
That woman died in my dream.

643
00:41:16,112 --> 00:41:16,605
What?

644
00:41:20,366 --> 00:41:21,312
No!

645
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:26,885
What is that? It's a thriller.

646
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,754
Yes. It was a realistic thriller.

647
00:41:31,336 --> 00:41:32,923
It's not realistic.

648
00:41:33,752 --> 00:41:35,342
You said that lady died in your dream.

649
00:41:35,427 --> 00:41:36,610
But she's fine.

650
00:41:37,126 --> 00:41:38,092
I'm glad.

651
00:41:38,238 --> 00:41:40,564
Why was Yoobum in
your dream out of the blue?

652
00:41:40,734 --> 00:41:42,066
I met him recently.

653
00:41:42,151 --> 00:41:43,833
And you just let him go?
You should've punched him.

654
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,744
I just said hi to him
with a smile like an idiot.

655
00:41:46,829 --> 00:41:51,779
I would've cussed him out and spat on him.

656
00:41:55,682 --> 00:41:59,271
But in your dream the woman
across the street dates Yoobum?

657
00:41:59,356 --> 00:42:02,296
They were meeting on
Valentine's Day, so I think so.

658
00:42:02,381 --> 00:42:03,587
It's just a bad dream.

659
00:42:03,803 --> 00:42:08,096
It just tied up two people you hate
the most and wrote a terrible story.

660
00:42:08,181 --> 00:42:09,134
What's the date today?

661
00:42:09,219 --> 00:42:10,259
February 14th.

662
00:42:11,467 --> 00:42:12,559
It's Valentine's Day.

663
00:42:12,644 --> 00:42:14,025
It's the day you're getting a new car.

664
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,753
All the couples are
having a romantic day...

665
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:19,006
...but you're test driving
a new car looking miserable.

666
00:42:19,958 --> 00:42:21,039
Do you have plans?

667
00:42:21,124 --> 00:42:21,905
I do.

668
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:26,744
Cancel it.
If you don't, I'll kill you.

669
00:42:57,269 --> 00:42:58,411
What is it?

670
00:42:58,855 --> 00:43:00,781
Why are you sitting here
when there's a lot of space?

671
00:43:03,139 --> 00:43:04,782
I have a question for you.

672
00:43:05,054 --> 00:43:05,934
For me?

673
00:43:07,066 --> 00:43:08,419
Do you know Lee Yoobum?

674
00:43:10,284 --> 00:43:11,955
How do you know that?

675
00:43:14,409 --> 00:43:15,759
You're a stalker, aren't you?

676
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:18,559
You did a background check on
me in order to hit on me, right?

677
00:43:19,442 --> 00:43:20,541
Do you know Lee Yoobum?

678
00:43:21,678 --> 00:43:22,529
Taxi.

679
00:43:22,618 --> 00:43:24,723
Excuse me. You'll going to
see Yoobum later, right?

680
00:43:25,076 --> 00:43:26,070
Don't do this.

681
00:43:26,173 --> 00:43:27,852
If you keep harassing me,
I'm going to scream.

682
00:43:29,604 --> 00:43:31,710
I know that I sound crazy...

683
00:43:31,795 --> 00:43:33,159
...but just think that I'm
fooling you and listen to me.

684
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:35,766
Don't see him today.
Don't drive because it's going to snow.

685
00:43:35,851 --> 00:43:37,718
Don't even get close to a car.
Do you understand?

686
00:43:40,847 --> 00:43:42,788
Excuse me. Did you understand me?
Excuse...

687
00:43:53,717 --> 00:43:54,718
Are you alright?

688
00:43:55,146 --> 00:43:56,817
I think he's a stalker.

689
00:43:56,918 --> 00:43:59,882
Why does he care if I drive or not?

690
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:05,051
Why do you care if I smoke or not?

691
00:44:07,223 --> 00:44:10,185
Sir. Is it going to snow today?

692
00:44:10,284 --> 00:44:12,683
No. I heard it's going
to be sunny today.

693
00:44:28,985 --> 00:44:29,883
Thank you.

694
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:45,363
Hey. Do you know what time is it?

695
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:48,218
Yoobum.

696
00:44:48,321 --> 00:44:50,205
What's this?
Are you here on a date?

697
00:44:51,056 --> 00:44:53,020
Did you buy a car too?

698
00:44:54,852 --> 00:44:55,744
What are you doing here?

699
00:44:55,851 --> 00:44:57,361
I'm on a date.

700
00:44:59,025 --> 00:44:59,964
With Nam Hongjoo?

701
00:45:00,184 --> 00:45:01,077
Yoobum.

702
00:45:05,634 --> 00:45:07,674
Yoobum. You said you'll
buy me sushi before.

703
00:45:07,759 --> 00:45:08,585
I want you to treat me right now.

704
00:45:08,684 --> 00:45:11,498
Hey. Today is not good.
I have a date planned already.

705
00:45:13,718 --> 00:45:15,677
I don't have plans, so treat me today.

706
00:45:16,073 --> 00:45:18,214
What's wrong with you?
Today is Valentine's Day.

707
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:19,359
It's because...

708
00:45:23,391 --> 00:45:25,773
I'm craving sushi so much right now.

709
00:45:25,858 --> 00:45:27,884
But it's strange for a guy to eat sushi
all by himself on Valentine's Day.

710
00:45:27,969 --> 00:45:31,531
Hey. It's stranger for two men to
eat sushi together on Valentine's Day.

711
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:32,759
What are you doing here?

712
00:45:33,084 --> 00:45:33,895
You're here.

713
00:45:38,165 --> 00:45:40,851
I told you before, didn't I?
I told you to just go home today.

714
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:43,289
Why do I have to do that?

715
00:45:43,518 --> 00:45:44,707
Give me a reason.

716
00:45:46,951 --> 00:45:48,579
-Well, it's...
-Wait a minute.

717
00:45:49,589 --> 00:45:51,847
Am I the only one who
doesn't understand this situation?

718
00:45:56,975 --> 00:45:58,022
Let's go, Hongjoo.

719
00:45:59,242 --> 00:46:02,059
Hey. Let's talk about what
happened today next time.

720
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:03,694
Let's go.

721
00:46:11,463 --> 00:46:13,099
I'm sorry, Jaechan. I'm late, aren't I?

722
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:16,984
This car is a work of art.

723
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:20,154
What's this? Does it have full option?

724
00:46:23,562 --> 00:46:24,148
Jaechan.

725
00:46:24,404 --> 00:46:25,925
My friend has
a piano performance today.

726
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:26,934
Do you want to go?

727
00:46:28,891 --> 00:46:30,591
Fine. Let's go.

728
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:32,094
I should stop being nosy and leave.

729
00:46:40,484 --> 00:46:41,154
What's this?

730
00:46:41,386 --> 00:46:42,773
They said it won't snow today.

731
00:46:49,501 --> 00:46:53,618
I told you that it snowed
on Valentine's Day.

732
00:46:58,284 --> 00:47:01,252
Hey. You might think that I sound crazy...

733
00:47:01,806 --> 00:47:03,313
...but I think that dream is coming true.

734
00:47:03,398 --> 00:47:05,129
That thriller dream that
you had this morning?

735
00:47:06,084 --> 00:47:06,718
Yes.

736
00:47:06,911 --> 00:47:07,634
Yes, Jaechan.

737
00:47:07,719 --> 00:47:10,039
You sound crazy,
so let's leave right now.

738
00:47:12,484 --> 00:47:13,684
Let me verify one more thing.

739
00:47:13,784 --> 00:47:14,663
One more thing.

740
00:47:16,238 --> 00:47:17,785
But it's going to start soon.

741
00:47:31,084 --> 00:47:32,585
I forgot one thing.

742
00:47:32,684 --> 00:47:35,485
I didn't lock the door before I go.
I think I have to go home.

743
00:48:04,628 --> 00:48:05,679
So it's true.

744
00:48:06,818 --> 00:48:08,818
Yoobum did drive.

745
00:48:14,866 --> 00:48:15,626
Yoobum!

746
00:48:16,121 --> 00:48:17,194
Nam Hongjoo!

747
00:48:18,684 --> 00:48:19,535
Stop right there.

748
00:48:23,384 --> 00:48:24,618
Jaechan. What's wrong?

749
00:48:25,217 --> 00:48:26,684
Hey. Call the police right now.

750
00:48:26,784 --> 00:48:27,693
There's going to be an accident soon,

751
00:48:27,778 --> 00:48:29,299
...so they need to stop the car
with 4772 license plate number.

752
00:48:30,773 --> 00:48:31,789
You must be crazy, Jaechan.

753
00:48:31,874 --> 00:48:32,751
What do you want
me to do by reporting it?

754
00:48:32,836 --> 00:48:33,987
You want me to tell them that...

755
00:48:34,072 --> 00:48:35,965
...my brother saw it in a dream that
there's going to be an accident?

756
00:48:36,144 --> 00:48:37,635
I'm going crazy.

757
00:48:37,771 --> 00:48:39,330
You're so strange.

758
00:48:39,415 --> 00:48:40,894
Why are you so worried about that woman?

759
00:48:40,979 --> 00:48:42,493
I'm not worried about her. I'm just...

760
00:48:46,017 --> 00:48:47,679
I feel like she's going
to turn out like me.

761
00:48:48,518 --> 00:48:50,761
She won't be able to say anything like
an idiot like me and taken advantage of.

762
00:48:51,317 --> 00:48:53,951
I think it was stressful
seeing Yoobum again.

763
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:55,833
That's why you had that terrible dream.

764
00:49:06,551 --> 00:49:08,505
Okay.
I shouldn't worry about it.

765
00:49:09,035 --> 00:49:11,189
If I act nosy,
I'll just become a crazy guy.

766
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:25,238
Oh my goodness...

767
00:49:26,417 --> 00:49:28,635
Jaechan. I didn't get in yet.

768
00:49:31,033 --> 00:49:32,936
Why are you leaving without me?

769
00:49:48,084 --> 00:49:50,518
An accident?
What are you talking about?

770
00:49:50,885 --> 00:49:53,056
Not right now.

771
00:49:53,498 --> 00:49:55,459
But I might cause
an accident in the future.

772
00:49:58,105 --> 00:50:00,063
I will be fine when that happens...

773
00:50:00,531 --> 00:50:02,199
...but please just protect my mother.

774
00:50:02,862 --> 00:50:03,700
I understand.

775
00:50:03,945 --> 00:50:07,819
No matter what happens,
I'll protect you and your mother.

776
00:50:08,017 --> 00:50:08,784
Is that good?

777
00:50:13,488 --> 00:50:15,979
By the way, what happened
with you and Jaechan?

778
00:50:17,132 --> 00:50:18,699
It seemed like Jaechan...

779
00:51:13,872 --> 00:51:14,851
Are you okay?

780
00:52:06,155 --> 00:52:07,192
Are you hurt?

781
00:52:11,722 --> 00:52:12,763
Are you okay?

782
00:52:14,117 --> 00:52:14,831
Yes.

783
00:52:19,225 --> 00:52:20,103
Jung Jaechan.

784
00:52:21,009 --> 00:52:22,139
Did you just hit me?

785
00:52:23,222 --> 00:52:25,695
Yes. I think my car
slipped because of the snow.

786
00:52:26,513 --> 00:52:29,813
You hit me on purpose, didn't you?

787
00:52:29,985 --> 00:52:31,752
No. I said the car
slipped on the snow.

788
00:52:31,851 --> 00:52:32,719
I'm sorry, Yoobum.

789
00:52:32,812 --> 00:52:33,579
Hey. Hey!

790
00:52:34,745 --> 00:52:35,685
Hey!

791
00:52:37,533 --> 00:52:38,765
Do you think I'm blind?

792
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:40,484
You followed me and caused the accident.

793
00:52:40,584 --> 00:52:42,693
It's obvious that
the collision was intentional.

794
00:52:42,778 --> 00:52:45,252
Don't be ridiculous.

795
00:52:46,684 --> 00:52:47,585
It's not like that.

796
00:52:47,684 --> 00:52:50,852
If it's not like that,
what else can it be?

797
00:52:51,451 --> 00:52:52,542
Do you need money?

798
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:54,266
Are you in a car accident
fraud ring or something?

799
00:52:56,818 --> 00:52:58,955
If it wasn't for me,
you would've killed someone.

800
00:52:59,214 --> 00:53:00,811
You're not in your right mind.

801
00:53:01,706 --> 00:53:03,013
You're crazy.

802
00:53:05,861 --> 00:53:08,314
Did you do it because of that
motorcycle accident back then?

803
00:53:11,643 --> 00:53:14,224
What do we do, Yoobum?
I think the police is coming.

804
00:53:17,584 --> 00:53:19,772
-I'm going crazy.
-Gosh!

805
00:53:20,103 --> 00:53:22,088
He'll find out that
I bought that motorcycle.

806
00:53:33,382 --> 00:53:35,245
When the police come, just beg.

807
00:53:35,542 --> 00:53:37,630
Just say that you're sorry and
that you'll pay for the damages.

808
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:39,216
What are you talking about?

809
00:53:39,584 --> 00:53:41,531
You drove the motorcycle,
so why do I have to pay for the damages?

810
00:53:42,317 --> 00:53:43,341
Tell them that you drove the motorcycle.

811
00:53:43,657 --> 00:53:44,603
That makes more sense.

812
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:46,089
Are you saying that you're going to lie?

813
00:53:46,851 --> 00:53:48,392
No, Jaechan...

814
00:53:48,761 --> 00:53:50,945
I'm just saying that I'll tell
the story that makes more sense.

815
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:52,459
To be frank...

816
00:53:55,044 --> 00:53:56,743
...it makes more sense
that you cause this accident than me.

817
00:54:00,045 --> 00:54:01,284
What makes more sense?

818
00:54:01,484 --> 00:54:02,851
You're the one who caused the accident!

819
00:54:02,951 --> 00:54:05,852
I'm going to tell the truth
when the police comes.

820
00:54:07,851 --> 00:54:08,686
Really?

821
00:54:21,851 --> 00:54:23,363
I'm going to say that
you drove the motorcycle.

822
00:54:24,084 --> 00:54:24,818
Yoobum!

823
00:54:24,918 --> 00:54:26,713
There's no witness...

824
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:30,133
...and you and I are the only ones here.

825
00:54:37,017 --> 00:54:37,934
I'm curious.

826
00:54:39,284 --> 00:54:40,531
Who will...

827
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:43,343
...the police believe in?

828
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:54,191
I almost killed someone?

829
00:54:54,985 --> 00:54:56,905
You shouldn't say something so crazy.

830
00:54:56,990 --> 00:55:00,230
Jaechan. You're totally crazy right now.
Do you know that?

831
00:55:01,481 --> 00:55:02,153
No.

832
00:55:02,643 --> 00:55:03,650
I'm totally fine.

833
00:55:04,518 --> 00:55:07,537
If I didn't stop you,
you would've killed that guy.

834
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:11,795
Since it's you, you would've fabricated
things and framed her for the accident.

835
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,741
Hey. You crazy jerk. That's enough.

836
00:55:13,826 --> 00:55:16,613
That woman would've become a criminal...

837
00:55:17,335 --> 00:55:19,529
...and her mom would've died due to shock.

838
00:55:20,485 --> 00:55:24,821
And that woman would've taken her
life foolishly because of the injustice.

839
00:55:24,926 --> 00:55:25,989
You...

840
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:30,214
...are totally capable of doing that.

841
00:55:33,964 --> 00:55:35,372
You're still the same.

842
00:55:35,871 --> 00:55:38,502
You still blame other
people and make excuses.

843
00:55:40,187 --> 00:55:42,081
You almost killed us.

844
00:55:44,584 --> 00:55:45,321
No...

845
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:48,266
I did it to save you.

846
00:56:02,417 --> 00:56:04,016
Who would believe that?

847
00:56:06,831 --> 00:56:07,814
Hongjoo.

848
00:56:09,251 --> 00:56:11,001
Do you believe this crazy jerk's words?

849
00:56:26,317 --> 00:56:27,050
Well.

850
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,486
Who would believe me...

851
00:56:30,731 --> 00:56:32,689
...if I said that
I saw you in my dreams.

852
00:56:35,923 --> 00:56:38,131
You were so sad in my dream...

853
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:42,730
...so, I came here to change that dream.

854
00:56:45,063 --> 00:56:46,566
No one would believe...

855
00:56:47,579 --> 00:56:48,926
...that I changed the future.

856
00:58:02,197 --> 00:58:03,046
I...

857
00:58:03,882 --> 00:58:05,148
...believe in you.

858
00:58:07,978 --> 00:58:08,948
Because it's me...

859
00:58:10,773 --> 00:58:12,322
...I can believe in you.

860
00:58:21,093 --> 00:58:22,372
Thank you.

861
00:59:34,104 --> 00:59:42,385
