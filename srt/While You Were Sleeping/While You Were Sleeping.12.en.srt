00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:00,700
"While You Were Sleeping"

2
00:00:08,767 --> 00:00:12,234
The brain dead patient will barely
survive a week and die soon.

3
00:00:12,334 --> 00:00:14,968
Then, proceed with the autopsy
and deal with it afterwards.

4
00:00:15,267 --> 00:00:17,884
Sir, can I proceed with
the organ transplant...

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,601
...and autopsy at the same time?

6
00:00:20,534 --> 00:00:21,335
Amazing.

7
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:24,001
Amazing.

8
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:27,901
Prosecutor Jung's brain dead patient
will proceed with both organ transplant...

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,300
...and autopsy at the same time.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,834
That's too reckless. That's a rare case...

11
00:00:32,934 --> 00:00:36,234
But that rare case is
very similar to this case.

12
00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:38,767
All the victims from this case
are injured at the brain area...

13
00:00:38,834 --> 00:00:40,234
...and not the organs.

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,567
According to the results,
we found blood near the neck.

15
00:00:42,734 --> 00:00:44,001
Without autopsy on the organs...

16
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:47,734
...we can conduct it on the neck and
the brain to reveal the cause of death.

17
00:00:49,067 --> 00:00:50,467
He said he'll reveal
the truth no matter what.

18
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:53,967
What's wrong with Prosecutor Jung?
What makes him so confident?

19
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:56,934
Nothing.

20
00:00:57,334 --> 00:00:58,135
What?

21
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:00,416
Don't you know Prosecutor Jung by now?

22
00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:03,382
His role model is a mayfly.

23
00:01:03,467 --> 00:01:06,867
He likes to start on something
without thinking of the next move.

24
00:01:06,968 --> 00:01:09,469
Isn't this too much, though?

25
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:14,868
I bet you he's somewhere pulling
his hair regretting his words.

26
00:01:16,133 --> 00:01:18,282
"Episode 12"

27
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:19,767
This darn mouth...

28
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:22,134
This mouth is making my body suffer...

29
00:01:23,634 --> 00:01:24,734
This mouth of mine.

30
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,467
Why did I say such things if
I don't know what I'm going to do?

31
00:01:29,767 --> 00:01:31,468
What do I do when
I didn't even win a lotto?

32
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:35,569
Who's calling? I don't feel like talking
on the phone right now.

33
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:37,101
"Little Pup"

34
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,850
What's up?

35
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:44,450
I was curious to what you decided on.

36
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:47,168
Same choice as you.

37
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,416
That's a tough choice. Are you sure?

38
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:52,513
Of course, that's why I chose it.

39
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:54,001
I don't believe it.

40
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:58,301
Aren't you some place
sitting down pulling your hair?

41
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:04,802
Did you see that in your dream?

42
00:02:09,934 --> 00:02:12,501
Nope, I followed your ringtone.

43
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:13,402
Hongjoo.

44
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,701
-Rat, rat...
-Goodness!

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,834
Where?

46
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,202
My leg is cramping.

47
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:27,635
Oh, that...

48
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:38,001
Are you that not confident?

49
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,887
No, it feels like I just learned to speak
and now I have to take the SATs.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,701
I feel like a turtle trying
to catch two rabbits.

51
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:48,101
Gosh.

52
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:53,335
Don't worry.

53
00:02:53,601 --> 00:02:57,135
It may be hard to get it done
but you'll catch them all.

54
00:02:57,501 --> 00:02:58,268
What?

55
00:02:58,801 --> 00:02:59,948
I had a dream.

56
00:03:00,033 --> 00:03:01,934
The organ transplant will go well...

57
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:04,901
...and you'll win the trial,
putting the culprit in the jail.

58
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:05,982
Really?

59
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:06,701
Yes.

60
00:03:07,234 --> 00:03:10,973
After you catch both rabbits,
let's go to the beach.

61
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:12,734
The beach near that bus stop.

62
00:03:13,534 --> 00:03:15,335
That's a relief.

63
00:03:15,834 --> 00:03:18,101
Why would you tell me that dream now?

64
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:20,402
I just thought you would be careless.

65
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:22,963
Don't worry, I won't.

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,701
It's good, you should go to work now.

67
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:27,168
Okay.

68
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:35,556
I forgot my stuff...

69
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,133
MY goodness.

70
00:03:41,634 --> 00:03:42,934
Thanks for telling me about the dream.

71
00:03:56,334 --> 00:03:58,868
Human lie detector my foot...

72
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,934
I think you should
go back to the hospital.

73
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:22,468
Why?

74
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:26,801
Prosecutor Jung got an approval
on the organ transplant.

75
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:30,834
What?

76
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:52,166
Prosecutor Jung.

77
00:04:54,968 --> 00:04:57,368
There was something
I left in Hwan's hand...

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,667
...when I was sending him
to the operation room.

79
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,101
I think it was when he was sixteen...

80
00:05:04,868 --> 00:05:06,769
I gave it to him for his birthday...

81
00:05:08,234 --> 00:05:11,035
...and he made up his mind
when he got that.

82
00:05:14,234 --> 00:05:15,601
He said he wanted to become a writer...

83
00:05:19,634 --> 00:05:20,701
I...

84
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:25,335
...could never forgive the person...

85
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:28,302
...who ruined his dream.

86
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:38,202
Don't worry.

87
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:42,135
I'll make sure he's pronounced guilty
in the trial.

88
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:57,368
I'll work on the main artery now.

89
00:06:17,734 --> 00:06:21,034
The time of death is June 2nd, 5:17 PM.

90
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:23,700
We'll begin the organ transplant.

91
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:41,435
We'll begin the transplant.

92
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,435
Forceps.

93
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:44,402
We'll control the bleeding.

94
00:07:40,534 --> 00:07:43,734
"Knocking on Heaven's Door"

95
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:48,367
"There's only one title in heaven,
it's the sea."

96
00:07:59,434 --> 00:08:00,368
Hongjoo.

97
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:02,567
Wootak.

98
00:08:02,934 --> 00:08:03,835
Are you on your way to work?

99
00:08:03,934 --> 00:08:04,568
Yes.

100
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:06,734
Get on. I'll give you a ride.

101
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:08,834
It's okay. I'll get there pretty soon
by bus, too.

102
00:08:10,501 --> 00:08:13,102
Get in, it'll be even faster.

103
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:14,467
Although I declined...

104
00:08:14,534 --> 00:08:16,068
...but I was hoping you wouldn't leave.

105
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:21,500
Can I charge my portable charger?
Do you have the cable?

106
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:22,901
Yes, here.

107
00:08:23,267 --> 00:08:26,235
Wootak, did you have
any dreams about this trial?

108
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:27,634
No, I didn't.

109
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,968
I thought you said you had a dream
where Jaechan won the trial?

110
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:34,067
I didn't. It was a lie.

111
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:35,068
What?

112
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:37,101
Why did you lie about that?

113
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,500
He looked so discouraged,
so I wanted to encourage him.

114
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:46,801
Perhaps I went overboard.

115
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:48,935
He'll get mad if he finds out, right?

116
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:52,267
I told you, if you can cover it up
until the end then it's not a lie.

117
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:59,934
If I become a murderer then I'll
reveal all your secrets to the police.

118
00:09:07,601 --> 00:09:09,801
Have you lied like this before?

119
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,101
A lie that you covered until the end?

120
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,867
Nope. Never.

121
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,734
You don't have to wear
that for the trial tomorrow.

122
00:09:21,834 --> 00:09:23,001
I already told the detention center.

123
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,968
That's a relief.

124
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,034
Because of Lee Hwan, that crazy jerk...

125
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:32,034
You have such foul-mouth
for Korea's representative write.

126
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:37,701
I'm being accused as a murderer
because of that jerk...

127
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:40,568
Well...

128
00:09:41,534 --> 00:09:43,502
You do deserve to be called a murderer.

129
00:09:44,868 --> 00:09:47,469
After you strangled
your teaching assistant...

130
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:53,534
...you pushed that poor, unconscious guy
down the elevator...

131
00:09:54,267 --> 00:09:55,701
...with the intent to kill him.

132
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,034
"Charge: Murder"

133
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:01,501
That's why you're charged with murder.

134
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:04,301
And you are a murderer.

135
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,567
You said you'll make me innocent.

136
00:10:11,734 --> 00:10:12,834
I will.

137
00:10:14,501 --> 00:10:17,534
But, don't forget what kind
of crime you've committed.

138
00:10:17,634 --> 00:10:21,701
That way it'll be worth
the expensive fee of hiring me.

139
00:10:23,534 --> 00:10:27,168
Is it really possible to make me innocent?

140
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:30,801
It could've been difficult if
you were charged with homicide...

141
00:10:31,267 --> 00:10:34,068
...but thanks to the prosecutor,
he charged you with murder.

142
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:37,334
It's easier to set you free when
you've been charged with murder.

143
00:10:37,934 --> 00:10:40,768
He can get out of it if you
charge him with murder.

144
00:10:40,868 --> 00:10:42,616
I charged him with murder
because he killed a person.

145
00:10:42,701 --> 00:10:43,901
What else should I charge him with?

146
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,582
Sir, you also agreed with that.

147
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:50,234
It's very difficult to prove
a murder charge in trial.

148
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,101
We haven't even done much preparation...

149
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,034
...and if he was found guilty
it can become a big issue...

150
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:57,115
...so maybe it's safer
to change the charge.

151
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,068
Charge him for injury or assault.

152
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:01,534
I can't. This is clearly a murder.

153
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:02,868
Why are you so reckless?

154
00:11:02,968 --> 00:11:04,313
Do you have something to back that up?

155
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,901
Yes, I do.

156
00:11:06,634 --> 00:11:10,101
What if he gets reckless
because of my dream?

157
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:13,101
He won't be unreasonable
because of that, right?

158
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:15,401
No way.

159
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:18,902
What are you looking for?

160
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,801
I don't see my portable charger.

161
00:11:21,267 --> 00:11:22,601
Maybe it fell under my seat.

162
00:11:22,701 --> 00:11:24,868
Wait. I'll look for it.

163
00:11:26,234 --> 00:11:27,102
It's okay.

164
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,001
I have another one so you can
give it to me later if you find it.

165
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,333
It's a red one this big.

166
00:11:30,767 --> 00:11:31,482
Okay.

167
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:32,401
Bye.

168
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:33,767
Hongjoo.

169
00:11:34,901 --> 00:11:36,735
Don't worry too much about Jaechan.

170
00:11:36,834 --> 00:11:38,435
I've been investigated by him before.

171
00:11:38,634 --> 00:11:41,401
He's very trustworthy and careful.

172
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,934
I know that he's careful.

173
00:11:45,868 --> 00:11:48,369
Mr. Jung, you're too careless.

174
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,734
It's like you're on the express way
without wearing a seat belt.

175
00:11:51,834 --> 00:11:53,635
You should wear your seat belt first.

176
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,364
Charge him with murder,
but put assault as preliminary charge.

177
00:11:57,434 --> 00:11:59,168
That's too pathetic.

178
00:11:59,234 --> 00:12:01,968
Preliminary charges are known as
a charge that the prosecutor...

179
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:04,601
...is letting the judge know that
he's not confident with the case.

180
00:12:06,968 --> 00:12:09,936
I'm going to charge him
with murder no matter what.

181
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:14,634
Prosecutor Jung will definitely
charge you for murder.

182
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:18,883
Why is a murder charge
easier to set me free?

183
00:12:18,968 --> 00:12:21,635
The difference between a murder
and homicide is simple.

184
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:25,035
It's a murder if you pushed him
thinking that the person would die.

185
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:28,301
And if you thought that
he might not die...

186
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,467
...then it's not a murder.

187
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:32,867
It's much harder to prove
a murder charge than homicide.

188
00:12:32,968 --> 00:12:35,302
If he can't prove that,
then you'll be set free.

189
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:39,202
Whether or not Prosecutor Jung
can prove your murder...

190
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,001
...I'm also curious.

191
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:49,740
The accused, Moon Taemin,
is a professor at Myungwon University.

192
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:53,301
The victim, Lee Hwan,
worked as Moon's assistant.

193
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:55,701
The accused made his assistants,
including the victim...

194
00:12:55,767 --> 00:12:57,549
...do his personal work
such as tutoring his children...

195
00:12:57,634 --> 00:12:59,734
...washing his car,
helping him on his moving day...

196
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:01,501
...or even running his personal errands.

197
00:13:01,634 --> 00:13:03,934
He even assaulted his assistants...

198
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,867
...when he didn't like their
attitudes towards their work.

199
00:13:05,968 --> 00:13:09,602
On 2016, May 30th at 4 PM...

200
00:13:09,701 --> 00:13:12,502
...the accused assaulted the assistant
at his publication event...

201
00:13:12,601 --> 00:13:14,569
...because he was holding a grudge
against the assistant...

202
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:15,734
...who reported him for assault...

203
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:18,401
...and exploitation of labor and called
him separately and assaulted him.

204
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,001
The victim, Lee Hwan...

205
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,901
...revealed the accused's picture
without his permission that day.

206
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:32,500
The accused claims that his
assault is a justifiable act.

207
00:13:32,601 --> 00:13:34,202
In the process of assault...

208
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,533
...the accused strangled the victim
and made him unconscious.

209
00:13:37,634 --> 00:13:40,201
This fact led the accused
to murder the victim...

210
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,700
...thinking when people found out...

211
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:44,669
...about what happened
he would lose everything.

212
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:47,767
I agree that there was minor
bickering and physical fights.

213
00:13:47,934 --> 00:13:49,301
But, the victim was too drunk...

214
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:52,734
...to have a proper conversation
on the day of the incident.

215
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:55,934
That is why the accused
left the scene right after.

216
00:13:57,067 --> 00:14:00,367
The accused pushed the victim
who was unconscious...

217
00:14:00,434 --> 00:14:03,168
...through the gap on the bottom of
the elevator and the victim...

218
00:14:03,234 --> 00:14:04,301
...fell from about 20 meters.

219
00:14:04,434 --> 00:14:07,534
Three days after the incident,
on 2016, June 2nd at 5:17 PM...

220
00:14:07,634 --> 00:14:10,502
...the accused has led the victim to die.

221
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:13,801
After the accused left the scene,
the victim couldn't hold his anger...

222
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:16,869
...and kicked the elevator
door and made a scene.

223
00:14:17,601 --> 00:14:22,302
And this made him fall between
the elevator door on his own.

224
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,834
I hereby charge him with murder...

225
00:14:25,934 --> 00:14:30,101
...according to
Criminal Article 250 of Section 1.

226
00:14:32,734 --> 00:14:35,201
The accused not only doesn't
have any motive to kill the victim...

227
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,700
...but there isn't any direct
proof to prove that...

228
00:14:38,968 --> 00:14:41,302
...the accused killed the victim.
So, I hereby deny the charge.

229
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,934
"Criminal facts subject to judgement"

230
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:53,334
Attorney, please go
through all the evidence.

231
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,135
"To inspect evidence
submitted by prosecutor for trial"

232
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,134
Evidence number 34, disagree.

233
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:01,901
Evidence number 43, disagree.

234
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,701
Evidence 43 is a testimony by
a witness, and yet you disagree?

235
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:07,301
Yes, I disagree.

236
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:09,802
He's the only witness to this case...

237
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:12,168
...but he's only
a 4 years and 9 months old kid.

238
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,367
It's very doubtful that this
kid could testify logically.

239
00:15:17,534 --> 00:15:20,667
So, there is a need for us
to hear from the witness.

240
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:45,701
You're not going home?

241
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:48,368
You should go first...

242
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:51,801
There's something I need to take care of.

243
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:52,867
Okay, then.

244
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:54,968
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

245
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:08,034
Can a five years old kid
testify in a trial?

246
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:12,001
Gosh. This is a problem since
he'll be scared to even talk.

247
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,901
That kid has a lot of fears.

248
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,934
He even cried and peed his
pants when I rescued him.

249
00:16:17,033 --> 00:16:19,033
That kid is the only witness, right?

250
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:20,934
Wouldn't the accused be free
if there's no testimony from the witness?

251
00:16:21,367 --> 00:16:23,235
I have to get his
testimony no matter what.

252
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,067
You said you heard from the kid
at the patrol yourself, right?

253
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:28,634
Yes, I did.

254
00:16:28,734 --> 00:16:30,034
How?

255
00:16:30,234 --> 00:16:32,735
Wasn't the kid scared
at the patrol as well?

256
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:34,849
I spoke to him by putting myself
in his shoes...

257
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:37,401
...and approached him by
communing with his emotions.

258
00:16:37,501 --> 00:16:38,868
Then, he testified.

259
00:16:38,968 --> 00:16:41,335
Communing with emotions...

260
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:44,268
How do you do that? Can you teach me?

261
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:53,401
Why were you scared of that guy?

262
00:16:53,467 --> 00:16:56,301
If you tell me, I'll punish him for you.

263
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:01,234
Talking like a kid...

264
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,534
Can you ask the witness
like that at the court?

265
00:17:04,634 --> 00:17:05,701
Why would I do that?

266
00:17:05,801 --> 00:17:08,101
I can just call his guardian
or the child's psychologist.

267
00:17:08,267 --> 00:17:09,001
My gosh.

268
00:17:09,701 --> 00:17:11,101
Mother, where should I put this?

269
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,701
Mother? Just call me as you used to.

270
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:16,935
That's enough. You should all go to work.
Hurry up and go.

271
00:17:18,501 --> 00:17:20,768
-Okay.
-Thank you for the food.

272
00:17:21,334 --> 00:17:23,968
Go ahead, I'm going to sew a button on
before I leave.

273
00:17:31,534 --> 00:17:33,701
Mom, have you seen the sewing basket?

274
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:45,901
Why is this...

275
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,500
Hongjoo, Prosecutor Jung forgot his phone.

276
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:55,300
Mom, why is this here?

277
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:02,101
Did you hide this on purpose?

278
00:18:03,067 --> 00:18:03,768
Yes.

279
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,167
But... Why?

280
00:18:08,868 --> 00:18:12,602
By the way, the kid
really likes Santa Claus.

281
00:18:12,701 --> 00:18:15,801
He testified well when I told
him that I'm Santa's friend.

282
00:18:15,968 --> 00:18:16,802
Santa Claus?

283
00:18:16,901 --> 00:18:19,368
No, not Santa Clause, but Santa Grandpa.

284
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:22,948
I'm more like an anchor style.

285
00:18:23,033 --> 00:18:24,600
I actually can't make sounds like that.

286
00:18:24,701 --> 00:18:26,249
Why can't you?

287
00:18:26,334 --> 00:18:28,901
My Robin, did you poo? Did it feel good?

288
00:18:28,968 --> 00:18:31,469
I can do it... Did you eat?

289
00:18:31,534 --> 00:18:32,768
Was it good?

290
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:35,968
Seungwon is good. You can't do this?

291
00:18:36,067 --> 00:18:37,434
Yes, not at all.

292
00:18:39,801 --> 00:18:40,769
My phone.

293
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:42,367
I think you left it inside.

294
00:18:44,234 --> 00:18:45,468
I'm seriously out of it.

295
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:50,834
He can do it.

296
00:18:50,934 --> 00:18:51,635
Really?

297
00:18:51,734 --> 00:18:53,867
He can perfectly do it.

298
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,267
Tell me.

299
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:58,202
Why are you so mean to
Jaechan these days?

300
00:18:58,534 --> 00:19:01,268
What did he do wrong
that you're so cold to him?

301
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:05,568
You said you met him at
the funeral 13 years ago.

302
00:19:05,934 --> 00:19:07,701
Are you okay when you see him?

303
00:19:07,767 --> 00:19:09,268
I'm not.

304
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:11,767
I'm trying to forget about your dad...

305
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,334
...but whenever I see Prosecutor Jung,
he reminds me of that incident.

306
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:16,202
I'm like this, but are you okay?

307
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,333
Yes, I'm fine.

308
00:19:19,434 --> 00:19:21,335
No, you're not fine.

309
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:24,068
What did you say last time
when Prosecutor Jung passed out?

310
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:27,001
You said you
couldn't change anything...

311
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:31,934
...and was crying your eyes out in case
the same thing happened to him like Dad.

312
00:19:44,634 --> 00:19:47,667
Others may not know, but I know.

313
00:19:47,934 --> 00:19:50,535
I can tell what you're thinking of.

314
00:19:51,033 --> 00:19:53,667
Your dad passing away and
Prosecutor Jung's accident...

315
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:55,867
You're blaming yourself
and suffering from it.

316
00:19:56,234 --> 00:19:59,202
You're going to continue
to blame yourself and suffer...

317
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:00,801
And get hurt again...

318
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:02,401
That's what you'll most probably do.

319
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:04,569
Mom.

320
00:20:04,634 --> 00:20:09,435
I'm afraid that you'll get hurt
meeting Prosecutor Jung again...

321
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:11,133
I'm worried.

322
00:20:13,634 --> 00:20:14,535
So...

323
00:20:15,934 --> 00:20:16,868
Mom.

324
00:20:19,267 --> 00:20:20,868
I'm really fine.

325
00:20:23,434 --> 00:20:25,501
I feel good thanks to him.

326
00:20:25,868 --> 00:20:27,769
I'm happy thanks to him.

327
00:20:29,434 --> 00:20:30,968
So, please don't do this.

328
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:35,168
Please like him like how I do.

329
00:20:37,067 --> 00:20:38,301
Please be nice to him.

330
00:20:50,033 --> 00:20:52,166
Hongjoo, have you seen my phone?

331
00:20:56,334 --> 00:20:57,768
Yes, here.

332
00:20:58,801 --> 00:21:01,568
You must be really out of it.

333
00:21:24,634 --> 00:21:26,968
13 years ago, to me...

334
00:21:27,968 --> 00:21:29,268
...you're a scar...

335
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,534
...and a wound to me.

336
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,834
I thought it'd be fine
if I just ignored it.

337
00:21:37,934 --> 00:21:42,001
But I guess I'm not fine
seeing how hurt I am.

338
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,067
Wow, the beach is so pretty here.

339
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:53,067
I wonder if it'll look like
this if I took a picture.

340
00:21:58,434 --> 00:21:59,402
What's wrong?

341
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:01,402
Are you worried about the trial today?

342
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:06,085
No, I have a witness and autopsy results.

343
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:07,968
The witness is a five years old kid...

344
00:22:08,067 --> 00:22:10,434
...and the autopsy result isn't clear
because of the organ transplant.

345
00:22:10,534 --> 00:22:13,968
True, but I have your
dream I can depend on.

346
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:18,201
You should still not be so careless.

347
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,867
Don't worry. I won't be.

348
00:22:19,934 --> 00:22:21,234
You shouldn't.

349
00:22:21,534 --> 00:22:22,667
If you do...

350
00:22:24,567 --> 00:22:26,767
...I'm going to punish you.

351
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:43,001
"Trial in process"

352
00:22:44,534 --> 00:22:46,101
We'll ask the witness.

353
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,200
Hello, Lim Seyong.
Can you hear me?

354
00:22:55,601 --> 00:22:56,402
Yes.

355
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,967
A cop rescued you before, right?

356
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:03,001
Can you tell us what you told him
the other day?

357
00:23:05,434 --> 00:23:06,701
No.

358
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:11,434
He's so young.
How can he testify like that?

359
00:23:11,534 --> 00:23:14,634
Lim Seyong, you have to tell us...

360
00:23:14,934 --> 00:23:16,268
Mom.

361
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:23,034
It looks like it'll be difficult
to get his testimony...

362
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:25,334
We can try again after
he calms down a bit.

363
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:28,668
We'll get back to the defense
attorney for the cross-examination.

364
00:23:28,767 --> 00:23:32,568
No, I think I can question now
since it's not regarding the accident.

365
00:23:33,133 --> 00:23:33,900
Really?

366
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,667
Can the defense attorney
start the cross-examination?

367
00:23:38,801 --> 00:23:39,468
Sure.

368
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,767
It's really scary here, right?

369
00:23:57,033 --> 00:23:58,534
You must be wanting to go home.

370
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,934
Yes.

371
00:24:00,133 --> 00:24:02,467
What did you take to come here today?

372
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,601
The bus.

373
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:05,801
Which bus?

374
00:24:06,367 --> 00:24:08,301
I don't remember.

375
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,767
You can go home if you can
tell me which bus you took...

376
00:24:13,175 --> 00:24:14,400
You still don't remember?

377
00:24:14,968 --> 00:24:18,001
I remember.
It was bus number 6.

378
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:20,469
Can Seyong's mother answer as well?

379
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:22,967
Did you take bus number 6 today?

380
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,419
No, we took number 433.

381
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:31,601
Seyong, did you just lie?

382
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:33,334
I don't know.

383
00:24:34,367 --> 00:24:36,400
How can the kid testify
when he's only five years old?

384
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:37,302
That's all for me.

385
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,767
How can the kid testify?

386
00:24:47,367 --> 00:24:50,268
He's made the kid into a liar in seconds.

387
00:24:50,467 --> 00:24:51,701
He's our only witness...

388
00:24:51,801 --> 00:24:54,602
...but it's over if we impeach
the testimony like that.

389
00:24:56,434 --> 00:24:59,701
Prosecutor, will you do
any additional interrogation?

390
00:24:59,868 --> 00:25:00,502
Yes.

391
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,824
Your Honor, for communing with
the witness with his emotions...

392
00:25:08,901 --> 00:25:12,001
...I'll have to proceed without
having to use any law terms.

393
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,601
Sure, go ahead.

394
00:25:32,934 --> 00:25:34,835
Lim Seyong!

395
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:40,301
I'm a friend of Santa Grandpa.
You know Santa Claus, right?

396
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:45,735
Yes, but are you really his friend?

397
00:25:45,834 --> 00:25:48,497
This uniform is for Santa's friends...

398
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:53,068
...and I can fly wearing this
uniform during Christmas.

399
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:55,401
What is he doing?

400
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,801
Oh my gosh...

401
00:26:00,367 --> 00:26:01,801
Wow.

402
00:26:01,868 --> 00:26:05,602
You would never lie to
Santa Claus, would you?

403
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,834
No.

404
00:26:07,215 --> 00:26:09,849
Then, you wouldn't lie to me
since I'm Santa's friend...

405
00:26:09,934 --> 00:26:11,435
...and tell the truth, right?

406
00:26:13,133 --> 00:26:13,934
Yes.

407
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,534
You drew this picture
before for the cop, right?

408
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,101
Yes.

409
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:21,534
Wow. You did such a great job.

410
00:26:21,801 --> 00:26:25,135
Do you remember what
this man told this guy?

411
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:27,401
Yes, I remember.

412
00:26:27,567 --> 00:26:30,401
Before I interrogate,
let's all hear from evidence number 67...

413
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:34,369
...which was recorded on the victim's
phone and compare it to the testimony.

414
00:26:34,701 --> 00:26:37,268
Your Honor, if we hear the evidence now...

415
00:26:37,367 --> 00:26:39,400
...the child may repeat it.

416
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:42,001
No, maybe he already heard it.

417
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,400
We'll listen to the kid testifying first
and then listen to the evidence.

418
00:26:45,485 --> 00:26:48,467
And this recorded file was found
during the prosecutor's investigation...

419
00:26:48,534 --> 00:26:51,368
...and it'll be Seyong's
first time hearing this.

420
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,100
You may continue with interrogation.

421
00:26:55,701 --> 00:26:57,302
Now, Seyong...

422
00:26:57,901 --> 00:27:01,235
What did this man say to this guy?

423
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:08,202
He pushed him and
asked him if he was drunk.

424
00:27:11,267 --> 00:27:12,749
Are you drunk?

425
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:14,702
Your drunk behaviors cannot be forgiven!

426
00:27:17,567 --> 00:27:19,700
Then, what did this guy say?

427
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,834
He said he didn't need something.

428
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,200
And he said he learned
how to clean his shoes.

429
00:27:28,501 --> 00:27:30,135
I don't need to debut as a writer.

430
00:27:30,434 --> 00:27:32,335
I haven't learned anything besides
cleaning your shoes and cars.

431
00:27:32,434 --> 00:27:33,834
So what's the point of debuting?

432
00:27:34,467 --> 00:27:35,834
It's similar.

433
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,767
Now we have the witness's testimony...

434
00:27:38,868 --> 00:27:40,268
Now, the evidence on murder.

435
00:27:41,234 --> 00:27:44,102
We're almost done.

436
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,734
What happened to these two after that?

437
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:52,935
The man in gray grabbed the other
guy's neck and pushed him.

438
00:27:53,601 --> 00:27:56,901
It made a loud noise and pushed him.

439
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:01,068
How was the guy in the white?

440
00:28:01,501 --> 00:28:04,068
He suddenly fell asleep.

441
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,834
He fell asleep?

442
00:28:06,033 --> 00:28:10,033
So what did the man in gray do to
the guy in white who fell asleep?

443
00:28:11,067 --> 00:28:15,334
He pushed him down the elevator.

444
00:28:16,701 --> 00:28:18,768
He purposely pushed him down...

445
00:28:19,267 --> 00:28:20,001
That's done.

446
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,168
That's all.

447
00:28:27,801 --> 00:28:29,502
Santa's friend.

448
00:28:31,367 --> 00:28:32,567
So embarrassing.

449
00:28:35,501 --> 00:28:36,832
Walk slowly.

450
00:28:36,901 --> 00:28:39,034
You may actually end up flying.

451
00:28:39,868 --> 00:28:41,335
What is it?

452
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:45,801
How did you pull of Santa Grandpa
with that personality of yours?

453
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,533
You're trying really hard.

454
00:28:51,133 --> 00:28:52,333
Of course.

455
00:28:52,934 --> 00:28:55,501
The accused is trying to get away...

456
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:56,935
So, being Santa isn't a big deal.

457
00:28:57,467 --> 00:28:58,667
I can do more.

458
00:28:58,734 --> 00:28:59,767
What more?

459
00:29:00,234 --> 00:29:01,701
Can I see it next time?

460
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:02,868
Of course...

461
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:06,767
It's rare to have an autopsy and
organ transplant at the same time.

462
00:29:06,868 --> 00:29:08,102
There's a lot if you search for it.

463
00:29:08,167 --> 00:29:09,101
Did you search everywhere?

464
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,434
I did.

465
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:11,233
I'm looking forward to it.

466
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:12,768
Yes, go ahead.

467
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:26,166
Welcome.

468
00:29:28,067 --> 00:29:29,501
Hey, Jung Seungwon.

469
00:29:30,901 --> 00:29:32,735
Myung Daegoo...

470
00:29:32,968 --> 00:29:34,135
You work here?

471
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:35,600
You live around here?

472
00:29:35,701 --> 00:29:36,435
Yes.

473
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:41,296
Can I have 10ml trash bags
and food recycling bags in 2L?

474
00:29:41,367 --> 00:29:42,801
10 pieces each.

475
00:29:43,167 --> 00:29:44,601
Are you running errands for your mom?

476
00:29:44,901 --> 00:29:47,602
No, my parents passed away...

477
00:29:47,701 --> 00:29:51,402
...and I take care of the house since
my brother is the house destroyer.

478
00:29:51,601 --> 00:29:52,601
Charge me for this as well.

479
00:29:54,868 --> 00:29:57,302
Does your brother come here often?

480
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,567
If a tall and normal-looking guy
who acts like a kid comes by...

481
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:01,734
...that's my brother.

482
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:02,702
Be careful.

483
00:30:05,133 --> 00:30:06,200
Hey, Seungwon...

484
00:30:06,968 --> 00:30:07,602
Yes?

485
00:30:07,834 --> 00:30:11,802
Can you ask your brother
to meet with my father?

486
00:30:12,434 --> 00:30:13,801
Your father?

487
00:30:13,901 --> 00:30:15,268
You should get closer to Seungwon.

488
00:30:15,367 --> 00:30:16,567
His brother is a prosecutor.

489
00:30:16,634 --> 00:30:17,535
Who knows?

490
00:30:17,634 --> 00:30:20,301
His brother may get your
father out of the prison.

491
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,734
Oh, about that...

492
00:30:24,601 --> 00:30:27,768
He's going through a lot because
of an important trial right now.

493
00:30:28,601 --> 00:30:30,402
I see.

494
00:30:32,234 --> 00:30:33,868
Then, just pretend you didn't
hear anything from me.

495
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:35,735
I said something I shouldn't have.

496
00:30:40,801 --> 00:30:42,201
I'm home.

497
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,168
You're home?

498
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,434
What's with the stool?

499
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,334
I was putting it away since I thought
I wouldn't need this anymore.

500
00:30:49,734 --> 00:30:52,249
Then, we won't have enough
chairs for tomorrow's breakfast.

501
00:30:52,334 --> 00:30:54,434
Tell everyone to eat at their own homes.

502
00:30:54,834 --> 00:30:55,635
Why?

503
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,500
I'm tired.

504
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:02,834
It's uncomfortable seeing Prosecutor Jung.

505
00:31:05,701 --> 00:31:06,734
Mom.

506
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,567
Mother, Mother, I peed on my own.

507
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:20,201
The pee just came out.

508
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,433
Really?

509
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,067
Good job.

510
00:31:26,901 --> 00:31:29,835
I'm so proud of you, my prince.

511
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:35,868
Grandma will be here in 30 minutes.
Can you stay here by yourself?

512
00:31:35,934 --> 00:31:36,601
Yes.

513
00:31:39,234 --> 00:31:44,901
Chanho, there's so many
people we need to be thankful for.

514
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
There's so many people
that we're indebted to.

515
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,434
Yes, we should hurry and repay
them back for their generosity.

516
00:31:51,501 --> 00:31:53,002
I'm fine now.

517
00:32:01,501 --> 00:32:02,668
Hey, it's me...

518
00:32:02,767 --> 00:32:03,800
Where are you?

519
00:32:03,901 --> 00:32:06,602
I'm on my way to your
house for breakfast.

520
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:09,468
I'm sorry, but I think we'll
have to skip breakfast today.

521
00:32:10,234 --> 00:32:10,868
Why?

522
00:32:10,968 --> 00:32:14,402
My mom said it'll be difficult due to
her restaurant work for the time being.

523
00:32:14,567 --> 00:32:15,301
Okay.

524
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:18,402
By the way, I found your portable charger.

525
00:32:18,601 --> 00:32:19,202
What?

526
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,282
The portable charger that
you left in my car last time.

527
00:32:21,367 --> 00:32:22,301
The red one.

528
00:32:23,801 --> 00:32:25,735
Oh, that...

529
00:32:26,167 --> 00:32:27,467
I'll give it to you next time I see you.

530
00:32:27,801 --> 00:32:29,669
They said it's going to rain today,
so don't forget your umbrella.

531
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:30,967
Okay.

532
00:32:47,234 --> 00:32:49,349
What are you doing here?
Were you waiting for us?

533
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:51,634
I felt like having brunch outside today.

534
00:32:51,734 --> 00:32:52,602
Let's go.

535
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:55,567
I just want to eat at your place.
I don't like brunches.

536
00:32:57,734 --> 00:32:59,801
You do like brunches.
Let's just eat brunch.

537
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,467
Let's go eat brunch.

538
00:33:01,534 --> 00:33:03,035
What time's the trial today?

539
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:05,001
2 PM. Why?
Are you going to come and watch?

540
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,434
Of course. It's the final trial.

541
00:33:07,834 --> 00:33:10,735
I have to watch and see if the slow
turtle can catch the rabbits.

542
00:33:11,234 --> 00:33:11,935
Let's go.

543
00:33:12,267 --> 00:33:13,901
Did you bring your umbrella?
It's going to rain today.

544
00:33:13,968 --> 00:33:14,735
Of course.

545
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,867
Can you let go of this?

546
00:33:17,367 --> 00:33:20,315
Attorney Lee disagreed to
the autopsy results, right?

547
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,400
Yes, so I have to interrogate
the doctor who conducted the autopsy.

548
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:25,117
I've never seen anyone
disagree to the autopsy results.

549
00:33:25,234 --> 00:33:26,883
It looks like he's going to
point out the fault...

550
00:33:26,968 --> 00:33:28,869
...for conducting the autopsy
after the organ transplant.

551
00:33:28,968 --> 00:33:32,135
Yoobum is playing it so dirty.

552
00:33:32,934 --> 00:33:37,334
Prosecutor Jung, let's go
to the trial together today.

553
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,734
I'll question the autopsy doctor myself.

554
00:33:39,801 --> 00:33:40,635
Why?

555
00:33:42,267 --> 00:33:44,834
I can't stand him playing it dirty.

556
00:33:45,968 --> 00:33:46,849
Would that be okay?

557
00:33:46,934 --> 00:33:49,912
Yes, I will feel so much
better if you joined me.

558
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,816
Thank you.

559
00:33:50,901 --> 00:33:53,835
No, I'm thankful.

560
00:33:54,901 --> 00:33:56,001
Why?

561
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,934
I'm so grateful for you these days too.

562
00:34:01,701 --> 00:34:03,402
You're so good.

563
00:34:21,968 --> 00:34:26,001
Did you write the autopsy
results yourself?

564
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:26,834
Yes.

565
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:29,834
According to the autopsy results,
what was the cause of death?

566
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:32,334
The cause of death is the exterior
shock on the brain of the victim...

567
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,800
...that led to excessive bleeding
on the arachnoid membrane.

568
00:34:34,901 --> 00:34:38,435
The autopsy was conducted
right after the organ transplant.

569
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,135
How was that possible?

570
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,901
When the victim arrived at
the hospital right after the accident...

571
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,901
...he didn't have any other injuries
except for a cerebral hemorrhage...

572
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,267
...and several fractures.

573
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,601
And when we put him
through the CT and MRI scan...

574
00:34:48,701 --> 00:34:51,569
...before the organ transplant,
the other organs looked perfectly fine.

575
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:54,368
So we excluded organ damage
as the cause of death...

576
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,634
...and conducted the autopsy right
after the organ transplant.

577
00:34:56,834 --> 00:34:58,834
By any chance, is it possible...

578
00:34:58,934 --> 00:35:02,601
...for the autopsy results to have changed
due to the organ transplant?

579
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:04,235
No, that's impossible.

580
00:35:08,234 --> 00:35:09,701
Her strategy is good.

581
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,734
She wants to lead the game...

582
00:35:11,801 --> 00:35:13,901
...by asking the same questions
before the attorney does.

583
00:35:15,934 --> 00:35:17,735
According to the autopsy results...

584
00:35:17,834 --> 00:35:20,834
...the right thyroid cartilage
was fractured.

585
00:35:21,133 --> 00:35:22,500
What does this mean?

586
00:35:22,701 --> 00:35:26,368
Thyroid cartilage is what
covers up the vocal cords like this...

587
00:35:26,434 --> 00:35:30,434
...and can get fractured when
someone strangles another.

588
00:35:30,501 --> 00:35:33,668
What if it got fractured because
the person fell by himself?

589
00:35:33,767 --> 00:35:36,234
Like a person gets drunk and falls down.

590
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,534
It's rare for the thyroid cartilage
cannot get fractured from a simple fall.

591
00:35:38,634 --> 00:35:42,068
But what if we assume that
the victim's thyroid cartilage...

592
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:44,834
...got fractured from the fall,
like the attorney's argument?

593
00:35:45,367 --> 00:35:48,335
If that's the case...

594
00:35:48,434 --> 00:35:50,501
...the fracture should've
occurred around the jaw...

595
00:35:50,601 --> 00:35:52,768
...and cervical spine as well,
but it wasn't the case.

596
00:35:53,267 --> 00:35:56,400
The most important part is that
we found blood stains...

597
00:35:56,601 --> 00:35:58,302
...around the thyroid cartilage...

598
00:35:58,467 --> 00:36:02,401
This means the stains only appear
when it's pressured by two hands.

599
00:36:02,968 --> 00:36:04,469
This is also cleared.

600
00:36:04,901 --> 00:36:08,869
Then, the autopsy results tell us
that the victim passed away...

601
00:36:08,968 --> 00:36:12,001
...because someone strangled
his neck and was unconscious...

602
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,534
...and he fell down the elevator
door in that condition.

603
00:36:13,601 --> 00:36:16,435
And this led to his death from
the exterior shock and bleeding.

604
00:36:16,868 --> 00:36:17,868
Is this correct?

605
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:19,535
Yes, that's correct.

606
00:36:20,434 --> 00:36:21,467
That'll be all.

607
00:36:36,501 --> 00:36:38,935
Defense attorney,
please start the cross-examination.

608
00:36:39,968 --> 00:36:40,735
Okay.

609
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,234
Now.

610
00:36:49,801 --> 00:36:53,168
When was the victim
diagnosed with brain death?

611
00:36:53,234 --> 00:36:57,102
It was on 2016, June 2nd at 8:30 AM.

612
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,367
Then, when did his heart actually stop?

613
00:37:00,467 --> 00:37:04,068
It was on 2016, June 2nd at 5:17 PM.

614
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:06,001
There's about 9 hour difference.

615
00:37:06,534 --> 00:37:09,601
Then, how did you decide
on his time of death?

616
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
When we were trying do
his heart transplant...

617
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,801
...we just recorded that
as his final hour.

618
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:23,601
Then, that hour must be the final hour
recorded on this arraignment, right?

619
00:37:23,767 --> 00:37:24,900
Yes, that's right.

620
00:37:26,901 --> 00:37:27,735
That'll be all.

621
00:37:32,267 --> 00:37:35,235
What? He disagreed to
the evidence just to ask that?

622
00:37:35,501 --> 00:37:36,568
I know...

623
00:37:36,834 --> 00:37:38,134
What's he planning?

624
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,901
The victim's previous life...

625
00:37:53,434 --> 00:37:57,101
...was meaninglessly taken by
a professor who he once admired.

626
00:37:58,133 --> 00:38:01,333
But from the day of
the incident until today's trial...

627
00:38:01,434 --> 00:38:05,467
...the accused denied the charge
and frequently changed his statement...

628
00:38:05,567 --> 00:38:09,535
...in order to cover up his crime and
does not show any form of remorse.

629
00:38:10,133 --> 00:38:14,233
According to
Section 1 of Criminal Law Article 250...

630
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:18,334
...I hereby request for a sentence of
10 years for the accused due to murder.

631
00:38:26,567 --> 00:38:30,001
Next, defense attorney,
please deliver your closing argument.

632
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:33,335
The trial is almost over.

633
00:38:35,968 --> 00:38:40,402
A testimony from a five year old,
autopsy after an organ transplant...

634
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
All of these are still inadequate
to prove that a murder occurred.

635
00:38:46,567 --> 00:38:49,435
Watching this unstable reasoning...

636
00:38:49,901 --> 00:38:52,368
...there's a question that I've
constantly wanted to ask.

637
00:38:54,367 --> 00:38:59,801
Can we actually charge
the accused for murder?

638
00:39:03,434 --> 00:39:06,201
What nonsense is he saying
with that much confidence?

639
00:39:06,501 --> 00:39:09,835
According to the doctor's
statement of the autopsy...

640
00:39:09,934 --> 00:39:14,835
...the victim died
on 2016, June 2nd at 8:30 AM.

641
00:39:15,267 --> 00:39:18,567
And after 9 hours, at 5:17 PM...

642
00:39:18,701 --> 00:39:22,768
...his heart stopped after
the organ transplant.

643
00:39:23,801 --> 00:39:26,235
As we all know,
brain death is not considered...

644
00:39:26,334 --> 00:39:27,801
...as an actual death
according to the criminal law.

645
00:39:27,901 --> 00:39:31,568
The criminal law only recognizes
death when the heart stops beating.

646
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,967
The same applies for
the organ transplant laws as well.

647
00:39:35,901 --> 00:39:39,435
We refer to the family of patient
who died of brain death as a family.

648
00:39:39,601 --> 00:39:41,068
We call them a bereaved family...

649
00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:42,768
...only after the organ transplant
has been completed.

650
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:46,368
No way...

651
00:39:47,767 --> 00:39:55,434
If the victim damaged his brain and
died only after some time has passed...

652
00:39:56,567 --> 00:39:59,282
...then, we can charge
the accused for murder.

653
00:39:59,367 --> 00:40:04,968
But when the victim's brain died,
but his heart hasn't stopped beating.

654
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:09,634
During his organ transplant surgery,
his heart has stopped beating.

655
00:40:12,634 --> 00:40:13,502
No.

656
00:40:15,634 --> 00:40:19,068
The accused was not the one
who stopped his heart from beating.

657
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:20,968
We'll work on the main artery.

658
00:40:22,067 --> 00:40:23,734
It's the doctor who stopped his heart...

659
00:40:23,834 --> 00:40:27,268
...when he started
to work on the main artery.

660
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:32,367
So, the death recognized
by the criminal law was...

661
00:40:32,467 --> 00:40:33,600
...not caused by the accused...

662
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:36,834
...but the doctor
who conducted the surgery.

663
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:42,734
No way.

664
00:40:42,934 --> 00:40:44,535
Therefore, by the criminal law...

665
00:40:44,634 --> 00:40:47,068
...the victim didn't die
because of the accused.

666
00:40:48,434 --> 00:40:50,268
He died because of the organ transplant.

667
00:40:50,734 --> 00:40:52,867
He really has the devil's tongue.

668
00:40:57,634 --> 00:41:01,468
Therefore, we can't charge
the accused for the victim's death...

669
00:41:01,701 --> 00:41:02,935
...and the accused...

670
00:41:05,601 --> 00:41:08,268
...is pleading innocence for murder.

671
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,901
This can't be!

672
00:41:18,067 --> 00:41:20,634
Wait... Who killed my son?

673
00:41:21,834 --> 00:41:22,967
Sir, please calm down.

674
00:41:23,067 --> 00:41:26,234
Wait, are they saying that
the doctor killed my son?

675
00:41:26,601 --> 00:41:29,235
And not that man? Let me go!

676
00:41:29,334 --> 00:41:35,135
No, that's all nonsense, so don't worry.

677
00:41:35,234 --> 00:41:38,068
I'll escort him out.
Sir, please come with me.

678
00:41:38,467 --> 00:41:40,001
Don't worry about this.

679
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:44,400
That prosecutor will tell them
that he's talking nonsense.

680
00:41:44,567 --> 00:41:46,468
Please leave quietly.

681
00:41:46,801 --> 00:41:49,735
He has to understand, so he can leave.

682
00:41:49,834 --> 00:41:54,735
Imagine how he must be feeling.
Why can't we charge him?

683
00:41:54,834 --> 00:42:00,469
If that guy didn't hit his son,
he would be perfectly alive.

684
00:42:00,567 --> 00:42:02,168
The doctor didn't have to do the surgery.

685
00:42:02,534 --> 00:42:03,634
Isn't that right?

686
00:42:06,334 --> 00:42:07,268
Please leave.

687
00:42:13,334 --> 00:42:18,068
She's really brave.
She says whatever she needs to say.

688
00:42:19,501 --> 00:42:20,235
I'm sorry.

689
00:42:21,434 --> 00:42:24,601
Prosecutor, are there any additional
statements you would like to make?

690
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,233
Shall I go?

691
00:42:26,968 --> 00:42:28,335
No, I'll go.

692
00:42:28,801 --> 00:42:30,035
Yes, I do.

693
00:42:34,501 --> 00:42:36,668
Is the law really like this? Is it?

694
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:40,309
Does it make him innocent
because of the organ transplant?

695
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,334
No.

696
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,066
The law is not that loose.

697
00:42:44,167 --> 00:42:46,883
There will be justice.

698
00:42:46,968 --> 00:42:49,368
I shouldn't have agreed
to the organ transplant...

699
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:54,034
Because of me... Gosh.

700
00:42:54,501 --> 00:42:59,168
Sir, this is not your fault at all.

701
00:43:00,934 --> 00:43:02,535
After hearing the attorney's defense...

702
00:43:02,601 --> 00:43:05,935
...the victim's father must be
blaming himself right now.

703
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,001
Goodness.

704
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:09,435
"Because I agreed
to the organ transplant..."

705
00:43:09,534 --> 00:43:11,934
"...the person who killed
my son can't be punished."

706
00:43:12,534 --> 00:43:14,667
"I did something good and
yet it turned out to be bad."

707
00:43:15,133 --> 00:43:17,266
"The law is on the criminal's side."

708
00:43:17,901 --> 00:43:19,301
I'm sure that's what he's thinking about.

709
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,968
The law cannot be like this.

710
00:43:27,834 --> 00:43:29,867
Of course... Of course...

711
00:43:29,934 --> 00:43:31,967
Of course... Of course...

712
00:43:32,567 --> 00:43:35,535
The victim suffered from brain
death because of the accused.

713
00:43:35,601 --> 00:43:38,368
And as the attorney said,
after suffering from brain death...

714
00:43:38,467 --> 00:43:40,268
...if days passed without
going through organ transplant...

715
00:43:40,334 --> 00:43:42,768
...his heart would've stopped
and he would've died.

716
00:43:43,234 --> 00:43:45,102
All brain dead patients end up that way.

717
00:43:45,934 --> 00:43:49,868
But just because the organ transplant
jumped in between his death...

718
00:43:50,067 --> 00:43:51,568
...can the accused be innocent?

719
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,600
It doesn't make sense.

720
00:43:54,234 --> 00:43:58,568
Your son would've died even without
the organ transplant in few days.

721
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
He would've died even without the doctor.

722
00:44:02,434 --> 00:44:06,601
But imagine if the incident where
Mr. Moon hasn't hit your son.

723
00:44:06,734 --> 00:44:12,435
If this incident never happened,
would the victim have died?

724
00:44:13,467 --> 00:44:16,968
It's quite simple to figure
who caused the death.

725
00:44:17,434 --> 00:44:20,734
You can start by removing
the causes that led to the death.

726
00:44:21,133 --> 00:44:23,166
Even if we remove
the doctor out of the equation...

727
00:44:23,267 --> 00:44:25,467
...the victim would've died anyway.

728
00:44:25,567 --> 00:44:29,567
But, the story becomes different
if we remove the accused here.

729
00:44:29,868 --> 00:44:31,782
If the accused did not do what he did...

730
00:44:32,234 --> 00:44:36,301
...the victim wouldn't have died
and have continued to live his life.

731
00:44:38,701 --> 00:44:42,168
Your son's death was not
caused by the organ transplant.

732
00:44:42,434 --> 00:44:44,068
And it's also not because of you.

733
00:44:45,367 --> 00:44:48,567
The person who took away
your son's life is Mr. Moon.

734
00:44:49,267 --> 00:44:50,701
You cannot confuse that fact.

735
00:44:51,367 --> 00:44:53,201
The law shouldn't get confused by that.

736
00:44:53,667 --> 00:44:59,601
The law has to clearly and fairly judge
who is responsible for the crime.

737
00:45:00,767 --> 00:45:04,134
Just because the time of
the death applies new rules to the case...

738
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:06,634
...doesn't mean we can say that
the accused is innocent for his crimes.

739
00:45:06,834 --> 00:45:10,967
Or else, that means we can
also say that there is no justice.

740
00:45:16,033 --> 00:45:19,901
Also, for the sake of victim who gave
new lives to seven others...

741
00:45:20,667 --> 00:45:22,834
...and the bereaved family members
who all agreed to the organ transplant.

742
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:26,469
...we can't let this trial go
in favor of the accused.

743
00:45:28,133 --> 00:45:31,433
That's also not justice.

744
00:45:49,734 --> 00:45:50,535
Please...

745
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,634
It is my sincere hope...

746
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,534
...that the justice and righteousness...

747
00:45:57,701 --> 00:45:59,502
...of the courtroom...

748
00:46:03,801 --> 00:46:04,901
...will be reflected
in this trial as well.

749
00:46:38,667 --> 00:46:41,334
"Trial in process"

750
00:46:43,934 --> 00:46:44,902
Prosecutor Jung.

751
00:46:46,634 --> 00:46:49,767
Thank you so much for today.

752
00:46:50,868 --> 00:46:51,802
No...

753
00:46:52,167 --> 00:46:53,267
I'm the one who's thankful.

754
00:46:54,801 --> 00:46:56,502
Thanks to you...

755
00:46:57,901 --> 00:47:00,201
...I think I'll be able
to sleep comfortably.

756
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,268
Thanks.

757
00:47:07,834 --> 00:47:09,368
Thank you so much.

758
00:47:12,133 --> 00:47:13,667
Yes... Well...

759
00:47:14,634 --> 00:47:16,435
Thank you, too.

760
00:47:23,434 --> 00:47:24,501
Thank you.

761
00:47:39,634 --> 00:47:41,068
Is it out of paper towel?

762
00:47:42,133 --> 00:47:43,166
Yes.

763
00:47:43,834 --> 00:47:45,601
Do you want to use my handkerchief?

764
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,233
It's okay.

765
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,800
I'm home.

766
00:48:01,868 --> 00:48:04,868
Hongjoo, I got all your
blankets from your room.

767
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,200
I don't think that's all going
to fit in the washing machine.

768
00:48:08,267 --> 00:48:10,634
I'm going to get it done
at the laundry place.

769
00:48:11,667 --> 00:48:12,501
Mom.

770
00:48:13,701 --> 00:48:15,734
Should I tell them not to come
tomorrow morning for breakfast again?

771
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:16,901
Yes.

772
00:48:19,834 --> 00:48:23,568
Mom, I went to Jaechan's trial today.

773
00:48:25,467 --> 00:48:27,234
After seeing the trial...

774
00:48:27,334 --> 00:48:29,302
...I realized I've been
confused all this time.

775
00:48:31,267 --> 00:48:32,201
About what?

776
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:39,133
Like you said, I thought
Dad died because of me.

777
00:48:39,767 --> 00:48:41,934
Jaechan was also
shot because of me...

778
00:48:43,934 --> 00:48:45,768
So, I was having a hard
time because of that...

779
00:48:47,467 --> 00:48:49,201
But I realized I was wrong
after watching that trial.

780
00:48:49,601 --> 00:48:51,402
I realized why I've been confused
all this time.

781
00:48:56,734 --> 00:48:59,201
Dad died because of
the soldier who ran away.

782
00:48:59,267 --> 00:49:01,800
Jaechan got shot because
Sookyung's father shot him.

783
00:49:02,868 --> 00:49:06,635
Those things would've happened in
those moments even if I wasn't there.

784
00:49:06,934 --> 00:49:07,735
Right?

785
00:49:08,701 --> 00:49:09,602
Yes.

786
00:49:11,434 --> 00:49:14,501
It was someone else's fault all along,
but I didn't know about it.

787
00:49:15,167 --> 00:49:17,001
I was confused for a long time.

788
00:49:21,133 --> 00:49:21,967
So...

789
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,335
...do you feel better now?

790
00:49:24,634 --> 00:49:25,734
You don't blame yourself?

791
00:49:25,934 --> 00:49:27,435
No, I don't.

792
00:49:34,701 --> 00:49:37,435
Goodness. So much laundry to do.

793
00:49:43,056 --> 00:49:43,924
Mother.

794
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,834
I mean, madam.

795
00:49:46,934 --> 00:49:47,802
Hi.

796
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,634
You're doing laundry?

797
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:50,734
Yes.

798
00:49:57,434 --> 00:50:00,101
Others may not know, but I know.

799
00:50:00,701 --> 00:50:03,168
Your Dad's death and
Prosecutor Jung getting shot...

800
00:50:03,267 --> 00:50:05,467
You're struggling because
you're blaming yourself for it.

801
00:50:06,501 --> 00:50:09,868
You're going to continue to
blame yourself, suffer...

802
00:50:09,934 --> 00:50:12,668
...and hurt yourself again and again.
That's what you'll probably do.

803
00:50:18,634 --> 00:50:19,634
Madam.

804
00:50:20,734 --> 00:50:22,034
There's something I'd like to say.

805
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,033
It's not Hongjoo's
fault that I got hurt.

806
00:50:26,534 --> 00:50:28,235
Someone else shot me.

807
00:50:28,801 --> 00:50:29,845
Hongjoo knows that's the truth, too.

808
00:50:29,934 --> 00:50:31,668
-So, she won't be confused about it.
-And she won't be confused about it?

809
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,100
And that she won't blame herself?

810
00:50:34,734 --> 00:50:36,101
How did you know?

811
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,800
Did you guys plan this together?

812
00:50:38,901 --> 00:50:41,568
Did you hear from Hongjoo
that I'd be here and followed me?

813
00:50:41,634 --> 00:50:42,335
No, not at all.

814
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,700
I just came here to do laundry
and happen to see you here...

815
00:50:44,767 --> 00:50:46,468
Don't talk nonsense.

816
00:50:46,567 --> 00:50:48,330
You don't do any chores and...

817
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:54,203
...yet you brought laundry here.
It's not natural at all.

818
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,534
I do a lot of chores, Mother.

819
00:50:57,968 --> 00:50:58,758
No, madam.

820
00:50:58,834 --> 00:51:01,201
I'm sorry for telling you to do
it this way and the other way...

821
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,600
But you can just call me Mother.

822
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:13,468
I'm sorry for being cold.

823
00:51:14,434 --> 00:51:16,834
I know I shouldn't be doing this...

824
00:51:16,934 --> 00:51:19,067
...but a person's heart can
be such a fickle thing.

825
00:51:20,067 --> 00:51:23,401
To protect my kid,
I'm hurting someone else's kid.

826
00:51:24,667 --> 00:51:26,601
I'm sorry for behaving
such a way as an adult.

827
00:51:29,567 --> 00:51:30,767
I'm really sorry.

828
00:51:33,167 --> 00:51:34,701
No, it's totally fine.

829
00:51:34,934 --> 00:51:37,701
Then, will you forgive me?

830
00:51:38,634 --> 00:51:39,667
Yes, Mother.

831
00:51:40,534 --> 00:51:44,513
Thanks for being so good
to her and taking care of her...

832
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,935
No, I'm more thankful, Mother-in...

833
00:51:48,701 --> 00:51:49,968
No, Madam...

834
00:51:51,534 --> 00:51:52,468
Mother.

835
00:51:53,434 --> 00:51:54,268
Come here.

836
00:52:11,133 --> 00:52:12,400
It's a red car.

837
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,001
Whose car is this?

838
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,433
That scared me.

839
00:52:23,534 --> 00:52:26,335
Prosecutor Jung, what are
you doing in front of my car?

840
00:52:26,567 --> 00:52:28,401
Is this your car?

841
00:52:28,467 --> 00:52:33,068
Yes, it's my car.

842
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:37,001
Wow, this is my dream car, red car...

843
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:41,034
Tell me anytime. I'll let you borrow it.

844
00:52:41,234 --> 00:52:42,035
Really?

845
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:42,734
Yes.

846
00:52:42,901 --> 00:52:43,635
Why?

847
00:52:43,734 --> 00:52:47,668
I just checked and
Moon Taemin is charged.

848
00:52:48,367 --> 00:52:51,068
Guilty of murder!
Seven years in prison!

849
00:52:54,667 --> 00:52:56,568
He deserved
the maximum sentence of 10 years.

850
00:52:56,667 --> 00:52:58,268
Seven years is quite a lot.

851
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,934
Good work. And...

852
00:53:02,868 --> 00:53:03,702
...thanks.

853
00:53:05,834 --> 00:53:07,268
You too?

854
00:53:07,667 --> 00:53:09,542
Why is everyone thanking me?

855
00:53:09,634 --> 00:53:12,934
Is a prosecutor doing his job
something to be thankful for?

856
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,367
Of course it is. But I'm just so thankful.

857
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:22,399
Yes. You said you'd let me
borrow it anytime, right?

858
00:53:22,501 --> 00:53:24,026
Yes, why?

859
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,500
Then, now!

860
00:53:27,567 --> 00:53:28,234
Now?

861
00:53:28,334 --> 00:53:29,135
Wow.

862
00:53:29,734 --> 00:53:31,568
-Wow.
-Wow!

863
00:53:35,467 --> 00:53:36,168
The keys.

864
00:53:49,834 --> 00:53:51,034
Can you take your day off?

865
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,267
If we leave now, we can see the ocean
for about an hour and come back.

866
00:54:04,901 --> 00:54:06,968
It's the ocean!

867
00:54:21,934 --> 00:54:24,234
Wow, it's the ocean!

868
00:54:41,767 --> 00:54:44,282
It looks the same.
How did you find it?

869
00:54:44,367 --> 00:54:45,934
I searched everywhere.

870
00:54:46,133 --> 00:54:46,867
How is it?

871
00:54:46,968 --> 00:54:48,402
Is it the same as the ocean
you saw in your dream?

872
00:54:48,501 --> 00:54:49,701
Yes, it's the same.

873
00:54:50,234 --> 00:54:51,135
Lies.

874
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,749
No, seriously.
It's the same.

875
00:54:54,834 --> 00:54:56,301
It's prettier than in my dream.

876
00:54:56,567 --> 00:54:59,001
You didn't have any dream.
I know you were lying.

877
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,834
How did you know?

878
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:06,300
I told you, right?
I'm a human lie detector.

879
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,500
And I can tell you were lying.

880
00:55:08,634 --> 00:55:12,435
You kept telling me not to be careless
and you even came to see the trial.

881
00:55:12,968 --> 00:55:14,933
Your face made it obvious
that you were lying.

882
00:55:15,033 --> 00:55:17,345
Why didn't you say anything
even though you knew?

883
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,500
Why did we come here?

884
00:55:18,601 --> 00:55:20,668
I knew you wanted to.

885
00:55:21,934 --> 00:55:24,435
I can tell that you want me
to win the trial...

886
00:55:25,434 --> 00:55:26,901
...and come to see the ocean.

887
00:55:27,534 --> 00:55:28,634
I worked a bit for it.

888
00:55:29,834 --> 00:55:30,967
Actually, I worked a lot for it.

889
00:55:31,767 --> 00:55:34,067
Thanks for working really hard.

890
00:55:36,267 --> 00:55:37,300
You don't want to go in?

891
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:40,433
It's too early.
I just want to watch.

892
00:55:40,901 --> 00:55:41,802
Okay.

893
00:55:55,601 --> 00:55:56,701
What a relief.

894
00:56:00,534 --> 00:56:02,534
It's not that cold.
Why don't you come?

895
00:56:02,634 --> 00:56:04,135
Stop lying.

896
00:56:04,334 --> 00:56:07,534
Your lips have turned purple
because you're cold.

897
00:56:08,033 --> 00:56:09,267
No.

898
00:56:09,701 --> 00:56:12,268
This picture is seriously
worth your profile picture.

899
00:56:12,734 --> 00:56:16,034
Really? Send it to me.

900
00:56:16,133 --> 00:56:19,266
Wow...

901
00:56:19,367 --> 00:56:21,500
How is this possible?

902
00:56:21,601 --> 00:56:23,935
Really? How did it come out?

903
00:56:24,734 --> 00:56:26,401
Let me see. Did it come out great?

904
00:56:26,501 --> 00:56:27,735
This is so fake.

905
00:56:29,534 --> 00:56:31,035
Wait.

906
00:56:31,801 --> 00:56:34,934
No! No!

907
00:56:35,033 --> 00:56:36,400
Stop!

908
00:56:38,934 --> 00:56:42,268
It's a blessing to know what's
going to happen in the future...

909
00:56:42,968 --> 00:56:44,635
That's what I used to think.

910
00:56:46,701 --> 00:56:50,635
But this blessing takes away
the feeling of butterflies in our stomach.

911
00:57:15,834 --> 00:57:17,468
It kills the will to challenge oneself.

912
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:20,801
"My death, a rainy day, green umbrella,
SBC Blue Team Uniform"

913
00:57:20,868 --> 00:57:22,602
It puts out embers of hope.

914
00:57:23,767 --> 00:57:25,601
Today around 5 AM, a 52 year old man...

915
00:57:25,667 --> 00:57:29,101
...named Mr. Myung tied up
the underwear he was wearing...

916
00:57:29,167 --> 00:57:33,135
...and hung himself while serving
in Seoul Goomin Prison.

917
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,639
A future I can't change.

918
00:57:35,734 --> 00:57:37,001
"A rainy day, green umbrella"

919
00:57:38,634 --> 00:57:40,168
A future that's been predestined.

920
00:57:42,067 --> 00:57:43,449
Father...

921
00:57:43,534 --> 00:57:46,168
In May 2015, Mr. Myung...

922
00:57:46,267 --> 00:57:49,734
...was pointed as the culprit of
a serial killing using injections...

923
00:57:49,801 --> 00:57:52,735
...that caused a stir and
was sentenced to life.

924
00:57:56,167 --> 00:57:58,267
That's another form of despair...

925
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,233
...and makes me lose everything
by giving up...

926
00:58:01,634 --> 00:58:03,268
...and repeating every day in vain.

927
00:58:03,868 --> 00:58:05,335
Mr. Myung left a suicide note...

928
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:10,001
...saying he was falsely accused
and that the truth must be revealed.

929
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,400
Lieutenant Han,
is the walkie-talkie fully charged?

930
00:58:15,501 --> 00:58:16,335
It's...

931
00:58:22,734 --> 00:58:24,134
When did you start charging them?

932
00:58:25,167 --> 00:58:25,868
What?

933
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:30,034
It's green. They're fully charged.

934
00:58:30,133 --> 00:58:31,433
Okay.

935
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,600
I wish I gave her some time to
relax by bringing her to the ocean...

936
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,634
...and that this can be a shelter
from those days that are in vain.

937
00:59:04,434 --> 00:59:05,268
I hope...

938
00:59:06,434 --> 00:59:08,068
you had an exciting day.

939
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,168
"While You Were Sleeping"

940
00:59:39,267 --> 00:59:41,934
Are you saying that the cop may
also be dreaming of us as well?

941
00:59:42,033 --> 00:59:42,682
The person who killed himself...

942
00:59:42,767 --> 00:59:44,366
...in the prison is the same person
as the injection murderer.

943
00:59:44,467 --> 00:59:46,268
I'm going to interview
you guys starting today.

944
00:59:46,367 --> 00:59:47,068
Us?

945
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:48,516
Can't you tell that they're lies?

946
00:59:48,601 --> 00:59:50,682
I'm just saying I'll check it myself.

947
00:59:50,767 --> 00:59:51,800
Hey, Prosecutor.

948
00:59:51,901 --> 00:59:53,602
There's something huge in there.

949
00:59:53,667 --> 00:59:55,168
-Victim...
-Victim?

950
00:59:55,267 --> 00:59:56,801
The injection murder case...

951
00:59:56,901 --> 00:59:57,901
That case...

952
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,267
Answer me!

953
00:59:59,334 --> 01:00:01,434
He might be the accomplice
or the real culprit.

954
01:00:01,501 --> 01:00:02,935
The dream started.

955
01:00:03,033 --> 01:00:05,500
I see dreams of the person I saved.

956
01:00:11,467 --> 01:00:18,467
"While You Were Sleeping"
