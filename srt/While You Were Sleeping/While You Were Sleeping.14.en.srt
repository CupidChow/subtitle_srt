1
00:00:00,234 --> 00:00:01,068
"While You Were Sleeping"

2
00:00:06,234 --> 00:00:09,035
"Episode 14"

3
00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:14,401
Are you okay?

4
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:16,467
Yes, I'm fine.

5
00:00:16,634 --> 00:00:18,301
The ambulance is almost here.

6
00:00:20,734 --> 00:00:22,968
Are you okay?
You look like you hurt your hand badly.

7
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:25,200
-That's not important.
-Gosh!

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,234
Why in the world did you
come to a place like this alone?

9
00:00:28,334 --> 00:00:30,035
Why didn't you call me?

10
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:31,834
Well...

11
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:34,333
It was after your work hours,
so I felt bad to call you...

12
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,135
You should've called
even if you felt bad.

13
00:00:36,234 --> 00:00:39,801
What would you do if something went wrong
when you ignored all our procedures...

14
00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:41,634
...by coming out here all alone?

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,033
What did I tell you when
you executed the warrant?

16
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,634
What's the most important
thing in places like this?

17
00:00:46,734 --> 00:00:47,401
My safety.

18
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:49,368
If you know that...

19
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:52,601
Why did you go alone?

20
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:58,401
You could've died...

21
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:00,868
...if I didn't show up today.

22
00:01:03,767 --> 00:01:07,088
It didn't cross his mind that
it would be dangerous here...

23
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:10,467
Stay out of this.
Taking his side won't help.

24
00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:11,801
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,901
It's the same for you too.

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,567
Why would you come here...

27
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:21,268
...when you don't know
who's going to be here?

28
00:01:21,334 --> 00:01:22,768
Right, without any fears.

29
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:29,600
The ambulance is here.

30
00:01:34,834 --> 00:01:38,501
Who do I need to go with
when there's two people.

31
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:40,433
Please take care of him.

32
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:43,182
He inhaled a lot of
gas trying to save me.

33
00:01:43,267 --> 00:01:45,235
No, please take care of her.

34
00:01:45,334 --> 00:01:46,568
Her hands were shaking
a lot earlier as well.

35
00:01:46,634 --> 00:01:48,602
It's not shaking. It's fine now.

36
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:50,900
His internal injury is
probably worse than mine.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,567
Hey, you're not okay.

38
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:55,635
No, I'm fine but you're not.

39
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:56,669
Are you okay?

40
00:01:59,634 --> 00:02:00,767
What should I do?

41
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:05,261
Over here.

42
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,134
When you ignore the assistant
chief prosecutor's orders...

43
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,649
...and went to the site without
your inspector, you can become the victim.

44
00:02:19,734 --> 00:02:22,501
You're destroying the neutrality
of the whole investigation.

45
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,400
Do you understand?

46
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,134
Yes.

47
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:33,305
How did you know I was here?

48
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:41,015
That's not the problem right now.
Just be quiet and keep this on.

49
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,034
This is there for you to breathe, but
it's also there so that you don't talk.

50
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,068
I'm glad. I'm so glad.

51
00:02:54,234 --> 00:02:55,401
What a relief...

52
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,201
I'm so glad that you're both alive.

53
00:03:14,734 --> 00:03:16,134
Thank you.

54
00:03:18,601 --> 00:03:21,569
If you're thankful, then please listen.

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,501
Stop making me worry...

56
00:03:57,534 --> 00:04:00,435
Hongjoo, we're going to
go over for breakfast in a bit.

57
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:02,935
I know, but there's a favor I need to ask.

58
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:04,500
A favor? What is it?

59
00:04:12,534 --> 00:04:14,634
I inhaled so much smoke yesterday that...

60
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:17,468
It keeps coming out no
matter how much I blow my nose.

61
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:20,068
I can write something with my snot...

62
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,482
Well, Jaechan...

63
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:33,634
Hongjoo is here because
she wanted to ask for a favor.

64
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:34,435
Really?

65
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:37,734
Wait up.

66
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,767
Write with my snot...

67
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:49,801
Can I come back from this?

68
00:04:50,868 --> 00:04:52,702
So disgusting...

69
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:55,635
Jeez...

70
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:59,335
I think he has a trumpet on his nose.
I don't need an alarm.

71
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,268
I wake up to that sound in the morning.

72
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,569
You're not shocked, are you?

73
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:10,701
You said you see him all messy
all the time in your dream, right?

74
00:05:10,767 --> 00:05:11,967
Yes, it's fine.

75
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:14,163
I have ash coming out of my nose as well.

76
00:05:14,267 --> 00:05:15,467
And your brother...

77
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:18,301
He's sexier when he's wet
coming out of the shower...

78
00:05:18,868 --> 00:05:20,736
...and it makes my heart flutter.

79
00:05:22,334 --> 00:05:23,202
I see.

80
00:05:24,501 --> 00:05:26,735
You being this blind by love
could even be a disease...

81
00:05:30,767 --> 00:05:31,767
My gosh.

82
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:34,068
Seungwon, you're going to be late.
Hurry up and wash up.

83
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:39,034
What favor do you need to ask?

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,567
I briefly told my mom...

85
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:47,135
...about the accident yesterday because
I don't want her to worry.

86
00:05:47,234 --> 00:05:48,267
What did you tell her?

87
00:05:49,467 --> 00:05:52,968
I just happen to see a fire when
I was passing by, so I called 911.

88
00:05:53,267 --> 00:05:55,334
So when we eat later,
try to go along with it.

89
00:05:55,434 --> 00:05:56,668
All right.

90
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:58,066
Shall we go then?

91
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:04,535
You can't be like that to me.

92
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:05,834
What do you mean?

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,767
You can't lie to me because
you don't want me to worry.

94
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:11,901
Whether it's bad things or a bad dream...

95
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:14,767
...you have to tell me
the truth and not lie.

96
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:16,867
Okay.

97
00:06:17,734 --> 00:06:19,734
You still have that dream
you told me about?

98
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:21,662
The dream about
the green umbrella on a rainy day.

99
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:22,568
I don't.

100
00:06:22,634 --> 00:06:24,368
It's been a while since
I last had that dream.

101
00:06:30,534 --> 00:06:32,468
Really? You're not lying, are you?

102
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:33,867
I'm serious.

103
00:06:34,434 --> 00:06:37,467
I'll tell you first if I have
that dream, so don't worry.

104
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,201
All right, then.

105
00:06:56,968 --> 00:07:01,302
So, inside the phone were photos of
victims of the IV drip serial murder case.

106
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,067
Is this right?

107
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:02,738
Yes.

108
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:05,368
Then, is he related to Myung Yiseok?

109
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:06,935
Like an accomplice?

110
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:08,066
Could be.

111
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:09,867
I could find out if
I investigate a bit more...

112
00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:11,901
...but he could be the real criminal.

113
00:07:11,968 --> 00:07:12,936
The real criminal?

114
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,634
What evidence do you have to say that?

115
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,467
Other than the 11 photos of the victims...

116
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:19,567
...there were eight extra photos
in his phone.

117
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,767
What are you talking about?

118
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:23,435
Then, what happened to those eight people?

119
00:07:23,534 --> 00:07:24,667
They're all dead.

120
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:25,635
-What?
-What?

121
00:07:26,868 --> 00:07:30,102
Why weren't those
eight victims listed in that case?

122
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,400
They were not part of the same
hospital room with the case.

123
00:07:32,501 --> 00:07:35,534
They weren't included because
they died after Myung Yiseok's arrest.

124
00:07:35,634 --> 00:07:37,634
They died after he got arrested?

125
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:41,568
Then, he can be
the real criminal or an accomplice.

126
00:07:41,968 --> 00:07:44,902
This means that the real killer
is still out there in the world.

127
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,934
There's also a threat that he
may commit another crime.

128
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:51,033
Are you sure that the man who
died in the fire wasn't the killer?

129
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,300
The person who died from the fire
wasn't the owner of the phone.

130
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:55,534
But he was just there
to get it for someone else.

131
00:07:55,634 --> 00:07:56,602
But when the police
approached the person...

132
00:07:56,701 --> 00:07:59,602
...who was looking for the phone,
someone else killed him with fire?

133
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:01,667
That means that it's a high probability
that the phone belongs to the arsonist.

134
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:04,867
And it's highly likely for
him to be the serial killer.

135
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,034
We can't make any assumptions.

136
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,500
This is a reinvestigation,
so let's be cautious.

137
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:14,534
Did you get the personal
information of the phone owner?

138
00:08:14,634 --> 00:08:17,568
It's not easy to find the owner
due to it being a burner phone.

139
00:08:17,701 --> 00:08:18,535
Hongjoo.

140
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:22,167
Weren't you in charge
of the case last year?

141
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:23,334
Yes.

142
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:26,834
Now, I want you two to step down
from the line and focus on this case.

143
00:08:26,934 --> 00:08:30,201
Doohyun, go to the hospital and
find out more about the eight patients.

144
00:08:30,734 --> 00:08:31,668
Hongjoo,

145
00:08:31,734 --> 00:08:34,468
stick with the police and prosecution
to find out the phone's owner,

146
00:08:34,534 --> 00:08:36,934
and if there were any problems
with the old investigation.

147
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,367
-Yes.
-Yes, sir.

148
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:44,367
Did you give the phone's backup
data to the digital forensic team?

149
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:46,268
Yes, it's here.

150
00:08:46,501 --> 00:08:49,868
By the way, how did you know
so much about the case?

151
00:08:50,267 --> 00:08:51,534
It's not your own case.

152
00:08:51,634 --> 00:08:53,667
Well, I was the first to
recognize this as a case...

153
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:56,168
You're the victim of the arson case.

154
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:57,868
How can the victim investigate?

155
00:08:57,934 --> 00:09:01,034
You'll be excluded if I were the judge.

156
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:02,501
Yes, I know.

157
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:04,468
Prosecutor Jung, stay out of this...

158
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:07,746
...and Ms. Son and
Prosecutor Shin should lead this case.

159
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:08,468
-Yes.
-Yes, sir.

160
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:09,468
Also...

161
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:14,066
...you and Prosecutor Lee should work
on reinvestigating the serial killer case.

162
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:15,734
Yes, sir.

163
00:09:16,434 --> 00:09:16,868
Yes, sir.

164
00:09:16,968 --> 00:09:20,435
But, if you do not follow my command
and run out to the crime scene again...

165
00:09:20,534 --> 00:09:22,468
...I'll remove you from this team.

166
00:09:22,534 --> 00:09:23,534
I understand.

167
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:25,166
All right.

168
00:09:25,267 --> 00:09:27,783
We have two cases but only one suspect.

169
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:29,635
We'll work on it with two tracks...

170
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:32,401
...and have both teams have
a meeting every day and cooperate.

171
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:39,335
First, I'll contact the Yeonju office
to get the records of the case...

172
00:09:39,434 --> 00:09:41,135
...and request to investigate
on the confiscated goods.

173
00:09:41,234 --> 00:09:41,868
Okay.

174
00:09:43,634 --> 00:09:44,502
Prosecutor Jung.

175
00:09:47,934 --> 00:09:48,934
Are you going to be fine?

176
00:09:49,234 --> 00:09:50,001
What do you mean?

177
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,034
Reinvestigating a closed case...

178
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,600
...means something in the previous
investigation had gone wrong.

179
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:55,716
Yes, I know.

180
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:58,702
You have to investigate Attorney Lee
who was the prosecutor for this case...

181
00:09:59,701 --> 00:10:02,935
...and Mr. Choi who was the inspector.

182
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:05,935
I'm sure nothing went wrong.

183
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:08,467
But if we find a problem with
the previous investigation...

184
00:10:08,634 --> 00:10:11,034
...Mr. Choi may face disciplinary actions.

185
00:10:13,534 --> 00:10:14,834
Best case, dereliction of duty.

186
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
But in the worst case,
he may have to go through a trial.

187
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:21,801
It's hard to do it myself
since it's my right hand...

188
00:10:22,634 --> 00:10:23,634
Thanks.

189
00:10:24,067 --> 00:10:25,568
I'm really nice, right?

190
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:26,268
Yes.

191
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:28,168
Since I'm so nice...

192
00:10:28,267 --> 00:10:31,834
...I wish someone like
Lieutenant Han fall from the sky for me.

193
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:34,268
Han Wootak also lived a good life.

194
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:41,001
I'm sorry.

195
00:10:41,968 --> 00:10:44,135
Can you investigate this case...

196
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:46,767
...when it may put Mr. Choi in trouble?

197
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:06,167
"Catch Me If You Can"

198
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:18,034
There's so much record.

199
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:20,034
It's going to take several
days to look through all of this.

200
00:11:20,133 --> 00:11:22,767
There's a lot because 11 people died.

201
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:24,868
Watch it.

202
00:11:24,968 --> 00:11:28,702
Why would you close it so hard?
You could've just pushed a button.

203
00:11:28,868 --> 00:11:30,569
Prosecutor Jung,
I've been watching from before...

204
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:32,800
...but let's be more careful
not to ruin the leather.

205
00:11:32,868 --> 00:11:34,048
This color...

206
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:36,133
I should've asked for a separate car...

207
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:39,034
Get in.

208
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:40,667
You should get in as well. We'll be late.

209
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:47,134
Whose car is this?

210
00:11:48,534 --> 00:11:52,934
It's my car that's kind
of like mine and not.

211
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:54,234
What?

212
00:11:58,701 --> 00:12:01,701
I wish I was in the same team as you...

213
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:02,834
I miss you.

214
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,700
We're going to put all
the confiscated goods...

215
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:07,268
...and the trial records
in your office, right?

216
00:12:07,334 --> 00:12:09,334
I'll put the investigation records
in my office.

217
00:12:09,434 --> 00:12:12,768
That won't work.
Mr. Choi is in your office.

218
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:14,168
Put all of them in my office.

219
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:16,602
You're going to leave Mr. Choi
out of this investigation?

220
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:17,669
Of course.

221
00:12:17,968 --> 00:12:21,502
We'll send him to the arson case team
and ask for another investigator.

222
00:12:21,901 --> 00:12:25,802
I'm going to investigate
this case with Mr. Choi.

223
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:29,669
Mr. Choi has nothing to do
with the people who are involved...

224
00:12:29,801 --> 00:12:32,268
...so he shouldn't be exempted
just because of our assumptions.

225
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,600
I said no.
Put these in my office.

226
00:12:40,701 --> 00:12:41,768
Sir.

227
00:12:41,868 --> 00:12:46,135
Mr. Choi is the one who thoroughly
investigated this case with Yoobum.

228
00:12:46,234 --> 00:12:49,668
If any false records are found,
he could turn out to be a criminal.

229
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:55,034
Can we talk about that later?

230
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,200
What do you mean, later?

231
00:12:56,267 --> 00:12:58,716
What if he wanted honor and
manipulated the case to his benefit?

232
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:01,035
-Sir!
-What? What about me?

233
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,200
I also don't want to suspect
Mr. Choi of any wrong doing.

234
00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:04,034
But what can I do?

235
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:05,967
It's my duty as a prosecutor
to suspect everything.

236
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:10,234
It's our job to suspect even those
who we don't want to suspect.

237
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:13,734
You're right.

238
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:15,869
Right? Mr. Choi!

239
00:13:17,467 --> 00:13:23,134
What I meant was I'm not saying
that you made a mistake or anything...

240
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,168
I know.

241
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,200
I shouldn't be on this case...

242
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:31,634
...and it's only right to leave these
in Prosecutor Lee's office.

243
00:13:38,934 --> 00:13:40,012
What?

244
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,701
Mr. Choi also said that I'm right.

245
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:00,635
Prosecutor Lee is going overboard.

246
00:14:00,734 --> 00:14:03,901
How can he do that to his partner?

247
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,067
So cold-hearted.

248
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:05,967
I know.

249
00:14:06,033 --> 00:14:07,473
It may hurt his feelings...

250
00:14:07,534 --> 00:14:09,768
But it's right to do that from
investigation perspective.

251
00:14:09,868 --> 00:14:11,635
Are you siding with Prosecutor Lee?

252
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:14,734
She's not siding with anyone,
but just saying it's right to do that.

253
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:16,934
It's possible that a real
criminal could be out there.

254
00:14:17,033 --> 00:14:19,834
Then, that means the old
investigation went wrong and Mr. Choi...

255
00:14:22,601 --> 00:14:26,268
I know Mr. Choi very well.
And he would never...

256
00:14:26,334 --> 00:14:27,801
That he would never do such a thing?

257
00:14:34,634 --> 00:14:36,201
How can you be certain?

258
00:14:39,434 --> 00:14:41,668
This is how you said it last time
during Hakyoung's case.

259
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:43,549
How is this the same as last time?

260
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:44,968
There's not much difference.

261
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:49,501
I thought what you said to me
back then was right.

262
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,115
I know that Mr. Choi is a great guy...

263
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,307
...but it's also true that there are many
suspicious things about the case.

264
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,567
-First...
-Let's talk about it later.

265
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:06,801
I don't want to hear it since
it'll make me lose my appetite.

266
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:20,335
Did Mr. Choi explain
how he knew about the arson...

267
00:15:20,434 --> 00:15:21,567
...and came to the place?

268
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:23,834
No, but there are many ways to know.

269
00:15:23,934 --> 00:15:24,835
What many other ways?

270
00:15:24,934 --> 00:15:26,101
He could've followed me...

271
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,101
Then, he would've
stopped it before the arson.

272
00:15:28,968 --> 00:15:30,179
Or he could've been walking by...

273
00:15:30,267 --> 00:15:33,135
It was far from his usual path.

274
00:15:33,234 --> 00:15:35,634
He could've seen the fire
from far away and came.

275
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,335
He came before the fire started.

276
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:46,835
Do you remember what Mr. Choi told me?

277
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,834
It's the same for you as well.

278
00:15:48,934 --> 00:15:53,001
Why would you come to this place
alone not knowing who could be here?

279
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,300
He knew that you and I went separately.

280
00:15:56,534 --> 00:15:58,402
He came before the fire started...

281
00:15:58,501 --> 00:16:02,668
...but isn't it weird that he waited
to rescue you after the fire started.

282
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,901
So, what is it that you want to say?

283
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,534
Are you saying that Mr. Choi
started the fire with the arsonist?

284
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,068
He's not saying that.

285
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:10,801
Don't get suspicious
and just ask him directly...

286
00:16:10,868 --> 00:16:13,335
Mr. Choi saved us by risking his own life.

287
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:17,168
How can I ask how he got there and
why he waited to save us after the fire?

288
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:18,868
You still have to ask.

289
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:21,166
You can't make assumptions and not ask
because you don't want to be rude.

290
00:16:21,234 --> 00:16:22,835
That's even worse.

291
00:16:50,701 --> 00:16:51,868
Are you mad?

292
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,267
What Wootak meant...

293
00:16:56,501 --> 00:16:57,268
I know.

294
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,100
I know that he's right and I'm wrong.

295
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:04,034
I've contradicted myself and I know
that I'm not being a good prosecutor.

296
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:08,502
I know why you and Wootak
are being suspicious of Mr. Choi...

297
00:17:11,534 --> 00:17:13,168
I know it in my head, but my heart...

298
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:16,501
I can't get my heart to do it.

299
00:17:21,033 --> 00:17:23,333
I just don't like myself right now
and feel disgraceful.

300
00:17:23,734 --> 00:17:25,867
I'm embarrassed that you
have to see this side of me.

301
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:31,067
Did we just have a fight?

302
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:35,667
Do you want to be alone?

303
00:17:40,534 --> 00:17:44,168
Okay then, I think it's best
that I go alone today as well.

304
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:48,502
I'm leaving.

305
00:18:04,901 --> 00:18:07,468
What?
I said I wanted to go alone.

306
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,167
Me too.

307
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:11,868
So let's just go alone together.

308
00:18:14,901 --> 00:18:16,168
That doesn't make sense.

309
00:18:30,033 --> 00:18:31,967
Where's the sentencing of Myung Yiseok?

310
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:34,634
Here it is.

311
00:18:36,968 --> 00:18:37,735
You're here.

312
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:39,268
Where's Mr. Choi?

313
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:41,001
He went to the arson team.

314
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:41,734
What?

315
00:18:41,934 --> 00:18:44,134
I'll go through the confiscations first.

316
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:47,800
Why are you telling me that?

317
00:18:47,901 --> 00:18:50,301
He's throwing a tantrum towards me.

318
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,901
Just ignore him.

319
00:18:53,934 --> 00:18:55,651
I don't think that Mr. Choi...

320
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:59,435
...is a person who would manipulate
a case for a promotion.

321
00:18:59,501 --> 00:19:00,534
I see.

322
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:04,368
Prosecutor Lee.

323
00:19:04,467 --> 00:19:07,534
Prosecutor Son wants
you in the video investigation room.

324
00:19:07,601 --> 00:19:08,349
Me? Why?

325
00:19:08,434 --> 00:19:11,768
She's currently lining up arson suspects
and needs a sidekick.

326
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:17,736
Lift up your face,
so we can see your faces.

327
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,682
Witness?

328
00:19:23,767 --> 00:19:27,201
Yes, someone saw a man running
away on a bicycle from the scene.

329
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,534
I gathered whoever spoke to
Jo Inpyo that day and...

330
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:34,068
...has similar foot sizes of
the footprints from the scene.

331
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,500
It's that guy.

332
00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:38,967
The guy in the far right
that's showing his teeth.

333
00:19:39,767 --> 00:19:40,967
I'm certain.

334
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,068
I saw his teeth yesterday.

335
00:19:43,234 --> 00:19:44,868
It was bright even in the dark.

336
00:19:44,968 --> 00:19:46,769
You said the culprit was wearing a mask.

337
00:19:46,868 --> 00:19:48,702
How did you see his teeth?

338
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:50,034
I said that?

339
00:19:51,334 --> 00:19:53,082
That second guy...

340
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:54,167
Second guy?

341
00:19:54,501 --> 00:19:56,968
Wait, is it the third guy?

342
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,734
What in the world...

343
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:09,800
Contrary to prior belief,
it's quite hard to purchase gasoline.

344
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:13,101
If consumers buy it from a container...

345
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,834
...we must record their
personal information.

346
00:20:15,901 --> 00:20:18,968
Was there anyone who purchased
it on June 22nd or before then?

347
00:20:22,634 --> 00:20:23,767
No.

348
00:20:23,968 --> 00:20:26,302
How many gas stations do we
have around here within 5km?

349
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:27,667
It's over 40...

350
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:31,568
40...

351
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,634
Hello, Attorney Lee Yoobum.

352
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,701
It looks like you enjoy hot
coffee even during the summer.

353
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:59,001
It makes sense since
the air conditioner here is so strong...

354
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,400
...so you probably have to drink it hot.

355
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:03,735
Who is this jerk?

356
00:21:17,033 --> 00:21:18,001
Welcome...

357
00:21:21,834 --> 00:21:23,335
You guys sell Icy Hot patches here?

358
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:27,035
Yes, it's right next to
the toothbrush and toothpastes.

359
00:21:27,734 --> 00:21:28,867
Thank you.

360
00:21:34,767 --> 00:21:36,167
How do you feel right now?

361
00:21:36,267 --> 00:21:38,501
Do you have anything to
say to the family of 11 victims?

362
00:21:38,567 --> 00:21:40,501
Do you have anything to say to your son?

363
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:43,635
Please say something.
Please say something to your son.

364
00:21:43,701 --> 00:21:45,502
How do you feel right now?

365
00:21:46,234 --> 00:21:47,601
Please say something.

366
00:21:56,701 --> 00:21:57,602
How much is it?

367
00:22:01,234 --> 00:22:03,102
Are you reporter
Nam Hongjoo from SBC?

368
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:04,968
Oh? How do you know?

369
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:06,634
Did you see me on TV?

370
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,434
No, I've seen you in person.

371
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,001
"How do you feel right now?"

372
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:18,800
"Do you have anything to
say to the family of 11 victims?"

373
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:22,435
"Do you have anything to say to your son?"

374
00:22:40,367 --> 00:22:42,734
I'm the serial killer, Myung Yiseok's son.

375
00:22:54,367 --> 00:22:56,500
You stood out amongst all those reporters.

376
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,335
You were so persistent...

377
00:22:58,934 --> 00:23:01,934
Hey, look...

378
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,267
Do you know that my father passed away?

379
00:23:18,033 --> 00:23:21,033
She does, she also knows
that he felt wrongly accused.

380
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,934
You're Myung Daegoo, right?
You're Seungwon's friend.

381
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,101
We're reinvestigating your father's case.

382
00:23:34,868 --> 00:23:35,901
Reinvestigation?

383
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,734
Yes. To see if the previous
investigation went wrong...

384
00:23:39,834 --> 00:23:41,268
...or if he was wrongly accused...

385
00:23:41,367 --> 00:23:43,068
We're going to go through
all the evidence again.

386
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:45,101
If anything unfair happened
in the previous investigation...

387
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,701
...or you have any evidence that
proves your father's innocence...

388
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:48,968
...then give me a call here.

389
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,367
I'll listen to everything.

390
00:23:56,901 --> 00:23:58,050
Thank you.

391
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:01,035
Thank you so much.

392
00:24:13,767 --> 00:24:15,735
Why the patch? Are you hurt?

393
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,500
Mom's shoulder muscles are aching.

394
00:24:23,734 --> 00:24:25,034
Are you still mad?

395
00:24:25,801 --> 00:24:28,868
Are you okay about feeling embarrassed?

396
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:30,967
Somewhat.

397
00:24:31,634 --> 00:24:33,868
When will you stop being mad?

398
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:35,667
Soon.

399
00:24:36,234 --> 00:24:37,035
Bye.

400
00:24:49,934 --> 00:24:50,967
Thanks.

401
00:24:52,334 --> 00:24:53,935
For what?

402
00:24:54,434 --> 00:24:58,135
Earlier... That kid was really scary.

403
00:24:58,234 --> 00:25:00,301
What's so scary about him?
He's only a high school student.

404
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,901
You know...

405
00:25:05,701 --> 00:25:08,335
I was really scared, but now I'm okay.

406
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,533
Thanks to someone.

407
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:17,867
You were so cool earlier.

408
00:25:18,367 --> 00:25:19,934
No need to feel embarrassed.

409
00:25:20,033 --> 00:25:21,367
So hurry up and stop being mad at me.

410
00:25:21,434 --> 00:25:22,434
It's uncomfortable.

411
00:25:24,667 --> 00:25:25,568
Okay.

412
00:25:29,067 --> 00:25:30,100
I'll stop being angry.

413
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:32,635
I'm not mad anymore. I'm fine.

414
00:25:32,968 --> 00:25:33,802
I'm fine.

415
00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:42,001
I'm sorry for being
suspicious of Mr. Choi.

416
00:25:42,234 --> 00:25:44,768
I didn't want to suspect him either,
so I wanted you to ask him.

417
00:25:45,167 --> 00:25:47,167
My suspicion only grows
if we don't do anything.

418
00:25:48,701 --> 00:25:51,569
We don't need to be suspicious
if we heard it directly from him...

419
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,234
I wanted to believe in Mr. Choi,
that's why.

420
00:25:57,467 --> 00:25:58,268
I know.

421
00:26:20,601 --> 00:26:22,502
You had a driver?

422
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:25,035
You look like my age...

423
00:26:25,934 --> 00:26:32,268
I envy you for having a driver.
Isn't that all thanks to me?

424
00:26:35,634 --> 00:26:37,868
Who in the world is this crazy jerk?

425
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,667
You're the one who manipulated the
confiscations for Myung Yiseok's case.

426
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,267
Didn't you?

427
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:56,435
Attorney Lee.

428
00:26:57,601 --> 00:26:58,935
You have a guest.

429
00:27:00,434 --> 00:27:01,135
Who?

430
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:14,901
I thought it was someone else.

431
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:18,101
What brings you here?

432
00:27:20,767 --> 00:27:22,735
There's something
I want to ask you for a bit.

433
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,133
Gosh. I should time it.

434
00:27:26,868 --> 00:27:28,369
My time is quite expensive.

435
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:31,501
I just need three minutes.

436
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:34,535
Tell me. What is it?

437
00:27:43,934 --> 00:27:46,101
"Lee Yoobum"

438
00:27:53,267 --> 00:27:54,701
What is this about?

439
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:59,268
I know a suspect who is getting
investigated by a prosecutor...

440
00:27:59,634 --> 00:28:02,435
...and the prosecutor keeps giving
out tips on the results to the media.

441
00:28:02,501 --> 00:28:04,168
That's not right.

442
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,767
Who's the prosecutor?

443
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:09,083
The investigation result
is strictly confidential.

444
00:28:09,534 --> 00:28:13,468
Even a suspect has his rights
and full rights to protection.

445
00:28:13,934 --> 00:28:17,701
Does that suspect have his own
attorney who can stand up for him?

446
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,467
Why would the prosecutor keep
leaking information about the case?

447
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:23,867
It's obvious.

448
00:28:24,367 --> 00:28:27,567
Either he doesn't have enough evidence
or he's not sure about something.

449
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,071
If he charges the suspect,
he may get acquitted...

450
00:28:30,133 --> 00:28:31,834
...so he's probably
asking the media for help.

451
00:28:34,467 --> 00:28:36,335
Like that Coke bubble from last time?

452
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:38,435
Yes.

453
00:28:41,901 --> 00:28:43,602
You must've leaked information...

454
00:28:44,033 --> 00:28:46,634
...during Myung Yiseok's case
for that same reason, right?

455
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:59,268
I thought you gave that information to
me because you had feelings for me...

456
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,967
But I guess you had that planned out.

457
00:29:02,467 --> 00:29:04,834
Did you not have enough
evidence back then and...

458
00:29:04,901 --> 00:29:06,435
...wasn't sure about something as well?

459
00:29:11,934 --> 00:29:13,101
Why...

460
00:29:14,701 --> 00:29:16,801
...would you suddenly bring up
a case that's been closed?

461
00:29:16,901 --> 00:29:18,702
We received information that
the real criminal...

462
00:29:18,801 --> 00:29:20,335
...other than Myung Yiseok is out there.

463
00:29:20,601 --> 00:29:24,535
Our reporting department has made
a new task force to start covering it.

464
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:28,301
It's been three minutes.

465
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,435
I'll listen to both the attorney
and the prosecutor...

466
00:29:32,534 --> 00:29:34,115
...for Myung Yiseok's case and
fairly release articles...

467
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,967
...so give me a call if you
would like to say something.

468
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,767
I'll come by any time.

469
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,001
You know my number, right?

470
00:29:41,834 --> 00:29:42,867
Of course.

471
00:29:43,434 --> 00:29:44,434
I'll be going.

472
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,400
Thanks for the tea.

473
00:29:58,501 --> 00:29:59,568
Good bye.

474
00:30:03,734 --> 00:30:04,568
Excuse me.

475
00:30:05,868 --> 00:30:07,335
Who are you here to see?

476
00:30:07,534 --> 00:30:10,168
I had something for Attorney Lee.

477
00:30:10,234 --> 00:30:11,768
He forgot it last time.

478
00:30:29,467 --> 00:30:31,567
Among all the confiscated items...

479
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:34,667
...the bottle with poison turned out to
be the finalizing evidence for the case.

480
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:37,534
And Myung Yiseok pleaded
innocent until the end.

481
00:30:37,601 --> 00:30:39,315
What did he say about the bottle himself?

482
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,201
He said it doesn't make sense and
that the prosecutor manipulated this.

483
00:30:44,934 --> 00:30:45,768
Manipulated?

484
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:48,101
We can manipulate your report card.

485
00:30:48,534 --> 00:30:51,168
Yoobum, my father is a cop.

486
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,333
You can raise it a little
bit so that it's subtle.

487
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:56,459
Do you think a prosecutor
or an inspector...

488
00:30:56,534 --> 00:30:58,235
...can manipulate confiscated goods?

489
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,433
That's really horrible.

490
00:31:00,534 --> 00:31:02,235
Is such fabrication even possible?

491
00:31:03,367 --> 00:31:05,335
Prosecutors can do it if he wants to.

492
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,435
Who went for the confiscations?

493
00:31:11,567 --> 00:31:13,368
It's Mr. Choi.

494
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:18,901
If it was manipulated,
it's either Mr. Choi or Attorney Lee.

495
00:31:21,133 --> 00:31:24,266
It's probably Attorney Lee
if it was manipulated.

496
00:31:24,868 --> 00:31:26,268
Mr. Choi would never do that.

497
00:31:26,367 --> 00:31:29,467
We're still investigating,
so we don't know that for certain.

498
00:31:40,634 --> 00:31:41,535
Minyoung.

499
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:42,418
Yes?

500
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:43,735
Please contact general affairs...

501
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:46,602
...and get Mr. Choi's personnel
records and make copies of it.

502
00:31:55,701 --> 00:32:00,701
If I get caught, I have to tell
the prosecutors about your manipulation.

503
00:32:01,234 --> 00:32:02,367
Would you be okay with that?

504
00:32:03,801 --> 00:32:05,769
Let's meet. Where should we meet?

505
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:12,302
9PM tonight, at your office.

506
00:32:25,868 --> 00:32:26,802
You're here?

507
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:32,567
How's the investigation going?

508
00:32:34,033 --> 00:32:35,567
Yes, it's going somewhere, I guess.

509
00:32:37,534 --> 00:32:39,567
How about you?
Any updates on the arsonist?

510
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:42,001
This is harder than I thought.

511
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:44,201
You didn't see the arsonist that time?

512
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,300
I couldn't see since
I came after the fire started.

513
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:50,334
Do you remember what Mr. Choi said to me?

514
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,867
He knew that you and I went separately.

515
00:32:55,801 --> 00:32:57,302
If you came after the fire started...

516
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,467
...how did you know that
Hongjoo and I went separately?

517
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:02,401
That...

518
00:33:03,934 --> 00:33:05,735
I was just guessing.

519
00:33:06,133 --> 00:33:08,133
How did you know that
we were going to be there?

520
00:33:08,234 --> 00:33:11,801
That too, I just happened to pass by.

521
00:33:12,634 --> 00:33:13,502
Mr. Choi.

522
00:33:15,234 --> 00:33:17,568
It's just... How should I say this.

523
00:33:17,834 --> 00:33:21,867
It's like I just received a telepathic
message that you were in danger.

524
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,601
I have such super power.

525
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:28,500
Perhaps it's because I went
to school near Miari Ridge.

526
00:33:37,534 --> 00:33:38,968
What are you doing here at this hour?

527
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,533
I wanted to ask you something
about the arson incident.

528
00:33:41,801 --> 00:33:42,834
Before that, here.

529
00:33:42,934 --> 00:33:44,635
I've been trying to give it
to you but kept forgetting.

530
00:33:47,968 --> 00:33:49,702
I found your portable charger.

531
00:33:49,868 --> 00:33:52,968
The red one that you forgot in my car.

532
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:57,202
What?

533
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,700
Is this red one not yours?

534
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,600
It's mine. Red one.

535
00:34:09,033 --> 00:34:09,800
Thanks.

536
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:12,634
What is it that you need to ask?

537
00:34:13,669 --> 00:34:17,203
Didn't you say that you arrest
the guy who got killed by the arsonist?

538
00:34:17,701 --> 00:34:18,302
Yes.

539
00:34:20,467 --> 00:34:21,983
How many gas stations
have we visited so far?

540
00:34:24,167 --> 00:34:25,968
36 gas stations.

541
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:30,634
Hello.

542
00:34:39,901 --> 00:34:41,201
Aren't you going home?

543
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,834
I have a consultation with my client.

544
00:34:44,267 --> 00:34:44,968
You can go home first.

545
00:34:45,067 --> 00:34:46,334
Okay.

546
00:34:54,434 --> 00:34:56,968
The prosecutors and police have
been looking for the arsonist for days...

547
00:34:57,067 --> 00:34:58,367
...but they haven't caught him yet.

548
00:34:58,467 --> 00:35:00,335
I've been digging as well,
but haven't found anything.

549
00:35:00,467 --> 00:35:02,734
I came hoping for something at least.

550
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,468
Was there anything that stood out
when you arrested Jo Inpyo?

551
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:08,635
I'm not sure...

552
00:35:09,567 --> 00:35:13,867
His clothes didn't look nice at all
for someone who had 10 million won.

553
00:35:15,167 --> 00:35:16,035
Anything else?

554
00:35:17,567 --> 00:35:20,134
And the bag that had cash...

555
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,234
What about the bag?

556
00:35:22,767 --> 00:35:26,967
It's here on the 22nd
for 10 liter of gasoline.

557
00:35:27,801 --> 00:35:29,068
He bought the entire bottle.

558
00:35:29,434 --> 00:35:30,701
Yes!

559
00:35:30,968 --> 00:35:31,802
I'm saved.

560
00:35:32,467 --> 00:35:35,500
Did he buy it with cash or with card?

561
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,801
He bought it with cash.

562
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,300
Do you recall what he looked
like or what he was wearing?

563
00:35:47,334 --> 00:35:48,835
I'm here.

564
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:53,667
Wow, your office is nice.
You should treat me out.

565
00:36:00,334 --> 00:36:03,868
If I get caught, does that
mean you'll lose all of these?

566
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:29,335
Those who have a lot...

567
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:33,901
...can lose a lot...

568
00:36:44,968 --> 00:36:46,368
That bag...

569
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:49,201
...looked like a woman's bag.

570
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:50,867
Woman's bag?

571
00:36:51,601 --> 00:36:53,029
It wasn't a man.

572
00:36:53,868 --> 00:36:56,001
It was a woman who came on a bicycle.

573
00:36:56,901 --> 00:36:58,001
-A woman?
-A woman?

574
00:37:01,934 --> 00:37:03,768
You sent those texts?

575
00:37:03,934 --> 00:37:04,635
Yes.

576
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:09,467
You look surprised.

577
00:37:10,467 --> 00:37:12,701
It's nice here...

578
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,601
I found out that we're the same age.

579
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,434
I can talk to you comfortably, right?

580
00:37:26,467 --> 00:37:28,500
You have many awards too.

581
00:37:29,567 --> 00:37:31,001
Let's sit and talk.

582
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:33,135
Shall we?

583
00:37:42,133 --> 00:37:43,500
What's with the text?

584
00:37:44,734 --> 00:37:45,968
Why were you looking for me?

585
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,867
Weren't you expecting it?

586
00:37:48,801 --> 00:37:50,101
You're supposed to be smart.

587
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:51,071
No!

588
00:37:53,734 --> 00:37:55,235
I have no idea.

589
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:01,668
You're not curious,
but you want to make sure.

590
00:38:03,234 --> 00:38:04,568
It's just as I texted.

591
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,300
I've killed close to 20 people.

592
00:38:07,801 --> 00:38:11,635
But thanks to you, I'm not in prison
and have been living a nice life.

593
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,201
I'm...

594
00:38:16,968 --> 00:38:18,602
...really grateful for you.

595
00:38:19,934 --> 00:38:22,768
If the real criminal is a woman,
then it must be her.

596
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:24,635
Ha Joohan, 34 years old.

597
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,333
Who is she?

598
00:38:26,434 --> 00:38:29,458
She was a long-term patient at
the ward where the incident occurred.

599
00:38:29,534 --> 00:38:30,534
A patient with Crohn's disease.

600
00:38:30,701 --> 00:38:35,302
But she was also admitted in
the same room as the other eight victims.

601
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,733
So she wasn't on the list of
suspects because she was a patient?

602
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:38,834
That's right.

603
00:38:39,033 --> 00:38:43,149
When all the patients were killed off,
Ha Joohan was also ill...

604
00:38:43,234 --> 00:38:44,901
...and was categorized
as one of the victims.

605
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:48,167
But why would a patient
kill off other patients?

606
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:51,200
Because it's so unfair.

607
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,801
I had to remove my intestines...

608
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,534
...and stomach and had gone through so
many operations for so many years...

609
00:39:00,634 --> 00:39:04,147
...but I didn't get any better,
but others did.

610
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:06,500
Plus, they got discharged
only in few days.

611
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And they said they felt sorry for me...

612
00:39:15,267 --> 00:39:17,768
You'll get better soon.
Cheer up.

613
00:39:20,334 --> 00:39:22,401
They were all talking nonsense.

614
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:25,300
So you killed all those people?

615
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,400
Do you think that justifies what you did?

616
00:39:27,501 --> 00:39:31,268
How can that justify what I did?

617
00:39:33,033 --> 00:39:34,467
So I gave up everything and thought...

618
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,934
...if I get caught, I'll get caught.

619
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:39,435
If I get punished, I'll get punished...

620
00:39:40,501 --> 00:39:42,235
That's what I thought...

621
00:39:46,601 --> 00:39:47,335
But wait!

622
00:39:50,167 --> 00:39:52,601
The prosecutor put someone else in jail.

623
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:56,601
And that was me?

624
00:39:58,667 --> 00:40:00,034
Then, this crossed my mind.

625
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:02,001
This is the first time...

626
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,601
...I found hope in my life.

627
00:40:06,033 --> 00:40:10,066
The person who gave me that
hope is you, Lee Yoobum.

628
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,868
And I hope...

629
00:40:14,467 --> 00:40:15,600
...you can continue...

630
00:40:16,868 --> 00:40:18,669
...to be that hope for me
until the very end.

631
00:40:21,567 --> 00:40:24,468
So have you to put that
Ha Joohan on the wanted list?

632
00:40:24,701 --> 00:40:27,202
Yes, but she hasn't come home
in a long time and has been...

633
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,734
...switching from burner phones
to burner phones...

634
00:40:29,834 --> 00:40:31,234
...so it's been hard to trace her.

635
00:40:32,334 --> 00:40:34,202
All her records of credit and
transportation cards,

636
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,867
are gone after the arson.

637
00:40:35,968 --> 00:40:38,101
It means that she'll try to
run away until the very end.

638
00:40:38,834 --> 00:40:41,901
She can try to run but that won't
last very long in today's world.

639
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,567
She's been on the run for over a year
in today's world after murder.

640
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,500
I'm sure she thinks it'll work this
time since it worked last time.

641
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:59,067
So Attorney Lee, make another
miracle happen like you did last time.

642
00:40:59,701 --> 00:41:03,101
Give me hope. Okay?

643
00:41:04,501 --> 00:41:06,035
I can't listen to this any longer.

644
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:13,201
When did I ever become
hope for a trash like you?

645
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,649
Why am I a trash?

646
00:41:14,734 --> 00:41:17,034
Because you've killed people!

647
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,801
I can't do anything about that...

648
00:41:21,701 --> 00:41:23,202
...since it's already in the past.

649
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,234
Of course....

650
00:41:29,868 --> 00:41:31,369
...it's a sad thing.

651
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:34,868
But those who are living
need to continue their life.

652
00:41:34,934 --> 00:41:38,756
In reality, who would benefit from
knowing that I'm the real culprit?

653
00:41:38,901 --> 00:41:41,235
To the family of the victims,
Myung Yiseok is the jerk.

654
00:41:41,334 --> 00:41:43,367
And that jerk already died...

655
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:47,001
...and that somewhat was a consolation
to them. But what if I suddenly appear?

656
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,433
It'll break their hearts.

657
00:41:50,601 --> 00:41:52,361
And what about Myung Yiseok's son?

658
00:41:52,434 --> 00:41:55,268
He'll go insane knowing
that his father is innocent.

659
00:41:55,968 --> 00:41:57,035
And you...

660
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:01,768
What are you going to do?

661
00:42:03,934 --> 00:42:04,868
Be quiet.

662
00:42:05,868 --> 00:42:06,802
I...

663
00:42:07,367 --> 00:42:09,534
...was really shocked
after hearing the news.

664
00:42:10,133 --> 00:42:12,834
That the bottle of medication was
found in Myung Yiseok's office.

665
00:42:17,667 --> 00:42:19,234
You were probably anxious.

666
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,834
It was obvious that
Myung Yiseok was the culprit.

667
00:42:21,901 --> 00:42:23,802
But no direct evidence came out.

668
00:42:24,033 --> 00:42:26,534
The media kept questioning
the prosecutor's competence...

669
00:42:26,701 --> 00:42:28,635
...so you probably manipulated
the confiscated bottles...

670
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,801
...as Myung Yiseok's, right?

671
00:42:31,667 --> 00:42:33,282
The bottles were already there!

672
00:42:33,367 --> 00:42:35,235
Then, why are you calling me a killer?

673
00:42:35,334 --> 00:42:38,215
If the bottles were found there
then Myung Yiseok is the killer.

674
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,801
So, why call me a piece of trash?

675
00:42:41,868 --> 00:42:42,762
Tell me.

676
00:42:44,367 --> 00:42:45,701
You understand now, right?

677
00:42:46,801 --> 00:42:48,302
If I go down...

678
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:51,402
...you're going down with me.

679
00:42:57,467 --> 00:42:58,667
Don't worry.

680
00:42:59,801 --> 00:43:02,101
The only people in the world
that knows that you've manipulated it...

681
00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:06,200
...is just you and me.

682
00:43:07,934 --> 00:43:11,501
It was three of us until recently,
but I got rid of him.

683
00:43:15,434 --> 00:43:16,168
You got rid of him?

684
00:43:17,367 --> 00:43:20,734
You saw the news on
the container arson, right?

685
00:43:21,334 --> 00:43:22,501
That was your doing?

686
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:25,402
Someone who knew all
about our story was living there.

687
00:43:26,534 --> 00:43:29,701
He's not the type to talk...

688
00:43:30,534 --> 00:43:32,435
...but unfortunately he got
involved with the police...

689
00:43:34,934 --> 00:43:37,601
You were here?

690
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:39,967
Yes.

691
00:43:41,267 --> 00:43:42,467
The door was open.

692
00:43:42,901 --> 00:43:44,435
Aren't the gloves too much when it's hot?

693
00:43:46,033 --> 00:43:49,100
It's better to be hot
than being in danger.

694
00:43:49,601 --> 00:43:50,402
Yes.

695
00:43:51,067 --> 00:43:53,035
I took care of your phone.

696
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,867
I threw it deep in Han River and
didn't say anything to the police.

697
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:57,802
So don't worry.

698
00:44:00,634 --> 00:44:01,634
Inpyo.

699
00:44:06,934 --> 00:44:07,967
Thanks.

700
00:44:17,033 --> 00:44:19,534
I took care of all the dirty deeds...

701
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,500
...so you take care of the rest.

702
00:44:23,667 --> 00:44:28,434
Family of the victims,
Myung Yiseok's son, you and me...

703
00:44:28,834 --> 00:44:30,435
Let us all be in peace.

704
00:44:37,701 --> 00:44:41,068
You know the meaning of conceal, right?

705
00:45:21,534 --> 00:45:22,667
Now you understand, right?

706
00:45:22,767 --> 00:45:26,368
If I go down, you're going down with me.

707
00:45:27,534 --> 00:45:30,667
I received information that
the real culprit is not Myung Yiseok.

708
00:45:31,601 --> 00:45:32,768
Don't worry.

709
00:45:33,033 --> 00:45:35,033
The only people in the world
that knows that you've manipulated it...

710
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,649
...is just you and me.

711
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:40,968
Our reporting department has made
a new task for on Myung Yiseok's.

712
00:45:41,067 --> 00:45:43,367
You know the meaning of conceal, right?

713
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,600
I have to figure something out.

714
00:46:03,801 --> 00:46:05,868
"Notification on Electricity Maintenance"

715
00:46:05,968 --> 00:46:09,135
"Starts at 9 PM on June 28th
until 6 AM on June 29th"

716
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,567
You were thinking for a long time.

717
00:46:29,634 --> 00:46:30,468
What do you say?

718
00:46:31,834 --> 00:46:33,535
Will you take on my case?

719
00:46:34,634 --> 00:46:35,568
Before that...

720
00:46:37,067 --> 00:46:38,801
...there's something that you missed.

721
00:46:40,334 --> 00:46:41,202
What is it?

722
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,734
There are three people that know
about the manipulation aside from us.

723
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:48,300
Who else knows?

724
00:46:50,534 --> 00:46:51,868
Would you like something?

725
00:46:53,234 --> 00:46:56,534
You're the only one who
truly thinks about me.

726
00:46:56,634 --> 00:46:57,868
You're so nice.

727
00:46:58,601 --> 00:46:59,668
A lot of meat.

728
00:47:01,234 --> 00:47:02,168
Right?

729
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,400
I'm so pretty and nice like this.

730
00:47:04,701 --> 00:47:07,101
And yet why can't I get
a man like Lieutenant Han?

731
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,299
Don't be like that.

732
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,235
It's a punishment for
someone like Lieutenant Han.

733
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:18,635
So, Prosecutor Lee and
Prosecutor Jung think that...

734
00:47:18,734 --> 00:47:21,668
...the IV serial killer case
was really manipulated?

735
00:47:21,767 --> 00:47:22,401
Yes.

736
00:47:23,033 --> 00:47:27,534
That case was investigated
by Attorney Lee and Mr. Choi...

737
00:47:27,801 --> 00:47:29,934
Does that mean they both manipulated it?

738
00:47:30,534 --> 00:47:32,435
Prosecutor Lee thinks that way...

739
00:47:32,534 --> 00:47:36,468
...but Prosecutor Jung keeps denying
that Mr. Choi would do such a thing.

740
00:47:36,567 --> 00:47:38,168
It's a case where over 10 people died...

741
00:47:38,267 --> 00:47:41,577
...so if it comes out as manipulated then
many people will get be in trouble.

742
00:47:41,667 --> 00:47:46,434
I think that's why Prosecutor Jung is
working even harder to protect Mr. Choi.

743
00:48:28,968 --> 00:48:30,202
Do you have an interview?

744
00:48:30,267 --> 00:48:34,934
Yes, I have an interview
with the victims' families.

745
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,700
You said you'll write fairly, right?

746
00:48:40,801 --> 00:48:44,001
Can I have an interview
at my office tonight at 8 PM?

747
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,634
So many interviews.

748
00:48:47,234 --> 00:48:49,168
Attorney Lee wants an interview.

749
00:48:49,334 --> 00:48:52,568
He's the prosecutor in charge of the IV
serial killer case at that time, right?

750
00:48:52,667 --> 00:48:53,368
Yes.

751
00:48:53,634 --> 00:48:55,634
If there was a real culprit...

752
00:48:55,934 --> 00:48:58,967
...that means there was
a mistake on the investigation.

753
00:48:59,534 --> 00:49:01,435
-Go find out.
-Yes, sir.

754
00:49:07,968 --> 00:49:10,769
Is it going to rain today?

755
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:14,400
No. The possibility of rain
is only five percent.

756
00:49:15,634 --> 00:49:17,201
Ok, I'll be back.

757
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:22,001
Prosecutor Lee, here are
Mr. Choi's personnel records...

758
00:49:24,634 --> 00:49:25,801
What about that?

759
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,567
Where's Prosecutor Lee?

760
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:31,954
Did Prosecutor Lee ask
you to make copies of that?

761
00:49:32,033 --> 00:49:32,834
Yes.

762
00:49:33,167 --> 00:49:35,182
He's seriously going overboard.

763
00:49:35,267 --> 00:49:38,434
Can he find out if it's been
manipulated looking at this?

764
00:49:40,701 --> 00:49:43,402
What? What is it?

765
00:49:44,467 --> 00:49:45,301
You sure can.

766
00:49:45,367 --> 00:49:47,068
"Ilyoo Police Station"

767
00:49:48,667 --> 00:49:50,215
Mr. Choi used to be a cop?

768
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:53,234
Yes. That's why he's good
with crime scenes.

769
00:49:53,601 --> 00:49:55,035
Ilyoo Police Station...

770
00:49:55,234 --> 00:49:55,901
Why?

771
00:49:56,067 --> 00:49:57,506
Do you know that place?

772
00:49:57,667 --> 00:49:59,401
My father used to work here.

773
00:49:59,767 --> 00:50:01,201
Did they work together?

774
00:50:01,434 --> 00:50:02,601
Yes, they did.

775
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,768
Such coincidence.

776
00:50:09,167 --> 00:50:10,200
No way...

777
00:50:16,868 --> 00:50:17,702
Mr. Choi.

778
00:50:20,234 --> 00:50:22,768
He's not here. He quit.

779
00:50:23,133 --> 00:50:24,373
What do you mean he quit?

780
00:50:24,467 --> 00:50:28,634
After lunch, he suddenly turned
in his resignation letter and left.

781
00:50:28,934 --> 00:50:32,315
I tried to stop him saying
he should say bye to you at least...

782
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,400
...but he just left saying that
it'll be hard to leave if he sees you.

783
00:50:46,534 --> 00:50:50,268
Prosecutor Jung,
I didn't manipulate anything.

784
00:50:50,901 --> 00:50:54,268
Attorney Lee will probably
say the same thing.

785
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,067
It's obvious that both of us
will deny manipulating anything...

786
00:50:57,601 --> 00:51:00,634
...so our plead won't mean anything.

787
00:51:00,734 --> 00:51:04,901
So, don't worry about me or anyone else...

788
00:51:04,968 --> 00:51:07,435
...and just focus on
reinvestigating this case fairly.

789
00:51:08,567 --> 00:51:11,368
I'll also prove my innocence my own way.

790
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:14,632
Thank you for everything.

791
00:51:15,534 --> 00:51:17,201
"From Choi Damdong"

792
00:51:20,734 --> 00:51:24,435
This is too much.
How could he just quit like this?

793
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,567
What are we going to do?

794
00:51:30,133 --> 00:51:32,600
"Prosecutor Jung Jaechan"

795
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,201
Is it Jaechan?

796
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,300
I'm sure he called
because of the investigation.

797
00:51:40,868 --> 00:51:42,769
Is he bothering you over the IV case?

798
00:51:45,667 --> 00:51:47,901
Probably since I'm being suspected.

799
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,501
It'll be hard for you to handle it on
your own when investigation gets serious.

800
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,701
My law firm will help you.

801
00:51:55,767 --> 00:51:56,900
That makes me feel better.

802
00:51:59,334 --> 00:52:02,835
Hyangmi, don't tell anyone about
him quitting. He didn't quit, okay?

803
00:52:02,934 --> 00:52:04,435
No one at home is picking up either.

804
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,767
I'll visit his house.

805
00:52:08,868 --> 00:52:10,279
Okay. Give me a call if you see him.

806
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,868
Hold him so that he
doesn't go anywhere else.

807
00:52:11,968 --> 00:52:12,735
Okay.

808
00:52:15,968 --> 00:52:18,802
"Mr. Choi, please call me."

809
00:52:26,734 --> 00:52:27,934
Thank you for the food.

810
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,064
Take care.

811
00:52:29,133 --> 00:52:29,867
Yes.

812
00:52:31,534 --> 00:52:33,235
-I'll be going now. Keep in touch.
-Sure.

813
00:52:42,567 --> 00:52:45,334
"12 missed calls"

814
00:53:05,501 --> 00:53:06,901
"Nam Hongjoo"

815
00:53:12,467 --> 00:53:14,701
Hello, Hongjoo. I'm in my office.

816
00:53:15,701 --> 00:53:17,901
I told the front desk,
so you can just come up.

817
00:53:43,234 --> 00:53:45,768
"Notification on Electricity Maintenance"

818
00:53:52,334 --> 00:53:53,068
You're here.

819
00:53:53,167 --> 00:53:55,367
Yes, what are you doing?

820
00:53:55,667 --> 00:53:57,667
I was working on
the investigation for IV case.

821
00:53:57,767 --> 00:53:59,621
It's hard to remember
since it was a year ago...

822
00:53:59,701 --> 00:54:01,954
...so I thought it'd be helpful
to organize it into a file.

823
00:54:02,334 --> 00:54:03,835
Please wait a bit.

824
00:54:04,133 --> 00:54:05,067
Sure.

825
00:54:06,734 --> 00:54:08,468
Are you going to give me
a copy of that file as well?

826
00:54:08,534 --> 00:54:11,001
Of course.
I'm making it for you.

827
00:54:14,234 --> 00:54:15,468
Is it for press release?

828
00:54:16,133 --> 00:54:17,800
Are you sharing it with others as well?

829
00:54:24,334 --> 00:54:25,101
No.

830
00:54:26,167 --> 00:54:27,467
You're the first one.

831
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,601
I haven't contacted anywhere else.

832
00:54:32,667 --> 00:54:36,067
I can't promise that I'll write nicely
even if I'm the first one to get it.

833
00:54:39,501 --> 00:54:40,935
Of course.

834
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:10,426
Excuse me. We'll be conducting maintenance
soon, so all powers will be out.

835
00:55:10,501 --> 00:55:13,501
I have a meeting with Attorney Lee.

836
00:55:13,634 --> 00:55:15,001
I'll be right out.

837
00:55:15,167 --> 00:55:16,701
It'll be brief.

838
00:55:22,167 --> 00:55:23,001
No!

839
00:55:30,367 --> 00:55:33,335
After she takes this,
she won't be able to breath...

840
00:55:33,934 --> 00:55:38,067
...and die after 5 minutes
as if she's falling asleep.

841
00:55:38,267 --> 00:55:39,400
Jaechan...

842
00:55:39,968 --> 00:55:41,101
Did you hear everything?

843
00:55:41,434 --> 00:55:42,501
Please...

844
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:57,701
Hongjoo, please...

845
00:55:57,968 --> 00:55:59,101
Please pick up.

846
00:55:59,501 --> 00:56:01,868
"Youngdeok Crab"

847
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:16,335
Is she the other one that knows about it?

848
00:56:18,234 --> 00:56:18,968
Yes.

849
00:56:47,934 --> 00:56:48,616
Hello?

850
00:56:48,701 --> 00:56:50,602
I just had a dream of
Hongjoo getting kidnapped.

851
00:56:50,701 --> 00:56:52,315
-Kidnapped?
-Kidnapped?

852
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,201
What do you mean? Who?

853
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:55,134
That dream.

854
00:56:55,234 --> 00:56:56,701
The green umbrella on a rainy day.

855
00:56:56,767 --> 00:56:57,800
When is it?

856
00:56:58,701 --> 00:57:00,335
10:30 PM, in 15 minutes.

857
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,867
Where is it? A mountain?

858
00:57:02,934 --> 00:57:04,001
It's not a mountain.

859
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,268
It's the roof of Haekwang Law Firm.

860
00:58:34,167 --> 00:58:36,135
"While You Were Sleeping"

861
00:58:36,567 --> 00:58:39,667
There's a death that's been blessed.
Do you want to become a killer?

862
00:58:39,767 --> 00:58:41,501
I just want to get rid
of a piece of trash.

863
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:42,701
Please hang in there.

864
00:58:43,133 --> 00:58:45,133
There'll be a fair argument.

865
00:58:45,234 --> 00:58:48,844
Why did you left me
alone at a time like this?

866
00:58:48,934 --> 00:58:50,701
I want to take responsibility as well.

867
00:58:50,901 --> 00:58:53,288
My carelessness is not illegal.

868
00:58:53,367 --> 00:58:57,534
Don't just make assumptions.
Think towards what makes sense.

869
00:58:57,601 --> 00:58:59,402
I think what I'm making more sense.

870
00:58:59,467 --> 00:59:00,149
I'm curious.

871
00:59:00,234 --> 00:59:02,102
I wonder whose words
will make sense this time.
