1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,134
"While You Were Sleeping"

2
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:09,735
"Episode 2"

3
00:00:17,312 --> 00:00:19,085
Who is the owner of that white car?

4
00:00:22,738 --> 00:00:23,223
That's me.

5
00:00:23,308 --> 00:00:24,546
What about this silver car?

6
00:00:24,688 --> 00:00:25,480
That's me.

7
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:26,895
You can come to the station later.

8
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,010
You should go to the hospital first.

9
00:00:29,188 --> 00:00:29,740
Yes.

10
00:01:00,824 --> 00:01:01,895
Are you okay?

11
00:01:07,188 --> 00:01:09,491
You should just look forward
since we're okay.

12
00:01:09,576 --> 00:01:10,203
Excuse me?

13
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:13,106
Yes.

14
00:01:19,804 --> 00:01:21,047
I believe in you.

15
00:01:22,419 --> 00:01:23,416
Because it's me...

16
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,652
...I can believe in you.

17
00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:30,090
How can you believe in me?

18
00:01:30,885 --> 00:01:31,382
Excuse me?

19
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:35,767
What do you mean?

20
00:01:35,852 --> 00:01:37,204
About what I said earlier...

21
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,173
When I said that you and your
mother will die because of Yoobum...

22
00:01:41,387 --> 00:01:43,503
I don't think I'd
believe you if I was you.

23
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:46,172
I think I'd get angry also.

24
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:50,377
I'm not angry.

25
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,380
I sincerely believe that you saved me.

26
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:56,414
Why do you believe me?

27
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,809
But I'm not saying that I lied...

28
00:02:00,894 --> 00:02:01,980
You had a dream, didn't you?

29
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:05,579
And that dream kept coming true...

30
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:06,368
Isn't that right?

31
00:02:08,346 --> 00:02:09,663
How did you...

32
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,399
I have dreams like that too.

33
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,635
And those dreams always come true.

34
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,971
Like yours.

35
00:03:03,414 --> 00:03:04,275
Are you okay?

36
00:03:05,122 --> 00:03:05,979
You're sweating so much.

37
00:03:08,446 --> 00:03:09,856
I guess she's feeling hot.

38
00:03:11,646 --> 00:03:12,698
You're okay, aren't you, honey?

39
00:03:13,646 --> 00:03:14,483
Yes.

40
00:03:17,846 --> 00:03:19,566
You keep having those kinds of dreams?

41
00:03:20,646 --> 00:03:22,168
Yes. I have many dreams like that.

42
00:03:22,813 --> 00:03:23,937
Was that your first time for you?

43
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,138
Yes.

44
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,708
How much of the future...

45
00:03:29,005 --> 00:03:30,977
So how much further into
the future do you see?

46
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:31,878
Ah!

47
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,547
I'm not asking you because I believe you.

48
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,549
There's isn't a set time.

49
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,867
Sometimes it's few months
into the future...

50
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,387
.. and sometimes
it's just couple of days later...

51
00:03:41,182 --> 00:03:43,156
It can be just few minutes later too.

52
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,025
Has your dream ever been wrong?

53
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,193
No. Never.

54
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,678
There are dreams that
haven't happened yet...

55
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:50,838
...but they're never been wrong.

56
00:03:50,923 --> 00:03:52,113
And you've never tried to change them?

57
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,969
That's why you're amazing.

58
00:03:57,579 --> 00:03:59,305
Did I really save someone?

59
00:03:59,613 --> 00:04:00,273
Yes.

60
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,630
Then what happens now?

61
00:04:05,442 --> 00:04:11,989
I'm not saying that I believe you,
but if I did change the future earlier...

62
00:04:12,074 --> 00:04:16,222
If we say that I changed the future,
what will happen?

63
00:04:19,453 --> 00:04:20,541
I'm not sure.

64
00:04:22,718 --> 00:04:24,166
When you stop the water
from flowing one direction...

65
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:26,537
...it will flow to a different direction.

66
00:04:27,072 --> 00:04:29,912
Now that you stopped
an event that was to happen...

67
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,578
...the time will flow
to a different direction.

68
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:36,284
I really have to lose more weight.

69
00:04:36,718 --> 00:04:38,095
Why were you so late today?

70
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,646
Don't even ask.

71
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:42,348
I almost died today.

72
00:04:43,377 --> 00:04:45,780
I'm going to die if
I don't lose weight too.

73
00:04:49,984 --> 00:04:52,343
Yes. I try to work on
my conditioning usually.

74
00:04:52,428 --> 00:04:53,912
I practiced very hard.

75
00:04:53,997 --> 00:04:55,080
Yes. Miss Park Soyun.

76
00:04:55,146 --> 00:04:58,336
You are the first Korean to make it to the
finals of an International Competition.

77
00:04:58,421 --> 00:05:00,000
Please tell us how you feel.

78
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:03,085
Many people were cheering for me.

79
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,672
I hope I can do my best so
that I don't disappoint them...

80
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,376
Mom.

81
00:05:08,461 --> 00:05:08,988
Honey.

82
00:05:09,073 --> 00:05:09,909
Madam.

83
00:05:10,103 --> 00:05:11,541
Hey. Call 911. Right now!

84
00:05:13,053 --> 00:05:14,014
-Honey.
-Mom!

85
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,226
What is this?

86
00:05:23,812 --> 00:05:25,225
I didn't do this.

87
00:05:28,022 --> 00:05:29,310
Is this the police?

88
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:30,896
I'm calling from Ivana Art Hall.

89
00:05:30,981 --> 00:05:32,937
I'd like to report
a domestic violence case.

90
00:05:33,022 --> 00:05:34,520
I said I didn't do this!

91
00:05:36,013 --> 00:05:38,192
Mom. Please wake up.

92
00:05:38,277 --> 00:05:39,190
Mom.

93
00:05:41,071 --> 00:05:42,957
If the time flows
to a different direction...

94
00:05:43,313 --> 00:05:44,978
...which way will it flow?

95
00:05:45,146 --> 00:05:47,364
To a better direction or worse direction?

96
00:05:47,645 --> 00:05:51,002
I don't know because I've never
changed the future before.

97
00:05:51,087 --> 00:05:52,532
But what I'm certain is that...

98
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:57,529
...it won't look that much different from
the original future which was set.

99
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,069
Don't you think the differences
from both events...

100
00:06:01,747 --> 00:06:03,982
...will be greater as more time passes by?

101
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:05,899
Do you know who I am?

102
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:20,622
Soyun.

103
00:06:22,264 --> 00:06:23,302
Are you okay?

104
00:06:25,277 --> 00:06:26,753
How did you get here?

105
00:06:27,116 --> 00:06:27,957
Well.

106
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,758
I was just passing by.

107
00:06:34,307 --> 00:06:35,228
You...

108
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:38,031
Don't say anything to our friends
about what happened today.

109
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,867
You didn't see anything.
Do you understand?

110
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,371
Okay.

111
00:06:52,046 --> 00:06:52,998
I won't say anything.

112
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,314
Never.

113
00:06:59,738 --> 00:07:00,587
Okay...

114
00:07:01,914 --> 00:07:02,767
Thanks.

115
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,095
I'm certain that the time will flow to
a different direction from now on.

116
00:07:09,926 --> 00:07:12,979
For better or for worse.

117
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:14,767
I guess so.

118
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:18,037
Now it's my turn to ask you.

119
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,181
Why did you come to save me?

120
00:07:22,266 --> 00:07:24,215
It must've been just a dream to you.

121
00:07:24,447 --> 00:07:26,773
Why did you go so far
as to destroying a car...

122
00:07:26,858 --> 00:07:28,693
...in order to save me?

123
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,819
I'm not sure.

124
00:07:35,614 --> 00:07:37,023
I guess you're not sure.

125
00:07:37,294 --> 00:07:39,123
I think I get it right away.

126
00:07:40,072 --> 00:07:40,934
What do you mean?

127
00:07:44,684 --> 00:07:47,809
When did you start falling for me?

128
00:07:49,076 --> 00:07:49,918
Excuse me?

129
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,480
I fell for someone? Who?

130
00:07:51,565 --> 00:07:53,166
Me? I fell for you?

131
00:07:56,814 --> 00:07:57,814
Bingo.

132
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,928
I think you have a misunderstanding.

133
00:08:03,013 --> 00:08:04,447
You fell for me when I hugged you, right?

134
00:08:04,514 --> 00:08:06,287
That's why you hugged me too.

135
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,488
That's because you hugged me...

136
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:10,262
...so I just hugged you
without any feelings...

137
00:08:10,347 --> 00:08:12,085
You held me for such a long time for
someone who has no feelings for me.

138
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,163
You patted me too.

139
00:08:13,248 --> 00:08:15,027
Do you usually hug women
who mean nothing to you?

140
00:08:15,112 --> 00:08:16,062
No.

141
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:18,369
Then I'm not just any woman to you.

142
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:19,306
What is it?

143
00:08:19,445 --> 00:08:20,873
What's so special about me?

144
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,344
What about me that attracted you?

145
00:08:23,431 --> 00:08:24,399
Why...

146
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:27,507
Why does it have to mean that way?

147
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:28,877
That might not be it.

148
00:08:28,962 --> 00:08:31,979
You hugged me after you came to save me,
so you must've fallen for me before that.

149
00:08:32,197 --> 00:08:35,098
Then perhaps at the bus stop?

150
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:40,687
If not, maybe when you
brought me the rice cake?

151
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:43,622
Oh my goodness...

152
00:08:43,707 --> 00:08:45,062
I'm right.

153
00:08:45,832 --> 00:08:47,764
But you fell for me just
by hearing my voice?

154
00:08:48,315 --> 00:08:49,477
That's amazing.

155
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:50,312
Wait...

156
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,130
Did you move across from my house
because of me?

157
00:08:54,896 --> 00:08:56,936
This is driving me crazy.

158
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:02,142
"A good person"

159
00:09:07,698 --> 00:09:08,763
Which police station?

160
00:09:09,568 --> 00:09:10,206
Yes.

161
00:09:11,764 --> 00:09:13,698
What's the charge and suspicion?

162
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,698
"A bad person"

163
00:09:18,489 --> 00:09:20,259
Wow. I got goose bumps.

164
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:23,896
You moved across the street from my house
on purpose because of me, didn't you?

165
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,267
"A weird person"

166
00:09:27,405 --> 00:09:30,635
"A good person, a bad person,
a weird person"

167
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,864
Are you okay?

168
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,788
Wake up, Jaechan.

169
00:10:25,563 --> 00:10:27,126
You're late. You're late.

170
00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:28,499
You're late.

171
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:30,405
Hey! Jeez!

172
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,083
You jerk...

173
00:10:32,183 --> 00:10:33,166
What time is it?

174
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,290
Hey. Make me a bowl too.

175
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,177
You should make one yourself.

176
00:10:44,316 --> 00:10:45,703
I'm troubled also.

177
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:48,719
You're acting mysterious.

178
00:10:48,804 --> 00:10:50,116
Do you have senioritis or something?

179
00:10:51,207 --> 00:10:52,139
Jaechan, it's...

180
00:10:54,285 --> 00:10:56,973
Don't say anything to our friends
about what happened today.

181
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,417
It's nothing.
It's nothing.

182
00:11:00,517 --> 00:11:02,020
What is it? Now you're into
mysticism or something?

183
00:11:04,335 --> 00:11:06,152
Anyway, what's going on with you
and the woman across the street?

184
00:11:06,237 --> 00:11:07,096
Are you dating her?

185
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:09,425
You want to die, don't you?

186
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,235
You're bored with living, aren't you?

187
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,255
Why? You were so worried about her before.

188
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,943
You even destroyed your car to save her.

189
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:22,815
Mom. I think that man is
head over heels for me.

190
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:24,795
Which man?

191
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:28,918
The young and handsome guys
who moved in across the street?

192
00:11:28,984 --> 00:11:29,863
My gosh.

193
00:11:29,948 --> 00:11:32,899
Then what about that lawyer, Yoobum?

194
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:37,663
Mom. Don't even talk about that jerk.

195
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:41,465
He would've framed me
so that he could live.

196
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,995
So you're going to break up with him?

197
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:44,439
Then how can I keep seeing him?

198
00:11:44,524 --> 00:11:46,485
He could've let you and I die.

199
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,560
Then you're going to start liking the man
across the street from now on?

200
00:11:50,068 --> 00:11:50,869
No.

201
00:11:51,884 --> 00:11:56,078
I'm just saying that
I'm going to do what's right.

202
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,517
Do what's right?

203
00:11:57,685 --> 00:11:58,983
What do you mean?

204
00:11:59,068 --> 00:12:03,022
Jaechan saved your life and mine.

205
00:12:03,224 --> 00:12:05,683
I have to consider it as repaying him back
for his kindness for the rest of my life.

206
00:12:06,055 --> 00:12:07,660
Isn't that the right thing to do?

207
00:12:08,016 --> 00:12:10,131
How are you going to repay him
for his kindness?

208
00:12:10,216 --> 00:12:14,150
I can tell by looking at him that
he can't make a move on women.

209
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,384
What can I do?
I'll have to accept him.

210
00:12:16,483 --> 00:12:17,150
Don't you think so?

211
00:12:17,216 --> 00:12:18,382
You should think carefully.

212
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:21,284
You might be repaying him with
vengeance rather than kindness...

213
00:12:21,703 --> 00:12:22,751
Vengeance?

214
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,432
That's nice too.

215
00:12:25,517 --> 00:12:27,418
Just like Romeo and Juliet...

216
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,945
That's exciting.

217
00:12:33,216 --> 00:12:34,820
That woman is crazy.

218
00:12:35,336 --> 00:12:38,617
She said that I fell for her.
She's delusional and snobby.

219
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,698
A person like that has to go see a doctor.

220
00:12:40,783 --> 00:12:44,307
The have to make a law that a person like
that has to wear flowers in her hair.

221
00:12:44,392 --> 00:12:45,898
That way people can
avoid people like that.

222
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,050
It was so unfortunate
to meet someone like that.

223
00:12:48,116 --> 00:12:49,852
You said so.

224
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:52,884
She looked so sad in your dream.

225
00:12:52,983 --> 00:12:54,668
I'm not sad for her.

226
00:12:54,781 --> 00:12:56,040
No. I'm scared of her.

227
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,714
I think I saved her because I was scared.

228
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:00,405
No. I didn't save her.

229
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,998
The dream was nonsense,
so don't even bring it up anymore.

230
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,658
People will say that I'm crazy.

231
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,254
Yes.
Yes...

232
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,269
Who could it be at his hour?

233
00:13:17,984 --> 00:13:18,585
Oh?

234
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,366
It's the woman from across the street.

235
00:13:22,016 --> 00:13:22,875
What?

236
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,638
I'm Nam Hongjoo who
lives across the street.

237
00:13:29,723 --> 00:13:31,451
Yes. What is it?

238
00:13:31,517 --> 00:13:33,617
Oh my...
I wonder who has such a nice voice.

239
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,482
Let me see your face. I'm curious.

240
00:13:37,177 --> 00:13:39,092
-What's wrong with her?
-See? She's not in her right mind.

241
00:13:39,177 --> 00:13:40,272
She has to put flowers in her hair.

242
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,873
I can hear everything.

243
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:43,733
I made someone rice balls.

244
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:45,683
I wanted to share some with you.

245
00:13:46,622 --> 00:13:47,668
Hello. Miss Nam Hongjoo.

246
00:13:47,753 --> 00:13:48,627
Yes.

247
00:13:48,712 --> 00:13:51,183
I can't believe the story
about the dreams.

248
00:13:51,396 --> 00:13:55,084
So I didn't save you,
so there's no need for you to repay me.

249
00:13:55,206 --> 00:13:56,866
I'm going to turn down the rice balls too.

250
00:14:00,817 --> 00:14:02,276
She should've understood, right?

251
00:14:02,878 --> 00:14:04,751
You can't believe it?

252
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,868
I totally get it.

253
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,465
"Flower"

254
00:14:25,554 --> 00:14:27,602
Hello.

255
00:15:18,624 --> 00:15:23,594
Sparrows are chirping.
Chicks are cheeping.

256
00:15:23,683 --> 00:15:28,867
Sparrows are chirping.
Chicks are cheeping.

257
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:32,389
A tall man with long
arms will get it out for you.

258
00:15:34,126 --> 00:15:35,401
His name is Jung Jaechan.

259
00:15:47,568 --> 00:15:49,871
Thank you. Mr. Jung Jaechan.

260
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,776
Welcome.

261
00:16:10,981 --> 00:16:14,598
In three minutes, a tall man
with long arms will be here.

262
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:16,484
He's wearing a beige color coat.

263
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,645
When he comes...

264
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:22,368
-I'd like...
-Your order is an Americano...

265
00:16:22,453 --> 00:16:24,344
...with double shot
of hazelnut syrup, right?

266
00:16:26,016 --> 00:16:28,183
Yes. That's right.

267
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,424
I'll charge your card.

268
00:17:00,391 --> 00:17:02,455
"Kiyoung Station"

269
00:17:45,037 --> 00:17:46,013
Do you know each other?

270
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,032
-No.
-Yes.

271
00:17:47,617 --> 00:17:48,151
Should I change seats with you?

272
00:17:48,236 --> 00:17:49,451
-No. That's okay.
-Thank you.

273
00:17:57,421 --> 00:18:00,261
It's me, Nam Hongjoo.
I live across the street from you.

274
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:01,643
I know.

275
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:04,883
You have a lot of questions
right now, don't you?

276
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,301
You must be wondering if I followed you...

277
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,722
...but I was on the train before you.
So you don't think so.

278
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,669
It's too strange for
it to be a coincidence.

279
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:13,993
Am I right?

280
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,061
Do you know how to read minds too?

281
00:18:16,614 --> 00:18:17,984
I did follow you.

282
00:18:18,403 --> 00:18:20,799
Because I saw you going
to work in my dream.

283
00:18:26,778 --> 00:18:29,041
I saw the balloon
getting caught in a tree.

284
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:31,910
I saw you order coffee.

285
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:37,516
I also saw you riding
the train to work today.

286
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:40,142
I even saw which platform you
were going to take the train from.

287
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:47,593
I see the future in my dreams.
It's not nonsense.

288
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:52,084
So, you did save me and
I am indebted to you.

289
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:53,069
Right?

290
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,432
"This train is for Jang am"

291
00:19:05,517 --> 00:19:06,794
Why aren't you answering me?

292
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,741
I came all the way here
to hear your answer.

293
00:19:09,672 --> 00:19:10,416
That's right.

294
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,284
You'll need this later.

295
00:19:15,783 --> 00:19:18,206
I don't believe in what you said.

296
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,987
You said you dreamt about me.
Why can't you believe me now?

297
00:19:21,072 --> 00:19:22,561
It's not that I can't believe you.

298
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,697
I won't believe you.

299
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:25,664
Excuse me?

300
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,933
I won't believe it because
I don't want to believe it.

301
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,850
Even if I have another dream
like that I'll never believe it.

302
00:19:33,149 --> 00:19:35,274
I don't care if someone dies in my dream.

303
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:36,850
Why not?

304
00:19:36,955 --> 00:19:38,893
If I believe in it,
I'll have to save that person.

305
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,218
If I don't do it,
I'll be responsible for it.

306
00:19:40,316 --> 00:19:41,899
I'll have to blame myself to no end.

307
00:19:41,984 --> 00:19:43,061
How can I handle something like that?

308
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,152
Can you handle something like that?

309
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:53,896
No.

310
00:19:58,151 --> 00:19:59,698
If you can't handle it,
you should ignore it.

311
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,617
Just consider it as bad dreams.

312
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,150
That would be better
for your mental health.

313
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,553
If you really want to change the future...

314
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,426
...you should look for
someone else other than me.

315
00:20:11,871 --> 00:20:13,379
You're the only one I found.

316
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:41,673
I don't know why it has to be you.

317
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:51,884
You should look longer.

318
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,286
If there are two,
there might be three or four our there.

319
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,034
There's aren't anyone else.

320
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,004
It's just you.

321
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,159
Father.

322
00:21:19,477 --> 00:21:21,561
I had a strange dream yesterday.

323
00:21:21,984 --> 00:21:22,878
What dream was it?

324
00:21:23,225 --> 00:21:26,685
One, two, three...

325
00:21:29,717 --> 00:21:31,290
I dreamt that you died.

326
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:33,792
How did I die?

327
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,461
Did I bleed a lot?

328
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,931
I had to bleed a lot
for it to be a good dream?

329
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:41,033
Put more snap on your wrist.

330
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:42,432
One more time.

331
00:21:42,517 --> 00:21:44,937
Your bus exploded in my dream.

332
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:46,839
It exploded?

333
00:21:47,617 --> 00:21:48,184
How?

334
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:52,218
A soldier got on your bus,
but he had a gun and a grenade.

335
00:21:52,303 --> 00:21:54,580
You brat. Do you think this is America?

336
00:21:54,861 --> 00:21:57,584
That's not realistic at all.

337
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:59,051
I mean it.

338
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:02,721
He set off the grenade in
the bus so everyone died.

339
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,056
That was what happened.

340
00:22:05,216 --> 00:22:06,101
Father.

341
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,927
Can you not go to work today?

342
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:12,073
That dream felt so real.

343
00:22:12,672 --> 00:22:13,332
Is that right?

344
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:14,733
Then...

345
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,772
...I'll consider it if
you grant me my wish.

346
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,123
What wish?

347
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,028
My gosh!

348
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:28,593
I don't want to. I'll never do it.

349
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:34,353
It's not that big of a wish.
Why won't you do it?

350
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:50,402
You'll need this later.

351
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:56,141
Darn it.

352
00:23:00,383 --> 00:23:03,215
The weather forecast is never right.

353
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,251
Good morning, sir.

354
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,450
Look who it is.
It's our newest prosecutor.

355
00:23:08,535 --> 00:23:11,252
Yes. Did you bring an umbrella?
.

356
00:23:12,707 --> 00:23:14,717
No. I'll go and get an umbrella from
the convenience store right away.

357
00:23:14,817 --> 00:23:15,712
Sir.

358
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,145
Prosecutor Shin.

359
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,636
Where's your car?

360
00:23:18,721 --> 00:23:20,721
My car isn't allowed to be
driven today under the law.

361
00:23:21,797 --> 00:23:23,735
Did you bring an umbrella today?

362
00:23:25,817 --> 00:23:27,988
-Of course.
-My gosh.

363
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,051
I'll take you all the way
to the office safely.

364
00:23:30,136 --> 00:23:31,617
Yes. That'd be great.

365
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:36,140
Prosecutor Jung. What can I do?

366
00:23:36,225 --> 00:23:37,750
I don't think I can take all three of us.

367
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:41,559
I'm fine, so you can just escort him.

368
00:23:43,263 --> 00:23:44,565
Okay. Excuse me.

369
00:23:46,283 --> 00:23:47,383
Let's go, sir.

370
00:23:47,483 --> 00:23:48,480
Yes.

371
00:23:50,383 --> 00:23:53,698
By the way, why is the newest
prosecutor speaking informally to you?

372
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:56,484
I think it's because
I was his junior in school.

373
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,518
What happened at
school doesn't matter here.

374
00:23:57,617 --> 00:23:59,067
He needs to respect
the order in our office.

375
00:23:59,261 --> 00:24:01,540
I don't think he understands things.

376
00:24:01,957 --> 00:24:03,003
I know.

377
00:24:03,088 --> 00:24:06,177
Our newest prosecutor
has a long way to go.

378
00:24:31,641 --> 00:24:33,598
I'm sorry.
I'm a little late, aren't I?

379
00:24:33,683 --> 00:24:35,590
It started raining suddenly.

380
00:24:36,702 --> 00:24:39,432
You went too far this time.

381
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:42,460
I looked at your wife's examination record
and saw that you broke six of her ribs.

382
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,520
Our colleagues went through
a lot to get rid of the CCTV footage.

383
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:49,752
I know that they went through a lot.

384
00:24:49,837 --> 00:24:52,016
That's why I paid them each with
a watch for their time spent.

385
00:24:55,563 --> 00:24:57,452
It will be complicated if it
becomes a charge of injury.

386
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:00,841
So, I'll speak with the hospital and
bring down to a charge of assault.

387
00:25:00,931 --> 00:25:04,436
You should write a letter of apology
according to the date just in case.

388
00:25:07,051 --> 00:25:08,774
You know what you need to do once
you're charged with assault, right?

389
00:25:09,392 --> 00:25:12,341
You need to have your wife sign a letter
saying that she won't press charges.

390
00:25:12,441 --> 00:25:12,746
Only then...

391
00:25:12,831 --> 00:25:16,014
Then, I won't be prosecuted
because she's not pressing charges.

392
00:25:16,161 --> 00:25:18,875
I know. This isn't the first time.

393
00:25:21,383 --> 00:25:23,359
Your wife should write a letter
of refusal to press charges, right?

394
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:27,456
If she doesn't, it will mean that
she's going to make me a criminal.

395
00:25:27,541 --> 00:25:28,392
Don't worry.

396
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:34,433
She'll never make her daughter
into a criminal's daughter.

397
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:48,610
Yes. From Yoobum's perspective,
it could be embarrassing for him.

398
00:25:48,917 --> 00:25:52,651
He got criticized for something he
didn't do and I hugged another man.

399
00:25:53,617 --> 00:25:55,917
It's natural for him to be angry.

400
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:06,431
I should stay calm and use common sense.

401
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:08,900
I need to end things rationally.

402
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:11,435
You're here.

403
00:26:11,911 --> 00:26:13,351
What coffee would you like?

404
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,808
No thanks.
This will only take a minute.

405
00:26:17,317 --> 00:26:20,378
I wanted to see you because I
wanted to hear many things from you.

406
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:23,648
For example, an apology.

407
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:28,220
I know very well that
you were very disappointed...

408
00:26:29,145 --> 00:26:31,189
...with my behavior...

409
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:33,249
...at the time of incident.

410
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:35,442
I'm glad that you know.

411
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:39,445
I know that I'm acting out of
my mind and I know that...

412
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:42,050
...you didn't do anything wrong.

413
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:45,197
But I think I have to end things
with you for me to sleep well.

414
00:26:46,817 --> 00:26:47,801
Excuse me...

415
00:26:47,886 --> 00:26:48,917
Nam Hongjoo.

416
00:26:49,016 --> 00:26:51,275
So let's end things here.

417
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,437
You can say that I was struck by
lightening or that I'm crazy wench.

418
00:26:53,522 --> 00:26:55,680
I have no excuses.
I'm sorry.

419
00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:00,013
Is this an apology?

420
00:27:00,098 --> 00:27:03,974
Yes. My voice gets
louder the more I feel sorry.

421
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:07,199
I'm sorry about everything.
I've done a terrible thing to you.

422
00:27:07,284 --> 00:27:08,827
I sincerely apologize.

423
00:27:19,551 --> 00:27:21,006
Yes. Welcome.

424
00:27:21,091 --> 00:27:23,175
The floor is slippery.
Please be careful.

425
00:27:24,942 --> 00:27:28,017
Why didn't you go to school?
Why are you getting on this bus?

426
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,537
I was just worried because of that dream.

427
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,688
Gosh. You'll have to drop out of school
if you have another dream.

428
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:06,484
Father. That's the soldier
I saw in my dream.

429
00:28:09,383 --> 00:28:10,917
It's just a coincidence.

430
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:22,434
Father. I think he has a gun in that bag.

431
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:28,940
This is breaking news.

432
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:32,317
An army private first class
soldier deserted from his post...

433
00:28:32,383 --> 00:28:34,161
...with loaded rifle and a grenade
in Anjin-gu, Gangwon-do.

434
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:38,194
The soldier shot a policeman in
a convenience store in...

435
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:39,598
...Seoul and ran away.

436
00:28:39,683 --> 00:28:41,801
The police and the army are pursuing him.

437
00:28:41,907 --> 00:28:44,665
The policeman who
was shot died at the scene.

438
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,426
The detailed news...

439
00:28:56,588 --> 00:28:57,991
Why is it raining all of a sudden?

440
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:05,597
Are you coming back from
seeing your mother at the hospital?

441
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:06,846
What?

442
00:29:07,894 --> 00:29:08,751
Yes.

443
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:09,695
How is she?

444
00:29:09,941 --> 00:29:10,817
Is she okay?

445
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:11,891
I told you, didn't I?

446
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:14,252
I told you not to act
like you know anything.

447
00:29:15,621 --> 00:29:17,455
I'm asking you because I was worried.

448
00:29:32,517 --> 00:29:35,340
I'd never acted like
I know in front of other kids.

449
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:37,342
You...

450
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:39,611
What's your name?

451
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,813
Don't you know my name?

452
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,031
I was in the same class with you
last year.

453
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:46,284
Do I have to know your name
if I'm in the same class with you?

454
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:47,594
Of course you should.

455
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,051
That's the responsibility
and duty of being a classmate.

456
00:29:52,136 --> 00:29:54,793
I didn't know I had
that kind of responsibility.

457
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,631
I shouldn't have given her my coat.

458
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:11,776
Are all those cases assigned to me?

459
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,746
Then do you think they're assigned to me?

460
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,715
Wait a minute.

461
00:30:19,885 --> 00:30:21,820
There's no space.

462
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:26,554
How about borrowing Prosecutor
Shin Heemin's cabinet?

463
00:30:26,639 --> 00:30:30,275
She works so fast that she
hardly has any unfinished cases.

464
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,162
She has a lot of cabinet spaces also.

465
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:33,999
I work fast also.

466
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,416
Did you make reservation
for today's lunch yet?

467
00:30:36,517 --> 00:30:37,318
You're the lunch manager.

468
00:30:37,416 --> 00:30:38,350
I'm going to do it now.

469
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:39,318
Which restaurant?

470
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:40,589
Is that important?

471
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:41,907
It's important.

472
00:30:41,992 --> 00:30:43,717
There's even rumor that
the evaluation of...

473
00:30:43,817 --> 00:30:45,584
...a new prosecutor depends upon
upon how good of a lunch manager he is...

474
00:30:45,683 --> 00:30:47,045
...than the actual case he works on.

475
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:50,731
You have to choose
the restaurant carefully.

476
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:53,567
I'm going to ask Prosecutor Shin
and choose one carefully.

477
00:30:55,183 --> 00:30:56,566
Do you think she'll teach you?

478
00:30:56,651 --> 00:30:57,408
Of course.

479
00:30:57,493 --> 00:30:59,421
She's my junior back in school,
so we're very close.

480
00:31:02,383 --> 00:31:03,661
Heemin.

481
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:05,689
Hey. Shin Heemin.

482
00:31:07,638 --> 00:31:08,588
Hey. Miss Shin.

483
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,781
Miss Shin.

484
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:12,241
Hey. Miss Shin.

485
00:31:15,617 --> 00:31:18,309
Does she have bad ears?

486
00:31:18,753 --> 00:31:20,979
You should've called her Prosecutor Shin.

487
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:27,501
Heemin. Shin Heemin. Miss Shin. You can't
call her like that. It's prosecutor Shin.

488
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:28,418
Even if she was your junior in school...

489
00:31:28,483 --> 00:31:30,934
...if she has seniority over you at work,
you should call her respectfully.

490
00:31:31,201 --> 00:31:33,540
So why were you calling
her so desperately?

491
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:36,983
I heard that she was
the lunch manager before I got hired.

492
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:38,282
I was going to ask her how to do it.

493
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:39,795
You should memorize this, you brat.

494
00:31:40,118 --> 00:31:42,216
Senior Prosecutor here
doesn't like meat in soup...

495
00:31:42,316 --> 00:31:44,113
...so don't choose seollongtang
or shabu shabu restaurant.

496
00:31:44,198 --> 00:31:46,765
The Chief Prosecutor doesn't
like raw meat so avoid sashimi.

497
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,328
The assistant prosecutor
doesn't like foot odor...

498
00:31:48,416 --> 00:31:50,265
...so he doesn't like restaurants that
you have to take your shoes off.

499
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,948
Prosecutor Shin doesn't like
Italian food so keep that in mind.

500
00:31:53,033 --> 00:31:56,548
Why are you teaching him such
valuable information for free?

501
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,633
I know. I should get paid for
teaching him this information.

502
00:31:59,718 --> 00:32:01,506
You brat.
Pay me the tutoring fee...

503
00:32:04,149 --> 00:32:05,290
I'm going to go inside.

504
00:32:10,234 --> 00:32:11,196
What's wrong with him?

505
00:32:11,632 --> 00:32:13,792
I think he has hard feelings against you.

506
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,869
I was his tutor before.

507
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,754
I think he must've thought that
I'm treating like my student.

508
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,684
But still... He made you feel foolish...

509
00:32:22,783 --> 00:32:24,692
That's okay. I should've been carefully.

510
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:25,783
It's my mistake.

511
00:32:36,574 --> 00:32:40,325
I think he's the runaway solder.

512
00:32:40,803 --> 00:32:44,023
What do we do, father?
What if we all die like in my dream?

513
00:32:45,183 --> 00:32:46,364
Don't worry.

514
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:48,466
No one is going to die today.

515
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:55,088
I'm going to say
that the bus broke down...

516
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:57,216
...and tell all the passengers
to get off the bus.

517
00:32:57,316 --> 00:32:58,255
Then I want you to...

518
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:08,935
I'm sorry. There's a problem
with the tires on the bus.

519
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,666
It needs repairs.

520
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,490
I'm sorry, but please use the next bus.

521
00:33:18,517 --> 00:33:19,849
I'm sorry.

522
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,614
Next bus will be here soon.

523
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,150
Why did the tires
causing me trouble today?

524
00:33:25,984 --> 00:33:26,685
I'm sorry.

525
00:33:26,783 --> 00:33:28,584
Why is it raining so much?

526
00:33:29,911 --> 00:33:31,090
Sir.

527
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,259
Please hurry.

528
00:33:36,344 --> 00:33:37,951
Hurry up and go.

529
00:33:38,054 --> 00:33:40,221
Please hurry.

530
00:33:54,768 --> 00:33:57,535
I think it will be difficult to
change the tires all by myself.

531
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:00,205
Would you please help me?

532
00:34:59,602 --> 00:35:01,900
Father!

533
00:35:25,783 --> 00:35:27,692
Father!

534
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:54,517
"Seungwon will become
a murderer because of me."

535
00:35:56,884 --> 00:35:58,498
Who is Seungwon?

536
00:36:00,016 --> 00:36:01,826
Who is he going to kill?

537
00:36:03,517 --> 00:36:04,996
And who is his brother?

538
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:17,408
Ignore it if you can't handle it.

539
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,311
Just think that you had a bad dream.

540
00:36:37,963 --> 00:36:39,030
I want to talk to you.

541
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:42,533
I think they're flirting.

542
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:45,470
Follow me.

543
00:36:57,788 --> 00:36:59,559
I told you not to act
like you know anything.

544
00:36:59,644 --> 00:37:01,753
I told you not to open your mouth!

545
00:37:02,112 --> 00:37:04,188
I saw you what you searched
on the internet earlier.

546
00:37:07,641 --> 00:37:09,777
Why did you search about
the sentence for committing patricide?

547
00:37:10,098 --> 00:37:11,425
Why did you search how to
purchase potassium cyanide...

548
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,588
...and how much antifreeze
is enough to kill?

549
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,422
What are you thinking?

550
00:37:17,518 --> 00:37:18,736
Are you thinking...

551
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,055
...of killing your father?

552
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,808
I'm trying to save my mom.

553
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,277
Dad has to disappear...

554
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:28,828
...for my mom to live.

555
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,315
Why do you have to do that?
He was reported to the police.

556
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:34,888
The prosecutor should be
prosecuting him by now.

557
00:37:34,987 --> 00:37:36,820
Your father will be
tried and go to prison.

558
00:37:36,905 --> 00:37:37,939
That should be fine so why...

559
00:37:38,024 --> 00:37:39,617
Why if the prosecutor
can't prosecute him?

560
00:37:39,702 --> 00:37:41,355
Why not? He committed a crime.

561
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,580
He can't.

562
00:37:43,378 --> 00:37:45,412
My dad will never be tried.

563
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:46,531
Because...

564
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:52,354
The prosecutor is an idiot and
the defense attorney is shrewd.

565
00:37:52,615 --> 00:37:54,539
Attorney Lee is here.

566
00:37:56,174 --> 00:37:58,676
I came today as the defense
attorney for Park Junmo.

567
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:00,485
Park Junmo?

568
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:02,179
The man who is being sent
for assaulting his wife?

569
00:38:02,264 --> 00:38:04,150
Yes. He's a regular customer of mine.

570
00:38:04,472 --> 00:38:07,000
You know that piano
prodigy Park Soyun?

571
00:38:07,085 --> 00:38:07,663
It's her father.

572
00:38:07,748 --> 00:38:08,525
Yes.

573
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,615
I thought it's a typical
domestic violence case.

574
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,896
Did you already review the records?

575
00:38:16,671 --> 00:38:17,601
Yes.

576
00:38:17,686 --> 00:38:19,936
He kicked his wife Do Geumseok
while wearing his dress shoes...

577
00:38:20,021 --> 00:38:22,448
...and fractured six of her ribs.

578
00:38:23,179 --> 00:38:24,542
So, it should be assault
with bodily injury.

579
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,505
It's not with bodily injury.
It's just assault.

580
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:31,476
That shrewd attorney will make it...

581
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:34,879
...into assault without bodily
injury no matter what.

582
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:38,732
What's the difference between
assault and assault with bodily injury?

583
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,663
If she didn't get hurt, it's just assault.

584
00:38:40,895 --> 00:38:42,268
But if she was hurt,
it's assault with bodily injury.

585
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:44,955
You said your mother was
injured and she has broken ribs.

586
00:38:45,131 --> 00:38:47,307
Isn't that obviously
assault with bodily injury?

587
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:50,114
I said its assault.

588
00:38:55,696 --> 00:38:57,150
This is medical report of Do Geumseok.

589
00:38:57,235 --> 00:38:59,504
Multiple fractures of
the ribs and contusions...

590
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:01,588
This is the medical report,
so how can it be just assault.

591
00:39:01,688 --> 00:39:02,696
It's assault with bodily injury.

592
00:39:03,386 --> 00:39:06,281
Hey. You should look
at the date. The date.

593
00:39:06,366 --> 00:39:08,776
The incident took place on February 14th.

594
00:39:08,861 --> 00:39:11,689
The medical report was given
4 days before on February 10th.

595
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:17,049
Then are you saying that her
ribs weren't broken...

596
00:39:17,134 --> 00:39:19,290
...because she was hit
by Mr. Park Junmo?

597
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:20,740
That's right.

598
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:22,466
Then how did that happen to her?

599
00:39:24,472 --> 00:39:27,295
This is Do Geumseok's
credit card statement.

600
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,743
If you look at the usage
report on February 10th...

601
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:34,105
...it shows that she was at Chungin Resort
and rented ski equipment.

602
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:42,046
Therefore, those ribs weren't broken
because Park Junmo assaulted her.

603
00:39:42,377 --> 00:39:45,784
She had them broken while she was skiing.

604
00:39:45,963 --> 00:39:49,654
If there isn't any change,
that shrewd attorney...

605
00:39:50,397 --> 00:39:53,004
...will succeed in turning assault
with bodily injury to just assault.

606
00:39:53,089 --> 00:39:54,891
Let's say that it turns into
just assault like you said.

607
00:39:56,087 --> 00:39:57,403
But what is the problem?

608
00:39:57,488 --> 00:39:59,053
Assault is a crime too.

609
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:00,486
That's right.

610
00:40:02,604 --> 00:40:04,517
It's a crime, but it's a strange crime.

611
00:40:05,432 --> 00:40:08,639
It's a crime that can only be punished
if the victim presses charges.

612
00:40:10,621 --> 00:40:12,994
So if the victim doesn't
want to press charges...

613
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:16,017
...there's nothing
a foolish prosecutor can do.

614
00:40:16,102 --> 00:40:17,570
And that crime will just go away.

615
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:21,052
Hey. Then you need to tell your mother
to press charges no matter what.

616
00:40:21,706 --> 00:40:22,954
No. Mr. Prosecutor.

617
00:40:23,148 --> 00:40:24,822
I don't want to press charges.

618
00:40:25,588 --> 00:40:27,706
I was injured while skiing.

619
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,893
It has nothing to do with my husband.

620
00:40:30,092 --> 00:40:34,805
As usual, my mom will say that
she doesn't want to press charges.

621
00:40:36,057 --> 00:40:36,770
Yes.

622
00:40:37,024 --> 00:40:37,991
Why not?

623
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:40,305
My mom is...

624
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,754
I'm sorry for troubling you.

625
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:45,228
My mom is more scared
of my father than the law.

626
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,721
So this is how you do it.

627
00:40:59,692 --> 00:41:01,714
I've been curious since a while ago.

628
00:41:02,155 --> 00:41:02,915
What about?

629
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,428
You said it earlier that...

630
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,430
...Mr. Park Junmo was
your regular customer.

631
00:41:07,163 --> 00:41:09,744
What kind of trouble is he in
that he's become a regular customer...

632
00:41:09,829 --> 00:41:13,038
...of an attorney who quit
being a prosecutor not even a year?

633
00:41:14,668 --> 00:41:16,041
Seeing how you dress and what you drive...

634
00:41:16,126 --> 00:41:18,724
...I can tell you're an attorney
that works for high legal fee.

635
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,763
Why did you take a case like this?
.

636
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,258
I was quite curious about it,
but now I understand.

637
00:41:26,353 --> 00:41:27,596
What are you trying to say?

638
00:41:27,681 --> 00:41:29,089
You must've been this way all this time.

639
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:32,833
You used few documents to turn assault
with bodily injury into just assault.

640
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:36,827
You threaten victims not to press charges
and throw out the indictment.

641
00:41:37,268 --> 00:41:40,175
You get rid of crimes for him and
made him into a regular customer.

642
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,928
How many times do you have to do this
to make him into your regular customer?

643
00:41:43,287 --> 00:41:44,769
Shouldn't we stop him?

644
00:41:46,443 --> 00:41:47,222
Prosecutor Jung.

645
00:41:47,307 --> 00:41:49,587
I think you're going too far.

646
00:41:54,351 --> 00:41:57,255
I was wondering, but you're still
the same just as I worried you'd be.

647
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:03,858
I know that you have a grudge
for what happened 13 years ago.

648
00:42:03,943 --> 00:42:05,523
Fine. Let's say that
I can understand that.

649
00:42:05,782 --> 00:42:07,722
But you should let it end with me.

650
00:42:07,902 --> 00:42:09,854
So why are you getting your
revenge on my innocent client?

651
00:42:10,595 --> 00:42:11,329
Revenge?

652
00:42:11,636 --> 00:42:13,404
Then try to explain that...

653
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,055
...what you've done to me for the past
few days are not revenge.

654
00:42:17,364 --> 00:42:20,279
I just can't understand that it
can be anything, but revenge.

655
00:42:22,454 --> 00:42:23,574
First,

656
00:42:24,253 --> 00:42:27,996
Why did you harass my girlfriend
to break up with me?

657
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,555
No way.

658
00:42:31,747 --> 00:42:35,986
Second, why did you crash into
my car when I just driving carefully?

659
00:42:37,101 --> 00:42:38,389
He crashed into him?

660
00:42:40,054 --> 00:42:40,818
Third.

661
00:42:40,903 --> 00:42:41,782
"Prosecutor Jung crashed into
Attorney Lee's car..."

662
00:42:41,867 --> 00:42:45,272
You can tell just by looking at the
documents of this case what the answer is.

663
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:48,527
So why are you trying
to pick a fight about it?

664
00:42:48,612 --> 00:42:49,620
Don't put them together forcefully.

665
00:42:49,705 --> 00:42:51,200
The case and those things are not related.

666
00:42:51,285 --> 00:42:52,122
Well.

667
00:42:54,106 --> 00:42:56,989
I can only explain those three things.

668
00:42:58,246 --> 00:42:59,101
It's revenge.

669
00:43:05,688 --> 00:43:06,788
That's crazy.

670
00:43:10,766 --> 00:43:11,647
No way.

671
00:43:11,732 --> 00:43:15,258
Prosecutor Jung crashed into
Attorney Lee's car intentionally.

672
00:43:18,832 --> 00:43:19,597
Why?

673
00:43:20,608 --> 00:43:21,538
I don't know.

674
00:43:21,623 --> 00:43:24,212
He's saying something about him
taking his revenge on the suspect.

675
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:27,417
So I think there's something
going on between them.

676
00:43:28,054 --> 00:43:29,248
There's something between them?

677
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:31,909
What is it?

678
00:43:32,878 --> 00:43:36,343
I heard that Prosecutor Jung
stole Attorney Lee's girlfriend.

679
00:43:36,428 --> 00:43:37,915
Don't you think its blind passion?

680
00:43:39,571 --> 00:43:40,728
Blind Passion?

681
00:43:43,407 --> 00:43:45,975
That's so disorderly. Disorderly.

682
00:43:46,524 --> 00:43:50,639
I'm not asking you do something
impossible just because I know you.

683
00:43:51,552 --> 00:43:54,752
I'm not asking you to get rid of
a crime that's been committed.

684
00:43:55,081 --> 00:43:58,324
I'm just asking you to do it by the law
that you learned at law school.

685
00:44:01,441 --> 00:44:02,419
Get it approved by the Senior Prosecutor
by today...

686
00:44:02,504 --> 00:44:04,656
...and take care of it as
there's no right for arraignment.

687
00:44:04,899 --> 00:44:07,144
Don't get revenge on my stern client.

688
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,082
By the law.

689
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:15,149
I'm going to go.

690
00:44:17,015 --> 00:44:22,118
Hey. And please don't act like a child.

691
00:44:22,203 --> 00:44:25,179
You acting like this make you
look like a drunk 16 year old.

692
00:44:28,748 --> 00:44:29,585
I'm going.

693
00:44:30,264 --> 00:44:32,803
- I'm going.
- Goodbye.

694
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:42,246
That foolish prosecutor will
not be able to save my mom.

695
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:45,249
It's been that way all this time.

696
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,953
There has to be a way.
There has to be another way.

697
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,388
The old sayings are never wrong.

698
00:44:53,621 --> 00:44:55,192
Where drums beat...

699
00:44:56,127 --> 00:44:57,294
...the laws...

700
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,164
...are silent.

701
00:45:20,397 --> 00:45:22,280
Miss Shin. Here.

702
00:45:22,889 --> 00:45:24,381
Miss Shin. Over here.

703
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:25,955
Hey. Over here. Miss Shin.

704
00:45:26,054 --> 00:45:27,845
Do you think she's acting like that
because she doesn't hear you?

705
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:29,829
Just call her Prosecutor Shin.

706
00:45:31,464 --> 00:45:32,678
Hey. Miss Shin!

707
00:45:32,864 --> 00:45:33,854
Miss Shin!

708
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,824
Miss Shin. Over here.

709
00:45:37,922 --> 00:45:39,548
There you are.

710
00:45:39,633 --> 00:45:41,105
I'm sorry.

711
00:45:41,908 --> 00:45:44,010
I was lost because
the restaurant sign was so small.

712
00:45:46,818 --> 00:45:48,913
What's your religion?

713
00:45:49,578 --> 00:45:50,915
I don't have a religion.

714
00:45:58,827 --> 00:46:00,300
What's wrong?

715
00:46:00,385 --> 00:46:01,925
It's nothing.

716
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:03,888
We share the same religion...

717
00:46:03,987 --> 00:46:06,479
...so we take turns praying for the meal.

718
00:46:06,564 --> 00:46:09,043
Don't worry about us and eat first.

719
00:46:09,128 --> 00:46:10,862
- Yes, Sir.
- Shall we pray?

720
00:46:11,821 --> 00:46:14,401
Then you why don't
you start praying first?

721
00:46:14,491 --> 00:46:15,090
Yes.

722
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,289
Gracious God who
gives us our daily bread.

723
00:46:18,382 --> 00:46:24,506
Please show kindness
to an unbelieving lamb.

724
00:46:24,591 --> 00:46:27,724
Please have the lunch manager
choose a family restaurant...

725
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:31,020
...with big signs so that
there are no lost souls.

726
00:46:31,105 --> 00:46:34,693
I work for an organization that
has clear order and system.

727
00:46:34,778 --> 00:46:37,873
Please help the lost lamb
to understand that order...

728
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:40,944
...and system is more important age.

729
00:46:41,029 --> 00:46:43,619
Unsolved cases are increasing.

730
00:46:43,781 --> 00:46:45,327
Please help him become a prosecutor
who takes care of unsolved cases...

731
00:46:45,412 --> 00:46:48,855
...quickly in order to ease
the sadness of victims.

732
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,709
Also, please help the soul
who disgraces the position...

733
00:46:51,794 --> 00:46:52,944
...of prosecutor by
wearing inappropriate attire...

734
00:46:53,029 --> 00:46:57,023
...and give him wisdom to wear
clothing worthy of a prosecutor.

735
00:46:57,108 --> 00:46:59,486
This world is full of jealousy and anger.

736
00:46:59,571 --> 00:47:02,388
There are times that people get
caught up in their personal feelings...

737
00:47:02,492 --> 00:47:05,171
...from their past and
lose sight of the cases.

738
00:47:05,256 --> 00:47:06,079
That's because...

739
00:47:06,164 --> 00:47:08,726
A prosecutor must see cases rationally...

740
00:47:09,147 --> 00:47:12,472
...even when he's caught up
in anxiousness and anger.

741
00:47:12,757 --> 00:47:15,652
Please help him not to
deviate from being a prosecutor.

742
00:47:15,821 --> 00:47:19,055
In the name of Jesus we pray, Amen.

743
00:47:19,154 --> 00:47:20,960
-Amen.
-Amen.

744
00:47:21,354 --> 00:47:22,608
Let's eat.

745
00:47:23,477 --> 00:47:25,980
Why aren't you eating yet?

746
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:28,628
Yes. I'm eating.

747
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,148
Here. Take this.

748
00:47:33,855 --> 00:47:34,656
Let's eat.

749
00:47:34,754 --> 00:47:35,421
Yes.

750
00:47:41,955 --> 00:47:43,122
What are you doing?

751
00:47:43,723 --> 00:47:44,388
What do you think I'm doing?

752
00:47:44,488 --> 00:47:46,697
I'm taking out the cases I'm
going to take care of today.

753
00:47:48,507 --> 00:47:50,786
Don't you think that's too much for today?

754
00:47:50,871 --> 00:47:53,424
I'm going to finish all of them
even if I have to stay up all night.

755
00:47:53,589 --> 00:47:56,973
I can empty out that cabinet in one day.

756
00:47:58,387 --> 00:48:00,621
It's Park Junmo's case.

757
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:03,278
There's a medical report and
the victim is not pressing charges.

758
00:48:03,363 --> 00:48:06,054
I just have to sign off that
this case can't be prosecuted.

759
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,577
It will only take five minutes.
Just five minutes.

760
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:14,230
Suspect Park Junmo.
Crime is assault.

761
00:48:14,315 --> 00:48:18,438
The victim expressed that she
doesn't want to press charges.

762
00:48:18,523 --> 00:48:21,186
Therefore, the case can't be prosecuted.

763
00:48:21,514 --> 00:48:22,132
The end.

764
00:48:22,769 --> 00:48:24,561
Wow! It didn't even take five minutes.

765
00:48:24,646 --> 00:48:27,102
If it's like this, there's no need
for me to stay up all night. All right.

766
00:48:27,187 --> 00:48:28,678
Next case is regarding unlicensed...

767
00:48:30,717 --> 00:48:32,109
This will only take three minutes.

768
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:33,821
Unlicensed.

769
00:48:33,921 --> 00:48:35,357
Why is he acting like
that all of a sudden?

770
00:48:35,442 --> 00:48:36,609
Did he drink at lunch?

771
00:48:38,527 --> 00:48:40,578
He's totally drunk.

772
00:48:41,392 --> 00:48:42,307
Will we get off work on time today?

773
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:50,214
I'm here at the funeral of
Inspector Jung Ilsong and the bus driver...

774
00:48:50,299 --> 00:48:55,766
...Nam Chuldoo who saved the citizens
from the armed runaway soldier.

775
00:48:56,734 --> 00:48:59,135
They stopped the tragedy by
sacrificing themselves bravely.

776
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:03,457
The politicians requested for
National Merit to be awarded to both men.

777
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:07,878
Where's his son?

778
00:49:08,058 --> 00:49:09,513
I heard he was on
the bus with his father.

779
00:49:09,709 --> 00:49:11,219
We have to interview him.

780
00:49:11,304 --> 00:49:13,724
I know. I heard that he
evacuated all the passengers.

781
00:49:13,809 --> 00:49:15,511
Where is he?

782
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,550
The assemblyman would like to
give him the words of comfort.

783
00:49:18,635 --> 00:49:22,292
Mr. Kim. Did you take a picture of the
Assemblyman paying his condolences?

784
00:49:22,872 --> 00:49:24,636
Yes. We took it.
Did you take it?

785
00:49:24,721 --> 00:49:25,703
Let's go.

786
00:49:25,788 --> 00:49:26,622
Let's go.

787
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:45,732
Mr. Choi.

788
00:49:49,488 --> 00:49:51,055
He's out.

789
00:49:51,287 --> 00:49:52,988
I thought he was working too fast.

790
00:49:54,317 --> 00:49:55,392
No!

791
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,231
Oh my goodness.

792
00:50:01,488 --> 00:50:02,788
My heart stopped.

793
00:50:06,321 --> 00:50:08,405
Did you have a bad dream?

794
00:50:10,397 --> 00:50:11,972
No. I wasn't sleeping.

795
00:50:12,057 --> 00:50:13,896
It seemed like you were crying just now.

796
00:50:15,468 --> 00:50:16,380
No, I wasn't.

797
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,422
Wait a minute.

798
00:50:27,521 --> 00:50:29,369
Jaechan. Jaechan.
Get me out.

799
00:50:29,454 --> 00:50:32,654
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

800
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,120
Hello.

801
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:41,796
Where are you right now?

802
00:50:42,867 --> 00:50:44,132
At school.

803
00:50:44,237 --> 00:50:45,390
You're okay, right?

804
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:47,808
You're not sick or hurt, are you?

805
00:50:47,893 --> 00:50:48,698
No.

806
00:50:48,783 --> 00:50:49,546
Why do you ask?

807
00:50:51,747 --> 00:50:52,983
Never mind. It's fine if you're okay.

808
00:50:53,604 --> 00:50:54,586
What time are you coming home?

809
00:50:56,618 --> 00:50:58,415
I'm not sure. Around 10 PM maybe?

810
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,165
Don't go anywhere else
and come straight home.

811
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:00,957
Do you understand?

812
00:51:01,042 --> 00:51:02,251
Do you think I'm a fool?

813
00:51:02,336 --> 00:51:03,627
Where else would I go?

814
00:51:04,204 --> 00:51:05,262
Okay.

815
00:51:20,648 --> 00:51:22,325
I'm trying to save my mom.

816
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:24,020
Dad has to disappear...

817
00:51:24,984 --> 00:51:26,583
...in order for my mom to live.

818
00:51:30,711 --> 00:51:32,517
Yes. It's just a dream.

819
00:51:32,617 --> 00:51:34,091
It's nothing.
It's nothing.

820
00:51:38,619 --> 00:51:39,850
Let me go!

821
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:40,964
We can't.

822
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:44,562
I asked you to believe me.

823
00:51:46,944 --> 00:51:49,973
We could've changed it
if you believed me.

824
00:51:56,111 --> 00:51:57,815
Seriously.

825
00:52:36,995 --> 00:52:40,924
I want you to make sure that
all the passengers get off.

826
00:52:42,251 --> 00:52:45,874
Once they get off, make sure that they
go as far away from the bus as possible.

827
00:52:45,959 --> 00:52:47,713
Let's not do that.
Let's just run away.

828
00:52:47,798 --> 00:52:49,718
It's exactly like my dream right now.

829
00:52:49,803 --> 00:52:51,341
I'm responsible for this bus.

830
00:52:51,426 --> 00:52:53,359
So, how can I just runaway to save myself.

831
00:52:53,699 --> 00:52:55,113
Father, please...

832
00:52:55,198 --> 00:52:55,817
You brat.

833
00:52:55,917 --> 00:52:58,113
If a catch doesn't catch
the ball and runs away...

834
00:52:58,198 --> 00:53:00,944
...the umpire will get hit by the ball.
Then it will be a mess.

835
00:53:02,294 --> 00:53:03,814
I'll grow out my hair.

836
00:53:04,697 --> 00:53:06,721
You said it's your wish
to see me with long hair.

837
00:53:08,868 --> 00:53:11,798
I'll grow out my hair.
So let's get off.

838
00:53:11,883 --> 00:53:12,754
Really?

839
00:53:14,246 --> 00:53:15,125
Okay.

840
00:53:16,147 --> 00:53:18,362
I'll see it later for sure.

841
00:53:20,086 --> 00:53:21,795
So get off the bus first.

842
00:54:01,281 --> 00:54:03,679
By the way, it wasn't
a son but a daughter?

843
00:54:04,487 --> 00:54:08,812
I heard that the child on the bus
wasn't a son but a daughter.

844
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:10,717
-Is that right?
-Yes.

845
00:54:14,952 --> 00:54:17,687
Madam. Where's your
daughter right now?

846
00:54:22,013 --> 00:54:25,362
Hongjoo isn't here right now.

847
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:31,935
Oh my goodness.

848
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,208
What are you doing here at this hour?

849
00:54:40,817 --> 00:54:42,979
I didn't come here
because I changed my mind.

850
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:45,949
I wanted to explain why
I won't believe you.

851
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:48,318
Go ahead.

852
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:49,619
I'm a prosecutor.

853
00:54:50,517 --> 00:54:53,090
My job is to punish the culprit
after the crime took place.

854
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:54,591
It's not to stop the crime.

855
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:57,105
I'm saying that there's nothing
I can do...

856
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:58,962
...no matter how many times
you tell me your dream.

857
00:54:59,126 --> 00:55:01,161
It's not my business
no matter who dies in our dreams.

858
00:55:01,246 --> 00:55:02,932
And I don't need to be responsible
for them.

859
00:55:03,017 --> 00:55:03,872
But...

860
00:55:04,754 --> 00:55:05,600
But...

861
00:55:08,116 --> 00:55:09,609
You feel like you've
become a catcher, don't you?

862
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:19,072
There's a ball coming at 160km per hour.

863
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,851
It's scary catch it.

864
00:55:21,587 --> 00:55:23,420
But if you avoid it,
you'll mess up the game.

865
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:25,288
It's like that, isn't it?

866
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:30,445
That's right.

867
00:55:31,314 --> 00:55:33,292
Now even if I don't want to
believe it, I can't ignore it.

868
00:55:33,805 --> 00:55:35,910
Because I'm dreaming
those darn dreams too.

869
00:55:36,655 --> 00:55:38,502
Why did I start having those dreams too?

870
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:39,290
Why me?

871
00:55:39,375 --> 00:55:41,575
I don't know why it had to be you either.

872
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,532
I don't even know why I started
having these dreams either.

873
00:55:43,617 --> 00:55:44,981
So how would I know that?

874
00:55:45,402 --> 00:55:46,932
I don't know what it is,
but there must be a reason.

875
00:55:47,017 --> 00:55:48,427
A reason that you and I are
having those dreams...

876
00:56:34,651 --> 00:56:35,759
I don't know!

877
00:56:37,474 --> 00:56:39,963
But what are you going
to do if there's a reason?

878
00:56:40,264 --> 00:56:41,371
You can't stop them because
you're a prosecutor...

879
00:56:41,456 --> 00:56:42,974
...and you don't want to believe me.

880
00:56:43,059 --> 00:56:44,568
But you're saying that it's all my fault?

881
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:46,303
Did you come here to tell me that?

882
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:53,276
I need your help.

883
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:00,984
You were in my dream.

884
00:57:02,543 --> 00:57:04,628
You blamed me for not listening to you...

885
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:07,390
...and Seungwon got into a police car
or an ambulance and left.

886
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:10,162
I just don't know what
that dream is about...

887
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:12,362
Seungwon...

888
00:57:13,817 --> 00:57:15,131
Who is Seungwon?

889
00:57:16,256 --> 00:57:17,434
He's my younger brother.

890
00:57:17,817 --> 00:57:18,437
Why?

891
00:57:22,989 --> 00:57:24,076
In my dream...

892
00:57:24,982 --> 00:57:26,543
...the guy named Seungwon...

893
00:57:28,543 --> 00:57:30,125
...killed someone.

894
00:57:32,693 --> 00:57:33,460
Excuse me?

895
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:51,950
"4 season antifreeze."

896
00:57:55,896 --> 00:57:57,041
Seungwon.

897
00:57:58,347 --> 00:57:59,011
Look at that.

898
00:57:59,377 --> 00:58:00,441
You memorized my name.

899
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:03,054
Then he said it's
because of his brother...

900
00:58:03,139 --> 00:58:05,815
He said that he became
a murderer because of his brother.

901
00:58:08,879 --> 00:58:11,223
Then his older brother is you, Jaechan?

902
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:17,124
Did you follow me?

903
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:20,628
Yes. Let's go together.

904
00:58:20,713 --> 00:58:21,909
I'll take you home.

905

"While You Were Sleeping"

907
00:59:04,236 --> 00:59:06,026
Is it connected to
Park Junmo's case?

908
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:06,912
It's because you
released Park Junmo...

909
00:59:06,997 --> 00:59:07,931
It's because of you.

910
00:59:08,016 --> 00:59:09,216
Do you have contact lenses?

911
00:59:09,316 --> 00:59:10,250
Do I look different without my glasses?

912
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:11,117
Are you falling for me again?

913
00:59:11,202 --> 00:59:12,117
Isn't the case closed?

914
00:59:12,216 --> 00:59:13,393
I brought it back.

915
00:59:13,478 --> 00:59:14,850
I plan to dig into the case to the end.

916
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:16,851
Why is it so hard for you to hear
that I'm looking forward to it?

917
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:18,584
You're saying that you'll be
disappointed if I can't do it.

918
00:59:18,683 --> 00:59:19,384
But why is it me?

919
00:59:19,483 --> 00:59:21,317
Why don't you want to
disappoint me specifically?

920
00:59:21,416 --> 00:59:22,828
What do you do, Nam Hongjoo?

921
00:59:22,913 --> 00:59:24,449
Are you interested in me now?

922
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:25,944
Are you saying that you
want to start dating me?
