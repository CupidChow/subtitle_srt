1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:00,734
"While You Were Sleeping"

2
00:00:09,868 --> 00:00:13,068
"Episode 11"

3
00:00:14,534 --> 00:00:15,667
Yes. Hello.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,901
Is this Attorney Lee Yoobum who had
Kang Daehee acquitted at his trial?

5
00:00:20,033 --> 00:00:21,333
Yes it is. Who's calling?

6
00:00:21,534 --> 00:00:23,502
Are you recording this conversation?

7
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:25,335
No, I'm not.

8
00:00:25,834 --> 00:00:27,044
Why are you asking me that?

9
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:28,500
You don't need to know that.

10
00:00:28,601 --> 00:00:31,634
I have something urgent
I must discuss with you.

11
00:00:31,734 --> 00:00:32,468
Where are you?

12
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:34,401
Then please make an appointment tomorrow.

13
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:35,935
It'd be too late tomorrow.

14
00:00:36,033 --> 00:00:37,233
You should make some
time for me right now.

15
00:00:37,334 --> 00:00:38,935
Look here. Who do you think you are?

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,033
I'm author Moon Taemin.

17
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:55,235
I have four of your novels.

18
00:00:55,634 --> 00:00:56,734
If I knew that I was going to see you...

19
00:00:56,834 --> 00:00:58,967
...I would've brought them with
me to get them signed by you.

20
00:01:04,868 --> 00:01:06,335
Should we get to the issue right away?

21
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:11,500
I need consultation from a lawyer...

22
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,856
...for the new novel idea I have.

23
00:01:13,934 --> 00:01:15,881
It's an honor.

24
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:17,401
Is the main character a lawyer?

25
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:18,435
No...

26
00:01:19,267 --> 00:01:20,267
He's a murderer.

27
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:23,068
A murderer?

28
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:25,767
What's the murderer's profession?

29
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:30,034
He's a writer and a professor.

30
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:31,968
A writer and a professor?

31
00:01:32,267 --> 00:01:34,068
Just like you right now, Mr. Moon.

32
00:01:34,934 --> 00:01:37,034
Why do you think that way?

33
00:01:39,334 --> 00:01:40,401
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:44,935
Okay. Please tell me the story in detail.

35
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:51,368
The story starts at that
writer's publication party.

36
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:54,901
"Youth, cheering for the beginning"

37
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:57,201
"Tea party and press conference"

38
00:01:57,934 --> 00:01:59,134
This essay is about youth...

39
00:01:59,234 --> 00:02:01,835
...which is different from what
you've written all this time.

40
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:03,701
I'm curious to know
if you had a special reason for this.

41
00:02:03,801 --> 00:02:06,834
I'm a writer and a professor,
so I've seen some students...

42
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:10,201
...that were having difficult
time with their education.

43
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,467
So, I'll be donating 100 percent...

44
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:14,734
...of the profits from the book
sales to scholarships...

45
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:17,601
Thank you.

46
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:20,433
"The truth behind
Professor Moon Taemin."

47
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:23,534
It looks like your student
prepared a surprise gift for you.

48
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:25,700
Good evening.

49
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:28,066
I'm standing before you today...

50
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:30,267
...to show you the truth about
Professor Moon Taemin...

51
00:02:30,334 --> 00:02:32,968
...who is our academic advisor and
the man we're honoring tonight.

52
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:41,382
This photo was on the cover
of our school magazine recently.

53
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:45,201
Professor Moon wanted to get the jump
photo with us until his knees break.

54
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,901
But in the afternoon on the same day...

55
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:51,534
...we had to help him move his
things until our knees broke.

56
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:55,301
Not only that, we had to drive
his son to and from school...

57
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,167
...and be the parking attendants
at his daughter's wedding...

58
00:02:58,234 --> 00:02:59,901
What are you doing?

59
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,068
I wanted to expose him for his brutality.

60
00:03:08,968 --> 00:03:12,702
I wrote some criticism on his thesis.

61
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:14,867
I guess he must've been
quite disappointed about that.

62
00:03:18,734 --> 00:03:19,616
Are you drunk?

63
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:21,416
This could be considered terrorism
even if you're acting drunk.

64
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,335
No. I'm more sober than any other time.

65
00:03:24,634 --> 00:03:26,235
You must not want to
start your literary career.

66
00:03:26,334 --> 00:03:28,634
You made up your
mind to leave this field.

67
00:03:29,734 --> 00:03:32,034
Yes. I don't need to
start my literary career.

68
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:34,268
I only learned to shine your shoes
and wash your car.

69
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:35,868
So what good is it for me
to start a literary career?

70
00:03:35,934 --> 00:03:39,201
I came to be your teaching assistant.
I didn't come to be your slave.

71
00:03:41,868 --> 00:03:43,135
I'm recording everything right now.

72
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,001
So why don't you act
like how you usually act?

73
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,367
You jerk.

74
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,034
What was that sound?

75
00:04:04,716 --> 00:04:06,849
So, he choked him out of anger.

76
00:04:06,934 --> 00:04:10,268
And because of the recoil,
he fell down the elevator shaft.

77
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,201
Was there any witness?

78
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:13,868
I'm not sure.

79
00:04:14,334 --> 00:04:18,668
I don't think anyone was there,
but there's something bothering him.

80
00:04:25,801 --> 00:04:28,535
There was a child's hat on the floor.

81
00:04:28,734 --> 00:04:34,168
But he's not sure if that hat was already
there or someone dropped it and left.

82
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:36,168
What's the teaching assistant's condition?

83
00:04:37,934 --> 00:04:40,768
He injured his head, so he's in a coma.

84
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:46,867
He's only breathing in the ICU right now.

85
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,934
You can't really say that he's alive.

86
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:51,767
Are you saying that he's brain dead?

87
00:04:54,968 --> 00:04:56,635
Let me explain the terminology first.

88
00:04:57,133 --> 00:05:01,333
The main character in your
novel is not a murderer.

89
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,801
Brain dead is not recognized
by the criminal law as death.

90
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:06,502
The law only recognizes cardiac death.

91
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:07,569
Is that right?

92
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:10,125
If we have to call it a crime,
it would merely be criminal negligence.

93
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,701
But I don't think that fits either.

94
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:15,035
He could be found innocent.

95
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,001
Innocent?

96
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:16,767
Yes.

97
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:18,669
Depending on how the lawyer...

98
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:21,834
...and the main character
strategize from now on...

99
00:05:21,934 --> 00:05:23,201
...he could be found innocent.

100
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,101
Innocent?

101
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:25,668
That's great.

102
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:28,167
I came to the right person.

103
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:31,335
Bring me some coffee.

104
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:34,734
Maybe it's because I can relax now.
I'm craving caffeine.

105
00:05:39,234 --> 00:05:42,749
All the employees went home.
We can have coffee outside later.

106
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:46,601
I need to wake myself up
if we're going to strategize.

107
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,967
What's wrong with the service here?

108
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:54,602
How can I give you any more service?

109
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:56,905
What?

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,901
Are you seriously...

111
00:05:57,968 --> 00:06:00,902
Frankly speaking, you killed your poor
student while overusing your power.

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,578
Now you're asking me
to have you be acquitted.

113
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:03,834
You're asking me to do a difficult thing.

114
00:06:03,934 --> 00:06:05,967
You're hoping that I bring you
coffee when you're a criminal?

115
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:08,200
Wait. Attorney Lee.

116
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,633
Your lifeline is in my hands now.

117
00:06:10,734 --> 00:06:13,068
I'm the one with
the power and you're not.

118
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,333
You better behave properly.

119
00:06:14,968 --> 00:06:17,435
Since I'm speaking to you nicely,
you should speak to me nicely.

120
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:20,001
You should humble yourself
like a criminal.

121
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,201
Repeat after me.

122
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:27,502
"Please help me, Attorney Lee."

123
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:37,567
Please help me, Attorney Lee.

124
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,568
That's right. Good job.

125
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:48,267
Now we can strategize, Mr. Moon.

126
00:06:51,968 --> 00:06:55,368
Mr. Moon Taemin is a scary person.

127
00:06:55,868 --> 00:06:59,901
One of his teaching assistant caused
a scene at his publication party.

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,400
He tried to expose his brutality.
I can tell right away.

129
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:07,534
He used grades as a reason to
overuse his power as a professor.

130
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:10,368
I was writer Moon Taemin's fan.

131
00:07:10,467 --> 00:07:11,934
I'm so disappointed.

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,667
Okay. Good.

133
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:14,534
You got the interview off of
the teaching assistant, right?

134
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,001
I was going to, but he had an accident.

135
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,067
What accident?

136
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:20,649
He got drunk and
fell in the elevator shaft.

137
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:21,934
Now he's in a coma.

138
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:23,867
How unfortunate.

139
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:25,569
Youngest one. Come here.

140
00:07:25,868 --> 00:07:27,935
I'm getting hungry,
so go get some snacks...

141
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:30,200
...at the convenience store
and get what you want to eat too.

142
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:32,001
I want red bean bread.

143
00:07:34,234 --> 00:07:38,234
We have to root out
the hierarchical culture in our country.

144
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:40,235
Being old doesn't give
you a high position.

145
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:42,823
Why do you treat people like your slaves?

146
00:07:44,033 --> 00:07:45,233
You're talking to me, aren't you?

147
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:47,235
No. I was talking about Mr. Moon.

148
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,867
Why, Mr. Bong? Are you feeling guilty?

149
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:51,435
Are you feeling guilty right now?

150
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:53,734
No. I was just...

151
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:56,567
Why are you holding my credit card?

152
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:58,309
Let's have a meeting.

153
00:08:00,601 --> 00:08:03,402
"Seogu University Hospital"

154
00:08:06,634 --> 00:08:08,315
Are you ready to be discharged?

155
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,901
Yes. I'm almost done.

156
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:14,601
You guys came together.

157
00:08:19,601 --> 00:08:21,268
You got my ring, right?

158
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:22,601
Yes.

159
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:29,634
I met him at the front.

160
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:31,182
What's this?

161
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:32,300
Did you decide to speak
casually to each other?

162
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:33,534
Yes. Well...

163
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:35,282
Then are we going to speak
casually to each other too?

164
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:36,268
No, we're not.

165
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:38,468
What's wrong with that stawakrd?

166
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:41,602
You two and you two are
speaking casually to each other.

167
00:08:41,777 --> 00:08:42,777
But it won't work this way?

168
00:08:42,868 --> 00:08:44,135
Gosh. Be quiet.

169
00:08:44,234 --> 00:08:45,668
You brought my ID with you, right?

170
00:08:46,634 --> 00:08:47,701
Here.

171
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:53,434
You see this, don't you?
I'm a prosecutor, aren't I?

172
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:55,768
Yes. You're right.

173
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:57,668
What's that?
Is that all you're going to say?

174
00:08:57,868 --> 00:08:58,669
Don't you have anything else to say?

175
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:01,282
"I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.
I'm sorry for not recognizing you."

176
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:02,868
Shouldn't you say something like that?

177
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,034
What's wrong with you?
You're being childish.

178
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:09,800
That's right. I'm getting
kind of embarrassed too.

179
00:09:13,734 --> 00:09:15,268
I'm sorry for not recognizing you.

180
00:09:15,634 --> 00:09:17,716
But I hope you won't get confused...

181
00:09:17,801 --> 00:09:19,602
...about criminal law clauses
as a prosecutor of Korea.

182
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:22,334
I hope you won't throw a tantrum...

183
00:09:22,434 --> 00:09:23,935
...and insist on being a prosecutor
without your ID either.

184
00:09:24,801 --> 00:09:26,749
Tantrum? You...

185
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:28,335
Calm down.

186
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,433
Everything he's saying is right.

187
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:32,616
Yes. It's you.

188
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:33,834
He's exactly like you
when you were young.

189
00:09:33,901 --> 00:09:35,635
He's rude behavior and
looks are exactly like you.

190
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,327
Don't be ridiculous.

191
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,834
Kid!

192
00:09:44,545 --> 00:09:45,801
Kid. Kid!

193
00:09:45,868 --> 00:09:46,669
Doctor. Over here.

194
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:48,167
A child has collapsed, Doctor.

195
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:52,101
"Intensive Care Unit"

196
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:53,534
What's going on with him?

197
00:09:53,601 --> 00:09:54,801
Is the kid alright?

198
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:56,612
He's getting emergency dialysis right now.

199
00:09:56,701 --> 00:09:57,935
So he'll be fine soon.

200
00:09:58,133 --> 00:09:59,233
He's on a dialysis?

201
00:09:59,434 --> 00:10:01,183
Yes. He has chronic heart failure.

202
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,034
He's been getting dialysis for five years.

203
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,282
I think he has a lot of
built up toxins in his body.

204
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:05,701
His body is quite swollen too.

205
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:07,400
For five years?

206
00:10:07,634 --> 00:10:08,701
But he's so young and little.

207
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:11,068
Now there aren't any veins to use.

208
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:14,367
Transplant is the only answer,
but there aren't any donors.

209
00:10:14,601 --> 00:10:15,668
It's frustrating.

210
00:10:19,834 --> 00:10:22,535
I should've stopped him from drinking.

211
00:10:22,868 --> 00:10:24,068
I'm sorry.

212
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:26,634
He always drinks calmly...

213
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:29,134
...so I never thought that
he'd get into an accident like this.

214
00:10:29,234 --> 00:10:31,102
No.

215
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,301
Thank you for coming
even though you're so busy.

216
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,700
Of course I should be here.

217
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:39,468
He's my most precious student.

218
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,134
Doctor.

219
00:10:43,334 --> 00:10:45,701
The surgery went well, right?

220
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:49,308
His brain injury was already too
severe when he arrived at the hospital.

221
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:52,101
He couldn't breathe on his own.

222
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:54,800
I think you should prepare for the worst.

223
00:10:58,634 --> 00:11:00,401
Sir.

224
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:18,501
Chanho.

225
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,700
Mom is here.

226
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:23,066
Chanho.

227
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:25,301
Chanho.

228
00:11:34,434 --> 00:11:43,467
"To die or to be bad"

229
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:50,667
Thank you for giving me a ride.

230
00:11:50,734 --> 00:11:51,968
Where are you going to recuperate?

231
00:11:52,067 --> 00:11:53,134
Are you going to recuperate at home?

232
00:11:53,234 --> 00:11:55,301
Or are you going to recuperate
at Hongjoo's house like I did?

233
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:57,716
Of course he should recuperate at home.

234
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:00,201
Why would he burden someone else
when he has a home on his own?

235
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:01,567
And you're pretty much all better.

236
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:03,301
You're in a great condition, right?

237
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,948
I'm not in a great condition.
I haven't recovered yet.

238
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:08,400
I'm still...

239
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:11,735
Then you should stay at our house
for few days like Wootak did.

240
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:13,668
I'll take care of you.

241
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,767
That would be too shameless.

242
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:18,268
Wootak needed to be nursed by Hongjoo.

243
00:12:18,534 --> 00:12:20,068
-You're only...
-What about me?

244
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:23,001
Did you get hurt while saving
Hongjoo like Wootak did?

245
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:24,867
No. I didn't.

246
00:12:24,934 --> 00:12:26,802
Do you live alone like Wootak does?

247
00:12:26,868 --> 00:12:30,736
No, I live with you.
But you're not that useful.

248
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:34,034
I'll be useful. Leave it to me.

249
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:36,235
Thank you so much everyone.

250
00:12:37,334 --> 00:12:39,434
Let's go Jaechan. Don't trouble them.

251
00:12:44,033 --> 00:12:45,233
Come to our house.

252
00:12:45,534 --> 00:12:48,035
Since I know what to do,
I'd do a better job than you.

253
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:51,135
You can come to my house, right?

254
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:54,467
Well... Should I then?

255
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,700
Jaechan.

256
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:04,401
Jaechan.

257
00:13:06,501 --> 00:13:08,534
Why is he acting so clueless?

258
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:11,401
You're the one who is clueless.

259
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:12,368
What did I do?

260
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:14,968
I heard that they were
friends 13 years ago.

261
00:13:15,634 --> 00:13:17,168
Let them catch up.

262
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,368
Thank you.

263
00:13:28,701 --> 00:13:30,035
You went through a lot.

264
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:34,801
I'll take good care of Mr. Jung,
so you should go and clean your room.

265
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:36,867
He has to take his medication and...

266
00:13:36,934 --> 00:13:39,535
I'll be sure to have him take it.
Just clean your room.

267
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:41,901
Prosecutor Jung will faint
if he sees your messy room.

268
00:13:43,634 --> 00:13:45,368
There's nothing to clean.

269
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:50,367
The abalone porridge is really good.

270
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:52,600
How long do you need to recuperate here?

271
00:13:52,968 --> 00:13:54,502
Two days should be plenty, right?

272
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,034
Yes. That's plenty.

273
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:16,234
I know I left it in my room...

274
00:14:16,968 --> 00:14:18,101
If Jaechan finds out
that I lost the ring...

275
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,967
...he'll be so disappointed.

276
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,734
Can I come in?

277
00:14:23,868 --> 00:14:25,302
Yes. Come in.

278
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:32,616
It's messier than I imagined.

279
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:35,335
No. It's not usually this bad.

280
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:36,935
But I was looking for something.

281
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:38,068
Looking for what?

282
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,034
There's something.

283
00:14:40,534 --> 00:14:42,301
Sit down here.
Let's take your temperature.

284
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:54,201
By the way Hongjoo,
do you not like the ring I gave you?

285
00:14:55,234 --> 00:14:57,367
No. I love it.

286
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:59,034
Then why aren't you wearing it?

287
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,767
It's awkward to wear it at work.

288
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:05,266
And it's awkward at home
because of my mom.

289
00:15:06,467 --> 00:15:07,734
I'll wear it when
it's just the two of us.

290
00:15:07,801 --> 00:15:08,801
You have to wear it.

291
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,034
Okay.

292
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:15,934
Your fever is almost gone.

293
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,834
I'll change your dressing
tomorrow morning.

294
00:15:19,467 --> 00:15:21,001
You're almost like a doctor now.

295
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:27,167
I practiced once with Wootak.

296
00:15:30,868 --> 00:15:32,868
Did you take Wootak's temperature
and changed his dressing too?

297
00:15:32,934 --> 00:15:33,668
Yes.

298
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,934
Why? Why?

299
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:38,133
Are you bothered by that?
Are you jealous?

300
00:15:38,234 --> 00:15:40,102
Not at all. Not even one bit.

301
00:15:41,534 --> 00:15:42,801
You don't have to say, "Not at all."

302
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:44,402
Hongjoo. What are you doing?

303
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:45,768
Come out so Prosecutor Jung can rest.

304
00:15:45,868 --> 00:15:47,302
Okay.

305
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:50,768
Go to sleep.
Call me if you need anything.

306
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:52,369
Okay. Thank you.

307
00:15:56,367 --> 00:15:58,434
Why isn't your fever coming down?

308
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,734
I think it's because
I'm excited around you.

309
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,452
It's so hard, so how did you get stabbed.

310
00:16:18,534 --> 00:16:20,035
Don't do that. You're tickling me.

311
00:16:22,734 --> 00:16:23,535
I'm going to punish you.

312
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:26,800
I'm scared.

313
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,734
Stop embarrassing yourselves.

314
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:38,335
Seriously.
I shouldn't have come.

315
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,700
I shouldn't have come here.

316
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:46,568
Mom. Have you seen my ring?
The ring that Jaechan gave me?

317
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,048
No. I haven't seen it.
Did you lose it?

318
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,067
I put it on my makeup desk carefully,
but I don't see it.

319
00:16:53,067 --> 00:16:55,668
Why are you putting it on so
carefully when you're about to sleep?

320
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:57,101
Just do it roughly and go to bed.

321
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,567
I can't.
My skin is so sensitive lately.

322
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:01,101
What if I get a pimple or something?

323
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,434
Jaechan is here too.

324
00:17:05,968 --> 00:17:08,535
You said you met
Prosecutor Jung 13 years ago, right?

325
00:17:08,634 --> 00:17:11,901
Do you feel closer to him
now that you know that?

326
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,101
Why do you ask?
Do you want us to get closer?

327
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,735
No. I hope you don't
get any closer to him.

328
00:17:17,334 --> 00:17:20,268
We might grow closer to each other.
You never know what can happen.

329
00:17:20,367 --> 00:17:21,434
And after some time...

330
00:17:21,534 --> 00:17:23,168
I don't want that.

331
00:17:23,234 --> 00:17:26,801
Even after some time,
I don't want you to get closer.

332
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:53,535
We checked as you asked and your
son did sign to be an organ donor.

333
00:17:53,634 --> 00:17:54,667
You see?

334
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,867
I knew it.

335
00:17:57,067 --> 00:17:59,668
You raised a wonderful son.

336
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:08,734
Hwan, did you hear that?
Your doctor is praising you.

337
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:13,067
Please let me know when
you decide on the date.

338
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,767
I'll choose the day after tomorrow.

339
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:25,802
That day...

340
00:18:27,534 --> 00:18:28,201
...is...

341
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:32,134
...his birthday.

342
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:41,801
Organ donor?

343
00:18:41,868 --> 00:18:43,602
It hasn't been confirmed yet...

344
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:45,568
...but there's a brain dead patient
in a coma.

345
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,734
If the type matches
after the antibody test...

346
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:50,401
...I think Chanho should be
able to get the transplant.

347
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,100
Thank you.

348
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,202
Thank you so much.

349
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,667
What?
You're going to release that jerk?

350
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:12,716
You said that jerk killed my son.

351
00:19:12,801 --> 00:19:14,735
We can't get him just because
we didn't perform the autopsy?

352
00:19:14,901 --> 00:19:17,201
What's wrong with the law!

353
00:19:33,701 --> 00:19:35,035
What do we do, Robin?

354
00:19:38,234 --> 00:19:40,068
How am I supposed to understand this?

355
00:19:44,801 --> 00:19:49,435
You killed seven people
just to catch one guy.

356
00:19:49,934 --> 00:19:54,934
So, is this the justice you believe in?
Is this the justice you think it is?

357
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:31,835
What do I tell him?

358
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,734
You're going to lose your
breath if you recycle twice.

359
00:21:04,501 --> 00:21:05,402
Is something wrong?

360
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,667
I had a bad dream.

361
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:13,567
I've been thinking about
how I'm supposed to tell him.

362
00:21:13,701 --> 00:21:14,335
What?

363
00:21:14,767 --> 00:21:15,668
Me too.

364
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,600
Is it about Jaechan?

365
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,667
Yes. You too?

366
00:21:20,767 --> 00:21:21,334
Yes.

367
00:21:21,434 --> 00:21:23,834
Did Jaechan quit being
a prosecutor in your dream also?

368
00:21:23,934 --> 00:21:25,967
What? You too?

369
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,767
Yes.

370
00:21:30,634 --> 00:21:32,001
It's cold.

371
00:21:36,701 --> 00:21:37,901
What is this?

372
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,400
Why aren't they coming inside?

373
00:21:44,901 --> 00:21:47,268
We have to tell him.
This is about him.

374
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,434
What will change if we tell him?

375
00:21:51,534 --> 00:21:53,534
There's nothing we can change
even if he knows ahead of time.

376
00:21:53,634 --> 00:21:55,135
At least he can run away.

377
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,001
If he runs away...

378
00:21:56,067 --> 00:21:57,115
...someone else will have to deal with it.

379
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,534
Would you run away if it was you?
Would you be able to do that?

380
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,734
No.

381
00:22:00,834 --> 00:22:02,435
Jaechan is like you.

382
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:04,334
He's not someone who
would run away if he knows.

383
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:08,201
So don't tell him.
I'll make him run away.

384
00:22:09,334 --> 00:22:10,302
How?

385
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:27,167
The bus is here.

386
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:31,435
Aren't you going to get on?

387
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,501
No. I'm not going to work today.

388
00:22:33,901 --> 00:22:35,435
I'm going to play hooky today.

389
00:22:37,234 --> 00:22:37,835
Why?

390
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,267
The weather is so nice.

391
00:22:43,534 --> 00:22:46,301
There's no micro dust flying around.
You're not working today either.

392
00:22:46,534 --> 00:22:48,201
It would be a waste to be working today.

393
00:22:52,734 --> 00:22:55,168
So, where do you want to go?

394
00:23:00,868 --> 00:23:02,802
Mr. Bong, I'm sorry.

395
00:23:02,868 --> 00:23:05,469
I'm going to take a day off since
the weather is so nice today.

396
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:07,935
She must've gone crazy since
the weather is so nice today.

397
00:23:08,334 --> 00:23:09,801
What is wrong with Nam Hongjoo?

398
00:23:18,334 --> 00:23:19,467
Did you work all night long?

399
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:21,468
Yes.

400
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,168
Isn't everyone working all night
in our department right now?

401
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,767
Because we have to cover for someone...

402
00:23:27,868 --> 00:23:28,530
You brat.

403
00:23:28,601 --> 00:23:31,001
Is Jaechan resting because he wants to?

404
00:23:32,267 --> 00:23:34,300
He knows very well we're
suffering because of him.

405
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:36,801
Then he should come back
to work as soon as he can.

406
00:23:36,868 --> 00:23:39,168
I'm sure he's worried
while he's resting too.

407
00:23:40,901 --> 00:23:41,802
Jaechan...

408
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:04,600
We're so cute.

409
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:07,868
My gosh. So cute.

410
00:24:07,934 --> 00:24:08,735
You're cute.

411
00:24:09,634 --> 00:24:11,602
You're so cute.

412
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:15,333
-My puppy... You're so cute.
-Do I look cute?

413
00:24:17,601 --> 00:24:19,302
They're so embarrassing.
Don't you think?

414
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:22,168
-I brought you flowers.
-Oh?

415
00:24:22,267 --> 00:24:23,201
What's this?

416
00:24:23,534 --> 00:24:25,201
You're so romantic.

417
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,734
Where did you go?
You're hidden behind the flowers.

418
00:24:35,367 --> 00:24:36,849
I can't tell which one is
flower and which one is you.

419
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:39,334
You love beer. Make beer with this.

420
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:40,401
Thanks.

421
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,667
Should we go to the beach tomorrow?

422
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,267
I haven't been to
the beach for several years.

423
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,167
I'm going back to work tomorrow.

424
00:25:14,033 --> 00:25:16,734
You can play hooky like I did today.

425
00:25:20,534 --> 00:25:22,201
Is something going to happen to me?

426
00:25:22,467 --> 00:25:23,101
What?

427
00:25:24,267 --> 00:25:26,168
What are you talking about?

428
00:25:26,267 --> 00:25:28,501
I heard what you and Wootak
were talking about this morning.

429
00:25:28,968 --> 00:25:30,268
You said you saw something in your dream.

430
00:25:32,501 --> 00:25:33,248
Tell me.

431
00:25:33,334 --> 00:25:35,202
What kind of dream was it that
you keep telling me to run away?

432
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:43,302
You have to make a decision.

433
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:45,002
A very difficult decision.

434
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,434
If it turns out like my dream...

435
00:25:48,901 --> 00:25:51,901
...you have to inspect a dead body
as soon as you get to work.

436
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,501
"To perform inspection on a body to
determine if the death was criminal"

437
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:55,734
A victim is brain dead due to an accident.

438
00:25:56,601 --> 00:25:58,368
But you realize that the victim...

439
00:25:58,467 --> 00:26:00,701
...didn't get hurt because of
an accident during the inspection.

440
00:26:01,133 --> 00:26:02,567
If it wasn't due to an accident...

441
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:04,201
...are you saying that someone
hurt him intentionally?

442
00:26:04,467 --> 00:26:05,201
Yes.

443
00:26:05,834 --> 00:26:09,601
So you decide to perform the autopsy
and catch the culprit in the end.

444
00:26:10,534 --> 00:26:11,567
Then what's the problem?

445
00:26:11,634 --> 00:26:12,801
That brain dead victim...

446
00:26:14,434 --> 00:26:16,368
...is an organ donor.

447
00:26:17,968 --> 00:26:19,769
Because you decided
to perform the autopsy...

448
00:26:19,868 --> 00:26:21,369
...he's not able to donate his organs.

449
00:26:22,567 --> 00:26:24,501
So seven people who has
been waiting for the transplant...

450
00:26:25,601 --> 00:26:26,402
They die?

451
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,634
Yes.

452
00:26:28,934 --> 00:26:33,568
So, you end up quitting
because of the shock.

453
00:26:36,767 --> 00:26:37,967
What if I don't perform the autopsy?

454
00:26:38,167 --> 00:26:39,968
I just have to catch the culprit
without performing the autopsy.

455
00:26:40,334 --> 00:26:42,135
Wootak had a dream
about you too.

456
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,702
In his dream, you did exactly that.

457
00:26:44,868 --> 00:26:48,335
You didn't perform the autopsy
and decided to save seven people.

458
00:26:48,434 --> 00:26:49,235
But...

459
00:26:59,934 --> 00:27:02,134
The culprit is acquitted at the trial.

460
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,301
Because you didn't perform the autopsy,
the cause of death is unclear.

461
00:27:06,701 --> 00:27:10,935
The victim's father resents you for it
and you end up blaming yourself.

462
00:27:11,033 --> 00:27:12,534
Then, I quit being a prosecutor.

463
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:14,334
Yes.

464
00:27:17,868 --> 00:27:19,769
You don't know who
is the brain dead victim?

465
00:27:20,133 --> 00:27:21,400
We didn't see that far.

466
00:27:24,734 --> 00:27:26,734
If I perform the autopsy,
seven people will die.

467
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:28,728
If I perform the autopsy...

468
00:27:28,801 --> 00:27:31,201
...I'll save seven people,
but lose the culprit.

469
00:27:32,033 --> 00:27:36,001
So I end up quitting whether
I perform the autopsy or not.

470
00:27:40,934 --> 00:27:42,501
That's why you guys told me to run away.

471
00:27:42,901 --> 00:27:44,468
Because I'll regret my decision
no matter what.

472
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:48,735
Gosh. That sucks.

473
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:52,300
I know.

474
00:27:52,567 --> 00:27:55,401
It really sucks.

475
00:28:08,734 --> 00:28:09,901
Let's go to the beach tomorrow.

476
00:28:11,634 --> 00:28:12,401
Really?

477
00:28:12,467 --> 00:28:14,368
Yes. I want to run away.

478
00:28:16,067 --> 00:28:17,601
Okay. Let's go.

479
00:28:18,501 --> 00:28:21,402
I know it's cowardly,
but I want to run away.

480
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:24,635
I really don't want to
quit being a prosecutor.

481
00:28:25,167 --> 00:28:27,001
Of course you don't.

482
00:28:28,634 --> 00:28:30,535
If he runs away,
someone else will have to deal with it.

483
00:28:30,634 --> 00:28:33,068
Would you run away if it was you?
Would you be able to do it?

484
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:35,001
Yes. I can.
I can totally do it.

485
00:28:35,067 --> 00:28:36,334
Jaechan is just like you.

486
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,834
He's not someone who
would run away if he knows.

487
00:28:37,934 --> 00:28:39,802
No. I would run away.

488
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:41,802
I don't care if someone
else has to deal with it.

489
00:28:41,868 --> 00:28:43,402
I'm not the same as Wootak.

490
00:28:43,501 --> 00:28:45,202
My level of conscience is quite low.

491
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:46,300
That's great.

492
00:28:46,901 --> 00:28:49,402
You have to know who you are.

493
00:28:50,133 --> 00:28:51,367
Sir.

494
00:28:51,801 --> 00:28:53,201
Would you mind taking a picture for us?

495
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,967
I don't want to. We never met before.

496
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,333
Why would you ask me
to take your picture?

497
00:28:56,934 --> 00:28:57,749
Did you see that?

498
00:28:57,834 --> 00:28:59,668
I'm going to do whatever
I want from now on.

499
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,734
He's so rude. What a brat.

500
00:29:05,801 --> 00:29:07,235
Let's go, Baby.
I'll buy you some barbeque.

501
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,182
Don't feel hurt.

502
00:29:08,267 --> 00:29:09,168
Okay.

503
00:29:09,901 --> 00:29:12,301
I think your brother is a good prosecutor.

504
00:29:12,767 --> 00:29:14,501
What are you talking
about all of a sudden?

505
00:29:15,701 --> 00:29:18,801
Your brother released Do Hakyoung
because he was innocent.

506
00:29:18,901 --> 00:29:21,135
That's obvious.

507
00:29:21,234 --> 00:29:23,135
A teacher is someone who teaches students.

508
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,300
A president protects the citizens.

509
00:29:25,567 --> 00:29:27,401
And the prosecutor indicts
if someone commits a crime.

510
00:29:27,501 --> 00:29:29,308
And if the person didn't commit a crime,
he releases them.

511
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,400
Is he a good prosecutor just
because he did the obvious?

512
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,701
Doing the obvious is difficult.

513
00:29:35,367 --> 00:29:36,601
I realized that after watching my father.

514
00:29:38,434 --> 00:29:40,668
My father was a doctor who saves people.

515
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,967
But he met a bad prosecutor
and became a serial killer.

516
00:29:47,934 --> 00:29:49,768
Who was that prosecutor?

517
00:29:51,234 --> 00:29:52,068
This guy.

518
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,068
There is one who fabricates
documents and evidence.

519
00:29:57,067 --> 00:29:59,001
A prosecutor who makes up
crime that doesn't exist.

520
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:06,068
You're so fortunate, Mr. Moon.

521
00:30:06,868 --> 00:30:10,402
I found out from the hospital that
Yoo Hwan will donate his organs soon.

522
00:30:10,467 --> 00:30:11,767
If he donates his organs...

523
00:30:11,834 --> 00:30:13,234
...they won't be able to
perform the autopsy, right?

524
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,901
It will be game over if they
don't perform the autopsy.

525
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,601
It will just end up being an accident.

526
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:20,166
Even if it goes to trial somehow,
you don't need to worry about anything.

527
00:30:20,267 --> 00:30:21,349
The cause of death would be unclear...

528
00:30:21,434 --> 00:30:22,968
...so it would be a piece of
cake to have you acquitted.

529
00:30:23,067 --> 00:30:25,634
I'm going to trust you, Attorney Lee.

530
00:30:27,467 --> 00:30:30,534
You should look for the owner of that hat.

531
00:30:30,634 --> 00:30:32,034
That's what's bothering me the most.

532
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:33,266
I understand.

533
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,234
Are we really going to the beach tomorrow?

534
00:30:44,501 --> 00:30:46,435
Of course. It would be a waste
of breath to say it twice.

535
00:30:47,033 --> 00:30:51,133
But will you be able to take
another day off consecutively?

536
00:30:51,968 --> 00:30:55,101
I worked passionately enough
to take two days off consecutively.

537
00:30:55,868 --> 00:30:58,635
Don't worry about me and just
look for a place to go tomorrow.

538
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,334
Okay.
Let's go inside.

539
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,201
Hey.

540
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,433
Come inside here.
Come in.

541
00:31:04,501 --> 00:31:05,082
Why?

542
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:07,068
You're only supposed to stay
at Hongjoo's house for two days.

543
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:08,968
It's been two days already. Come home.

544
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,901
But my things are still in there.

545
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:14,167
Mrs. Yoon already brought them over.

546
00:31:14,868 --> 00:31:17,168
Stop burdening them and come in.

547
00:31:17,367 --> 00:31:18,367
Okay.

548
00:31:20,033 --> 00:31:20,796
I'll see you tomorrow.

549
00:31:20,868 --> 00:31:21,535
Okay.

550
00:31:27,033 --> 00:31:28,867
Why is mom acting like this?

551
00:31:35,801 --> 00:31:37,968
You came at the right time.
Let's fold this together.

552
00:31:38,901 --> 00:31:39,668
Okay.

553
00:31:44,434 --> 00:31:45,201
Mom.

554
00:31:45,634 --> 00:31:46,368
Yes?

555
00:31:46,868 --> 00:31:49,235
I heard you took Jaechan's things
back to his house.

556
00:31:49,501 --> 00:31:51,501
He was supposed to just stay
two days from the beginning.

557
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:55,001
But you're being so cold-hearted.

558
00:32:00,234 --> 00:32:02,434
Is there something you're
disappointed with Jaechan?

559
00:32:02,534 --> 00:32:04,135
No. There isn't anything like that.

560
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:32,868
I changed it.

561
00:32:33,734 --> 00:32:37,435
I changed it,
but it turned out to be worse.

562
00:32:37,667 --> 00:32:40,468
If he dies like dad...

563
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,767
I knew that dad will die,
but I couldn't stop it.

564
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,467
Mom, I couldn't stop it.

565
00:32:52,801 --> 00:32:54,602
I couldn't save dad.

566
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,534
Mom, I couldn't stop it.

567
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,535
I'm sorry, Prosecutor Jung.

568
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,001
I can't watch my Hongjoo
suffer any longer.

569
00:33:42,801 --> 00:33:44,702
Which beach should we go to?

570
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,500
It would be too far for us to go
to Namhae in one day, right?

571
00:33:54,334 --> 00:33:56,282
I sent you some onion extract.
Did you get it?

572
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,101
I've been praying for you every day.

573
00:33:58,434 --> 00:34:01,567
Don't worry about us and
take good care of yourself.

574
00:34:02,334 --> 00:34:04,568
Don't do too much and
rest more if you're still hurting.

575
00:34:05,634 --> 00:34:08,168
If you're not here I'm the most
handsome person in the office.

576
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,067
No one notices that you're not here.
Get as much rest as possible.

577
00:34:13,534 --> 00:34:17,068
Why is everyone showing
excessive humanism all of a sudden?

578
00:34:18,734 --> 00:34:20,368
I don't care. I'm going to the beach.

579
00:34:20,467 --> 00:34:21,634
Gosh.

580
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:30,801
Is that what you wear to the beach?

581
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:33,449
Yes. I usually dress like this
when I go to the beach.

582
00:34:33,534 --> 00:34:36,768
Sunglasses with a suit and a mat.

583
00:34:40,467 --> 00:34:43,068
Why isn't the bus coming?
The bus heading to the beach?

584
00:34:44,534 --> 00:34:45,667
You're nervous, aren't you?

585
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,867
You're worried that other people
will suffer instead of you.

586
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,867
No. I'm not worried.

587
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,600
And they can suffer
instead of me a little bit.

588
00:34:55,701 --> 00:34:57,268
I'm the only one...

589
00:34:57,367 --> 00:35:00,467
...who gets beat up by the suspects
and gets shot all the time.

590
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:02,734
It would be too harsh for me
to quit being a prosecutor too.

591
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,635
I'm suffering more than anyone.

592
00:35:04,701 --> 00:35:07,268
This is not how things should be like.

593
00:35:07,334 --> 00:35:08,868
The burden should be divided equally
amongst all of us.

594
00:35:11,934 --> 00:35:12,967
That's okay.

595
00:35:13,334 --> 00:35:15,786
We can go to the beach later,
so go back to work.

596
00:35:15,868 --> 00:35:17,135
Why? Let's go to the beach.

597
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,034
You said you want to go to the beach.

598
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:20,101
It's okay. I was feeling
uncomfortable about going too.

599
00:35:20,167 --> 00:35:21,883
Look. Look.
I brought my notebook already.

600
00:35:21,968 --> 00:35:23,235
I was going to go to work
if it doesn't work out.

601
00:35:29,968 --> 00:35:32,302
I'm sure we'll find a way.

602
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:34,834
Go back to work.

603
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,901
Okay.

604
00:35:43,334 --> 00:35:45,101
But if I think it's not good
after I go back to work...

605
00:35:45,167 --> 00:35:46,495
...I'm going to run away to the beach.

606
00:35:46,567 --> 00:35:48,634
If you run away to the beach, call me.
I'll run away with you.

607
00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:10,935
I told you that it will
be a difficult decision.

608
00:36:11,868 --> 00:36:13,369
You better be prepared.

609
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:18,669
Okay.

610
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:24,368
Hurry up and push me.

611
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,268
It fits you perfectly.

612
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,082
You've seen me before, haven't you?

613
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:22,467
In front of the elevator...

614
00:37:22,801 --> 00:37:25,968
No. I've never seen you before.

615
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,267
Are you okay?

616
00:38:00,367 --> 00:38:03,001
You're under arrest for
suspicion of assault.

617
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,767
You have the right to have
an attorney represent you...

618
00:38:05,834 --> 00:38:07,335
...and you have the right
to remain silent.

619
00:38:07,434 --> 00:38:10,426
No.
I was just trying to speak to the child.

620
00:38:10,534 --> 00:38:13,834
What were you trying to say to
a child that made him pee himself?

621
00:38:13,968 --> 00:38:17,869
Let's go to the police station first and
talk about what happened in detail.

622
00:38:24,701 --> 00:38:26,935
Kid. Are you alright?

623
00:38:27,133 --> 00:38:28,200
But Wootak.

624
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,215
How did you know that he was going to do
something wrong and had us pursue him?

625
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,234
You know that I can read
people's faces a little bit.

626
00:38:34,934 --> 00:38:37,835
Does my face show that
I'd become an inspector?

627
00:38:39,033 --> 00:38:39,867
I'm not sure.

628
00:38:42,234 --> 00:38:43,772
Mr. Bong. I'm here.

629
00:38:43,868 --> 00:38:45,469
Hey. I'm glad you're here.

630
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:47,976
You know about the  teaching assistant
that you were going to interview?

631
00:38:48,067 --> 00:38:48,801
Oh my...

632
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:50,800
Yes. I remember.

633
00:38:50,901 --> 00:38:54,001
Do you mean that teaching assistant who
accused Mr. Moon for overuse of power?

634
00:38:54,767 --> 00:38:56,434
Did you not look at yourself today?

635
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:59,101
Now you're being rebellious
about our uniform.

636
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,667
Well, I was trying to be rebellious.

637
00:39:03,534 --> 00:39:05,068
Please continue about
that teaching assistant.

638
00:39:07,968 --> 00:39:08,802
I mean...

639
00:39:08,901 --> 00:39:12,235
I called Seogu University Hospital to
see if I can get an interview from him.

640
00:39:12,334 --> 00:39:14,001
But he's currently brain dead.

641
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,801
He's going to be donating
his organs today.

642
00:39:15,901 --> 00:39:17,068
To seven people.

643
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:22,267
Seven people....

644
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:24,500
It was him.

645
00:39:24,701 --> 00:39:25,302
What?

646
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:28,402
Mr. Bong. I'll be back.

647
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:31,901
Okay. Go ahead.

648
00:39:32,501 --> 00:39:34,435
I don't think I'm her superior,
but her subordinate.

649
00:39:35,634 --> 00:39:37,201
If the suspect gets arrested,
give me a call.

650
00:39:37,267 --> 00:39:38,768
I'll check my cell phone.

651
00:39:38,934 --> 00:39:39,967
And please check to see...

652
00:39:40,067 --> 00:39:42,200
...if the report I submitted
this morning has been approved.

653
00:39:42,267 --> 00:39:43,034
Yes, Madam.

654
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,141
Where are you going?

655
00:39:48,234 --> 00:39:50,835
I'm going to the hospital
because of Chanho.

656
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,201
Wait...

657
00:39:57,501 --> 00:39:58,402
Here.

658
00:39:58,467 --> 00:39:59,168
Yes.

659
00:40:00,834 --> 00:40:02,268
Her son must be ill.

660
00:40:02,334 --> 00:40:04,068
I think so.

661
00:40:06,133 --> 00:40:08,533
She must be having a hard time
because she's a single mom.

662
00:40:15,067 --> 00:40:17,768
Everyone. I was able to recover
well thanks to all of you.

663
00:40:17,868 --> 00:40:18,935
You must've been worried
about me so much...

664
00:40:19,033 --> 00:40:20,534
Okay. Welcome back.

665
00:40:20,601 --> 00:40:21,569
You're here, Jaechan.

666
00:40:25,934 --> 00:40:27,635
They were not that worried
about me at all.

667
00:40:34,334 --> 00:40:36,501
What's wrong?

668
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:39,001
Did something happen to Chanho?

669
00:40:39,901 --> 00:40:44,235
Chanho might get
a transplant surgery today.

670
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,201
Did they find a donor?

671
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,901
Yes. There's a brain dead patient.

672
00:40:49,067 --> 00:40:51,100
I think he might be
declared dead officially soon.

673
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,734
Once it's declared, they're going
to have the surgery right away.

674
00:40:55,367 --> 00:40:57,001
It doesn't seem real.

675
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,800
I can't believe it either.

676
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,200
It will go well, won't it?

677
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,801
Of course! It will go well!

678
00:41:04,968 --> 00:41:07,235
I don't want others to worry about it.

679
00:41:07,601 --> 00:41:08,402
You know what I mean, right?

680
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:11,268
I can keep a secret.

681
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,767
If I had a big mouth...

682
00:41:13,834 --> 00:41:15,967
...everyone at work would know that...

683
00:41:16,067 --> 00:41:18,100
...Mr. Park had Botox
and Ms. Shin is Buddhist.

684
00:41:19,801 --> 00:41:21,402
Mr. Park had Botox done?

685
00:41:21,467 --> 00:41:23,368
Gosh. Don't even start.

686
00:41:23,467 --> 00:41:25,701
Mr. Park is addicted
to cosmetic surgeries.

687
00:41:25,801 --> 00:41:27,068
If you look at him carefully...

688
00:41:27,968 --> 00:41:30,635
My goodness. And Ms. Shin is a Buddhist?

689
00:41:30,734 --> 00:41:32,767
She's quite devout.

690
00:41:32,968 --> 00:41:36,936
She went to the temple to bow 108 times
when she was looking for a house.

691
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,934
Amazing.

692
00:41:38,434 --> 00:41:40,201
I'm just finding out such funny things.

693
00:41:52,567 --> 00:41:54,268
Are you feeling a little relaxed now?

694
00:41:59,968 --> 00:42:04,836
You need to be relaxed like this
and be calm at the hospital later too.

695
00:42:06,434 --> 00:42:07,235
Do you understand?

696
00:42:08,634 --> 00:42:09,535
Thanks.

697
00:42:14,567 --> 00:42:15,501
All the best.

698
00:42:18,267 --> 00:42:19,334
I'll call you.

699
00:42:33,033 --> 00:42:33,834
I hope it works out.

700
00:42:41,667 --> 00:42:43,767
Where did everyone go?

701
00:42:49,801 --> 00:42:51,602
Hyangmi. I'm here.

702
00:42:51,934 --> 00:42:53,635
You're here, Prosecutor Jung.

703
00:42:54,567 --> 00:42:55,934
Why are you coming in like that?

704
00:42:56,033 --> 00:42:59,400
Prosecutor Jung. You prefer seeing
me from behind than from the front.

705
00:42:59,601 --> 00:43:02,734
I'm going to walk around like
this in front of you from now on.

706
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,801
Yes. Thank you.

707
00:43:05,067 --> 00:43:06,301
Hello, Hyangmi.

708
00:43:08,033 --> 00:43:09,066
Prosecutor Jung.

709
00:43:09,901 --> 00:43:11,335
Are you alright?

710
00:43:11,767 --> 00:43:13,568
Have you recovered fully from your injury?

711
00:43:13,634 --> 00:43:15,133
You didn't overdo it by
coming to work, did you?

712
00:43:15,334 --> 00:43:16,467
Oh my goodness, look at your face.

713
00:43:16,567 --> 00:43:19,034
You've gotten so thin.
You were so thin to begin with.

714
00:43:21,267 --> 00:43:23,701
You're the only one who
is welcoming me back.

715
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,333
What are you talking about?
Everyone missed you a lot.

716
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,467
No. You're the only one.

717
00:43:29,968 --> 00:43:31,202
You can share your feelings
with someone else.

718
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,967
Please take care of this first.

719
00:43:33,567 --> 00:43:34,667
What is this?

720
00:43:34,815 --> 00:43:36,015
Inspection documents.

721
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:39,334
They need to start the organ transplants
as soon as the inspection is done.

722
00:43:39,434 --> 00:43:40,968
So, you need to take care of it
right away.

723
00:43:48,634 --> 00:43:50,502
"Organ Donation Clearance Form"

724
00:43:51,801 --> 00:43:53,348
If it goes according to my dream...

725
00:43:53,434 --> 00:43:56,768
...you're going to go on an inspection
as soon as you get back to work.

726
00:43:57,067 --> 00:43:58,301
What are you waiting for?

727
00:43:58,464 --> 00:44:00,168
Please stamp it with
your seal and send it out.

728
00:44:00,267 --> 00:44:02,968
Then, they can start the transplant.

729
00:44:03,534 --> 00:44:04,435
Mr. Choi.

730
00:44:04,834 --> 00:44:08,335
What do we do if this person
isn't brain dead due to an accident?

731
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:09,934
If he's brain dead because
someone hit him...

732
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,601
Then, you can't approve
the organ transplant.

733
00:44:15,501 --> 00:44:17,668
Mr. Choi. I want you to come with
me to Seogu University Hospital.

734
00:44:17,767 --> 00:44:19,034
Excuse me?
Why...

735
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,834
I think I need to dig into the case
a bit more before I sign it off.

736
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,968
Yes, I see.

737
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,567
He's going to dig as soon as he gets back?

738
00:44:28,634 --> 00:44:30,201
He's always digging.

739
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,634
Is he the gopher of this office?

740
00:44:34,267 --> 00:44:35,768
I totally forgot.

741
00:44:36,133 --> 00:44:37,967
That's why no one is welcoming him back.

742
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:38,934
I know.

743
00:44:48,167 --> 00:44:49,001
It's not mine.

744
00:44:53,067 --> 00:44:53,901
Yes, Wootak.

745
00:44:53,968 --> 00:44:55,101
Where are you right now?

746
00:44:55,334 --> 00:44:56,901
I'm on my way to the hospital
to inspect the victim.

747
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,801
You heard about my dream
from Hongjoo, right?

748
00:44:59,133 --> 00:45:00,400
Yes. I did.

749
00:45:01,667 --> 00:45:04,101
I think I just arrested
the culprit of that case.

750
00:45:05,367 --> 00:45:06,534
Professor Moon Taemin.

751
00:45:07,267 --> 00:45:08,101
Really?

752
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,400
And I think I just found
the witness to the crime also.

753
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,700
He's still a child,
so his testimony is a bit confusing...

754
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,501
...but he gave quite a lot of detail.

755
00:45:18,801 --> 00:45:20,068
In a little while...

756
00:45:20,133 --> 00:45:21,967
...this case will be transferred
to Han River Police Station.

757
00:45:22,067 --> 00:45:24,301
"Transfer of case jurisdiction"

758
00:45:24,934 --> 00:45:26,268
You're here, Prosecutor Jung.

759
00:45:26,367 --> 00:45:28,201
Have you recovered fully?

760
00:45:28,367 --> 00:45:28,934
Yes.

761
00:45:29,801 --> 00:45:31,834
Please tell me in detail of what happened.

762
00:45:32,367 --> 00:45:33,801
They said I have to go to...

763
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:36,869
...Han River Police Station for
assault because of that kid.

764
00:45:36,968 --> 00:45:38,669
Assault isn't the issue.

765
00:45:38,767 --> 00:45:41,301
If you go there now, it's obvious that
you'll be connected to that case.

766
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,800
They won't be able...

767
00:45:43,667 --> 00:45:46,001
...to perform the autopsy once
the transplant is done, right?

768
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:48,101
Cause of death would be unclear also.

769
00:45:48,167 --> 00:45:52,549
Then I can get away with it cleanly.

770
00:45:52,634 --> 00:45:55,034
For now, ask for a lawyer
when you get to the police station...

771
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,334
...and keep your mouth shut.

772
00:45:56,834 --> 00:45:58,234
I'll take care of the rest.

773
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,201
This is driving me crazy.

774
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,002
Let's go to
Seogu University Hospital first.

775
00:46:12,167 --> 00:46:12,801
Yes, Sir.

776
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,167
Just endure a little longer.
You're so strong, Chanho.

777
00:46:38,267 --> 00:46:40,915
Yes. If you can endure
through the surgery today...

778
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,734
...you won't have to go through
dialysis at the hospital anymore.

779
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,368
Then I can pee like other kids too, right?

780
00:46:47,467 --> 00:46:48,634
Of course.

781
00:46:49,133 --> 00:46:51,467
You're so smart.

782
00:46:52,901 --> 00:46:53,835
Doctor.

783
00:46:53,934 --> 00:46:55,835
Ms. Son. Just a moment please.

784
00:46:56,067 --> 00:46:56,816
What's going on?

785
00:46:56,901 --> 00:46:59,135
I don't think we can
have the surgery today.

786
00:46:59,667 --> 00:47:00,635
Why all of a sudden...

787
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,501
The prosecutor just
came by for inspection...

788
00:47:02,567 --> 00:47:04,700
...but he left without signing
off on the organ harvesting.

789
00:47:05,367 --> 00:47:07,335
He said they might have
to perform the autopsy.

790
00:47:28,667 --> 00:47:29,501
Excuse me.

791
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:30,701
Yes?

792
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:34,103
Did patient named Lee Hwan
go in for organ transplant?

793
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,233
Who might you be?

794
00:47:35,334 --> 00:47:36,467
I'm Hwan's friend.

795
00:47:36,667 --> 00:47:38,582
The professor was wondering
what's going on with Hwan.

796
00:47:38,667 --> 00:47:41,301
The prosecutor came by earlier
and inspected the patient.

797
00:47:41,367 --> 00:47:42,968
He said that it might
not have been an accident...

798
00:47:43,067 --> 00:47:44,935
...so he didn't sign off
on the organ harvesting.

799
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:45,968
He didn't sign off?

800
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,834
Do you know who that prosecutor is?

801
00:47:56,234 --> 00:47:58,582
He said he was
Prosecutor Jung Jaechan.

802
00:47:58,667 --> 00:47:59,734
He was quite tall.

803
00:48:03,767 --> 00:48:05,960
Fine, Jaechan. Let's go at it.

804
00:48:06,067 --> 00:48:08,035
Since it turned out like this,
take it to trial.

805
00:48:08,133 --> 00:48:10,233
Let's have a proper showdown at the trial.

806
00:48:16,834 --> 00:48:17,867
Ms. Son.

807
00:48:18,601 --> 00:48:20,068
Why are you back so soon?

808
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:21,701
What about the surgery?

809
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:24,401
It didn't happen.

810
00:48:25,067 --> 00:48:26,035
Why not?

811
00:48:27,667 --> 00:48:33,268
I told you that it doesn't seem
real and I couldn't believe it.

812
00:48:34,234 --> 00:48:35,735
I was right about that feeling.

813
00:48:37,367 --> 00:48:40,168
The donor who is supposed
to give his kidney to Chanho...

814
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,601
...needs to have the autopsy.

815
00:48:50,267 --> 00:48:51,634
The two of you were here.

816
00:48:53,067 --> 00:48:54,534
Mr. Park is calling for you.

817
00:48:54,901 --> 00:48:56,735
He's calling for us? Why all of a sudden?

818
00:48:56,801 --> 00:48:58,702
He wants to discuss something urgently.

819
00:49:02,167 --> 00:49:04,801
"Organ Donation Clearance Form"

820
00:49:12,467 --> 00:49:13,661
What's going on?

821
00:49:13,834 --> 00:49:15,568
What do we need to discuss suddenly?

822
00:49:15,767 --> 00:49:19,735
Our rookie is giving us headaches
as soon as he came back.

823
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:21,502
You again...

824
00:49:21,601 --> 00:49:23,001
He's not giving us a head headache.

825
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,133
This is an issue that we should look into.

826
00:49:25,434 --> 00:49:26,302
Go ahead.

827
00:49:26,467 --> 00:49:27,134
Yes.

828
00:49:27,701 --> 00:49:31,701
I just got back from inspecting the brain
dead patient at Seogu University Hospital.

829
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,800
If I sign off for organ donation...

830
00:49:33,868 --> 00:49:35,702
...they would've gone ahead
with the surgery.

831
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,900
Then why are you just
waiting around like this?

832
00:49:40,968 --> 00:49:42,923
It's an urgent surgery,
so you need to sign off on it.

833
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,177
I couldn't sign off on it.

834
00:49:44,267 --> 00:49:45,300
Why not?

835
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,368
It doesn't seem like it was
injured due to an accident.

836
00:49:52,133 --> 00:49:53,467
What is it if it's not an accident?

837
00:49:56,701 --> 00:49:59,701
This is the video, Reporter Nam
from SBC sent me earlier.

838
00:49:59,767 --> 00:50:02,101
This is from Writer Moon Taemin's
publication party.

839
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:04,635
The teaching assistant
you see here is the victim.

840
00:50:04,834 --> 00:50:07,834
As you can see, he was dragged out
while he was acting in disobedience.

841
00:50:07,934 --> 00:50:08,635
And one hour later...

842
00:50:08,734 --> 00:50:11,635
...he was found fallen through
the elevator shaft in the same building.

843
00:50:11,734 --> 00:50:14,101
I thought he fell through the elevator
shaft because he was completely drunk.

844
00:50:14,167 --> 00:50:14,868
No.

845
00:50:15,801 --> 00:50:18,794
As you can see here,
he wasn't drunk at all.

846
00:50:18,901 --> 00:50:21,235
And unlike the others,
he didn't drink much at all.

847
00:50:21,801 --> 00:50:22,735
You're right.

848
00:50:23,834 --> 00:50:27,668
So, you're saying that
someone pushed him off?

849
00:50:28,167 --> 00:50:28,801
Yes.

850
00:50:30,767 --> 00:50:32,101
Do you have a suspect?

851
00:50:32,567 --> 00:50:36,068
If you didn't sign off on a guess,
you'll be killing many more people.

852
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:40,168
Writer Moon Taemin is the prime suspect.

853
00:50:41,567 --> 00:50:42,435
Really?

854
00:50:42,567 --> 00:50:44,834
Just a moment ago,
I received a call from a police station.

855
00:50:44,934 --> 00:50:47,835
Mr. Moon was arrested for assault
after pursuing a kindergartener.

856
00:50:47,934 --> 00:50:49,201
But that kindergartener said that...

857
00:50:49,267 --> 00:50:51,168
...he saw Mr. Moon at
the scene of the crime.

858
00:50:52,634 --> 00:50:54,268
That's suspicious on many ways.

859
00:50:54,901 --> 00:50:56,736
I think we'll have to perform the autopsy.

860
00:50:56,834 --> 00:50:57,501
Sir.

861
00:50:57,567 --> 00:51:00,901
But we can't perform the autopsy
right now since he's brain dead.

862
00:51:00,968 --> 00:51:04,302
If he's brain dead, he'll usually die of
cardiac arrest in a few days.

863
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,581
We can perform the autopsy then.

864
00:51:05,667 --> 00:51:08,301
Then, he won't be able
to donate his organs...

865
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,467
So you're saying that
we shouldn't perform the autopsy...

866
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:10,634
...just so that we can have him
donate his organs?

867
00:51:11,033 --> 00:51:12,387
What if we lose the culprit?

868
00:51:12,467 --> 00:51:14,567
What if it's revealed that it was
an accident after the autopsy?

869
00:51:14,834 --> 00:51:17,401
We'll let seven people
lose their lives for nothing.

870
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,734
I just can't understand.

871
00:51:23,868 --> 00:51:25,901
Are we going to perform
the autopsy with just this evidence...

872
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,100
...and go against the will of the victim's
family's wish to donate his organs?

873
00:51:28,767 --> 00:51:31,401
The victim's family requested
for the autopsy as well.

874
00:51:31,501 --> 00:51:33,601
I'm sure you convinced him
because you wanted this case.

875
00:51:33,767 --> 00:51:34,401
Hey.

876
00:51:34,701 --> 00:51:35,849
Getting good performance record...

877
00:51:35,934 --> 00:51:37,835
..is more important to you than
saving seven people's lives, right?

878
00:51:37,934 --> 00:51:39,134
It's not like that, Mr. Lee.

879
00:51:39,234 --> 00:51:40,434
Hey, Lee Jikwang.

880
00:51:40,567 --> 00:51:41,901
What is wrong with you?

881
00:51:42,067 --> 00:51:44,100
Is this something we
should decide emotionally?

882
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,101
If there's suspicion of a homicide...

883
00:51:46,167 --> 00:51:48,035
...it's our primary job to find out
the cause through the autopsy.

884
00:51:48,133 --> 00:51:48,967
Don't you know that?

885
00:51:49,767 --> 00:51:51,501
That's how we take
the perpetrator to court.

886
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:53,967
But there has to be valid evidence.

887
00:51:54,868 --> 00:51:56,235
Do you think those evidence...

888
00:51:56,334 --> 00:52:00,334
...is great enough to exchange it
with the lives of seven people?

889
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,634
Do you think that way too?

890
00:52:09,634 --> 00:52:12,201
I also think that
Mr. Lee's point is valid.

891
00:52:12,701 --> 00:52:14,168
To give up on the organ donation...

892
00:52:14,234 --> 00:52:18,468
...with this evidence and performing
an autopsy is a dangerous decision.

893
00:52:27,467 --> 00:52:28,401
What do you think, Ms. Son?

894
00:52:30,767 --> 00:52:31,468
Yes?

895
00:52:31,801 --> 00:52:32,801
What do you think?

896
00:52:32,901 --> 00:52:35,235
Should we sign off on
the organ harvesting?

897
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:42,834
I...

898
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:48,435
I...

899
00:52:53,534 --> 00:52:55,953
I don't think we should sign off on it.

900
00:52:56,442 --> 00:52:57,476
Ms. Son.

901
00:52:59,734 --> 00:53:00,968
We should...

902
00:53:02,534 --> 00:53:03,701
...perform the autopsy.

903
00:53:06,567 --> 00:53:07,934
I think that...

904
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,234
...he made the right decision.

905
00:53:35,167 --> 00:53:37,534
Are you in the right mind, Ms. Son?

906
00:53:37,634 --> 00:53:39,868
Don't you know what case
Prosecutor Jung is working on right now?

907
00:53:39,934 --> 00:53:42,868
That brain dead patient is the one
who can give his kidney to Chanho.

908
00:53:43,834 --> 00:53:44,601
I know that.

909
00:53:44,701 --> 00:53:46,402
But you're saying we
have to do the autopsy?

910
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,934
Do you want to give up on
Chanho just to catch a culprit?

911
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,334
You know that's not what I mean.

912
00:53:51,434 --> 00:53:54,601
No, I don't know.
I just don't understand!

913
00:53:56,634 --> 00:53:58,667
If you're going to say that you're
making the decision as a prosecutor...

914
00:53:58,734 --> 00:54:00,134
If you're going to act holy now...

915
00:54:00,234 --> 00:54:02,768
I didn't decide as a prosecutor.

916
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,234
I decided as a parent.

917
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,267
If...

918
00:54:16,734 --> 00:54:18,734
...I was the parent of
that teaching assistant...

919
00:54:20,334 --> 00:54:22,401
...I would want to reveal...

920
00:54:23,234 --> 00:54:26,168
...how my son died rather than
saving someone else's child.

921
00:54:29,167 --> 00:54:30,068
Hwan.

922
00:54:31,567 --> 00:54:32,667
Say something.

923
00:54:35,801 --> 00:54:37,702
Who did this to you?

924
00:54:41,267 --> 00:54:42,901
I will...

925
00:54:45,501 --> 00:54:47,302
...catch him and punish him.

926
00:54:49,467 --> 00:54:51,600
So please tell me, you brat.

927
00:55:00,934 --> 00:55:03,802
Rather saving seven or 70 lives...

928
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,335
...I would want to get justice...

929
00:55:08,701 --> 00:55:11,235
...for my son first.

930
00:55:14,067 --> 00:55:15,801
That's the heart of a parent.

931
00:55:18,334 --> 00:55:22,202
That's why I think that we
should perform the autopsy.

932
00:55:24,067 --> 00:55:25,534
That's what I think...

933
00:55:27,901 --> 00:55:29,235
...as a parent...

934
00:55:33,601 --> 00:55:35,035
...and not as a prosecutor.

935
00:56:14,501 --> 00:56:18,068
This brain dead patient won't last
a week and will die of cardiac arrest.

936
00:56:18,501 --> 00:56:19,868
You can perform the autopsy then.

937
00:56:20,267 --> 00:56:21,934
Don't sign off on this.

938
00:56:28,434 --> 00:56:30,135
"Organ Donation Clearance Form"

939
00:56:31,234 --> 00:56:32,968
Which decision would you make?

940
00:56:33,968 --> 00:56:38,802
Are you going to save seven people
or catch one culprit?

941
00:56:48,968 --> 00:56:51,902
Which decision would
you choose if you were me?

942
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:53,934
If I was you...

943
00:56:58,834 --> 00:57:01,635
...I wouldn't choose either
decision if I was you.

944
00:57:08,234 --> 00:57:08,968
Sir.

945
00:57:09,701 --> 00:57:11,101
Can't we proceed with
the organ transplant...

946
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:13,001
...and the autopsy at the same time?

947
00:57:13,367 --> 00:57:14,068
What?

948
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,601
I consulted the pathologist.

949
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:17,867
It's rare but...

950
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,635
...there were cases that proceeded
with organ transplant and the autopsy.

951
00:57:22,067 --> 00:57:24,048
The pedestrian overpass
murder case in Busan in 2008...

952
00:57:24,133 --> 00:57:25,767
...proceeded with the organ
transplant and the autopsy.

953
00:57:25,834 --> 00:57:27,301
And they were able to get
the murder conviction.

954
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,467
And the Pyeongchang Ski Resort
case in 2014...

955
00:57:30,567 --> 00:57:32,468
...they performed organ transplant
and autopsy at the same time...

956
00:57:32,567 --> 00:57:34,234
...and they were able to get the bodily
injury resulting in death conviction.

957
00:57:34,501 --> 00:57:35,402
And then...

958
00:57:35,501 --> 00:57:38,616
Those are rare cases.

959
00:57:38,701 --> 00:57:39,669
If they perform the organ transplant...

960
00:57:39,734 --> 00:57:41,734
...it will impossible to
perform the autopsy.

961
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:43,802
Then the cause of death
will be difficult to determine.

962
00:57:43,868 --> 00:57:48,202
Yes, but that rare case is
quite similar to this case.

963
00:57:48,501 --> 00:57:52,335
Both victims have injury to
their head not in their organs.

964
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,567
And there were signs of
strangulation on his neck.

965
00:57:54,868 --> 00:57:57,702
I think we'll be able to find out
the cause of death by performing...

966
00:57:57,801 --> 00:57:59,769
...the autopsy on the head
and not the body.

967
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,300
You can't just think
that you can find out.

968
00:58:13,901 --> 00:58:15,368
You have to find out.

969
00:58:16,801 --> 00:58:20,302
Yes. I will definitely find it out.

970
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,433
If it was me...

971
00:58:26,567 --> 00:58:29,967
...I would save the seven people
and catch the culprit too.

972
00:58:32,667 --> 00:58:34,067
That's the decision I would choose.

973
00:59:20,033 --> 00:59:22,033
"While You Were Sleeping"

974
00:59:22,133 --> 00:59:23,512
I'll make sure that
you're found innocent.

975
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:24,901
If you try him for murder
and something goes wrong...

976
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,234
...he might be found innocent.
Is there something you believe in?

977
00:59:27,334 --> 00:59:29,534
Yes. But I still have
your dream, Hongjoo.

978
00:59:29,634 --> 00:59:30,634
There will be at least two big
obstacles you'll have to climb...

979
00:59:30,701 --> 00:59:32,035
...in order to get murder instead
of injury leading to murder.

980
00:59:32,133 --> 00:59:32,700
Did you look into everything?

981
00:59:32,801 --> 00:59:33,535
-I looked into everything.

982
00:59:33,601 --> 00:59:34,890
-I'm looking forward to it.
-You should look forward to it.

983
00:59:34,968 --> 00:59:37,493
That's why we're trying him for murder.

984
00:59:37,567 --> 00:59:39,700
It's an endless question.

985
00:59:39,801 --> 00:59:43,068
So, you cannot ask the defendant to take
responsibility of the victim's murder...

986
00:59:43,133 --> 00:59:44,266
What are you talking about?

987
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,582
And the defendant is
pleading his innocent.

988
00:59:46,667 --> 00:59:47,700
Don't worry, Sir.

989
00:59:47,801 --> 00:59:50,568
I will get the guilty verdict
in this trial no matter what.

990
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:03,267
