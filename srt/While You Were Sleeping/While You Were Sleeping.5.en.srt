"While You Were Sleeping"

8
00:00:53,634 --> 00:00:54,435
It's happening again.

9
00:00:55,367 --> 00:00:56,601
It's that dream again.

10
00:00:59,534 --> 00:01:01,734
It hasn't happened yet...

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,008
...but the dream makes
me feel like I'm there already.

12
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:19,112
That dream makes me feel like I'm still
dreaming even when I woke up from it.

13
00:01:19,517 --> 00:01:24,451
That nightmare makes me feel
like the morning will never come.

14
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,123
"Episode 5"

15
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,294
There's a sound that wakes
me up from that nightmare.

16
00:01:35,868 --> 00:01:37,364
It comforts me by telling me that...

17
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:40,800
...the night is gone and the dream
has disappeared into the future.

18
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:45,272
It calms me down and says,
"Morning has come. It's okay."

19
00:01:47,434 --> 00:01:50,901
My mom is the morning
that wakes the night to me.

20
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,616
My goodness. This is killing me.

21
00:01:59,812 --> 00:02:02,282
I can't believe I gave birth to you.

22
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:04,624
Is this really a person's room?
This is a pigpen.

23
00:02:05,021 --> 00:02:07,496
This is why I can't eat pork.

24
00:02:07,581 --> 00:02:09,781
Because it reminds me of my daughter.

25
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,014
Mom...

26
00:02:14,457 --> 00:02:16,436
Let's sleep for
just another five more minutes.

27
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:19,734
What's wrong with you?
It's gross.

28
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,448
Did you have that dream again?

29
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:15,934
Crazy jerk...

30
00:03:22,393 --> 00:03:24,068
Why are you leaving so early today?

31
00:03:24,153 --> 00:03:25,300
Are you meeting someone?

32
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:26,975
No.

33
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,159
I'm leaving early so that
I don't have to see someone.

34
00:03:29,932 --> 00:03:31,166
Who are you talking about?

35
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:36,101
Who is it?

36
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:38,168
Yes. Thank you.

37
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,739
The neighbor across
the street brought us mackerel.

38
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:44,034
Go and get it.

39
00:03:45,895 --> 00:03:46,894
Hey. You go and get it.

40
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:49,296
Just go and get it.
I have to go to the bathroom.

41
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:51,012
No. If I go out like this,
she'll misunderstand.

42
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,167
You look clean cut. That's good!

43
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:53,284
That's what I mean.

44
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:55,803
The problem is that I look clean cut.
I look too cool to be receiving mackerel.

45
00:03:55,888 --> 00:03:57,858
She'll think that I'm trying too hard.
She's going to misunderstand me.

46
00:03:57,943 --> 00:04:00,110
I just don't want to have that kind
of misunderstanding anymore.

47
00:04:00,195 --> 00:04:01,601
Why are you being ridiculous?

48
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:03,893
-Hey.
-Let me go.

49
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:04,791
I have to go and poop.

50
00:04:04,876 --> 00:04:06,980
Seungwon. You brat.

51
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:20,026
It's you, Mrs. Moon.

52
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:24,064
Your brother said that you
don't eat that much breakfast.

53
00:04:24,234 --> 00:04:25,347
That's not good for men.

54
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,570
You won't have enough energy.

55
00:04:26,655 --> 00:04:29,039
I wrapped it individually,
so put them in the fridge.

56
00:04:29,124 --> 00:04:30,158
Grill them when you want to eat it.

57
00:04:30,243 --> 00:04:32,362
It's already seasoned,
so you just need to grill them.

58
00:04:32,447 --> 00:04:34,968
This is even easier to make
as compared to ramyeon.

59
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,252
Yes. Thank you.

60
00:04:36,604 --> 00:04:38,509
You must like mackerel.

61
00:04:38,594 --> 00:04:40,547
I should've brought it to you sooner.

62
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,468
You've been coming earlier lately.

63
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:53,665
Yes. I'll have Americano
with double shot of...

64
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,982
Extra hazelnut was already ordered...

65
00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:57,697
...by the woman
with the short hair just now.

66
00:04:57,782 --> 00:04:59,468
She went to the bathroom a moment ago.

67
00:04:59,553 --> 00:05:00,634
She'll be back soon.

68
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,649
She's already here?
At this hour?

69
00:05:02,734 --> 00:05:03,602
Yes.

70
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:06,916
It seems like the two of you have been
missing each other for the past few days.

71
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:10,267
I told her that she'll be able to
see you if she comes a little earlier.

72
00:05:10,995 --> 00:05:11,982
I did a good thing, didn't I?

73
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:13,801
You didn't need to do that...

74
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,246
She's coming...

75
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,451
Gosh...

76
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:16,135
Americano with double shot of hazelnut.
Yours, right?

77
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,200
Are you a stalker?

78
00:06:18,293 --> 00:06:19,134
Don't you have anything to do?

79
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,500
No. I don't.

80
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:22,967
By the way, have you been
working out in the morning lately?

81
00:06:23,067 --> 00:06:24,543
I didn't know that you've been
going to work so early lately.

82
00:06:24,628 --> 00:06:26,001
I missed you for several days.

83
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,401
You said you've been
taking time off from work.

84
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:28,534
Aren't you going back to work?

85
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:30,937
If I go back to work, it will
be hard for you to see me.

86
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,015
Do you want that?

87
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,867
Yes. I want that desperately.

88
00:06:33,968 --> 00:06:34,769
Oh no.

89
00:06:34,868 --> 00:06:37,954
I like seeing your face more
than going back to work.

90
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:38,753
Gosh.

91
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,170
Are you sure you just don't
want to go back to work?

92
00:06:46,734 --> 00:06:48,133
It's not that I don't
want to go back to work...

93
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:54,581
Should I go back to work or not?

94
00:06:56,725 --> 00:06:58,117
Why are you asking me that?

95
00:06:58,596 --> 00:07:00,420
It's because I really
don't know what to decide.

96
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,860
It's exactly 50 to 50.

97
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:09,500
Half of me wants to go back
to work and half of me doesn't.

98
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:11,901
"Reinstated employee"

99
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:14,601
That's why I want you to decide for me.

100
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,203
I'll do what you tell me to do.

101
00:07:19,334 --> 00:07:22,542
Should I or shouldn't I go back to work?

102
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,044
Is it difficult to be a reporter?

103
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,034
Do you really hate it that
much to go back to work?

104
00:07:28,825 --> 00:07:29,578
No.

105
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:31,884
It's because I want to go back to work.

106
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:35,121
Because I really want to.

107
00:07:55,388 --> 00:07:56,709
You look great.

108
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,033
I was born with it.

109
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:58,901
Are you dating?

110
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,962
Of course I'm dating.

111
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,187
Are you really dating?

112
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:04,028
Yes. I'm involved with my cases.

113
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:07,201
With your cases.

114
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:14,927
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

115
00:08:15,934 --> 00:08:17,001
Close the door.

116
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:18,834
Get in.

117
00:08:19,267 --> 00:08:20,149
I'll get on the next one.

118
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:21,234
He says he's getting on the next one.

119
00:08:23,453 --> 00:08:25,059
Get in. We still have lots of space here.

120
00:08:25,144 --> 00:08:26,674
Please move along.

121
00:08:31,213 --> 00:08:32,400
Get in.

122
00:08:33,534 --> 00:08:35,052
I have to go to the restroom.

123
00:08:35,137 --> 00:08:37,500
He has to go to the restroom.
Hurry up and get in.

124
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,196
Did you make any progress?

125
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,001
I was pretty fast.

126
00:08:53,334 --> 00:08:55,711
In one month, I was already...

127
00:08:55,796 --> 00:08:57,782
That's enough.
There are a lot of people here.

128
00:08:58,067 --> 00:09:00,665
I won the Excellence Prosecutor
award in one month.

129
00:09:02,901 --> 00:09:05,568
Is that something I shouldn't say
just because there are people here?

130
00:09:05,653 --> 00:09:06,853
No.
No.

131
00:09:09,434 --> 00:09:12,603
You were thinking about
a different progress, weren't you?

132
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:14,821
Was it about Nam Hongjoo?

133
00:09:21,515 --> 00:09:22,182
I'll see you later.

134
00:09:22,267 --> 00:09:23,634
Bye.

135
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:28,374
Hey. I progressed faster
than you with that.

136
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:29,736
You should do better.

137
00:09:34,512 --> 00:09:35,422
What progress?

138
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:37,310
The progress that you
and I are thinking about?

139
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,982
That rumor must be true.

140
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:41,267
The rumor that he stole
Attorney Lee's girlfriend...

141
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,567
Really?

142
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,169
I can hear everything.

143
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,253
Well, since you heard us...

144
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,134
...you should tell us
your side of the story.

145
00:09:49,234 --> 00:09:52,259
If you let a rumor like that spread,
it will just get bigger.

146
00:09:52,344 --> 00:09:55,157
A rumor like that spreads more
if you try to make excuses.

147
00:09:55,834 --> 00:09:57,397
Who is...

148
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,098
...Nam Hongjoo?

149
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:00,364
I don't know her very well either.

150
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:01,268
Nam Hongjoo?

151
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,349
Nam Hongjoo from
Hongjoo Samgyeopsal?

152
00:10:03,434 --> 00:10:04,302
That one that makes great kimchi stew?

153
00:10:04,387 --> 00:10:05,586
That's right.

154
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:06,716
We'll be able to see her if we go there.

155
00:10:06,801 --> 00:10:08,355
-Have you been there?
-Not yet.

156
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,106
But according to the rumor,
she's very pretty and intelligent too.

157
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:13,634
She's pretty and intelligent?

158
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:14,634
What is she like?

159
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:16,168
Is she like Prosecutor Shin?

160
00:10:17,801 --> 00:10:19,385
Not at all.

161
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,382
There wouldn't be a rumor like
that about Prosecutor Shin.

162
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:23,467
That's what I'm saying.

163
00:10:23,552 --> 00:10:27,927
Prosecutor Shin is only
attractive among average people.

164
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:30,246
I heard that Nam Hongjoo
is on a different level.

165
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:33,701
I don't think we can
even compete with her.

166
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,968
Attorney Lee said that she's
really hard to get type.

167
00:10:38,534 --> 00:10:40,624
She's a total femme fatale.

168
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,020
Excuse me? What did you say?

169
00:10:44,105 --> 00:10:46,041
Femme, what?

170
00:10:46,126 --> 00:10:47,367
You know...

171
00:10:47,467 --> 00:10:50,148
She captures men's hearts with
her beauty and intelligence.

172
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,987
But she'll never give her heart away.

173
00:10:52,072 --> 00:10:53,490
Femme Fatale.

174
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:57,056
You completely picked the bones clean.

175
00:10:57,141 --> 00:10:59,081
What was missing this time?

176
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,522
There was a leg missing.

177
00:11:00,607 --> 00:11:02,916
It's the most important part of
the chicken along with the wings.

178
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:05,449
I'm not a machine.

179
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:11,268
A piece can fall into
a different box while I'm packing.

180
00:11:11,634 --> 00:11:13,787
I'll be careful next time.

181
00:11:13,872 --> 00:11:17,726
I've ordered 26 chickens
from this restaurant.

182
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,671
If a piece can fall into a different
box from time to time...

183
00:11:19,756 --> 00:11:20,896
...then there must've been times
that I received extra pieces.

184
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:21,635
Right?

185
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,268
That's right.

186
00:11:22,353 --> 00:11:25,553
But there was never a time
that there were extra pieces.

187
00:11:25,638 --> 00:11:26,915
The name of the menu
is one whole chicken...

188
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,834
...but why do you think that I've
never had a whole chicken before.

189
00:11:29,934 --> 00:11:31,940
Where do you think missing pieces went?

190
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,068
Are you sure you're not making...

191
00:11:33,153 --> 00:11:34,995
...another whole chicken
with those missing pieces?

192
00:11:35,101 --> 00:11:36,985
What's wrong with you?

193
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,714
Are you one of those black consumers?

194
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,249
You complain without any
evidence and take money...

195
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,753
If I report you, you'll be punished.

196
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:45,774
Evidence?

197
00:11:45,859 --> 00:11:46,901
I have evidence.

198
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:50,816
I have a video that I took from
the moment I received the chicken.

199
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:52,780
According to the video...

200
00:11:52,865 --> 00:11:56,092
I sent you to grocery shopping.
What are you doing here?

201
00:11:56,177 --> 00:11:58,101
You really are terrible.

202
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,567
Even though I gave birth to her,
I just can't understand her.

203
00:12:00,695 --> 00:12:02,488
Never mind. Sorry...

204
00:12:02,837 --> 00:12:05,471
-Yes.
-...seems to be the hardest word .

205
00:12:05,556 --> 00:12:07,349
-Sir. I'll be back.
-Come with me.

206
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:08,935
I'm going to keep watching you.

207
00:12:09,024 --> 00:12:10,435
What are you going to watch?

208
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,124
-My goodness.
-Mother. Mother.

209
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,839
"Don't trust that woman"

210
00:12:24,886 --> 00:12:25,787
What's wrong with you?

211
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:28,483
Why weren't you grocery shopping?

212
00:12:28,568 --> 00:12:30,698
Why were you causing
a scene at someone's business?

213
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:31,551
Right?

214
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,801
It just looked like I was
causing a scene to you, right?

215
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,341
I used to do reports
from Prosecutor's Office...

216
00:12:36,426 --> 00:12:37,849
...police stations and congress.

217
00:12:37,934 --> 00:12:40,159
But now I'm only digging up corruption
of a fried chicken restaurant.

218
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,967
This really is a waste of talent.

219
00:12:44,052 --> 00:12:45,355
A waste of talent.

220
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,784
Is that why you're
trying to get reinstated?

221
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:53,321
Did you see it?

222
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:54,500
Of course I did.

223
00:12:54,593 --> 00:12:57,129
You put in on top of your desk,
so I'd see it.

224
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,001
Why aren't you answering me?

225
00:13:00,102 --> 00:13:01,547
Are you going to go back to work?

226
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,115
Yes.

227
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:09,267
You said you saw yourself die
as a reporter in your dream.

228
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,257
You said you can't be a reporter
anymore because you're scared.

229
00:13:11,562 --> 00:13:13,942
You said you were going to
work with me at this restaurant.

230
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:16,630
Why did you have a change of heart? Why?

231
00:13:18,285 --> 00:13:19,966
I didn't have a change of heart.

232
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,616
The future might be changed.

233
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,235
You said the future can't be changed.

234
00:13:23,341 --> 00:13:25,756
You said that we can't change the future
even if we know what will happen.

235
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:27,102
It can be changed.

236
00:13:27,267 --> 00:13:29,649
Look at Jaechan.
He saved you and me.

237
00:13:29,734 --> 00:13:31,901
So you're going to go back to work?

238
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,500
Did he say that he's going to save you?

239
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:35,601
Is he going to protect you?

240
00:13:35,686 --> 00:13:36,753
Well...

241
00:13:37,701 --> 00:13:38,918
It's not quite like that...

242
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,301
Frankly speaking,
he was able to change it.

243
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,335
Why can't I change it?

244
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,457
You can't change it.
You'll never change it.

245
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,025
Why not?

246
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,041
What can he do better than me?

247
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,840
There are many things.
There are so many things.

248
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,210
Mom.

249
00:13:50,334 --> 00:13:51,931
I'm your daughter.

250
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:53,765
Why can't you believe
in me more than him?

251
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,069
I can't.

252
00:13:55,154 --> 00:13:59,656
To me, you're not as
reliable or strong as him.

253
00:13:59,741 --> 00:14:01,236
I'm more worried about you.

254
00:14:01,321 --> 00:14:02,159
Much more...

255
00:14:05,225 --> 00:14:06,812
You're more precious to me than him.

256
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:15,735
You're the only one
I have in this world also.

257
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:19,625
So don't leave me alone.

258
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:22,929
Okay?

259
00:14:25,934 --> 00:14:26,735
Okay.

260
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,002
That's my daughter.

261
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,703
We're here to have some pork belly.

262
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:49,667
Hello.

263
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,991
Again?

264
00:14:51,076 --> 00:14:53,580
I skipped breakfast today,
so I'm so hungry.

265
00:14:55,367 --> 00:15:00,924
43007, 43008, 43009...

266
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:03,057
What is he doing right now?

267
00:15:03,142 --> 00:15:04,812
You know the protest at
Ganghwamun yesterday?

268
00:15:04,897 --> 00:15:06,343
He's going to see if the count...

269
00:15:06,428 --> 00:15:10,149
...by the police or the organizers is
right by counting each one himself...

270
00:15:10,234 --> 00:15:12,244
He's got too much time on his hands.

271
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,061
Hey. Bong Doohyun.

272
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,167
Nam Hongjoo is returning
to work next week, right?

273
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,117
What did she say?

274
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:19,234
Is she going to return to work?

275
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:21,134
43019...
Why are you asking me?

276
00:15:21,234 --> 00:15:22,001
43020.

277
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:23,501
We're getting new uniforms...

278
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:25,494
...so I have to let them
know how many we need.

279
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:27,193
You're her supervisor.
You need to take care of these things.

280
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:28,124
Do I have to do these things?

281
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:29,561
43024...

282
00:15:29,646 --> 00:15:30,734
-4...
-4...

283
00:15:30,845 --> 00:15:32,004
-9...
-9...

284
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,731
Captain. I lost count
because of you.

285
00:15:34,816 --> 00:15:35,968
You're my supervisor.

286
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,734
I don't even expect
you to take care of me.

287
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:39,612
But at least you
shouldn't ruin things for me.

288
00:15:39,697 --> 00:15:42,093
Other people will think that
you're my supervisor or something.

289
00:15:42,178 --> 00:15:42,997
What are you going to do?

290
00:15:43,082 --> 00:15:44,539
Do you want me to count her or not?

291
00:15:44,624 --> 00:15:49,118
-One, two, three, four...
-Look at that...

292
00:15:53,267 --> 00:15:54,220
Gosh.

293
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,322
He must be losing his mind.

294
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,943
Let's finish our meeting here.

295
00:15:59,028 --> 00:16:00,974
Lunch Manager.
Where are we eating today?

296
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:02,862
-Today, we're eating at...
-Sir.

297
00:16:03,855 --> 00:16:07,700
Why didn't you approve the DUI
hit and run case I submitted?

298
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,294
I stated the reason as lack of evidence.

299
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:15,134
Indicting the passenger for aiding
and abetting DUI is too harsh.

300
00:16:15,315 --> 00:16:18,149
You know that even if
we indict someone like this...

301
00:16:18,234 --> 00:16:19,912
...he'll just go free at the court.

302
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:22,001
Someone from last month was
found innocent last month also.

303
00:16:22,501 --> 00:16:23,896
-Where are we eating today?
-Today, we're eating at...

304
00:16:23,981 --> 00:16:26,165
There were similar cases
in Gwangju and Daejeon...

305
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,810
...that sentenced
the offenders to probation.

306
00:16:27,895 --> 00:16:30,942
In Japan, the same case involving
this kind of passenger is indicted...

307
00:16:31,027 --> 00:16:32,568
...with two years in prison.

308
00:16:32,653 --> 00:16:34,651
That's right. I saw that file too.

309
00:16:34,736 --> 00:16:35,956
Is your case similar to that one?

310
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,464
Yes. No. It's more serious.

311
00:16:39,229 --> 00:16:42,835
He got drunk together with the driver
and even got the keys from the valet.

312
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:46,152
He told him that he knows how to avoid the
police and asked him to drive him home.

313
00:16:46,237 --> 00:16:49,716
It's aiding and abetting
if he goes that far.

314
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,968
"Aiding and abetting to crime is
advising someone to commit a crime"

315
00:16:54,536 --> 00:16:57,783
Because of him, a nine years old child
lost his parents.

316
00:16:57,868 --> 00:17:01,435
Now he has to wear colostomy
bag for the rest of his life.

317
00:17:02,634 --> 00:17:05,192
If he tried to stop the driver,
this wouldn't have happened.

318
00:17:05,277 --> 00:17:06,977
I went easy on him by indicting
him for aiding and abetting.

319
00:17:07,062 --> 00:17:08,634
It's not harsh.
It isn't nearly enough.

320
00:17:08,734 --> 00:17:10,048
He didn't drive the car.

321
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:12,625
You can't do that to him just
because he gave him the keys.

322
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:16,035
You shouldn't turn someone into a criminal
just because you're a prosecutor.

323
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:16,734
Sir.

324
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:18,079
Ms. Son.

325
00:17:20,434 --> 00:17:22,302
Let's eat lunch first.

326
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,368
We can't solve cases that
can be solves if we're hungry.

327
00:17:24,467 --> 00:17:26,201
Mr. Jung. Where are
we having lunch at?

328
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,367
Yes. I decided on a pork katsu restaurant
nearby.

329
00:17:28,452 --> 00:17:29,253
Chunha Pork Katsu.

330
00:17:29,338 --> 00:17:32,139
Mr. Jung. Were you inside
my stomach just now?

331
00:17:32,234 --> 00:17:33,908
I was craving pork katsu.

332
00:17:33,993 --> 00:17:36,801
Chunha Pork Katsu is good.

333
00:17:36,886 --> 00:17:40,901
But Chief Park drank last night, so he'll
need to eat something for his hangover.

334
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:44,438
I heard that kimchi stew in at
Hongjoo Samgyeopsal is amazing.

335
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:46,416
That's too far,
so we should go somewhere closer.

336
00:17:46,501 --> 00:17:47,625
There's a...

337
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,245
Yes. There are a lot of
kimchi stew places nearby.

338
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,090
Then...

339
00:17:51,934 --> 00:17:53,470
Let's go to Hongjoo Samgyeopsal.

340
00:17:53,734 --> 00:17:56,068
Weather is nice,
so we should walk as an exercise.

341
00:17:56,613 --> 00:17:57,405
Let's go.

342
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,181
The weather is nice these days.

343
00:18:00,033 --> 00:18:03,289
I get off the bus one stop earlier,
so I can walk to work.

344
00:18:04,204 --> 00:18:05,248
Let's go.

345
00:18:06,734 --> 00:18:09,294
I analyzed the dreams that
the three of us have been having.

346
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,414
You've been dreaming
about random people, right?

347
00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:14,034
And you've been having
dreams about Jaechan lately.

348
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:14,756
Yes.

349
00:18:14,841 --> 00:18:17,225
I think Jaechan
is having dreams about you...

350
00:18:17,534 --> 00:18:19,098
...and I usually have dreams
about Jaechan.

351
00:18:19,686 --> 00:18:20,511
Is that right?

352
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,057
That's amazing.

353
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,575
There must be some rules to this.

354
00:18:24,426 --> 00:18:26,093
You're the one who
started having dreams first.

355
00:18:26,178 --> 00:18:27,434
Then the next person is Jaechan.

356
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:28,429
And I'm the last one to have the dreams.

357
00:18:28,514 --> 00:18:31,948
If we think of this as a virus,
you're the first person who got infected.

358
00:18:32,033 --> 00:18:34,449
But it wasn't contracted
through air or contact.

359
00:18:34,534 --> 00:18:36,849
If not, there would be a lot
more people who are infected.

360
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,352
Hey. Do you think I'm a patient
with an infectious disease?

361
00:18:39,437 --> 00:18:41,868
I'm just putting it simply.

362
00:18:42,634 --> 00:18:43,913
Do you hate having these dreams?

363
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:48,079
Yes. I feel like I betrayed my country
in my previous life or something.

364
00:18:48,164 --> 00:18:49,628
I feel like I'm being punished for it.

365
00:18:49,714 --> 00:18:52,506
No. You must've saved
a country in your previous life.

366
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:53,934
Once we figure out
the rules of your dream.

367
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:57,512
We'll be able to stop variety
of crimes and disasters.

368
00:18:57,801 --> 00:19:00,926
What if you have dreams
about a war or terrorism?

369
00:19:01,858 --> 00:19:02,592
Hongjoo.

370
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:05,215
We should each
master a foreign language.

371
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,628
That way we can communicate
internationally to stop crimes.

372
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,478
I can speak a little German.

373
00:19:12,162 --> 00:19:15,133
Lieutenant Han has such great manners.

374
00:19:15,218 --> 00:19:17,956
He's handsome and
he has an American style.

375
00:19:18,162 --> 00:19:19,867
It's because he takes after me.

376
00:19:19,968 --> 00:19:22,182
He looks exactly like me too.

377
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:28,167
People tell me that I raised a good
younger brother all the time.

378
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:30,142
Can I pay with cash receipt?

379
00:19:30,227 --> 00:19:31,182
Of course.

380
00:19:31,267 --> 00:19:32,249
Thank you.

381
00:19:32,334 --> 00:19:33,968
You're so excited.

382
00:19:34,834 --> 00:19:36,301
Do you like having these dreams?

383
00:19:36,367 --> 00:19:37,701
Of course I like it.

384
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:40,479
What if you dream about you dying?

385
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:44,667
What are you talking about?
That's ominous.

386
00:19:44,868 --> 00:19:46,535
You're a police officer.

387
00:19:46,734 --> 00:19:49,279
What if you dream about you dying
while working on a dangerous case?

388
00:19:49,494 --> 00:19:50,671
Are you going to quit
being a police officer?

389
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:51,772
Are you crazy?

390
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,540
Do you know what it took for
me to become a police officer?

391
00:19:55,334 --> 00:19:57,302
But you might die if
you stay as a police officer.

392
00:19:57,434 --> 00:19:59,366
I can just change the future.

393
00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:02,940
I just have to change it.

394
00:20:03,801 --> 00:20:04,803
I can change it.

395
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,007
Really?

396
00:20:08,901 --> 00:20:10,342
Do you really think that way?

397
00:20:12,534 --> 00:20:13,567
Get out!

398
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:18,284
What's wrong, mother?

399
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:19,702
Who are you calling your mother?
Get out right now.

400
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:21,154
Get out right now.

401
00:20:21,681 --> 00:20:22,649
Mom.

402
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:23,603
But Mother...

403
00:20:23,757 --> 00:20:24,672
Who is your mother?

404
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,392
Stop talking nonsense and get out.

405
00:20:26,477 --> 00:20:27,835
Get out right now!

406
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,331
Why is she acting like that
all of a sudden?

407
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,134
Did I say something wrong?

408
00:20:47,242 --> 00:20:48,134
No.

409
00:20:48,219 --> 00:20:50,165
I don't think it was because of you.
I think it's my fault.

410
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,979
I asked for her if I can
pay with cash receipt.

411
00:20:53,064 --> 00:20:56,255
Why did you do that, sir?
It wasn't that much.

412
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:59,258
-She even gave us free rice.
-Jeez.

413
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:09,864
Han Wootak?

414
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:15,641
"Prosecutor - 2
Police -  X"

415
00:21:19,758 --> 00:21:21,525
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

416
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:23,153
You can sit anywhere you like.

417
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:28,440
Oh my...

418
00:21:28,683 --> 00:21:30,577
Prosecutor Jung is here too.

419
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:34,535
Jaechan. You must be
close to the owner here.

420
00:21:34,634 --> 00:21:36,168
Of course. He's a regular customer.

421
00:21:38,137 --> 00:21:40,093
Then are you guys
dating just like the rumor?

422
00:21:40,178 --> 00:21:41,633
No. We're not like that.

423
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,971
If Prosecutor Jung is a regular customer,
will you give us free sodas?

424
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:49,948
People who ask for free
sodas at a place like this...

425
00:21:50,033 --> 00:21:53,015
...and free wontons at Chinese
restaurants seem so cheap.

426
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,734
It seems like they rip people off.

427
00:21:55,028 --> 00:21:57,959
It's not like that.
Of course we should give free sodas.

428
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,385
Please wait a moment.

429
00:22:01,447 --> 00:22:04,473
That must be Nam Hongjoo.
She's so pretty.

430
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:08,594
She seems intelligent.
Like a femme fatale?

431
00:22:11,334 --> 00:22:12,464
Is she?

432
00:22:14,154 --> 00:22:15,088
Femme...

433
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:21,849
Lord Jesus, you allow us to have
grace and wisdom even in difficulties.

434
00:22:21,934 --> 00:22:26,701
Please grant us your wisdom
to all the prosecutors at our office...

435
00:22:26,801 --> 00:22:31,749
...so that we would be fair
in prosecuting offenders.

436
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:34,501
A child became an orphan
because of a mishap...

437
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:37,197
...and he's going to be handicapped
for the rest of his life.

438
00:22:37,282 --> 00:22:40,474
The person who didn't stop
the accident is a sinner along with...

439
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,001
...the one who caused
the accident before this tragedy.

440
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,780
Please punish the one who didn't stop
accident with your sword of justice...

441
00:22:47,865 --> 00:22:51,034
The driver didn't commit a deliberate
offense but a negligent one.

442
00:22:51,133 --> 00:22:54,082
There can't be aiding and
abetting on unexpected mistake.

443
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:55,982
Therefore he can't be
charged with a crime...

444
00:22:56,067 --> 00:22:58,294
Drunk driving can cause accidents,
so you can expect it...

445
00:22:58,379 --> 00:23:01,168
It can be expected.

446
00:23:01,267 --> 00:23:02,065
That's right.

447
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:05,749
Lord. It's obvious that the person who
ignored expected crime should be punished.

448
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:07,688
It's an obvious logic...

449
00:23:07,773 --> 00:23:11,338
If we live by that logic,
everybody who ignore the poor children...

450
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:15,299
...dying of starvation
should be punished as well...

451
00:23:15,384 --> 00:23:18,365
Please save us from foolish people
who forcefully cloud the issue...

452
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:22,182
We live in a country
who believes in the elders.

453
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:23,606
Let us respect our elders...

454
00:23:23,691 --> 00:23:26,927
Why are you bringing up
about the elders first ethics...

455
00:23:27,012 --> 00:23:29,582
...when we're praying to our Lord?
That's Confucianism.

456
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:31,963
If the doctrine is the same,
we can bring it up.

457
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,567
Don't you know anything
about religious reconciliation?

458
00:23:33,652 --> 00:23:34,947
Let's not do this.

459
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,698
Why don't we just decide by majority?

460
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:39,068
On the basis of democracy...

461
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,855
Miss. We'd like our free sodas please.

462
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,333
It's not free.
Please add it to our bill.

463
00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:43,992
Yes.

464
00:23:44,077 --> 00:23:44,625
Fine.

465
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,586
Let's decide it by majority vote.

466
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:50,035
A passenger who didn't try to stop
the drunk driver should be punished.

467
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,996
Raise your hand.

468
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:59,638
He shouldn't be punished.
Raise your hand.

469
00:24:03,073 --> 00:24:04,367
What's wrong, Mr. Jung?

470
00:24:04,467 --> 00:24:05,777
Why didn't you raise your hand?

471
00:24:06,868 --> 00:24:08,838
I can see that both sides
have elements of truth.

472
00:24:08,923 --> 00:24:11,183
I think I'll have to think about
it more to give you an answer.

473
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:13,416
Don't mind the others
and give your opinion.

474
00:24:13,501 --> 00:24:15,669
It's cowardly not to vote
at a time like this.

475
00:24:15,934 --> 00:24:16,934
Don't you think so?

476
00:24:19,062 --> 00:24:22,048
Why are you asking me that?

477
00:24:22,133 --> 00:24:25,437
I was curious if I'm the only one
who thinks that's cowardly...

478
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:31,334
I don't know.

479
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:34,339
First of all,
praying like this is a behavior...

480
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:39,262
...that goes against the
public officials' religious neutrality.

481
00:24:40,033 --> 00:24:43,022
No. All four of us are Christians.

482
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,983
No way.

483
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,167
Excuse me?

484
00:24:46,883 --> 00:24:50,416
At most, only 20 percent of Korea's
population are Christians.

485
00:24:50,501 --> 00:24:53,428
Then the possibility of all four
of you being Christians...

486
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:55,327
...is 0.2 to the power of 4 which
comes out to be 0.0016.

487
00:24:55,724 --> 00:24:56,868
It has a lower possibility that seeing...

488
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:59,068
...a double rainbow which you
might see once in your life.

489
00:24:59,153 --> 00:25:00,532
It means that it's impossible.

490
00:25:02,242 --> 00:25:06,939
It clearly means that one of you is hiding
your religion because of your superior.

491
00:25:07,334 --> 00:25:09,838
It also means that the person who
refuses to pray in an organization...

492
00:25:10,033 --> 00:25:12,110
...has quite a conviction.

493
00:25:13,868 --> 00:25:17,435
I don't think this person is
minding others or being cowardly.

494
00:25:18,067 --> 00:25:20,534
I'm sure he's thinking
about it with his conviction.

495
00:25:20,634 --> 00:25:22,487
More carefully than anyone else.

496
00:25:24,067 --> 00:25:25,057
Does that give you an answer?

497
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:29,535
Wow.

498
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,297
Who is she? She knows how to argue.

499
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:36,835
That tone of voice...

500
00:25:37,983 --> 00:25:39,866
I've heard it somewhere before.

501
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,734
-Nam Hongjoo!
-Oh my goodness...

502
00:25:55,819 --> 00:25:57,349
You scared me.

503
00:25:57,434 --> 00:25:59,816
That girl from
the restaurant is a reporter.

504
00:25:59,901 --> 00:26:01,059
Reporter Nam Hongjoo.

505
00:26:01,324 --> 00:26:03,534
She was a reporter at SBC.

506
00:26:04,765 --> 00:26:07,532
I didn't recognize her
because she cut her hair.

507
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,434
No wonder...

508
00:26:09,608 --> 00:26:10,836
What kind of a reporter was she?

509
00:26:11,633 --> 00:26:13,839
My gosh. She was really tough.

510
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:16,657
She was so talented in picking...

511
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:19,120
...the best spot when
the suspects are summoned.

512
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,629
She'd stay close to the suspect and pour
on her questions.

513
00:26:21,714 --> 00:26:24,616
She always yelled
at the top of her lungs...

514
00:26:24,701 --> 00:26:26,235
Please give us a statement.

515
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:29,600
A chief prosecutor is causing
a controversy after sexually harassing...

516
00:26:29,685 --> 00:26:32,224
...female prosecutors at a team dinner.

517
00:26:32,362 --> 00:26:33,367
Was it two years ago?

518
00:26:33,434 --> 00:26:34,616
She exposed the case on
sexual harassment...

519
00:26:34,701 --> 00:26:35,849
...of the chief prosecutor at
Yeonju District Prosecutors' Office.

520
00:26:35,934 --> 00:26:37,453
It was that reporter who made him quit.

521
00:26:37,538 --> 00:26:41,035
It was revealed that he fondled
some body parts of female prosecutors...

522
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:43,101
...and committed
other sexual harassment.

523
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:46,328
Then she disappeared suddenly.

524
00:26:46,834 --> 00:26:49,268
I thought she was sent as
a correspondent somewhere.

525
00:26:49,367 --> 00:26:52,804
Why is a successful reporter
working at a restaurant now?

526
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,834
I wonder, too.

527
00:26:54,367 --> 00:26:55,479
I'm curious about that too.

528
00:26:55,564 --> 00:26:57,734
She's not someone who
would quit being a reporter.

529
00:26:57,934 --> 00:26:59,735
I should ask around.

530
00:27:06,133 --> 00:27:11,338
The organizers announced that
70,000 people participated in the protest.

531
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:13,301
However, the number of participants
that the police announced is...

532
00:27:13,386 --> 00:27:16,640
...15,000 which is far less than
what was reported by the organizers.

533
00:27:16,923 --> 00:27:19,450
So, the difference between
the organizers and the police...

534
00:27:19,535 --> 00:27:22,236
...was caused by the method
and the timing of counting.

535
00:27:25,868 --> 00:27:29,649
If you consider everything,
you'll have to arrest everyone.

536
00:27:29,734 --> 00:27:31,535
What are we going to do
if don't arrest everyone?

537
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,874
Let's go back to
the beginning and think it over.

538
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,516
Alright.

539
00:27:34,601 --> 00:27:37,182
He's responsible for
providing that opportunity.

540
00:27:37,267 --> 00:27:39,709
That's why it's a car accident.

541
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:45,012
However, when I counted
the total number of participants...

542
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:50,268
...there were 37 thousand
participants at 6 PM.

543
00:27:50,868 --> 00:27:51,868
Did you hurt yourself?

544
00:27:53,067 --> 00:27:53,837
Let me see.

545
00:27:55,701 --> 00:27:57,015
You should've been careful.

546
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,934
Leave it.
I'll do the rest.

547
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,846
Are you crying?

548
00:28:02,567 --> 00:28:03,615
Does it hurt a lot?

549
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:05,150
Should I take you to the hospital?

550
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:08,220
Mom. I don't think
these are fresh onions.

551
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:09,601
They are so spicy.

552
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:30,635
Taeseob.

553
00:29:30,734 --> 00:29:31,435
Yes.

554
00:29:32,567 --> 00:29:34,288
This is the last delivery.

555
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:36,004
Yes. I'll be back.

556
00:29:53,133 --> 00:29:54,101
What is this?

557
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,312
Did he steal the chicken for that?

558
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:03,367
Okay, I won't do it.

559
00:30:03,934 --> 00:30:05,403
That's not my business.

560
00:30:06,968 --> 00:30:08,440
I am so tired now.

561
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:31,496
What if you dream about you dying?

562
00:30:31,927 --> 00:30:32,992
I can just change the future.

563
00:30:33,734 --> 00:30:34,800
I can change it.

564
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:40,105
"Myungwon University
Candle Light Event 2016, March 28, 8 PM"

565
00:31:20,767 --> 00:31:22,481
"Myungwon University"

566
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:51,722
What are you doing?

567
00:31:54,334 --> 00:31:55,413
I'm a father too.

568
00:31:56,315 --> 00:32:00,001
I cried after I found out
that child became an orphan.

569
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,168
But I'm not the one who drove.

570
00:32:03,253 --> 00:32:05,557
I only got in the passenger seat.
That's my only sin.

571
00:32:05,642 --> 00:32:08,206
I didn't kill them.

572
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:10,333
You didn't just get in the car.

573
00:32:10,434 --> 00:32:13,798
You gave him the car keys and even
told him where to avoid the police.

574
00:32:13,883 --> 00:32:15,618
Is it a sin to have
given him the car keys?

575
00:32:15,703 --> 00:32:17,574
If I didn't give him the keys,
someone else would have.

576
00:32:17,659 --> 00:32:20,569
He would've driven
even if tried to stop him.

577
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:23,948
Frankly speaking, did I grab
his throat and make him drive?

578
00:32:24,033 --> 00:32:25,600
Did I beat him up?

579
00:32:25,865 --> 00:32:27,877
Just because I did this...

580
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:29,786
Just because I told him to drive...

581
00:32:29,871 --> 00:32:33,389
...do I have to be treated like
a criminal because of that?

582
00:32:36,674 --> 00:32:38,408
That frustrating guy...

583
00:32:38,543 --> 00:32:40,435
It's not only this...

584
00:32:40,767 --> 00:32:43,756
Ms. Son is so stubborn.

585
00:32:43,841 --> 00:32:46,769
Since Chief Park didn't approve it,
she shouldn't indict him.

586
00:32:46,868 --> 00:32:49,067
Why did she call him for questioning?

587
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:52,102
Why did you come here?

588
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:54,268
Did you decide if you
would indict him or not?

589
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,274
I have a favor to ask of you.

590
00:32:58,043 --> 00:32:59,399
I have to question a suspect.

591
00:32:59,701 --> 00:33:00,569
Bye.

592
00:33:03,634 --> 00:33:04,401
Bye...

593
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:06,669
Okay. Okay.
What is it?

594
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:08,493
I have an urgent matter later tonight.

595
00:33:08,578 --> 00:33:11,268
Could I ask you to take my shift tonight?

596
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:12,901
My goodness...

597
00:33:14,664 --> 00:33:16,656
There's a scary curse here at
Han River District Prosecutors' Office.

598
00:33:16,741 --> 00:33:19,696
If you take someone else's shift,
big problem will occur...

599
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:20,468
Then...

600
00:33:21,027 --> 00:33:22,382
I'll take your weekend shift for you.

601
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:26,223
I took someone's shift before and an
explosion at a karaoke bar took place...

602
00:33:26,308 --> 00:33:27,444
I'll take your extra holidays shift.

603
00:33:27,529 --> 00:33:31,719
There were many deaths and there were so
much work with autopsy and examination.

604
00:33:31,804 --> 00:33:34,285
I took someone's shift unfortunately
and ended up doing so much work.

605
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,479
I'll introduce you to a woman.

606
00:33:36,868 --> 00:33:37,836
What?

607
00:33:40,501 --> 00:33:41,637
It's your shift tonight, right?

608
00:33:43,467 --> 00:33:44,122
Yes.

609
00:33:48,831 --> 00:33:50,342
Thank you so much, Mr. Jung.

610
00:33:50,758 --> 00:33:51,692
Yes.

611
00:34:10,587 --> 00:34:11,829
Jaechan!

612
00:34:12,045 --> 00:34:13,251
Jaechan!

613
00:34:26,501 --> 00:34:28,668
-Did you fall asleep?
-I didn't fall asleep.

614
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:30,221
Aren't you hungry?

615
00:34:30,306 --> 00:34:34,734
There's a cart bar that sells
amazing stir-fried blood sausage.

616
00:34:34,941 --> 00:34:36,074
Should we eat some?

617
00:34:37,043 --> 00:34:38,777
Instead of that, what do you think of...

618
00:34:38,862 --> 00:34:40,332
...patrolling around Myungwon University?

619
00:34:40,417 --> 00:34:43,856
Okay. Then let's eat
stir-fried blood sausage quickly...

620
00:34:43,941 --> 00:34:45,468
...and go patrol
around Myungwon University.

621
00:34:48,249 --> 00:34:49,500
I'll drive.

622
00:34:49,601 --> 00:34:50,734
So let's go on the patrol first.

623
00:34:51,095 --> 00:34:54,133
Maybe, you're right.

624
00:34:55,543 --> 00:34:57,026
Let's do it.

625
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:07,001
Hey. Where are you
going at this hour?

626
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,300
Mom. I might be late today.

627
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:09,089
Don't wait up.

628
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:11,968
Where are you going?
What is this?

629
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:13,511
I'm going to save someone.

630
00:35:13,596 --> 00:35:15,001
Someone got hurt in my dream.

631
00:35:18,834 --> 00:35:22,001
Mom. Promise me one thing.

632
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:26,512
If I change my dream this time...

633
00:35:27,428 --> 00:35:29,386
...and save that person...

634
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,947
...I want you to reconsider
my return to work.

635
00:36:09,693 --> 00:36:11,202
What are you doing?

636
00:36:12,467 --> 00:36:13,801
That's so annoying.

637
00:36:16,538 --> 00:36:18,476
Chohee. Chohee.

638
00:36:19,033 --> 00:36:20,011
I'm so glad.

639
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:33,958
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

640
00:36:34,767 --> 00:36:37,582
You might not believe it,
but I just stopped a big accident.

641
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:40,201
What are you talking about right now?

642
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,717
This took so long to prepare.

643
00:36:41,802 --> 00:36:43,502
Do you know what I went
through to prepare this?

644
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,102
What are you doing?

645
00:36:50,467 --> 00:36:51,477
Hey. Stop there!

646
00:37:10,714 --> 00:37:12,706
Hey. Where did she go?

647
00:37:15,897 --> 00:37:17,492
What are you doing here, Jaechan?

648
00:37:17,577 --> 00:37:18,429
Hush.

649
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,431
It's alright.

650
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:03,835
In my dream, a female student got burned
because of the Candle Light Event.

651
00:38:03,928 --> 00:38:06,533
So I put the fire out with
the fire extinguisher.

652
00:38:06,766 --> 00:38:08,836
But once I saved her I realized that...

653
00:38:08,934 --> 00:38:11,616
...it was that woman from
the cafe that we go to everyday.

654
00:38:11,701 --> 00:38:12,792
Isn't that amazing?

655
00:38:14,749 --> 00:38:16,395
Did you come because
you dreamt about me too?

656
00:38:16,934 --> 00:38:21,133
Recently Wootak said that you
dream about me often these days.

657
00:38:21,868 --> 00:38:22,948
I wonder why?

658
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:25,934
Is because opposites attract?
Are you nervous for no reason?

659
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,901
Is it fate?

660
00:38:31,558 --> 00:38:32,873
I'm sorry about back then.

661
00:38:32,968 --> 00:38:33,968
And thank you.

662
00:38:34,084 --> 00:38:35,001
Back then?

663
00:38:35,334 --> 00:38:36,202
When are you talking about?

664
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,716
When you took my side
at your restaurant...

665
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:40,200
Back then...

666
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,867
I didn't take your side.

667
00:38:41,982 --> 00:38:43,435
I just told the truth.

668
00:38:45,092 --> 00:38:46,023
Then I take it back.

669
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,984
By the way, did you make up your mind?

670
00:38:49,339 --> 00:38:52,901
Would you indict that person who aided
and abetted that drunk driver or not?

671
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,013
I'd indict him.

672
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,783
Why?
It's not like he caused the accident.

673
00:38:58,868 --> 00:39:00,320
You're going to indict him
for only giving him the keys?

674
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,268
It's a crime because it was
only giving him the keys for him.

675
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:06,901
If he only gave him the keys, he could've
only not given him the keys also.

676
00:39:07,232 --> 00:39:09,619
He aided and abetted him to
drive drunk with a single word.

677
00:39:09,704 --> 00:39:11,827
Then he could've stopped
him with a single word also.

678
00:39:13,307 --> 00:39:16,120
If he didn't say that to him,
he could've saved them.

679
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:19,035
Since he ignored it, he's a criminal.

680
00:39:19,834 --> 00:39:21,964
Because he only did that, it's a crime.

681
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,963
You changed.

682
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,432
Well. It's because of someone.

683
00:39:37,544 --> 00:39:38,606
That wench is over there.

684
00:39:40,367 --> 00:39:41,679
They're dead.

685
00:39:51,782 --> 00:39:52,616
Excuse me.

686
00:39:52,701 --> 00:39:54,368
I'm Lieutenant Han from
the Third District Station.

687
00:39:54,467 --> 00:39:56,342
You were just jaywalking and...

688
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:59,220
...you violated traffic law
article 10 of section 2.

689
00:39:59,305 --> 00:40:00,711
I haven't even crossed the street yet.

690
00:40:00,796 --> 00:40:03,501
What are you talking about?
Why are you making a fuss?

691
00:40:04,328 --> 00:40:06,637
I heard everything.

692
00:40:06,834 --> 00:40:07,830
Who is that wench?

693
00:40:07,915 --> 00:40:09,574
You said you were going to kill her.

694
00:40:09,834 --> 00:40:12,583
You jerk. You guys were going
to beat up someone, weren't you?

695
00:40:12,668 --> 00:40:13,616
No. We weren't.

696
00:40:13,701 --> 00:40:19,402
You can't run around like hyenas looking
for rotten meat and beat up people.

697
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:20,422
Do you understand?

698
00:40:20,507 --> 00:40:23,036
Follow me. Follow me.

699
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:24,830
Why are you doing that?
Follow me.

700
00:40:24,915 --> 00:40:26,703
Follow me.

701
00:40:26,878 --> 00:40:29,627
-Follow me.
-No, please!

702
00:40:29,801 --> 00:40:32,224
-Follow me!
-I'm sorry!

703
00:40:34,872 --> 00:40:36,614
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

704
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:40,035
I'm not, but it feels like its burning.

705
00:40:40,267 --> 00:40:41,400
I wonder what's wrong with me.

706
00:40:46,801 --> 00:40:47,801
Hello.

707
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,634
Daehee.

708
00:40:57,157 --> 00:41:00,157
What happened?

709
00:41:03,042 --> 00:41:03,843
Daehee.

710
00:41:05,578 --> 00:41:07,127
Can you hear me?

711
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,834
He's not opening his eyes.

712
00:41:14,734 --> 00:41:18,155
Daehee. This is not true, right?

713
00:41:19,067 --> 00:41:20,951
What happened?

714
00:41:24,252 --> 00:41:27,081
Why is his body so cold?

715
00:41:27,868 --> 00:41:31,345
Wake up. Chohee is here.

716
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,567
I took his shift and now
I have to observe an autopsy...

717
00:41:36,667 --> 00:41:39,274
The curse of Han River District
Prosecutors' Office strikes again.

718
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,235
The younger brother
didn't wear his seatbelt.

719
00:41:41,435 --> 00:41:44,887
Due to the impact, his skull was
fractured and his neck was broken.

720
00:41:44,972 --> 00:41:45,940
My gosh.

721
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,597
Why didn't he wear his seatbelt?

722
00:41:48,447 --> 00:41:49,547
I know, right?

723
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:52,868
Just a moment.

724
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,849
He's not bleeding much for
the severity of the accident.

725
00:41:59,192 --> 00:42:01,432
-Should we perform the autopsy?
-No.

726
00:42:02,557 --> 00:42:04,102
I don't want the autopsy.

727
00:42:04,767 --> 00:42:05,961
But in order to find
the truth of his death.

728
00:42:06,046 --> 00:42:07,767
No. You can't do that.

729
00:42:08,003 --> 00:42:09,470
I killed him.

730
00:42:09,555 --> 00:42:13,868
He could've taken the bus but I drove him.

731
00:42:13,953 --> 00:42:15,333
I'm the one who killed him.

732
00:42:16,397 --> 00:42:19,370
If that is the family's wish,
let's skip the autopsy.

733
00:42:32,953 --> 00:42:34,353
I'm home.

734
00:42:37,465 --> 00:42:38,320
Wow.

735
00:42:38,405 --> 00:42:40,195
Why did you buy so many crabs?

736
00:42:47,653 --> 00:42:50,669
Mom. I saved that person.

737
00:42:50,754 --> 00:42:52,603
The student who got hurt in my dream.

738
00:42:54,483 --> 00:42:56,512
So as you promised...

739
00:42:56,597 --> 00:42:58,158
I never promised.

740
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,867
You're the one who said
I promised on your own.

741
00:43:05,012 --> 00:43:05,878
Mom.

742
00:43:06,447 --> 00:43:08,868
You know that I like writing in my diary.

743
00:43:09,172 --> 00:43:11,667
I wrote in my journal every day
in my teens...

744
00:43:11,767 --> 00:43:14,127
...even if I couldn't
sleep for more than an hour.

745
00:43:15,249 --> 00:43:18,186
I probably wrote 10 pages just
criticizing my superiors at work.

746
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,647
But I finish writing in
it after I write six lines.

747
00:43:23,637 --> 00:43:25,096
It's similar to yesterday.

748
00:43:26,294 --> 00:43:27,741
I can even write ahead of time.

749
00:43:27,883 --> 00:43:29,379
It will be similar tomorrow.

750
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:34,416
I saw that the whole year's worth...

751
00:43:34,501 --> 00:43:36,335
...wasn't even as long as
one day worth from before.

752
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:38,309
What are you trying to say?

753
00:43:43,602 --> 00:43:44,436
Mom.

754
00:43:45,133 --> 00:43:49,536
I just want today to be a little more
wonderful than the day before.

755
00:43:50,063 --> 00:43:52,535
I don't want to waste by doing
nothing just because I'm scared.

756
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:55,082
So you're going to go back to work?

757
00:43:55,391 --> 00:43:57,192
Even though you dreamed that you saw
yourself die as a reporter in your dream?

758
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:00,015
I'm not going to die.

759
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,672
I can just change my dream.

760
00:44:02,746 --> 00:44:05,735
I can change the dream after
I met Jaechan and Wootak.

761
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,224
I changed it today too.

762
00:44:07,501 --> 00:44:08,712
I understood while
I was changing the future.

763
00:44:09,722 --> 00:44:13,268
There is one certainty in life.

764
00:44:13,468 --> 00:44:14,531
What is that?

765
00:44:14,968 --> 00:44:17,721
There isn't a single thing that
has been decided for sure in life.

766
00:44:20,322 --> 00:44:22,196
You're not asking for my permission.

767
00:44:23,131 --> 00:44:24,632
You're just informing me.

768
00:44:27,133 --> 00:44:28,266
I'm not informing you.

769
00:44:28,601 --> 00:44:30,441
I won't return to work
without your permission.

770
00:44:52,334 --> 00:44:53,768
It's gone bad.

771
00:45:19,328 --> 00:45:20,787
What is this?

772
00:45:20,872 --> 00:45:22,554
Breakfast is my responsibility.

773
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:23,729
Cooking?

774
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,616
I'm a great cook.

775
00:45:26,701 --> 00:45:27,768
When you come back to
Korea during your vacation...

776
00:45:27,868 --> 00:45:28,948
...I'll grill you some mackerel.

777
00:45:29,033 --> 00:45:32,166
I'm amazing at grilling mackerels.

778
00:45:32,267 --> 00:45:34,382
Soyun. He's totally lying.
You should try a video call.

779
00:45:34,467 --> 00:45:35,934
Move away.

780
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,968
There's a fire. There's fire.

781
00:45:40,843 --> 00:45:43,541
"Hongjoo's dream, Jaechan's dream,
My dream"

782
00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:50,531
Do you usually have breakfast here?

783
00:45:50,616 --> 00:45:51,708
What are you doing here?

784
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:54,001
I made some toast, but I burnt them.

785
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:55,369
So, I was going to
have this as my breakfast.

786
00:45:55,454 --> 00:45:56,534
What about you?

787
00:45:56,619 --> 00:45:58,249
I'm in a similar situation.

788
00:45:58,801 --> 00:46:00,591
I wanted to ask you a question.

789
00:46:01,042 --> 00:46:01,888
What is it?

790
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,999
That car accident back then.

791
00:46:04,767 --> 00:46:07,932
I felt really strange
when the accident happened.

792
00:46:10,638 --> 00:46:12,851
You clearly saved me from
the accident...

793
00:46:13,176 --> 00:46:14,660
...but strangely...

794
00:46:15,283 --> 00:46:17,617
...the moment before I felt like I was
dying after getting hit by the car.

795
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:24,281
That feeling was unbelievably real.

796
00:46:26,085 --> 00:46:27,938
Did you ever experience
something like that?

797
00:46:28,334 --> 00:46:31,340
The experience of surviving
from almost dying?

798
00:46:33,303 --> 00:46:34,235
I do.

799
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:35,365
Really?

800
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:36,581
When?

801
00:46:37,347 --> 00:46:39,414
It was when I was really young.

802
00:46:39,499 --> 00:46:40,998
I fell in the water once.

803
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:43,801
But someone saved me.

804
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:52,440
I was saved because of that person,
but strangely...

805
00:46:54,053 --> 00:46:56,614
...I felt like I was drowning.

806
00:46:57,106 --> 00:46:58,336
It felt so real.

807
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,640
I knew it.

808
00:47:03,382 --> 00:47:04,985
Was the person who saved you...

809
00:47:06,288 --> 00:47:07,666
...happen to be Nam Hongjoo?

810
00:47:07,751 --> 00:47:08,500
Excuse me?

811
00:47:08,585 --> 00:47:10,821
What if we look at it this way?

812
00:47:11,115 --> 00:47:13,582
I was really thankful to
you because of that feeling.

813
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:15,536
I could've really be dead.

814
00:47:15,669 --> 00:47:18,669
I thought,
"I want to repay him for saving me."

815
00:47:18,938 --> 00:47:20,871
-Because of that thought...
-Because of that thought?

816
00:47:21,467 --> 00:47:22,940
I started having the dreams.

817
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:26,477
I see the future of the one
who saved me in my dreams.

818
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,549
You dream about Nam Hongjoo.

819
00:47:29,634 --> 00:47:32,673
So, the one who saved
you was Nam Hongjoo.

820
00:47:33,865 --> 00:47:34,733
What do you think?

821
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,670
That's impossible.

822
00:47:36,834 --> 00:47:37,601
Why?

823
00:47:37,801 --> 00:47:40,834
The one who saved me was a man.
It wasn't Nam Hongjoo.

824
00:47:40,934 --> 00:47:41,866
Are you sure?

825
00:47:41,951 --> 00:47:43,392
Yes. I'm positive.

826
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:48,052
The one who saved me was called Bamtol
and he was a boy who loved baseball.

827
00:47:48,388 --> 00:47:50,388
And he was strong and energetic.

828
00:47:54,267 --> 00:47:55,771
I'm back.

829
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,074
Mom. There was a sale on
vitamins on my way back.

830
00:47:59,701 --> 00:48:00,669
Mom.

831
00:48:01,522 --> 00:48:03,089
Where did she go at this hour?

832
00:48:12,634 --> 00:48:14,849
Is this considered as food waste?

833
00:48:16,701 --> 00:48:17,822
Is that perhaps...

834
00:48:19,868 --> 00:48:21,635
Is it the mackerel that I gave you?

835
00:48:23,224 --> 00:48:25,667
No. This is...

836
00:48:25,868 --> 00:48:28,202
Grilling this was harder that I thought.

837
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:29,734
It was difficult to control the heat too.

838
00:48:30,726 --> 00:48:34,249
Why don't you just have breakfast
at my house from now on?

839
00:48:34,334 --> 00:48:35,461
No. That's okay.

840
00:48:35,546 --> 00:48:38,035
It's because I have
a favor to ask of you.

841
00:48:38,775 --> 00:48:45,096
You don't know why Hongjoo
quit being a reporter, do you?

842
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,098
She dreamt that she died as a reporter.

843
00:48:51,501 --> 00:48:54,172
That's why I told her to quit
being a reporter immediately.

844
00:48:54,906 --> 00:48:55,784
You know, don't you?

845
00:48:56,214 --> 00:48:58,952
That Hongjoo's dreams are special.

846
00:48:59,701 --> 00:49:00,998
Yes. I know.

847
00:49:02,033 --> 00:49:05,576
But that rotten girl wants to
return to work in the end.

848
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,924
I should've tried to stop her.

849
00:49:15,045 --> 00:49:17,801
But I gave her permission
because I felt so bad for her.

850
00:49:19,246 --> 00:49:23,534
I felt bad for her because she wasn't
doing what she wants to do in life.

851
00:49:47,324 --> 00:49:48,556
Anyway...

852
00:49:48,769 --> 00:49:51,584
What do you like to eat, Prosecutor Jung?

853
00:49:51,801 --> 00:49:57,135
I worked at Korean, Chinese,
Western and all sorts of restaurants.

854
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:59,544
So I can make all kinds of food.

855
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,452
So just tell me.

856
00:50:01,537 --> 00:50:05,773
I'll make what you and your
brother likes every morning.

857
00:50:05,858 --> 00:50:07,756
For free. It will be free.

858
00:50:07,841 --> 00:50:08,620
Gosh.

859
00:50:08,934 --> 00:50:11,201
But why do you want to make me breakfast?

860
00:50:12,167 --> 00:50:14,634
It's because I'm thankful
to you for everything.

861
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:16,868
I heard that you saved
my daughter several times.

862
00:50:17,434 --> 00:50:19,201
I wanted to repay you.

863
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:24,435
And... I might be
indebted to you again.

864
00:50:27,761 --> 00:50:28,807
Well...

865
00:50:29,567 --> 00:50:31,610
I shouldn't be asking you this.

866
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:34,435
But if something happens...

867
00:50:35,367 --> 00:50:37,241
...please protect my daughter.

868
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:10,934
Should I return to work or not?

869
00:51:12,901 --> 00:51:14,335
It wasn't because she didn't want to.

870
00:51:15,934 --> 00:51:18,768
She wanted to, but she was scared.

871
00:51:52,267 --> 00:51:53,903
Face expressions are so mysterious.

872
00:51:55,501 --> 00:51:56,568
Let's do it!

873
00:51:57,367 --> 00:51:58,262
Let's do it!

874
00:51:59,234 --> 00:52:00,097
Let's do it!

875
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,534
Let's do it!

876
00:52:05,575 --> 00:52:07,333
You can tell one's mood...

877
00:52:08,067 --> 00:52:08,993
...thoughts...

878
00:52:09,345 --> 00:52:10,221
...and emotions easily....

879
00:52:10,566 --> 00:52:12,127
...through one's facial expression
as if you're looking into the mirror.

880
00:52:21,978 --> 00:52:22,877
Mom.

881
00:52:23,934 --> 00:52:25,732
Don't worry. I'm still in the bus.

882
00:52:27,334 --> 00:52:28,701
Can't you believe your daughter?

883
00:52:29,249 --> 00:52:31,150
Okay. Okay.

884
00:52:31,897 --> 00:52:33,997
I feel great.

885
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,963
But you can also hide your mood...

886
00:52:37,167 --> 00:52:40,540
...thoughts, and feelings with your face
expressions like putting on a mask.

887
00:53:11,437 --> 00:53:14,402
But in the flash of a moment...

888
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,415
...there's a moment where...

889
00:53:18,634 --> 00:53:20,502
...the boundary between that
mask and mirror comes down.

890
00:53:34,167 --> 00:53:35,924
The truth that no one saw...

891
00:53:47,362 --> 00:53:49,289
That feeling that you
didn't want others to see.

892
00:53:52,167 --> 00:53:54,609
The moment it surfaces
to the world for a moment...

893
00:53:58,033 --> 00:54:01,393
If we face that moment,
let's not close our eyes.

894
00:54:21,977 --> 00:54:23,146
Let's not ignore them if we see them.

895
00:54:24,252 --> 00:54:27,424
Let's not avoid them,
but let's face them.

896
00:54:48,267 --> 00:54:48,883
Hello.

897
00:54:48,968 --> 00:54:50,469
Nam Hongjoo has returned to work.

898
00:54:50,534 --> 00:54:51,435
It's been a long time.

899
00:54:51,534 --> 00:54:53,402
Welcome back, Nam Hongjoo.

900
00:54:53,501 --> 00:54:55,111
Welcome to hell.

901
00:54:55,734 --> 00:54:56,468
It's been a while.

902
00:54:56,553 --> 00:54:57,387
Yes.

903
00:54:58,004 --> 00:55:00,066
Captain. I've returned to work.

904
00:55:00,167 --> 00:55:01,347
Is your health better?

905
00:55:01,432 --> 00:55:02,601
It's nice to see you again.

906
00:55:02,701 --> 00:55:04,602
Congratulations on having a baby.

907
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:05,768
Your eye make-up smeared.

908
00:55:05,853 --> 00:55:07,015
Don't you look at yourself in the mirror?

909
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,901
I've returned to work.

910
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,334
I put your uniform
on that desk over there.

911
00:55:18,994 --> 00:55:21,568
I guess you are her supervisor
since you took care of that.

912
00:55:21,653 --> 00:55:24,549
You don't act like
how you feel. You jerk.

913
00:55:24,634 --> 00:55:27,768
Captain. What are you doing?

914
00:55:28,334 --> 00:55:30,738
You're my supervisor,
but you don't even help me.

915
00:55:30,925 --> 00:55:33,325
What are you doing?

916
00:55:51,367 --> 00:55:54,148
We got a different design this time,
so our uniforms changed.

917
00:55:54,886 --> 00:55:58,176
I was sick of purple uniforms.
Try it on to see if it looks good.

918
00:56:03,189 --> 00:56:05,550
Is it that difficult to
cross the crosswalk?

919
00:56:06,247 --> 00:56:07,175
I know.

920
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,901
Maybe it's because
I haven't been here in a while.

921
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,151
It's hard and I'm nervous for no reason.

922
00:56:11,236 --> 00:56:12,161
Then what would you like me to do?

923
00:56:12,246 --> 00:56:14,013
Do you want me to go inside with you?

924
00:56:14,634 --> 00:56:15,734
What's wrong with you?

925
00:56:16,026 --> 00:56:17,711
I might start to misunderstand again.

926
00:56:17,901 --> 00:56:20,682
I might cling onto you and ask
you to take me to work every day.

927
00:56:20,767 --> 00:56:22,268
And whine to you about protecting me.

928
00:56:24,336 --> 00:56:25,250
Why don't you do that?

929
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:28,047
Excuse me?

930
00:56:28,221 --> 00:56:32,079
Cling onto me, ask me to take
you to work and protect you.

931
00:56:32,567 --> 00:56:33,673
I'll give it a try.

932
00:56:37,067 --> 00:56:40,474
If that puts you at ease,
I'll give it a try.

933
00:56:43,799 --> 00:56:46,518
Why are you saying that?
It sounds like you mean it.

934
00:56:49,267 --> 00:56:50,968
I meant it.

935
00:56:51,221 --> 00:56:52,495
Don't you believe me?

936
00:56:52,667 --> 00:56:53,757
Is that why you're crying?

937
00:56:54,901 --> 00:56:56,458
I'm crying because I believe you.

938
00:56:56,909 --> 00:56:58,462
Because I feel relieved.

939
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,290
I really wanted to hear those words.

940
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:03,686
That's why I'm crying.

941
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,971
My eye make-up has smeared.

942
00:57:12,152 --> 00:57:13,405
Excuse me.

943
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:14,948
You said you'd protect me.

944
00:57:15,033 --> 00:57:16,475
Can't you at least do this for me?

945
00:57:30,361 --> 00:57:31,949
You're not avoiding it today.

946
00:58:33,767 --> 00:58:34,735
Don't you like it?

947
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:37,222
No.

948
00:58:38,968 --> 00:58:40,538
I really like it.

949
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:39,182
"While You Were Sleeping"

950
00:59:39,267 --> 00:59:40,834
Did you kill your younger brother?

951
00:59:42,124 --> 00:59:43,883
I'm asking you to make me innocent.

952
00:59:43,968 --> 00:59:45,836
The opposing attorney
is Lee Yoobum.

953
00:59:45,934 --> 00:59:47,768
He'll be found guilty by 99 percent.
Of course.

954
00:59:47,868 --> 00:59:48,849
We're the 99 percent.

955
00:59:48,934 --> 00:59:50,101
Your Honor, the defense council is...

956
00:59:50,192 --> 00:59:53,567
All of these records here are
denouncing the prosecution's claims.

957
00:59:53,652 --> 00:59:55,681
If he is released like that and kills more
people, you'll be the one responsible.

958
00:59:55,766 --> 00:59:58,836
You prosecutors are responsible
for not proving that he's guilty!

959
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:01,921
Jung Jaechan!
