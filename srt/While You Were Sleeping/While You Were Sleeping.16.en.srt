00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,767
"While You Were Sleeping"

2
00:00:07,033 --> 00:00:10,066
"Episode 16"

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,101
Prosecutor Lee. Prosecutor Jung.

4
00:00:15,868 --> 00:00:16,736
Yes?

5
00:00:16,968 --> 00:00:18,166
I think...

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,268
...we should request
a travel ban for Attorney Lee.

7
00:00:21,367 --> 00:00:22,382
A travel ban?

8
00:00:22,467 --> 00:00:24,934
Attorney Lee drove me here
and in his car...

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,533
Get in, Mr. Choi.

10
00:00:27,434 --> 00:00:30,834
I saw a luggage at the back of his seat.

11
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:36,100
He may run away to a different
country once the trial is done.

12
00:00:37,934 --> 00:00:40,668
Doesn't it take few days for
the travel ban to be approved?

13
00:00:40,734 --> 00:00:42,458
If it's urgent,
we can get it approved today.

14
00:00:42,534 --> 00:00:43,335
Hold on.

15
00:00:56,901 --> 00:00:57,702
I swear that...

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,033
...I will tell the truth and nothing but
the truth according to my conscience.

17
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:03,734
If any lies are found...

18
00:01:05,767 --> 00:01:07,735
...I will be punished for perjury.

19
00:01:08,534 --> 00:01:09,416
All right.

20
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:11,687
Prosecutors, you may begin
with the interrogation.

21
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:12,501
Yes, Your Honor.

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,200
You were the first one to
have arrived at the rooftop...

23
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,831
...of Haekwang Law Firm on
the night of the incident, right?

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,534
Yes, that's correct.

25
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:24,244
Could you describe the moment
when you got there?

26
00:01:24,434 --> 00:01:25,235
Yes.

27
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:27,867
When I got there...

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,301
...the defendant, Yoobum, was stumbling
while carrying reporter Hongjoo.

29
00:01:33,934 --> 00:01:37,168
I saw two umbrellas
far away that were open.

30
00:01:37,367 --> 00:01:39,249
Was there anyone else at the rooftop?

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
No, there was no one else.

32
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:51,935
The following pictures
are evidence one and two.

33
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,601
The handles of both umbrellas
had the fingerprints of both defendant...

34
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:56,734
...Lee Yoobum, and Ha Joohan.

35
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,834
The fact that she brought these
two umbrellas to the rooftop...

36
00:01:59,934 --> 00:02:03,334
...means that it was her intent to return
back with the defendant later on.

37
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,200
This means that Lee Yoobum
murdered Ha Joohan...

38
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,129
...who had no intent to kill and...

39
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,200
...it also contradicts to his
claim of self-defense.

40
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:14,135
Please insist that...

41
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:18,468
...the umbrella was found on
the first floor and not on the rooftop.

42
00:02:19,033 --> 00:02:21,867
State that the umbrella may not
be the same one the witness saw.

43
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:26,867
The witness here is a cop who
got to the scene first...

44
00:02:26,934 --> 00:02:29,967
...and saw the situation and the umbrella
he saw on the rooftop...

45
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:33,934
...and the one from the first floor could
be identified as the same by the witness.

46
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:37,901
I won't show this picture to the witness
and begin with the questioning.

47
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:39,601
Witness.

48
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,802
Tell us about the umbrella.

49
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:47,467
One umbrella was long and the other one
was a short three-fold umbrella.

50
00:02:49,934 --> 00:02:51,735
What were the colors?

51
00:03:03,534 --> 00:03:05,701
What are you going to say when you
testify if you don't run now?

52
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:07,201
Are you going to hide
the fact that you're colorblind?

53
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,268
If you get caught lying...

54
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:11,754
...then you'll get punished for perjury.

55
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:13,066
I won't.

56
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,233
Are you going to tell the truth
about you being colorblind?

57
00:03:15,634 --> 00:03:17,535
Then, you'll have to quit being a cop.

58
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:20,700
Witness.

59
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,901
Why aren't you telling us
the color of the umbrellas?

60
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:30,434
Witness.

61
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,268
What were the colors of the umbrellas?

62
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,067
I...

63
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,300
I can't differentiate colors.

64
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,467
What does that mean?

65
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,667
Wootak, what are you doing?

66
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:09,667
Everything will be over
for you if you do this.

67
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:11,602
How did he become
a cop if he's colorblind?

68
00:04:13,534 --> 00:04:14,601
It's over.

69
00:04:17,934 --> 00:04:18,668
Witness.

70
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:19,875
Did you just say...

71
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,101
Yes. However, I am a cop.

72
00:04:22,934 --> 00:04:25,868
Being colorblind means that
I'm not eligible to be a cop.

73
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,100
As soon as my witness testimony is over...

74
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:32,001
...I'm going to submit
my resignation letter.

75
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,867
He's going to quit being a cop
to be a witness for this trial?

76
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:47,968
Please continue, Prosecutor Jung.

77
00:05:03,901 --> 00:05:04,735
Witness.

78
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:09,001
Then, can you describe the details of
the umbrella that you saw that night?

79
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:11,367
Your Honor, it'll be difficult for...

80
00:05:11,434 --> 00:05:16,834
...a normal person to be able to remember
the umbrellas at that brief moment.

81
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:20,901
Especially for someone
who is colorblind...

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,200
It's not that I can't see colors,
but I see it differently.

83
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,449
I see colors different
compared to others...

84
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:28,934
...but I'm able to identify light
and shades better than anyone.

85
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,500
So my eyesight is far better
than normal people at night.

86
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:35,400
Your Honor, it won't be late...

87
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,187
...if we hear the witness with his full
testimony before making any judgments.

88
00:05:38,267 --> 00:05:40,334
Yes, please proceed.

89
00:05:43,868 --> 00:05:44,635
Witness.

90
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:47,334
What kind of umbrellas
did you see that night?

91
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:49,600
The long umbrella I saw that night...

92
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:54,601
...night at the rooftop had a wooden
handle that was bent like a cane.

93
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:02,835
The foldable umbrella had
a cylinder-shaped handle...

94
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:06,001
...with two circles on it.

95
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:08,501
The long umbrella...

96
00:06:10,634 --> 00:06:13,135
...is the same color
as the defendant's necktie color.

97
00:06:14,634 --> 00:06:15,934
And the three fold umbrella...

98
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:19,101
...is of a similar color
to the front of your robe...

99
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:21,801
...but brighter.

100
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:33,168
He's right.

101
00:06:33,467 --> 00:06:34,500
It's the same.

102
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:36,435
He did see it correctly.

103
00:06:37,267 --> 00:06:41,801
Are the umbrellas you see in the pictures,
the same as the ones you've seen?

104
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,001
Yes, they're the same ones.

105
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:25,600
"Goodbye My Friend"

106
00:07:26,434 --> 00:07:32,801
We'll end the witness interrogation
and resume trial on July 25 at 11 AM.

107
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,068
My goodness.

108
00:07:39,434 --> 00:07:41,534
Is Lieutenant Han going to be okay?

109
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:44,533
I think he lost his job
because of this testimony...

110
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:52,168
Let's not be awkward with each other.

111
00:07:52,434 --> 00:07:54,634
I'm okay, so let's continue to be friends.

112
00:07:58,868 --> 00:08:01,669
I'm sure you know this
but it would be better for you...

113
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:06,101
...to collect some proof and reasons to
state that you didn't do it on purpose.

114
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:08,234
On purpose?

115
00:08:08,868 --> 00:08:10,268
I thought you were going
to claim that I'm innocent?

116
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,867
I don't think we need to
continue pleading self-defense.

117
00:08:13,968 --> 00:08:14,869
But...

118
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:17,735
...isn't it better to reduce
the sentence by a few years, right?

119
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:21,335
Attorney Seo will be joining for
you in the next trial instead of me.

120
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:24,634
Sir. Sir!

121
00:08:33,734 --> 00:08:35,668
You crazy jerk!

122
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:39,601
I told you to keep your mouth shut.

123
00:08:40,234 --> 00:08:43,434
You should've just said
that you didn't see anything.

124
00:08:43,534 --> 00:08:47,001
You can't take back
what you said in the court.

125
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:48,802
I know.

126
00:08:48,901 --> 00:08:50,802
Your parents worked so hard
breeding cows and pigs...

127
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:53,834
... to send you, the only son
in three generations to police academy...

128
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,868
I'm not the only son in three generations.

129
00:08:58,467 --> 00:08:59,134
What?

130
00:08:59,267 --> 00:09:02,135
My parents don't live
in the countryside either...

131
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:06,268
It's been awhile since they divorced
and got remarried to different people.

132
00:09:06,701 --> 00:09:11,202
They probably won't really care
even if I quit my job.

133
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:14,668
Wootak...

134
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:27,267
Not even once...

135
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:30,567
...I've ever thought...

136
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:34,734
...that this badge is mine.

137
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,600
It was always heavy...

138
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,667
...and difficult.

139
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,168
But still...

140
00:09:55,834 --> 00:09:57,668
...I wanted to bear this weight...

141
00:09:58,234 --> 00:09:59,367
...and I was happy.

142
00:10:03,434 --> 00:10:05,368
I really enjoyed...

143
00:10:08,434 --> 00:10:09,868
...working with you.

144
00:10:18,634 --> 00:10:20,235
I'm good now.

145
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:27,034
I don't think it's right...

146
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:28,734
...for me to be greedy anymore.

147
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:51,402
Thank you for everything.

148
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:56,467
You little fool...

149
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,700
You went through so much.

150
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:42,735
It's okay.

151
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,333
It's okay...

152
00:11:46,868 --> 00:11:48,135
It's not over yet.

153
00:11:57,734 --> 00:11:59,767
Yes, it's Lee Yoobum.

154
00:11:59,868 --> 00:12:02,905
There was a report that he may run
away to a different country today.

155
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,567
Yes, please set a travel ban immediately.

156
00:12:11,701 --> 00:12:12,502
Wait.

157
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,868
"Travel ban for Lee Yoobum
has been approved."

158
00:12:17,934 --> 00:12:20,401
You're so perfect in every way.

159
00:12:24,234 --> 00:12:25,534
Are you dating someone?

160
00:12:26,868 --> 00:12:28,602
This is the best time.

161
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:30,001
Mr. Choi.

162
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:36,268
We got Lee Yoobum's travel ban approved.

163
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,634
Really? That's good.

164
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,368
Thank you for today.

165
00:12:42,601 --> 00:12:44,102
You'll come for the next trial, right?

166
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,333
The next trial is the last one, right?

167
00:12:46,868 --> 00:12:48,102
Who's demanding the charge?

168
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,068
Why?

169
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:51,149
You won't come if I do it and you'll
come if Prosecutor Jung does it?

170
00:12:51,234 --> 00:12:52,020
Is that how it is?

171
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,167
Yes, that's how it is.

172
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,834
Yes, come. Please come.

173
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,568
Prosecutor Jung will do it.

174
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:00,901
I'll make sure I'll be there.

175
00:13:01,501 --> 00:13:04,068
You're making me upset. Gosh.

176
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,567
You did great today, too.

177
00:13:31,968 --> 00:13:34,569
Your words earlier was very impressive.

178
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:38,068
Responsibility and honor
on an investigation...

179
00:13:40,267 --> 00:13:41,634
...all belong to the prosecutor?

180
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:46,101
When I investigated
the IV serial killer case...

181
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:51,501
...I never wanted a reward for it.
You know that well.

182
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:53,302
I believed that Myung Yiseok...

183
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,834
...was the true criminal and wanted to
capture him no matter what.

184
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:58,601
That was all.

185
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:02,282
Yes, I know.

186
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:04,134
Then, why are you doing this to me?

187
00:14:05,467 --> 00:14:06,834
Why?

188
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:12,201
Why is everyone...

189
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:15,416
...being so cruel to me?

190
00:14:15,501 --> 00:14:18,268
1983, November 20th.

191
00:14:19,534 --> 00:14:21,335
That's your birthday, right?

192
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:22,867
Yes.

193
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:26,335
My parents
don't even remember that date...

194
00:14:26,434 --> 00:14:29,001
...but you celebrated it with me
every year.

195
00:14:30,701 --> 00:14:34,168
Did you celebrate with me
so that you can betray like this?

196
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:38,635
It's the same as my brother's.

197
00:14:40,234 --> 00:14:42,768
Same age and same birthday...

198
00:14:46,801 --> 00:14:49,635
So, you were special to me.

199
00:14:50,601 --> 00:14:52,168
And that's why I'm doing this.

200
00:14:56,701 --> 00:14:59,282
There's a travel ban against you.

201
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:01,801
There's no point in going to the airport.

202
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,334
Did you...

203
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,267
So...

204
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:08,935
...stop running away.

205
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:11,335
You can't run away anymore.

206
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,201
If not, you'll end up in more pain...

207
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:39,567
...and suffer greatly.

208
00:15:42,334 --> 00:15:43,068
Damdong...

209
00:15:48,901 --> 00:15:50,201
So...

210
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,402
...stop being so stubborn...

211
00:15:55,702 --> 00:15:58,203
...stop hurting others...

212
00:15:59,701 --> 00:16:01,834
...and just come with me, Wookhyun.

213
00:16:20,634 --> 00:16:22,268
I'm going to go see Mr. Choi.

214
00:16:22,334 --> 00:16:23,367
Now?

215
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:27,401
This...

216
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:29,004
I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

217
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,734
Wait...

218
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:30,568
I'll be right back.

219
00:16:30,634 --> 00:16:32,801
Prosecutor Jung! Hey!

220
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,568
Then, you'll end up in more pain
and suffer greatly.

221
00:16:45,701 --> 00:16:47,101
Please.

222
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,501
It's a bit early for
the leaves to turn red...

223
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:32,235
Where have I seen this before?

224
00:18:08,234 --> 00:18:09,835
It was around this time.

225
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,867
I knew it was fall because of you.

226
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:33,735
I thought I had more time...

227
00:18:47,234 --> 00:18:48,035
No...

228
00:18:49,801 --> 00:18:50,769
Mr. Choi!

229
00:19:16,601 --> 00:19:17,835
Prosecutor Jung...

230
00:19:24,067 --> 00:19:25,234
Prosecutor Jung...

231
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:41,501
Call 911 please...

232
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:43,468
911?

233
00:19:44,501 --> 00:19:45,335
Mr. Choi...

234
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,133
Follow us.

235
00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:51,500
Follow us.

236
00:19:55,934 --> 00:19:57,067
Prosecutor Jung...

237
00:19:58,634 --> 00:19:59,968
There's something...

238
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,868
There's something I need to tell you...

239
00:20:03,968 --> 00:20:05,202
Don't talk.

240
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,567
The ambulance will be here soon.

241
00:20:06,801 --> 00:20:08,402
It's going to be okay...

242
00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:10,435
A long time ago...

243
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,801
13 years ago...

244
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,767
I had a dream about this exact moment.

245
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:21,767
In that dream...

246
00:20:23,067 --> 00:20:24,968
...you said something...

247
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,101
...to me.

248
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:37,001
Mr. Choi...

249
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:41,502
If you had a dream about this moment...

250
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:43,701
...please don't meet me.

251
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:45,667
You can live if you don't meet me.

252
00:20:47,934 --> 00:20:52,535
So please, don't look for me...

253
00:20:53,434 --> 00:20:55,634
That's not how you said it.

254
00:20:57,334 --> 00:20:58,334
Again...

255
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,767
Say it again...

256
00:21:06,534 --> 00:21:07,402
Hurry...

257
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,535
There's not much time.

258
00:21:16,868 --> 00:21:17,915
Mr. Choi...

259
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:26,001
Mr. Choi...

260
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:29,834
I'm so glad to have met you again...

261
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,274
I'm the investigator, Choi Damdong.

262
00:21:32,367 --> 00:21:34,335
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Jung Jaechan.

263
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,800
I was stupid enough not to recognize you.

264
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:39,234
To you...

265
00:21:39,701 --> 00:21:42,335
...I was obnoxious and clumsy.

266
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,035
You must've been sick of me.

267
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:46,667
Can you tell the doctor to bring
over all his medical records?

268
00:21:46,734 --> 00:21:47,635
Okay.

269
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,801
Gosh. I'll have to work all night again.

270
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,701
You had to work overtime because of my
unsolved cases that kept piling up...

271
00:21:53,801 --> 00:21:56,769
Mr. Choi, come with me to check out the
scene for the Park Joonmoo's case.

272
00:21:56,834 --> 00:21:57,934
Check out the scene?

273
00:21:58,033 --> 00:22:01,400
I kept asking you to
check out the scene...

274
00:22:01,501 --> 00:22:03,002
And I never...

275
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:06,701
...listened to you...

276
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,333
Prosecutor Jung!

277
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:17,001
It's dangerous to go alone!
Prosecutor Jung!

278
00:22:17,234 --> 00:22:22,568
Prosecutor Jung!
Let's request for assistance.

279
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:24,201
Seriously...

280
00:22:24,567 --> 00:22:27,401
I'm wearing new shoes today too. Gosh.

281
00:22:27,501 --> 00:22:30,202
Your new shoes got
ruined because of me...

282
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:34,400
You suffered a lot because of me.

283
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,133
And still...

284
00:22:37,033 --> 00:22:38,934
And still, you...

285
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:43,568
You accepted me...

286
00:22:45,067 --> 00:22:46,668
...and looked for me.

287
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,918
What happens if I can't charge this case?

288
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,453
You'll be in trouble.

289
00:22:51,534 --> 00:22:55,235
The chief, no, the entire nation
will hate you.

290
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:59,434
I'll ask you a lot and learn a lot...

291
00:23:00,534 --> 00:23:01,734
And...

292
00:23:03,334 --> 00:23:04,401
And...

293
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,834
...I'll respect you a lot.

294
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,167
This is it...

295
00:23:17,267 --> 00:23:19,201
This is how you said it.

296
00:23:24,033 --> 00:23:26,233
That's why I quit being a cop...

297
00:23:27,534 --> 00:23:29,035
...and came looking for you.

298
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,667
I came knowing that this will happen...

299
00:23:37,734 --> 00:23:40,971
It was my choice...

300
00:23:43,534 --> 00:23:45,368
So, don't blame yourself.

301
00:23:46,501 --> 00:23:47,668
Mister...

302
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:50,701
Mister...

303
00:23:52,734 --> 00:23:53,602
Mister...

304
00:23:53,801 --> 00:23:55,669
Blame yourself for only a short while.

305
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:58,836
But remember it for a long time.

306
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:03,267
You remember what I said, right?

307
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:11,267
Only then...

308
00:24:14,033 --> 00:24:16,366
...you would be acting like
my Chief's son.

309
00:24:18,567 --> 00:24:19,834
Mister...

310
00:24:23,634 --> 00:24:24,834
Mister.

311
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,200
Mister.

312
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,300
Mister.

313
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,901
Mister, please don't go. Don't go.

314
00:24:32,434 --> 00:24:37,168
Mister, please don't go. Don't go.

315
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,767
"Even if life gives you trials..."

316
00:25:06,234 --> 00:25:09,178
"...don't be sad or angry."

317
00:25:10,234 --> 00:25:11,968
"Your heart lives in the future."

318
00:25:12,434 --> 00:25:16,201
"Your present is sad and
everything is a brief moment."

319
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,700
"And they will all pass."

320
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,901
"And what's passing now..."

321
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:22,202
"...will be cherished in the future."

322
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:24,634
It's nice...

323
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:27,635
You scared me.

324
00:25:28,234 --> 00:25:29,135
Sir.

325
00:25:29,901 --> 00:25:31,135
I'm hungry.

326
00:25:31,601 --> 00:25:32,634
I want to eat.

327
00:25:32,934 --> 00:25:35,168
Okay, I'll go bring something for you.

328
00:25:38,767 --> 00:25:42,034
You're not thinking of
something stupid, are you?

329
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:43,600
I won't go anywhere else.

330
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,667
I'm not thinking of anything stupid.

331
00:25:49,234 --> 00:25:50,434
My end...

332
00:25:51,534 --> 00:25:53,001
...is not right now.

333
00:25:57,577 --> 00:25:59,011
There's someone...

334
00:26:00,694 --> 00:26:02,428
...I have to meet in the future.

335
00:26:18,167 --> 00:26:19,768
"Choi Damdong"

336
00:26:26,868 --> 00:26:29,669
"We're not taking any condolence
money as that was his will."

337
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,667
"To Jung Jaechan"

338
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,367
Yesterday at 5 PM in
the parking lot of Han River office...

339
00:30:39,434 --> 00:30:43,168
...Lee Yoobum, who was in a trial
for the Moguk-dong's fall case...

340
00:30:43,267 --> 00:30:47,201
...killed a man named Choi who
attended the trial as a witness.

341
00:31:18,934 --> 00:31:21,902
Lee Yoobum who was
denying all the charges...

342
00:31:21,968 --> 00:31:25,469
...has confessed his crimes
after the imprisonment.

343
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:28,234
He has been charged for
manipulating the IV serial killer case...

344
00:31:28,334 --> 00:31:31,235
...murdering Ha Joohan,
the actual murder of the IV killer...

345
00:31:31,467 --> 00:31:35,168
...and attempted murder of
Reporter Nam Hongjoo.

346
00:31:35,267 --> 00:31:37,801
The investigation by prosecutors
will soon make progress.

347
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:05,301
Prosecution has also added a charge of
manslaughter for hit-and-run to his case.

348
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,600
In the case of manipulating
the IV killer case...

349
00:32:07,701 --> 00:32:12,535
...he will be facing additional
charges of falsifying evidence...

350
00:32:12,634 --> 00:32:15,767
...attempted murder, and manslaughter.

351
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,402
Yoobum...

352
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,567
That jerk.

353
00:32:50,434 --> 00:32:52,482
He's getting investigated today, right?

354
00:32:52,567 --> 00:32:55,315
The investigation is over,
but he said he wanted to say something.

355
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,368
Even if he had thousand mouths,
he should just keep his mouth shut.

356
00:32:59,701 --> 00:33:00,768
Where's Wootak?

357
00:33:01,033 --> 00:33:02,231
Is he not coming for breakfast anymore?

358
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,132
I don't think so.

359
00:33:03,234 --> 00:33:04,315
He's not even picking up his phone.

360
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,134
Should we take some food for him?

361
00:33:12,934 --> 00:33:14,301
"Don't be afraid,
I'll be right here next to you."

362
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,201
"Every day, forever..."

363
00:33:18,234 --> 00:33:19,601
Is your hand still shaking?

364
00:33:19,834 --> 00:33:20,635
Yes.

365
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:23,300
The doctor said there's nothing wrong,
so I don't know why.

366
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,335
I know why.

367
00:33:25,434 --> 00:33:27,035
My hand used to shake a lot.

368
00:33:27,634 --> 00:33:28,335
Really?

369
00:33:28,701 --> 00:33:29,935
What should I do?

370
00:33:31,133 --> 00:33:33,834
It takes time but it can be fixed.

371
00:33:33,934 --> 00:33:35,168
I'll help you.

372
00:33:35,534 --> 00:33:36,368
You?

373
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:40,767
Yes.

374
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:44,469
So, don't worry.
I'll be right here for you.

375
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,901
Every day, forever.

376
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:53,300
Hey...

377
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:56,101
I should be the one to say that...

378
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:57,668
You did say it.

379
00:33:58,033 --> 00:33:59,534
I did? When?

380
00:34:00,868 --> 00:34:03,202
I forget when, but may a year ago?

381
00:34:03,767 --> 00:34:04,867
You saw it in your dream?

382
00:34:04,934 --> 00:34:05,601
Yes.

383
00:34:06,601 --> 00:34:09,901
And you also said that you wanted
to say something to yourself now.

384
00:34:10,868 --> 00:34:11,836
What is it?

385
00:34:15,634 --> 00:34:18,361
This brings back memories.

386
00:34:18,868 --> 00:34:21,968
You're now a prosecutor
investigating me...

387
00:34:22,434 --> 00:34:23,935
...and I'm a defendant...

388
00:34:25,501 --> 00:34:26,369
I know.

389
00:34:26,601 --> 00:34:28,561
Let's not record everything.

390
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:30,835
I've already confessed everything.

391
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:40,701
I know what you...

392
00:34:42,601 --> 00:34:44,734
...and everyone else...

393
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,267
...are thinking.

394
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:50,634
Lee Yoobum, that jerk is
finally getting what he deserves.

395
00:34:50,767 --> 00:34:52,368
Finally...

396
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,534
...justice is flowing like a river.

397
00:34:57,334 --> 00:35:00,701
He gave up everything and is being wicked.

398
00:35:00,801 --> 00:35:03,868
He should be asking for forgiveness.

399
00:35:06,701 --> 00:35:08,086
Don't make me laugh.

400
00:35:09,434 --> 00:35:13,101
Me being here today might
be yours in the future.

401
00:35:15,267 --> 00:35:16,601
What do you mean?

402
00:35:16,868 --> 00:35:20,968
Well, the tipping point to the whole
thing is the IV serial killer case.

403
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:24,167
I, who used to be a prosecutor,
let Ha Joohan go...

404
00:35:24,434 --> 00:35:27,201
...and I concluded falsely that
Myung Yiseok is the guilty one.

405
00:35:27,934 --> 00:35:28,668
Right?

406
00:35:29,133 --> 00:35:29,767
Yes.

407
00:35:30,033 --> 00:35:35,200
Everyone takes care of about 200 cases
a month and a few thousand a year.

408
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:40,001
Do you think you all took care
of every case in a proper way?

409
00:35:41,634 --> 00:35:43,667
It's hard to get 100 percent
right even on your dictation test.

410
00:35:43,801 --> 00:35:47,302
Among the cases that can
easily ruin a person's life...

411
00:35:47,367 --> 00:35:49,834
...among those thousand cases...

412
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,435
...are you sure you never
made a single mistake?

413
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,767
Let's be honest.

414
00:35:59,901 --> 00:36:03,802
You must have a few cases that went wrong.

415
00:36:04,267 --> 00:36:05,801
Hey, Prosecutor Lee.

416
00:36:06,133 --> 00:36:08,800
You didn't do an autopsy
and made a false claim.

417
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:10,234
Hey, Shin Heemin!

418
00:36:10,901 --> 00:36:13,435
You falsely charged and
missed Kang Daehee.

419
00:36:13,934 --> 00:36:16,015
There are quite a lot of cases
that I know of.

420
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,701
So, how long will you guys last?

421
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,967
You are standing there...

422
00:36:20,234 --> 00:36:22,401
...just because you are lucky that
your misjudgments weren't revealed.

423
00:36:22,467 --> 00:36:24,368
The reason why I'm here...

424
00:36:25,334 --> 00:36:27,668
...is that my misjudgment has
been revealed due to bad luck.

425
00:36:28,367 --> 00:36:29,301
I was...

426
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:32,201
...just unlucky.

427
00:36:36,033 --> 00:36:36,934
No...

428
00:36:38,834 --> 00:36:40,301
You're just bad.

429
00:36:41,801 --> 00:36:43,349
When you investigated the IV case...

430
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:45,968
...you set Myung Yiseok as your target
and made the puzzle pieces fit.

431
00:36:46,868 --> 00:36:49,358
You even falsified
evidence to finish your puzzle.

432
00:36:49,434 --> 00:36:51,968
But you knew all along
that you were wrong.

433
00:36:53,834 --> 00:36:56,635
That's why you were so mad at us.

434
00:36:59,901 --> 00:37:01,873
So, why would you investigate after
already deciding on the result?

435
00:37:01,968 --> 00:37:04,469
You should've tried to investigate
and find out the results!

436
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:10,390
Maybe when you did that to us,
it reminded me of the things you did.

437
00:37:11,133 --> 00:37:13,500
That's probably why you were so mad.

438
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:17,001
You were not mad at us...

439
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:23,435
But you were mad at yourself.

440
00:37:24,601 --> 00:37:25,402
A I right?

441
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,233
No.

442
00:37:35,601 --> 00:37:37,502
You probably hated yourself.

443
00:37:37,601 --> 00:37:38,601
No!

444
00:37:39,634 --> 00:37:42,634
You probably thought your mistakes would
be gone if you washed it or blamed others.

445
00:37:44,234 --> 00:37:45,835
You were probably scared.

446
00:37:47,334 --> 00:37:48,268
Shut up.

447
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:50,368
You continued to hide...

448
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,768
...and disguise the fact and felt
guiltier as the days passed.

449
00:37:54,434 --> 00:37:56,368
You didn't get here
because you answered wrong.

450
00:37:57,701 --> 00:38:00,168
You came this far because you insisted
that the wrong answers were right.

451
00:38:00,567 --> 00:38:03,268
You even had to kill Ha Joohan
and Mr. Choi to back up your plead.

452
00:38:09,033 --> 00:38:10,500
You kept insisting that
the wrong answer was right.

453
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,901
That's why you're here.

454
00:38:22,701 --> 00:38:24,101
You're not unlucky.

455
00:38:26,934 --> 00:38:28,301
You're bad.

456
00:38:38,934 --> 00:38:40,368
The defendant, Lee Yoobum...

457
00:38:40,467 --> 00:38:43,001
...who as a prosecutor,
should've sought the truth.

458
00:38:43,334 --> 00:38:45,202
Instead, he sought after fame and money.

459
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,001
As a result, he let the real culprit go
and caused the deaths of many.

460
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,867
The defendant used to be
a prosecutor who charges people...

461
00:38:52,934 --> 00:38:55,701
...and punished
those who committed crimes.

462
00:38:59,234 --> 00:39:04,601
However, the defendant continued
the path he was on despite knowing that...

463
00:39:04,934 --> 00:39:08,902
...what he was doing was wrong
while killing and hurting many people.

464
00:39:15,949 --> 00:39:18,982
I hope that in this country,
those who protect the law...

465
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:23,067
...will be accountable
when they enforce the law.

466
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:29,501
To many innocent ones who lost
lives because of the defendant.

467
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:32,001
I hereby apologize on behalf
of him as a prosecutor...

468
00:39:33,067 --> 00:39:34,100
...and demand charges on him.

469
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,567
Please sentence Lee Yoobum
to life sentence.

470
00:40:22,133 --> 00:40:25,367
Mr. Choi needed to see this...

471
00:40:37,901 --> 00:40:39,835
You still read these books?

472
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,068
Hongjoo?

473
00:40:46,934 --> 00:40:49,234
It's 11 AM. Wake up.

474
00:40:50,067 --> 00:40:51,501
So dusty.

475
00:40:51,801 --> 00:40:54,115
It looks like you haven't
read them in years.

476
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,567
You probably won't read
them in the next three years...

477
00:40:56,667 --> 00:40:58,734
What about the books?
And what's with the three years?

478
00:41:00,067 --> 00:41:03,501
I want to give it to Wootak.
Wootak is going to law school.

479
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:04,516
Really?

480
00:41:04,601 --> 00:41:06,135
He never mentioned that before.
When did he say that?

481
00:41:06,234 --> 00:41:07,434
In my dream.

482
00:41:07,501 --> 00:41:11,068
He has to study for
years without any income.

483
00:41:11,534 --> 00:41:13,660
So, let's help him save money on books.

484
00:41:13,767 --> 00:41:15,635
Yes, of course.

485
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,534
Bring your luggage.

486
00:41:17,734 --> 00:41:18,602
Of course.

487
00:41:30,501 --> 00:41:31,935
No one should be coming.

488
00:41:33,501 --> 00:41:34,601
Who is it?

489
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:37,068
It's me, Hongjoo.

490
00:41:37,234 --> 00:41:38,234
It's me.

491
00:41:38,601 --> 00:41:40,282
What brings you guys here?

492
00:41:40,367 --> 00:41:41,968
We brought you a gift.

493
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,501
Wait... I'll be right out.

494
00:41:48,634 --> 00:41:49,634
My goodness.

495
00:41:51,567 --> 00:41:52,567
My gosh.

496
00:41:52,667 --> 00:41:55,700
You're similar to Jaechan
when you don't go to work.

497
00:41:57,033 --> 00:41:57,800
Is that a compliment?

498
00:41:57,934 --> 00:41:59,301
You think so?

499
00:41:59,734 --> 00:42:01,168
What's all this?

500
00:42:01,267 --> 00:42:04,601
I had a dream that's in a year.
You're going to law school.

501
00:42:04,701 --> 00:42:05,602
Me?

502
00:42:05,834 --> 00:42:06,649
At my age?

503
00:42:06,734 --> 00:42:10,401
You, at that age, listening
to lectures with young girls.

504
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,234
I'm so jealous.

505
00:42:17,667 --> 00:42:20,178
No way. Me going to law school...

506
00:42:20,267 --> 00:42:21,749
Why not? It makes sense.

507
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:23,658
When I saw you defending
Do Hakyoung last time...

508
00:42:23,734 --> 00:42:25,401
...you were more versed
in the law than I am.

509
00:42:25,701 --> 00:42:27,235
You even told me you excelled
in law at the police academy.

510
00:42:27,334 --> 00:42:30,334
I wasn't just good, but I was the best.

511
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,150
Jeez.

512
00:42:32,234 --> 00:42:34,267
And my mom made these.

513
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:38,569
My mom will take care of your
meals while you go to law school.

514
00:42:38,667 --> 00:42:39,800
No need to do this...

515
00:42:39,901 --> 00:42:44,468
Everyone is doing this for you,
so please clean your room and shave.

516
00:42:44,534 --> 00:42:47,035
Did you feed Robin?
He must be so hungry.

517
00:42:47,133 --> 00:42:51,166
Robin, have you eaten?

518
00:42:51,534 --> 00:42:56,168
Robin, did you go for a walk?

519
00:42:56,267 --> 00:42:57,467
You brought so much stuff.

520
00:42:57,534 --> 00:43:00,035
How did you bring all this without a car?

521
00:43:00,901 --> 00:43:02,168
We have a car.

522
00:43:02,434 --> 00:43:03,834
You do? What car?

523
00:43:05,367 --> 00:43:09,301
Honey, I'm taking the bus
and I'm on my way.

524
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:13,700
Jaechan wanted to borrow my car,
so I let him borrow it.

525
00:43:14,167 --> 00:43:14,934
I don't know.

526
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,400
He said he needed to carry some stuff.

527
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,568
Bus is better than a car.

528
00:43:20,567 --> 00:43:21,368
Bye.

529
00:43:24,634 --> 00:43:26,734
I think you can get up now.

530
00:43:33,234 --> 00:43:35,035
"It was Wootak."

531
00:43:36,834 --> 00:43:38,501
Give me the keys.
I'll drive.

532
00:43:38,601 --> 00:43:39,235
Okay.

533
00:43:41,434 --> 00:43:42,768
My hand doesn't shake.

534
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,567
It was Wootak.

535
00:43:45,834 --> 00:43:46,368
What do you mean?

536
00:43:46,467 --> 00:43:49,068
I was right, wasn't I?
I said I can fix it.

537
00:43:50,334 --> 00:43:51,334
You drive.

538
00:43:54,067 --> 00:43:55,168
You fixed it?

539
00:43:55,934 --> 00:43:57,168
When?

540
00:43:58,934 --> 00:44:00,668
Just now.

541
00:44:00,767 --> 00:44:01,568
Just now?

542
00:44:07,667 --> 00:44:09,734
"Introduction to Criminal Law"

543
00:44:33,434 --> 00:44:36,634
"Tell your brother I said thank you."

544
00:44:39,501 --> 00:44:41,835
Daegoo, my brother just told me...

545
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,201
...that Lee Yoobum
just got sentenced today.

546
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,600
Just as my brother demanded.

547
00:44:47,534 --> 00:44:48,534
Life in prison.

548
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,901
What should I say in moments like this?

549
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:03,834
It's hard to say that it was good.

550
00:45:05,901 --> 00:45:07,535
Tell your brother I said thank you.

551
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:09,601
Okay.

552
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,100
Hey, Soyoon.

553
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,001
Sorry, I'll call you later.

554
00:45:22,734 --> 00:45:23,834
Soyoon?

555
00:45:24,634 --> 00:45:26,602
Why is Soyoon calling you?

556
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,934
Well... We're dating.

557
00:45:30,467 --> 00:45:31,401
No way.

558
00:45:31,667 --> 00:45:33,834
I'm serious, we're dating.

559
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:35,035
Look.

560
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:37,935
You photoshopped it.

561
00:45:38,901 --> 00:45:40,889
No man, this isn't photoshopped.

562
00:45:40,968 --> 00:45:43,592
Why would Soyoon go out with you?

563
00:45:43,667 --> 00:45:45,800
Do you think I'm a pervert to
have photoshopped her like this?

564
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,769
Fine, let's just say
that you two are dating.

565
00:45:47,868 --> 00:45:49,098
Help with this.

566
00:45:49,167 --> 00:45:52,200
-You little...
-You need to help me with this.

567
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:11,501
"A year later"

568
00:46:11,601 --> 00:46:15,268
Mother, if the bride and the groom
are both colleagues from work...

569
00:46:15,334 --> 00:46:16,568
...how do you pay
the congratulatory money?

570
00:46:16,667 --> 00:46:19,194
Is it your friend's wedding today?

571
00:46:19,267 --> 00:46:21,300
I don't know how much
I'm supposed to give.

572
00:46:21,367 --> 00:46:22,467
Do you have to pay double?

573
00:46:22,534 --> 00:46:24,634
Or do you have to pay for one person?

574
00:46:24,734 --> 00:46:26,568
Don't you have to give
it to them separately?

575
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:27,901
Should pay in double?

576
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,133
No way...

577
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,434
Just pay who you're close to.

578
00:46:30,534 --> 00:46:31,768
Besides, you're the MC,

579
00:46:31,868 --> 00:46:33,035
do you have to give them money?

580
00:46:33,367 --> 00:46:35,034
Is that so? I don't need to pay?

581
00:46:35,133 --> 00:46:35,834
No.

582
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:39,041
Is the dry cleaner open right now?

583
00:46:39,234 --> 00:46:41,168
I have to pick up my
blouse for the wedding.

584
00:46:41,267 --> 00:46:44,218
I'll get it for you after
I give this food to Wootak.

585
00:46:45,234 --> 00:46:47,135
Mother, wait.

586
00:46:47,667 --> 00:46:48,700
What's this?

587
00:46:48,801 --> 00:46:50,735
I'm the prosecutor
and Wootak is the cop?

588
00:46:51,067 --> 00:46:52,734
Oh... That...

589
00:46:52,834 --> 00:46:56,419
What were you counting?

590
00:46:56,501 --> 00:46:57,968
It looks like a point system.

591
00:46:58,033 --> 00:46:59,033
Why is yours lower?

592
00:46:59,133 --> 00:47:01,001
Right?
I think she was rating us.

593
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:04,200
That was a long time ago.
Throw it away.

594
00:47:04,467 --> 00:47:05,301
I...

595
00:47:05,934 --> 00:47:08,368
I'm late. I'm going to go.
Go ahead and eat.

596
00:47:08,467 --> 00:47:10,734
Mother, answer me before you go.
What is this?

597
00:47:10,834 --> 00:47:12,568
What about breakfast?

598
00:47:19,067 --> 00:47:20,734
Mother, try this.

599
00:47:20,834 --> 00:47:21,501
Yes.

600
00:47:26,367 --> 00:47:29,534
It's good, it's perfect.

601
00:47:29,601 --> 00:47:32,668
You've mastered Korean food
if you've mastered japchae.

602
00:47:32,801 --> 00:47:33,769
Japchae is easy.

603
00:47:33,868 --> 00:47:35,035
It's not easy...

604
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:38,001
We wouldn't eat japchae for special
occasions if it was easy to make.

605
00:47:38,167 --> 00:47:40,734
Police Han, you don't have
to learn cooking anymore.

606
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,701
I should stop calling you Police Han...

607
00:47:47,934 --> 00:47:49,001
Have you decided what you wanted to do?

608
00:47:49,067 --> 00:47:50,067
What should I call you?

609
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:51,167
Judge Han?

610
00:47:51,234 --> 00:47:53,168
Prosecutor Han? Or Attorney Han?

611
00:47:55,901 --> 00:47:57,034
Attorney Han.

612
00:47:57,467 --> 00:48:00,234
I think I suit better to advocate
for someone than to judge.

613
00:48:00,334 --> 00:48:02,168
Attorney Han sounds nice.

614
00:48:02,234 --> 00:48:03,741
It sounds really nice.

615
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:13,901
My gosh.

616
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,145
Oh my, thank you.

617
00:48:16,234 --> 00:48:17,367
Please be careful.

618
00:48:17,467 --> 00:48:18,634
-Thank you.
-Sure.

619
00:48:28,167 --> 00:48:31,267
This isn't good.
I'm going to be late to the wedding.

620
00:48:31,334 --> 00:48:32,701
Where did the driver go?

621
00:48:33,734 --> 00:48:34,535
What are you doing?

622
00:48:34,634 --> 00:48:36,268
Are you the driver?

623
00:48:36,601 --> 00:48:38,701
I accidentally bumped into your car.

624
00:48:38,834 --> 00:48:39,802
So here...

625
00:48:41,167 --> 00:48:42,167
You can just go.

626
00:48:42,534 --> 00:48:43,068
Excuse me?

627
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:46,501
That's why the bumper is there.

628
00:48:46,601 --> 00:48:47,901
If you're really sorry...

629
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,200
...then you can let someone go if
someone bumps into your car like this.

630
00:48:52,534 --> 00:48:53,601
Thank you.

631
00:49:04,167 --> 00:49:08,367
Yes, I got the bouquet,
but who's collecting the money?

632
00:49:11,767 --> 00:49:12,834
Thank you.

633
00:49:12,901 --> 00:49:13,935
Are you okay?

634
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,300
Thank you.

635
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,967
That could've been trouble.
Thank goodness.

636
00:49:20,067 --> 00:49:21,568
Hello?
Oh my goodness.

637
00:49:34,901 --> 00:49:35,934
What should I do with this?

638
00:49:36,033 --> 00:49:38,267
Turn it around.

639
00:49:39,367 --> 00:49:40,101
Jeez.

640
00:49:40,467 --> 00:49:42,428
Why in the world do I have
to come to this wedding?

641
00:49:42,501 --> 00:49:45,968
You have to attend the wedding of
the closest colleague of my brother.

642
00:49:46,367 --> 00:49:47,500
And there's someone I wanted to show you.

643
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:48,501
Someone you wanted to show me?

644
00:49:49,033 --> 00:49:49,967
Who?

645
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:13,634
Is this your tie?

646
00:50:22,734 --> 00:50:23,702
Park Soyoon?

647
00:50:23,801 --> 00:50:25,135
Soyoon.

648
00:50:25,234 --> 00:50:27,267
Yes. Did you miss me?

649
00:50:27,367 --> 00:50:29,335
Yes, a lot.

650
00:50:30,667 --> 00:50:32,667
Hey, are you two really dating?

651
00:50:32,901 --> 00:50:34,968
Do you think we were joking?

652
00:50:35,167 --> 00:50:38,567
Do you still think this was photoshopped?

653
00:50:39,567 --> 00:50:40,867
It looks real.

654
00:50:41,901 --> 00:50:42,769
Okay, then.

655
00:50:44,234 --> 00:50:46,568
Wow, Park Soyoon.
You really came.

656
00:50:46,634 --> 00:50:49,368
What? You flew all the way here
to play the piano for the wedding?

657
00:50:49,634 --> 00:50:53,201
Well... Someone asked me a favor as well.

658
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,500
How's the water pressure
for the bathroom at your dorm?

659
00:50:55,601 --> 00:50:57,402
You need especially
stronger water pressure.

660
00:50:59,567 --> 00:51:03,435
Wasn't it already revealed
that that poop wasn't mine?

661
00:51:03,734 --> 00:51:05,535
I don't know.
I still think it was yours.

662
00:51:05,634 --> 00:51:06,749
I said it wasn't mine!

663
00:51:06,834 --> 00:51:09,335
It was yours.
Your mom tried to protect you.

664
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:12,135
My mom wouldn't do that.

665
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,001
How did the bride and groom get caught?

666
00:51:14,367 --> 00:51:16,201
They must've dated secretly.

667
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:19,534
Don't even mention it.
They got caught in a ridiculous way...

668
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,500
You overstate the purchase and
construction cost by 1.1 billion...

669
00:51:27,601 --> 00:51:30,973
Embezzlement and
malfeasance also included.

670
00:51:31,067 --> 00:51:34,110
I did not overstate,
but it's the actual cost.

671
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,867
Look at the offerings here...

672
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:37,001
I know...

673
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,300
You paid every time.

674
00:51:40,834 --> 00:51:42,101
If you give offerings...

675
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:48,601
Do you think you will be
forgiven for embezzlement?

676
00:51:55,567 --> 00:51:56,567
What's with him?

677
00:51:57,334 --> 00:51:58,668
Oh my gosh.

678
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:03,534
It got switched with mine!

679
00:52:12,033 --> 00:52:14,066
The bride's entrance.

680
00:52:29,033 --> 00:52:30,534
You're so pretty.

681
00:52:30,634 --> 00:52:33,335
-So pretty.
-So pretty.

682
00:52:36,968 --> 00:52:38,302
That kid.

683
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,301
That kid is Prosecutor Son's son?

684
00:52:45,033 --> 00:52:47,867
He looks much healthier. That's a relief.

685
00:52:52,767 --> 00:52:56,468
Bride and groom, please kiss each other.

686
00:53:00,868 --> 00:53:04,935
What kind of a kiss
was that at a wedding?

687
00:53:05,033 --> 00:53:05,601
Do it right.

688
00:53:05,701 --> 00:53:07,701
Kiss! Kiss!

689
00:53:07,801 --> 00:53:10,001
My son is watching...

690
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,300
Thank you, Chanho. You're all grown up!

691
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:25,068
So handsome!

692
00:53:35,167 --> 00:53:37,499
Bride, let's throw the bouquet.

693
00:53:37,601 --> 00:53:39,569
Whoever wants to catch it,
please stand behind her.

694
00:53:39,734 --> 00:53:41,668
Now, you can toss it.

695
00:53:49,868 --> 00:53:52,235
Prosecutor Jung, you can't catch that.

696
00:53:54,234 --> 00:53:55,392
You did that on purpose, right?

697
00:53:55,701 --> 00:53:56,701
No, I did not.

698
00:53:56,968 --> 00:53:58,702
She can toss it again.

699
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:01,501
-Again!
-Let's go!

700
00:54:03,767 --> 00:54:04,800
Again!

701
00:54:04,868 --> 00:54:07,035
Now, throw it in
the count of three this time.

702
00:54:07,133 --> 00:54:09,934
One, two, three!

703
00:54:20,234 --> 00:54:21,068
No!

704
00:54:21,501 --> 00:54:22,335
Nice!

705
00:54:59,133 --> 00:55:01,034
What's wrong?
Did you have a bad dream again?

706
00:55:08,868 --> 00:55:11,068
It's okay. It's all over.

707
00:55:11,167 --> 00:55:12,300
Don't be afraid.

708
00:55:12,868 --> 00:55:14,135
I'm right here.

709
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,701
I'm going to be here with you
every day, forever...

710
00:55:19,467 --> 00:55:22,435
So, don't be afraid. I'll be right here.

711
00:55:23,133 --> 00:55:25,600
Every day, forever...

712
00:55:28,334 --> 00:55:29,302
Was it this?

713
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,800
The dream you had a year ago.

714
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:33,734
Yes.

715
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,467
I had a dream about this day back then.

716
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:39,434
I was in bad shape back then...

717
00:55:39,834 --> 00:55:42,134
Blaming myself for Wootak and Mr. Choi...

718
00:55:42,234 --> 00:55:44,234
Do you have anything you would
like to say to yourself back then?

719
00:55:46,467 --> 00:55:47,767
To myself?

720
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,433
Well...

721
00:55:51,934 --> 00:55:53,067
Tell me this.

722
00:55:53,868 --> 00:55:57,172
"I'll investigate it right.
So, trust me and don't worry."

723
00:55:57,267 --> 00:55:58,801
That's what prosecutor says and...

724
00:56:00,133 --> 00:56:01,233
...that's what my brother would say.

725
00:56:01,934 --> 00:56:03,468
This will all pass.

726
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:12,635
It may look like a big issue now...

727
00:56:14,067 --> 00:56:18,035
Dad is out of prison
and my hell will begin again.

728
00:56:19,367 --> 00:56:21,567
But it's really nothing
once it all passes.

729
00:56:22,567 --> 00:56:24,334
I think we should do an autopsy.

730
00:56:24,667 --> 00:56:27,501
That's what I think as a parent.

731
00:56:28,467 --> 00:56:29,952
You won't believe it.

732
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:32,834
But you will talk about these
things as if they're some joke.

733
00:56:33,367 --> 00:56:36,068
So, tell me not to worry too much.

734
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:40,150
I'll make difficult choices,
and it'll be hard for me.

735
00:56:40,334 --> 00:56:42,534
After a year, a morning
like today will come as well...

736
00:56:42,634 --> 00:56:46,734
A morning like today will come,
so trust that day and persevere.

737
00:56:47,234 --> 00:56:50,801
You told me to tell yourself
that all your choices are right.

738
00:56:52,834 --> 00:56:54,735
How is it? Does it comfort you?

739
00:57:48,801 --> 00:57:49,635
Tell me.

740
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Did you make all the right choices?

741
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,634
Out of all your choices,
what was the one thing you didn't regret?

742
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:57,634
A choice I didn't regret?

743
00:57:59,734 --> 00:58:01,068
The one at the bus stop.

744
00:58:03,267 --> 00:58:04,534
At the bus stop?

745
00:58:22,701 --> 00:58:26,335
It can't be her. He was a boy...

746
00:58:30,901 --> 00:58:32,869
I'm sorry, but I need to take the bus.

747
00:59:31,397 --> 00:59:37,864
"While You Were Sleeping"
