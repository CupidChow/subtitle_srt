1
00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:01,001
"While You Were Sleeping"

2
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:10,101
"Episode 10"

3
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:12,301
Did you see the picture I sent you?

4
00:00:12,386 --> 00:00:13,534
He's Lieutenant Han Wootak.

5
00:00:13,634 --> 00:00:16,201
A very good friend of Prosecutor Jung.

6
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:20,501
Han's former roommate
turned out to be Do Hakyoung.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,067
I wished Prosecutor Jung to be
more rational on this case...

8
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:27,234
...but unfortunately,
he let Hakyoung free.

9
00:00:58,734 --> 00:01:01,068
Let's get one more drink
to get rid of hangover.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,749
Why would you drink more if
you want to get rid of hangover?

11
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:05,635
Not that,
but there's a place right here...

12
00:01:05,734 --> 00:01:06,702
...that sells really good
bloody sausage soup...

13
00:01:10,234 --> 00:01:11,168
Hongjoo.

14
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:14,201
What in the world happened?

15
00:01:14,267 --> 00:01:17,068
License plate number 65C4399.
You have to find that car.

16
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:19,734
The driver had a shotgun...

17
00:02:04,367 --> 00:02:05,370
Are you okay?

18
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:06,801
Yes, Sir.

19
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,749
The patient is bleeding so much that
his blood pressure is undetectable.

20
00:02:53,834 --> 00:02:54,834
Put the mask on.

21
00:02:54,934 --> 00:02:55,835
Please prepare the equipment.

22
00:02:55,934 --> 00:02:56,535
Yes.

23
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,967
So, you are Chestnut?

24
00:03:16,501 --> 00:03:17,968
How did I not recognize you?

25
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:26,569
There's something I want to tell you.

26
00:03:27,601 --> 00:03:30,935
Instead of not being able to
forget the event 13 years ago...

27
00:03:31,801 --> 00:03:34,001
...more so than I'm happy
to have met you again...

28
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:35,835
...there's something else
I really want to say...

29
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:40,368
I don't believe in your words.

30
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:53,168
I'm sorry.

31
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:03,634
Don't die.

32
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,635
Tell me when the wave hits 200.

33
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,001
It's ready.

34
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:10,968
Step aside.

35
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,534
Three, two, one.

36
00:04:14,715 --> 00:04:16,982
I shouldn't have said that back then...

37
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:18,968
I have to rescue you and save
you if I believe in your words.

38
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:20,334
If I can't,
it's going to be all my fault...

39
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:23,201
...and I'll blame myself for it.
I can't handle that.

40
00:04:24,334 --> 00:04:25,401
Charge it again.

41
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:27,001
One ampoule please.

42
00:04:29,267 --> 00:04:31,101
You must've been really hurt...

43
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:34,668
You must've blamed yourself
for things you can't handle...

44
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:36,301
Can you handle that?

45
00:04:37,734 --> 00:04:38,668
No.

46
00:04:38,968 --> 00:04:39,495
Step aside.

47
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:41,001
Three, two, one.

48
00:04:43,234 --> 00:04:44,901
I said such mean things to you.

49
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:47,401
Don't die.

50
00:04:47,467 --> 00:04:48,467
I regret it.

51
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:58,567
If this is the last time...

52
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:01,467
...then you will blame yourself
because of what happened to me.

53
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:03,300
I'm concerned for you.

54
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:07,400
You'll need this later.

55
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:10,101
Thanks.

56
00:05:12,868 --> 00:05:13,901
Back then...

57
00:05:14,934 --> 00:05:17,468
I should've just taken the umbrella
without saying anything.

58
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:29,001
This won't do...

59
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:31,568
I have to...

60
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,635
...apologize to you.

61
00:05:45,801 --> 00:05:46,868
His pulse is back.

62
00:05:46,968 --> 00:05:49,202
He's going to go into surgery,
so call the anesthesia.

63
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:50,434
Check his blood pressure.

64
00:06:12,968 --> 00:06:18,836
"A boy meets a girl"

65
00:06:20,334 --> 00:06:22,868
Around 9 PM near
the intersection in Hayeon-dong...

66
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:24,836
...a prosecutor was shot by Mr. Yoo...

67
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:27,288
...a 73 year old man,
and was heavily injured.

68
00:06:27,601 --> 00:06:30,102
The prosecutor has been
transferred to a hospital...

69
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,734
...and currently undergoing a surgery.

70
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:34,634
-Mr. Yoo...
-Hongjoo.

71
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:37,368
He's known as the professional
archer Yoo Sookyung's father.

72
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:39,500
The police said her father was unhappy...

73
00:06:39,601 --> 00:06:43,102
...with the result of investigation
in which the suspect was freed.

74
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:46,534
It is deemed that this fact
drove him to commit such crime.

75
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:10,334
Why is it taking so long?
It's already been over four hours.

76
00:07:10,434 --> 00:07:11,701
Sit down and wait.

77
00:07:11,868 --> 00:07:13,901
The doctor said it may take a while.

78
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:17,500
This is crazy... Why is it taking so long?

79
00:07:41,868 --> 00:07:44,268
He'll be more worried if he saw you.

80
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:47,734
Sit down and wait.
I'll go get a band aid for you.

81
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:07,502
The future may change.

82
00:08:07,868 --> 00:08:10,602
Look at Jaechan,
he saved both you and me.

83
00:08:10,734 --> 00:08:13,034
If he can change it, so can I.

84
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,233
You can't, you can never do it.

85
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:21,735
Hongjoo.

86
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:24,435
Hongjoo.

87
00:08:27,534 --> 00:08:28,634
Mom...

88
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,901
Hongjoo, are you okay?

89
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,101
You were right...

90
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:37,901
I couldn't change it.

91
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:41,268
No, I did change it, but...

92
00:08:42,868 --> 00:08:46,569
It got worse...

93
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:50,834
What if something bad
happens to Jaechan?

94
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,801
What am I going to do?

95
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,667
What if something that happened
to dad happens to him...

96
00:08:57,033 --> 00:08:57,934
No...

97
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,534
Don't say those things.

98
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:02,868
That's not going to happen.
You shouldn't say those things.

99
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,500
The surgery has yet to end...

100
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:10,635
It's already been four hours...

101
00:09:17,267 --> 00:09:18,201
Hongjoo.

102
00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:20,301
The surgery is over.

103
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:25,734
They just finished.

104
00:09:26,501 --> 00:09:29,435
The surgery went well and
the results are good as well.

105
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:33,235
Are you serious?

106
00:09:34,334 --> 00:09:35,668
You're not lying, right?

107
00:09:35,934 --> 00:09:37,768
I heard it directly from the doctor.

108
00:09:38,267 --> 00:09:39,367
He's fine now.

109
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:42,300
That's a relief...

110
00:09:45,434 --> 00:09:47,634
My goodness. Hongjoo.

111
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:49,135
Lieutenant Han...

112
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,068
Hongjoo.

113
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:52,600
Hongjoo.

114
00:10:06,634 --> 00:10:07,502
What in the world...

115
00:10:07,601 --> 00:10:10,469
He used a gun. This is not America.

116
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,301
Where did he get the gun?

117
00:10:12,634 --> 00:10:14,201
He had a gun license.

118
00:10:14,267 --> 00:10:17,168
He used the shotgun
from the patrol station.

119
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,767
Chief redistributed
Prosecutor Jung's cases.

120
00:10:19,868 --> 00:10:22,235
You got injury cases,
you got fraud cases...

121
00:10:22,434 --> 00:10:23,768
...and you got attempted rape cases.

122
00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:28,935
Hyangmi, are you crying?

123
00:10:29,534 --> 00:10:31,435
Yes, I'm crying.

124
00:10:31,534 --> 00:10:32,824
I'm crying because I'm happy.

125
00:10:32,901 --> 00:10:36,449
I'm crying because I'm happy from no
more unfinished cases and working late.

126
00:10:36,534 --> 00:10:40,567
I'm so happy that I don't
have to see Prosecutor Jung.

127
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:42,901
Are you happy? Are you satisfied?

128
00:10:46,801 --> 00:10:48,282
Prosecutor Jung...

129
00:10:48,367 --> 00:10:49,634
What's with her?

130
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:51,167
I thought she didn't like Prosecutor Jung?

131
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:53,168
Now that I look at her,
she likes him a lot.

132
00:10:53,234 --> 00:10:54,202
She's in love.

133
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,734
It's shallow.

134
00:10:56,501 --> 00:10:57,901
She's going to hate him soon.

135
00:11:05,267 --> 00:11:06,135
This girl...

136
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,934
You were like this when
your father passed away...

137
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:15,168
Are you awake?

138
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:21,401
Mom, where's Jaechan?

139
00:11:21,467 --> 00:11:24,201
The surgery went well
and he's now in the ICU.

140
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,101
Seungwon called earlier.

141
00:11:27,701 --> 00:11:29,068
You can't see him even
if you went right now.

142
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:31,582
The ICU has limited visiting hours.

143
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:32,434
Still...

144
00:11:32,534 --> 00:11:33,575
You should eat first.

145
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:35,134
You won't be late for
going after you eat.

146
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:40,901
When are the visiting hours?

147
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,834
11 AM.

148
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,869
You have plenty of time,
so take your time.

149
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:52,634
By the way, Seungwon told
me to give this to you.

150
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,200
What's this?

151
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,467
I think Prosecutor Jung...

152
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,034
...wanted to meet with you
yesterday to give this to you...

153
00:12:03,033 --> 00:12:06,834
How did he know that
your nickname is Chestnut?

154
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:10,567
What do you mean?

155
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:14,234
He came to me out of
the blue and asked me that.

156
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:15,967
Oh my, that scared me.

157
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:19,934
By any chance,
was Hongjoo's nickname Chestnut?

158
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:23,134
Did you tell him?

159
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,335
No.

160
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:29,567
How did he know?
That nickname was from about 10 years ago.

161
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:47,101
"My father said that anger makes it hard
to do the right thing."

162
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:48,501
"From Chestnut"

163
00:13:16,634 --> 00:13:17,834
It was you.

164
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:20,834
Chestnut.

165
00:13:33,901 --> 00:13:35,502
Why haven't I realized?

166
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,033
I wonder.

167
00:13:58,701 --> 00:14:00,035
Do you remember me?

168
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:02,834
Yes.

169
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:05,233
I do.

170
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,200
I've missed you for a really long time.

171
00:14:16,834 --> 00:14:18,101
I was worried...

172
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,201
...that you'd never wake up again.

173
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:30,335
I was worried that...

174
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:37,935
...you would blame yourself after
what I've said in the subway...

175
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,400
I'm sorry.

176
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:45,268
No need to be sorry.

177
00:15:14,701 --> 00:15:18,635
I never imagined that you were a woman.

178
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:20,421
A woman?

179
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:21,901
What are you talking about?

180
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:23,434
I thought...

181
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:26,368
...you were a man.

182
00:15:26,434 --> 00:15:27,968
I am a man.

183
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:30,634
What's wrong with him?
He's talking nonsense.

184
00:15:31,467 --> 00:15:33,201
He's showing symptoms of unclear mindsets.

185
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,402
What's that?

186
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:39,168
It's temporary situation which happens
right after a surgery.

187
00:15:39,234 --> 00:15:42,234
But he'll come back to being
normal after a day so don't worry.

188
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:44,935
Whatever he says right
now doesn't mean anything.

189
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,300
So don't take it personally.

190
00:15:46,434 --> 00:15:49,601
He's not going to remember
anything he says later.

191
00:15:49,701 --> 00:15:51,768
Oh, really?

192
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:56,702
Don't go.

193
00:15:57,767 --> 00:15:58,967
I still have so much to tell you.

194
00:15:59,067 --> 00:16:01,434
You can just respond to him.

195
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:03,367
Gosh...

196
00:16:04,934 --> 00:16:05,868
Fine...

197
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,667
Tell me, I'll listen to everything.

198
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:09,468
Now...

199
00:16:15,801 --> 00:16:16,702
I'm sorry.

200
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:19,801
I should've just taken the umbrella
from you...

201
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:24,835
...when we were at the subway.

202
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:30,101
How's Prosecutor Jung doing?

203
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,416
Is he awake?

204
00:16:31,501 --> 00:16:35,534
He is awake, but not yet fully awake.

205
00:16:35,634 --> 00:16:38,901
He can't tell between genders.
He thinks I'm a woman.

206
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,167
Did he hurt his head?

207
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:41,868
No, it's the usual side
effects of anesthesia.

208
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:44,168
I had a surgery in middle school.
I asked my dad...

209
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:47,068
...to smoke with me when I woke up,
so he almost beat me to death.

210
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:53,034
Anyways, it looks like it'll take about
a month for him to fully recover.

211
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,534
But it looks like
Prosecutor Son isn't around.

212
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:10,279
Is he still unconscious?

213
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:11,767
Yea, still unconscious.

214
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:13,200
He has advanced pancreatic cancer.

215
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,234
He may die before he gets prosecuted.

216
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,901
I guess he wanted to get revenge
since he was going to die anyways.

217
00:17:20,267 --> 00:17:21,601
You two are cops, right?

218
00:17:22,701 --> 00:17:24,302
How did you know?

219
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,734
I know all the cops and prosecutors.

220
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:29,467
Why are you guys here?

221
00:17:29,607 --> 00:17:31,048
Is there a bad person inside?

222
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,834
Yes. We caught a bad person,
but he's hurting a lot.

223
00:17:34,934 --> 00:17:37,868
So, does that mean he's under
investigation without physical detention?

224
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,001
All the best.

225
00:17:43,534 --> 00:17:44,335
Wow.

226
00:17:44,434 --> 00:17:46,501
How does a kid like him
know about such things?

227
00:17:51,767 --> 00:17:53,034
What floor?

228
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,433
13th floor.

229
00:17:58,367 --> 00:18:01,268
Did you get into a car accident
or did you fall?

230
00:18:01,934 --> 00:18:03,899
I got beat up by my professor.

231
00:18:03,968 --> 00:18:05,902
You can charge him with
an injury crime if it's this bad.

232
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,600
Would you like for me to report him?

233
00:18:09,534 --> 00:18:11,701
No, I'll do it.

234
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,333
You have to.

235
00:18:16,534 --> 00:18:17,701
You must.

236
00:18:18,434 --> 00:18:19,467
Chanho.

237
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:20,967
Mother.

238
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,834
Where were you?

239
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:28,801
My prince...

240
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:45,367
Hey, I saw the news.

241
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,901
I heard your brother got shot.

242
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,967
Is he okay?

243
00:18:49,033 --> 00:18:51,934
Yoo Sookyung's father must
be completely retarded.

244
00:18:52,067 --> 00:18:54,100
Tell us in detail. Why did he shoot him?

245
00:18:57,501 --> 00:18:58,202
What's this?

246
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:02,600
What's this?

247
00:19:03,334 --> 00:19:05,568
Is he ignoring our gesture of apology?

248
00:19:19,234 --> 00:19:21,868
Are you here to be investigated
by Prosecutor Shin?

249
00:19:22,234 --> 00:19:22,901
Yes.

250
00:19:22,968 --> 00:19:23,869
Me too.

251
00:19:24,901 --> 00:19:27,735
Prosecutor Shin probably wants us to
take part in confronting investigation.

252
00:19:40,601 --> 00:19:42,102
How's Prosecutor Jung doing?

253
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:43,200
Is visitation allowed?

254
00:19:43,601 --> 00:19:46,701
He'll be out of ICU today,
so you should stop by.

255
00:19:46,801 --> 00:19:47,801
He's recovering quickly.

256
00:19:47,901 --> 00:19:49,502
That's good.

257
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:53,967
Shall we begin?

258
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,500
Sure.

259
00:19:55,834 --> 00:19:57,982
Yoo Sookyung's mother said that...

260
00:19:58,067 --> 00:20:02,901
...Attorney Lee sent these
pictures to Yoo Manho.

261
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:04,176
Is this correct?

262
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:05,934
Yes, I've sent them.

263
00:20:06,067 --> 00:20:07,267
After seeing these pictures...

264
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:10,115
...he got mad and shot Prosecutor Jung.

265
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,734
He misunderstood that
Prosecutor Jung were closely connected...

266
00:20:12,868 --> 00:20:15,202
...to Lieutenant Han and Hakyoung.

267
00:20:16,467 --> 00:20:17,667
Is that a misunderstanding?

268
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,400
Is that a misunderstanding?

269
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,233
Wootak, aren't you quite
close with Prosecutor Jung?

270
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,734
Yes, I am.

271
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,301
See?

272
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,716
That's not a misunderstanding,
but a suspicion.

273
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:32,702
Because they're close,
he could've requested something.

274
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:34,315
It's a very reasonable suspicion...

275
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,268
...that he could've asked Jaechan
to take care of his friend.

276
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:39,968
Have you made a request
to Prosecutor Jung?

277
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:43,158
I told him that Hakyoung
would never kill a person.

278
00:20:43,234 --> 00:20:44,668
See? He did do it.

279
00:20:46,567 --> 00:20:48,535
That's when Prosecutor Jung said that.

280
00:20:48,601 --> 00:20:49,835
How can you be certain?

281
00:20:49,934 --> 00:20:53,034
You can't be sure of something
until the investigation is over.

282
00:20:53,734 --> 00:20:55,568
Whether he's guilty or innocent...

283
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:57,667
He said it so straightforwardly
that I felt a little hurt.

284
00:20:57,767 --> 00:21:02,735
I also know him well and he's a bit
rude sometimes but he's warmhearted.

285
00:21:02,801 --> 00:21:05,702
So, I'm sure it must've bothered
him even when he said it like that.

286
00:21:06,367 --> 00:21:08,834
Let's also think from
Yoo Manho's perspective.

287
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,134
His beloved daughter suddenly died.

288
00:21:11,434 --> 00:21:13,834
His daughter died and yet
the prosecutor did nothing.

289
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,601
Hakyoung was his prime suspect
and yet he freed him without any charges.

290
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,001
And it turns out that...

291
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:24,502
...the prosecutor's friend is close with
Hakyoung and made a request to him.

292
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:25,934
It's crazy.

293
00:21:26,234 --> 00:21:27,501
How could it not be driving you crazy?

294
00:21:27,601 --> 00:21:30,768
He's not just free of charges.

295
00:21:30,868 --> 00:21:32,802
The evidence came out
to be the robot vacuum.

296
00:21:32,901 --> 00:21:35,968
Her blood was found in the robot vacuum.

297
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:37,968
Someone could've fabricated it.

298
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,700
It's easy to set someone free...

299
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:47,501
...if a prosecutor helps with forging
some documents with the police.

300
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,834
Is such forging even possible?

301
00:21:54,801 --> 00:21:56,635
It is if a prosecutor wants it.

302
00:21:56,868 --> 00:21:57,669
Really?

303
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:03,168
Prosecutors can forge
documents if he wants to?

304
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:09,301
No, I would never imagine that happening.

305
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,334
It looks like you may have
forged documents...

306
00:22:12,434 --> 00:22:13,834
...when you used to be a prosecutor.

307
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:22,201
Is that why you gave him the pictures?

308
00:22:23,234 --> 00:22:24,801
Because you thought Prosecutor Jung...

309
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,201
...may have forged documents
like how you did in the past?

310
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:38,435
Wow, everyone is my enemy.

311
00:22:39,767 --> 00:22:40,867
Hey, Miss Shin.

312
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,533
No, Prosecutor Shin.

313
00:22:45,267 --> 00:22:47,068
Is this really a witness investigation?

314
00:22:51,467 --> 00:22:54,234
Why is everyone investigating
me for Yoo Manho's crimes?

315
00:22:54,601 --> 00:22:55,801
Did I fire the shots?

316
00:22:55,901 --> 00:22:57,368
Did I aid or abet the murder?

317
00:22:57,434 --> 00:22:59,601
"Aid and abet: To assist another in the
conduct of a crime by words or conduct"

318
00:22:59,701 --> 00:23:01,168
What's my crime?

319
00:23:01,534 --> 00:23:04,135
There's nothing. You're innocent by law.

320
00:23:04,234 --> 00:23:07,534
If I'm innocent,
why am I being investigated like this?

321
00:23:08,701 --> 00:23:11,235
The person who shot him
is going to die soon...

322
00:23:11,334 --> 00:23:13,801
...so the right of arraignment is invalid
and the prosecution will drop.

323
00:23:13,868 --> 00:23:15,202
So why...!

324
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,201
Why are you bothering so much?

325
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:23,368
Prosecutor Shin.

326
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,934
Someone was shot and almost killed.

327
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,133
Do you think...

328
00:23:29,901 --> 00:23:31,835
...a prosecutor can just ignore this case?

329
00:23:32,601 --> 00:23:35,335
Why did Yoo Manho shoot him?

330
00:23:35,467 --> 00:23:39,335
I thought it was necessary to make note
of what kind of person Attorney Lee is.

331
00:23:39,434 --> 00:23:43,035
That's why I'm investigating you.

332
00:23:48,701 --> 00:23:52,435
Lee Yoobum is a scary person.

333
00:23:52,501 --> 00:23:54,302
It looks like Yoo Manho shot him...

334
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,368
...but Attorney Lee seems
to be the guilty one.

335
00:24:02,868 --> 00:24:04,168
Attorney Lee.

336
00:24:07,667 --> 00:24:08,368
Your phone.

337
00:24:09,167 --> 00:24:10,883
I almost forgot. Thank you.

338
00:24:10,968 --> 00:24:12,489
Thank you for today.

339
00:24:12,567 --> 00:24:13,667
Have a good one.

340
00:24:13,801 --> 00:24:19,168
Mr. Choi, would you like to come
for a manager's position in our office?

341
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:25,235
I'm fine, but I have few others
who would like to be referred out...

342
00:24:25,334 --> 00:24:27,001
I want you and not anybody else.

343
00:24:27,734 --> 00:24:31,468
I always feel like the bad guy
whenever I see you here.

344
00:24:33,334 --> 00:24:36,367
You were always on my side
when I used to work with you.

345
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:39,568
You never thought I made
the wrong decision.

346
00:24:40,734 --> 00:24:41,767
That's true...

347
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:45,268
That's why I'm scared now.

348
00:24:47,133 --> 00:24:52,500
I'm scared and wondering if I've
also forged anything back then...

349
00:25:16,334 --> 00:25:17,202
Excuse me.

350
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:19,767
Is a patient named
Jung Jaechan not here yet?

351
00:25:19,868 --> 00:25:22,035
He came here from ICU yesterday...

352
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:24,234
Maybe he went to exercise.

353
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:26,533
Can I wait in here?

354
00:25:26,634 --> 00:25:27,634
Of course.

355
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:33,634
I must be crazy.

356
00:25:33,934 --> 00:25:36,568
How could I come without
putting on any makeup?

357
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,801
What nonsense is that?

358
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:55,200
I called chief a woman?

359
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,500
He can't come in now.
It's so even right now...

360
00:25:58,601 --> 00:26:00,068
That's nonsense.

361
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:09,734
You touched his face and
said that you were sorry.

362
00:26:10,234 --> 00:26:12,568
No way.
I'm not like that.

363
00:26:13,567 --> 00:26:15,334
You were.

364
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,433
I thought you were in love with him.

365
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,635
Hey, that's so creepy...

366
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,268
Why don't you move
to a different hospital?

367
00:26:24,367 --> 00:26:25,834
Why?
It's nice here.

368
00:26:25,934 --> 00:26:29,334
Yoo Manho,
the person who shot you...

369
00:26:30,567 --> 00:26:31,934
He's in this hospital.

370
00:26:35,267 --> 00:26:37,235
Why here when there's so many hospitals?

371
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,134
I don't think they knew
both were admitted...

372
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,801
...to this hospital back then
when things were so hectic.

373
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,769
Yes, let's move hospitals.

374
00:26:44,868 --> 00:26:45,736
I don't want to.

375
00:26:46,901 --> 00:26:48,101
It's better this way.

376
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,449
Which room is he staying?
I should go talk to him.

377
00:26:51,534 --> 00:26:53,182
He can't talk, so what are you
going to talk to him about?

378
00:26:53,267 --> 00:26:55,235
He's in critical condition right now,
so he may die any time soon.

379
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:55,767
Really?

380
00:26:55,834 --> 00:26:57,501
Then, I should go today or tomorrow.

381
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,267
I have to ask him why he shot me.

382
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:01,834
You already know why he shot you.

383
00:27:01,901 --> 00:27:04,335
It's because you freed
Do Hakyoung with no charges...

384
00:27:04,434 --> 00:27:06,201
Do Hakyoung is not the culprit.

385
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,801
But Yoo Manho didn't
know and was angry so...

386
00:27:08,868 --> 00:27:10,469
He's allowed to shoot
because he didn't know?

387
00:27:10,968 --> 00:27:12,569
He can kill someone if he doesn't know?

388
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,776
I have to meet with him.

389
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,268
I have to let him know that anger
can't justify him to kill before he dies.

390
00:27:27,534 --> 00:27:29,468
Why would I save him
when I hate him so much?

391
00:27:29,567 --> 00:27:31,234
You're going to let him die
just because you hate him?

392
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:32,869
You call that a reason?

393
00:27:32,934 --> 00:27:36,601
Yes, I hate him so just let him die!

394
00:27:58,968 --> 00:27:59,769
Wootak.

395
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,597
You came to visit?

396
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:05,001
Yes, but why aren't you going in?

397
00:28:05,968 --> 00:28:06,802
Just because...

398
00:28:09,167 --> 00:28:10,035
Wootak.

399
00:28:10,534 --> 00:28:11,201
Yes?

400
00:28:12,167 --> 00:28:15,401
People say that ignorance is bliss.

401
00:28:16,067 --> 00:28:16,801
Yes.

402
00:28:16,968 --> 00:28:18,302
If ignorance is bliss...

403
00:28:18,701 --> 00:28:21,701
...then should I just pretend
I don't know anything and lie?

404
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,801
Do you think you can lie until the end?

405
00:28:26,033 --> 00:28:27,001
I don't know...

406
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,301
Maybe?

407
00:28:30,701 --> 00:28:33,602
If you can lie until the end,
they say that's not a lie.

408
00:28:34,767 --> 00:28:36,167
So try pretending you don't know.

409
00:28:36,467 --> 00:28:37,266
That's surprising.

410
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:39,201
I thought you would tell
me to do the opposite.

411
00:28:39,434 --> 00:28:40,135
How so?

412
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,133
Because you have such a good-guy image.

413
00:28:43,234 --> 00:28:44,935
You're polite and have
a good personality.

414
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,434
You're right.

415
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,027
Thanks.

416
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,120
You always tell me what I want to hear.

417
00:28:52,367 --> 00:28:53,134
Really?

418
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:56,452
Let's go together.
Jaechan must be waiting.

419
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:59,634
No, after thinking about it,
I think it's best that I don't go.

420
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:00,468
Why not?

421
00:29:00,534 --> 00:29:04,235
People think we're close and assume
he easily let go of Hakyoung.

422
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:07,502
I don't think I should
see him for a while.

423
00:29:08,968 --> 00:29:10,001
You should go.

424
00:29:12,367 --> 00:29:13,701
Tell him I said hi.

425
00:29:13,968 --> 00:29:16,101
Okay, I'll see you later.

426
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,101
Okay.

427
00:30:14,934 --> 00:30:16,101
Why did you come so late?

428
00:30:16,868 --> 00:30:18,635
I missed you so much...

429
00:30:32,334 --> 00:30:34,168
Men are animals.

430
00:30:44,434 --> 00:30:46,035
What in the world...

431
00:30:51,701 --> 00:30:52,669
Hyangmi.

432
00:30:52,868 --> 00:30:53,968
Hyangmi.

433
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,701
The person you are hugging is Hyangmi.

434
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,968
Prosecutor Jung.

435
00:31:02,501 --> 00:31:03,469
No...

436
00:31:04,534 --> 00:31:06,682
Should I call you Jaechan now?

437
00:31:06,767 --> 00:31:08,767
No, Hyangmi...

438
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:18,435
I'm sorry I'm late.

439
00:31:18,534 --> 00:31:20,435
I didn't know you were waiting for me...

440
00:31:21,501 --> 00:31:22,335
This isn't right...

441
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,268
He gets it so you should look
around and get away from him...

442
00:31:25,367 --> 00:31:26,801
You don't know anything so back off.

443
00:31:26,901 --> 00:31:27,802
I get it so get off of him.

444
00:31:27,901 --> 00:31:30,135
It hurts...

445
00:31:30,234 --> 00:31:32,568
Hongjoo,
this is all a misunderstanding.

446
00:31:32,667 --> 00:31:34,134
You know that, right?

447
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,622
Misunderstanding?

448
00:31:39,534 --> 00:31:40,435
Hongjoo.

449
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,935
You're Hyangmi, right?
I'll apologize first.

450
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,168
My mother said that...

451
00:31:47,267 --> 00:31:50,467
...misunderstandings occur
when people lack understanding.

452
00:31:50,567 --> 00:31:51,468
Today's misunderstanding...

453
00:31:51,567 --> 00:31:55,801
...occurred only because Jaechan
and I have a misunderstanding.

454
00:31:56,167 --> 00:32:02,467
We'll work on it so that this kind
of thing won't ever happen again.

455
00:32:02,934 --> 00:32:04,835
So please let go of him.

456
00:32:10,467 --> 00:32:13,093
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

457
00:32:14,501 --> 00:32:17,068
Why did you do something
you'd be sorry for?

458
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:18,901
Why did you do it?

459
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,214
Let's get out of here.

460
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,100
Are you Nam Hongjoo
from Hongjoo Pork Belly?

461
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,467
Yes, I am.

462
00:32:28,534 --> 00:32:31,235
Does this scarf belong to you?

463
00:32:48,868 --> 00:32:52,769
She's really pretty
and very intelligent...

464
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,100
She's a total femme fatale style.

465
00:32:58,701 --> 00:32:59,541
Here you go.

466
00:32:59,701 --> 00:33:00,635
Thank you.

467
00:33:03,868 --> 00:33:04,836
Yes...

468
00:33:04,934 --> 00:33:08,934
She's finally here to see him,
so we should get going.

469
00:33:09,019 --> 00:33:10,486
Please get well soon.

470
00:33:10,968 --> 00:33:12,602
-Let's go.
-I don't care if you get well or not.

471
00:33:12,701 --> 00:33:15,502
-Thanks for coming. Thank you.
-Let's go.

472
00:33:18,467 --> 00:33:20,268
Let's go.

473
00:33:26,501 --> 00:33:29,634
You guys looked so alike from the back.

474
00:33:30,334 --> 00:33:33,501
Or maybe I'm still recovering
from the anesthesia.

475
00:33:33,601 --> 00:33:35,431
I'm still seeing things...

476
00:33:35,501 --> 00:33:36,835
That's enough.

477
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:39,368
It gets weirder
when you give more excuses.

478
00:33:39,734 --> 00:33:40,568
Okay.

479
00:33:44,501 --> 00:33:46,268
Did you get the ring?

480
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,268
Yes.

481
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:50,245
I also put in the note that you wrote.

482
00:33:50,334 --> 00:33:51,367
Did you see it?

483
00:33:51,601 --> 00:33:53,402
I wrote that?

484
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:59,001
You wrote it to me 13 years ago.
Don't you remember?

485
00:33:59,734 --> 00:34:03,268
We met each other before?
And it was 13 years ago?

486
00:34:05,767 --> 00:34:07,767
Your father was killed because
of a soldier who ran away, right?

487
00:34:08,033 --> 00:34:08,800
Yes.

488
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,001
I also lost my father from
a solider that ran away.

489
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,233
And that's how we met at the funeral.

490
00:34:13,334 --> 00:34:14,835
Do you seriously don't remember?

491
00:34:15,634 --> 00:34:17,667
I don't know. I don't remember...

492
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,334
Do you remember me?

493
00:34:21,033 --> 00:34:21,767
Yes.

494
00:34:22,968 --> 00:34:24,035
I do.

495
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,716
I don't even remember
things from a month ago...

496
00:34:28,801 --> 00:34:31,035
...so how should I remember
something from 13 years ago?

497
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,834
It's normal that I don't remember.

498
00:34:34,467 --> 00:34:37,210
You told me that you
remembered from the ICU.

499
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,435
I've never been to the ICU.

500
00:34:39,501 --> 00:34:41,701
No way.
I'm sure I saw you.

501
00:34:41,801 --> 00:34:43,502
Were you hallucinating?

502
00:34:43,767 --> 00:34:45,601
They say you see things after the surgery.

503
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,067
Maybe that's what happened to you.

504
00:34:51,434 --> 00:34:53,368
I'm sorry that I can't remember.

505
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,233
You can't sleep?

506
00:35:23,434 --> 00:35:25,135
Do you remember Chestnut?

507
00:35:25,334 --> 00:35:27,202
The one you met at father's funeral?

508
00:35:27,267 --> 00:35:28,068
Yes.

509
00:35:30,067 --> 00:35:33,768
That Chestnut is Nam Hongjoo...

510
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:35,367
I thought he was a guy?

511
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:36,634
She wasn't.

512
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:39,034
Does she know that you two met before?

513
00:35:39,334 --> 00:35:41,434
Yes, she does...

514
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:42,901
But not really.

515
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,033
What do you mean?

516
00:35:46,667 --> 00:35:49,034
She said it's been so long
that she doesn't remember.

517
00:35:50,033 --> 00:35:51,400
How could that be?

518
00:35:51,501 --> 00:35:52,601
How could she not remember that?

519
00:35:52,701 --> 00:35:54,202
I thought it was only one day?

520
00:35:54,701 --> 00:35:55,669
She may have forgotten.

521
00:35:55,767 --> 00:35:59,268
I remember every minute
and second of that day...

522
00:36:00,701 --> 00:36:02,801
Maybe it wasn't anything special to her.

523
00:36:05,434 --> 00:36:07,201
Not that it wasn't anything special...

524
00:36:07,467 --> 00:36:10,301
Maybe her memory is not as great as yours.

525
00:36:12,834 --> 00:36:13,768
Seungwon.

526
00:36:13,934 --> 00:36:14,568
Yes?

527
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,168
Turn off the lights.

528
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:18,568
I want to sleep...

529
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,734
You should've told me before I sat down.

530
00:36:37,968 --> 00:36:40,435
"Seogu University Hospital"

531
00:36:51,701 --> 00:36:54,168
By any chance,
is Yoo Manho admitted here?

532
00:36:54,267 --> 00:36:55,768
Can I help you?

533
00:36:55,934 --> 00:36:58,435
I'm Prosecutor Jung from
Han River Prosecutor's Office.

534
00:36:58,534 --> 00:37:00,435
I need to talk to Yoo Manho.

535
00:37:00,501 --> 00:37:03,568
Yoo Manho's prosecutor
is Prosecutor Shin.

536
00:37:03,634 --> 00:37:06,734
We're in the same division.
She's my junior at school.

537
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:08,901
You have to show your ID.

538
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,434
You can't just say that
you're a prosecutor.

539
00:37:14,534 --> 00:37:15,368
Who are you?

540
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:18,034
Impersonating a prosecutor
can be a serious crime.

541
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,034
You can be put in jail for up to
three years and 7 million won fine.

542
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,901
Don't you know that?

543
00:37:22,267 --> 00:37:25,883
I do, you punk.
That's Criminal Law Article 128.

544
00:37:25,968 --> 00:37:26,936
Article 118.

545
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,801
Yes, 118. Of course I know.

546
00:37:29,901 --> 00:37:31,201
You are impersonating.

547
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,433
What kind of prosecutor
gets confused with that?

548
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:38,734
Can I see him if his prosecutor comes?

549
00:37:38,801 --> 00:37:39,602
Yes.

550
00:37:39,701 --> 00:37:40,602
Okay.

551
00:37:45,834 --> 00:37:47,501
"Shin Heemin"

552
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:52,100
Hi Prosecutor Shin.
It's me, Prosecutor Jung.

553
00:37:54,467 --> 00:37:55,335
I know.

554
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,368
I know you're Prosecutor Jung,
so no need to speak so loudly.

555
00:37:59,501 --> 00:38:02,598
You didn't forget that I want to
meet with Yoo Manho, right?

556
00:38:02,667 --> 00:38:05,416
I know. I'll go after work later.

557
00:38:05,501 --> 00:38:06,402
Bye.

558
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,502
You have to come.
I'm sorry for bothering you.

559
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:11,068
I'm really sorry, but you have to come.

560
00:38:11,133 --> 00:38:12,500
I said okay.

561
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,368
If you know you're sorry,
you shouldn't be calling.

562
00:38:16,434 --> 00:38:17,901
Exactly.

563
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,834
Why would he do something
if he knows he's sorry?

564
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:23,535
Why!

565
00:38:25,467 --> 00:38:26,467
You were right.

566
00:38:26,767 --> 00:38:29,767
She really turned just like you said.

567
00:38:30,067 --> 00:38:32,701
Just wait.
She'll become his fan again.

568
00:38:32,901 --> 00:38:33,968
"Prosecutor Lee"

569
00:38:36,367 --> 00:38:37,634
Yes, Prosecutor Lee?

570
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:40,969
Hyangmi, I'm here to
visit Prosecutor Jung.

571
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:42,416
Do you know which room he's staying in?

572
00:38:42,501 --> 00:38:43,735
I don't know.

573
00:38:43,834 --> 00:38:45,635
I'm not working for
Prosecutor Jung starting today...

574
00:38:45,734 --> 00:38:47,834
...and I work for Prosecutor Shin instead.

575
00:38:50,801 --> 00:38:53,101
Why is she so mean?

576
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:57,502
How am I going to find him?

577
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,233
It's Ms. Son.

578
00:39:00,367 --> 00:39:02,367
Ms. Son! Ms. Son!

579
00:39:05,067 --> 00:39:06,134
Ms. Son!

580
00:39:06,434 --> 00:39:08,682
Ms. Son! Ms. Son!

581
00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:09,967
Ms. Son!

582
00:39:12,734 --> 00:39:14,168
Look who it is.

583
00:39:14,767 --> 00:39:17,067
I didn't expect to see you here.

584
00:39:17,567 --> 00:39:19,234
Did you not hear me
when I was calling you?

585
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,367
No, not at all.

586
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,702
What are you doing here?

587
00:39:22,801 --> 00:39:25,335
Why would I be here?
I'm here to visit Jaechan.

588
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,233
Aren't you here to visit Jaechan as well?

589
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,101
I'm...

590
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,134
Mother.

591
00:39:33,701 --> 00:39:34,602
Chanho.

592
00:39:34,701 --> 00:39:35,834
Is he your son?

593
00:39:35,901 --> 00:39:36,602
Yea.

594
00:39:36,868 --> 00:39:40,335
Chanho, say hi. He's my co-worker...

595
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,867
Hello. Prosecutor Lee.

596
00:39:41,968 --> 00:39:43,268
I've heard a lot about you.

597
00:39:43,367 --> 00:39:46,335
You look so smart.

598
00:39:48,567 --> 00:39:51,134
Is he sick?

599
00:39:54,234 --> 00:39:56,001
He has chronic renal failure.

600
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,367
He passed out from anemia
when he was 8 years old...

601
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:03,934
...so he got it checked.

602
00:40:04,534 --> 00:40:06,135
They told me that he had kidney failure.

603
00:40:06,868 --> 00:40:11,001
He's been going through
dialysis for 3 to 4 times a week...

604
00:40:11,601 --> 00:40:13,935
...until recently he's been getting worse
and has to go through it every day.

605
00:40:16,033 --> 00:40:18,901
We're now waiting for transplants
because that's the only option.

606
00:40:19,801 --> 00:40:21,268
But it's been difficult.

607
00:40:24,267 --> 00:40:25,934
I had no idea
since you never said anything.

608
00:40:26,734 --> 00:40:30,235
Whenever it rained before...

609
00:40:32,601 --> 00:40:35,135
I used to think,
"Oh, no, I just had a car wash."

610
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:38,601
"Did I bring an umbrella?"

611
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,934
Those were the things
which I used to think of.

612
00:40:41,934 --> 00:40:46,468
But do you know what I think
now that my son is sick?

613
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:52,567
There must be a lot of
accidents due to the rain.

614
00:40:53,934 --> 00:40:58,268
I wonder if there's anyone dead...

615
00:40:59,033 --> 00:41:01,400
...from the accident that may
be able to transplant a kidney.

616
00:41:03,133 --> 00:41:05,333
I wish for those things
while watching the rain.

617
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:22,067
The sound of ambulance
means someone is hurt...

618
00:41:23,334 --> 00:41:26,235
That it's a tragedy for someone...

619
00:41:28,367 --> 00:41:34,201
But for someone like me,
it's a sound of small hope.

620
00:41:38,367 --> 00:41:40,168
I must be terrible.

621
00:41:41,567 --> 00:41:42,401
No.

622
00:41:44,868 --> 00:41:45,802
You're not...

623
00:41:48,367 --> 00:41:49,801
Please pretend that you don't know.

624
00:41:50,801 --> 00:41:54,435
I don't want to think about
this terrible thing while working.

625
00:41:55,934 --> 00:41:57,967
Yes. Of course.

626
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,268
Sir.

627
00:42:09,234 --> 00:42:11,601
Were you in the ICU
recently due to a gun shot?

628
00:42:12,067 --> 00:42:12,768
Yes.

629
00:42:13,634 --> 00:42:16,468
-This was near your bed.
-I see.

630
00:42:19,968 --> 00:42:21,001
It's an earring.

631
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,667
Are you teasing me?

632
00:42:37,868 --> 00:42:39,968
I'm been eating terrible food here
for the past few days.

633
00:42:40,067 --> 00:42:41,167
Oh, that's right.

634
00:42:41,367 --> 00:42:42,634
I didn't think of that.

635
00:42:42,767 --> 00:42:45,167
Should I eat outside and come back?

636
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,234
Just eat it. At least I can smell it.

637
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:49,800
Here.

638
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:51,601
You can smell it all you want.

639
00:42:54,567 --> 00:42:55,867
Come on.

640
00:42:55,968 --> 00:42:56,669
What?

641
00:42:56,767 --> 00:42:58,635
You said you wanted to smell it at least.

642
00:43:01,834 --> 00:43:02,867
By the way...

643
00:43:05,934 --> 00:43:07,735
-Is this yours?
-Oh?

644
00:43:09,434 --> 00:43:11,235
Where did you find it?
I was looking all over for it.

645
00:43:16,634 --> 00:43:18,634
They found it in the ICU.

646
00:43:23,868 --> 00:43:25,868
Why would you lie to me?

647
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,700
You came to see me at the ICU
after my surgery, right?

648
00:43:30,634 --> 00:43:31,834
What is this?

649
00:43:32,434 --> 00:43:34,235
I feel like I'm being investigated.

650
00:43:35,033 --> 00:43:37,033
You remember everything from
that day 13 years ago, right?

651
00:43:38,534 --> 00:43:40,901
You remember everything including
Chestnut and the reservoir...

652
00:43:42,133 --> 00:43:43,433
I'm so thirsty.

653
00:43:43,834 --> 00:43:45,468
I'm going to get more water.

654
00:43:48,868 --> 00:43:50,369
Stop running away and tell me.

655
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,734
Don't give excuses that I was
hallucinating after the surgery.

656
00:43:54,234 --> 00:43:55,935
I remember everything to the details.

657
00:43:56,234 --> 00:43:58,968
You told me that you remembered then.

658
00:44:00,634 --> 00:44:01,968
Why are you avoiding it?

659
00:44:02,868 --> 00:44:04,302
Why are you pretending
that you don't remember?

660
00:44:22,334 --> 00:44:23,568
I remember.

661
00:44:25,567 --> 00:44:28,834
How would I forget you?

662
00:44:32,901 --> 00:44:36,568
You're the person who stayed by my side
when it was the saddest day of my life...

663
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:41,602
You're the one who created
the day I want to forget the most.

664
00:44:44,567 --> 00:44:46,134
What do you mean you want to forget?

665
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:46,968
I...

666
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,634
I almost killed you back then.

667
00:44:50,734 --> 00:44:53,335
What do you mean?
You saved me that time.

668
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:56,167
I hesitated...

669
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:03,667
It was only for a brief moment,
but I had a terrible thought.

670
00:45:04,567 --> 00:45:06,368
I hated that man so much...

671
00:45:07,033 --> 00:45:12,133
...that I wouldn't care even
if you died with that man...

672
00:45:14,334 --> 00:45:15,701
Wake up.

673
00:45:16,033 --> 00:45:18,600
Hey, wake up!

674
00:45:20,167 --> 00:45:22,468
And when you came out of the water...

675
00:45:22,734 --> 00:45:24,268
...it was like hell to me.

676
00:45:26,234 --> 00:45:27,168
I...

677
00:45:29,133 --> 00:45:30,800
I thought I killed someone...

678
00:45:34,067 --> 00:45:36,901
My hands still shake when
I think about that day.

679
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,500
I know I don't have any excuses...

680
00:45:47,534 --> 00:45:49,368
But I've lost someone so precious to me...

681
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,001
His absence was too big for me,
so I couldn't stand it.

682
00:45:56,934 --> 00:45:59,234
So I filled his absence with my anger...

683
00:45:59,901 --> 00:46:02,435
...and the regrets remained with me
like scars.

684
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:09,534
13 years ago...

685
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,267
...you are pain...

686
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,567
...and a scar to me.

687
00:46:21,501 --> 00:46:22,435
I'm sorry.

688
00:46:24,534 --> 00:46:27,268
I thought it would be okay
to pretend I didn't know...

689
00:46:30,868 --> 00:46:34,769
But seeing how painful it is,
I guess I was wrong.

690
00:47:10,067 --> 00:47:11,968
What is it? Why aren't you
picking up your phone?

691
00:47:12,467 --> 00:47:13,467
What are you doing here?

692
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,168
You told me to come.

693
00:47:16,267 --> 00:47:18,267
You said you wanted
to talk to Yoo Manho.

694
00:47:19,334 --> 00:47:20,649
Oh, I totally forgot.

695
00:47:20,734 --> 00:47:24,335
Let me get my notes. Hold on.

696
00:47:44,467 --> 00:47:46,034
You sure wrote a lot.

697
00:47:46,133 --> 00:47:47,567
You're going to talk about all of that?

698
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,134
Yes.

699
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,035
Don't push it too much.

700
00:47:52,601 --> 00:47:54,035
He's in final stages
of pancreatic cancer.

701
00:47:55,534 --> 00:47:56,667
Yoo Manho.

702
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:01,600
I'm the prosecutor that was in
charge of your daughter's case.

703
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,133
I'm here to clarify the things...

704
00:48:04,234 --> 00:48:07,168
...you had misunderstood about
regarding the investigation.

705
00:48:14,601 --> 00:48:16,535
I lost someone
that was so precious to me...

706
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:21,701
...that maybe I couldn't hold back
because his absence was so big.

707
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:25,568
So I filled his absence with anger...

708
00:48:25,968 --> 00:48:28,502
...and the regrets remained
with me like scars.

709
00:48:37,868 --> 00:48:38,769
Sir.

710
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,467
I know why you were so upset.

711
00:48:50,033 --> 00:48:53,467
You couldn't understand that
someone killed your beautiful...

712
00:48:53,567 --> 00:48:55,034
...and precious daughter out of anger.

713
00:48:56,501 --> 00:48:58,868
That's probably
why you hated Do Hakyoung...

714
00:48:58,968 --> 00:49:01,101
...and hated me for freeing him.

715
00:49:01,834 --> 00:49:03,201
It's understawakble that you'd be mad.

716
00:49:07,434 --> 00:49:11,801
I've met a lot of people surrounding
your daughter while investigating...

717
00:49:12,434 --> 00:49:16,634
...and everyone praised,
respected and loved your daughter.

718
00:49:16,934 --> 00:49:19,835
Sookyung doesn't need the law
because she's an honest person.

719
00:49:19,901 --> 00:49:22,968
That's her autograph.

720
00:49:23,033 --> 00:49:26,267
She never refuses to give
autograph when requested.

721
00:49:26,367 --> 00:49:27,367
Please have some.

722
00:49:27,467 --> 00:49:29,001
Thank you.

723
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:32,468
She always gave me something
to drink whenever I went.

724
00:49:32,667 --> 00:49:34,101
She was a nice person.

725
00:49:35,467 --> 00:49:37,867
Even the prime suspect,
Do Hakyoung...

726
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:40,168
...said that your daughter
was a nice person.

727
00:49:41,734 --> 00:49:44,268
That was the biggest evidence
that she was not murdered.

728
00:50:00,067 --> 00:50:02,167
I really wanted to tell you that.

729
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:06,368
I hoped that you wouldn't
misunderstand your nice daughter...

730
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,467
She wasn't someone who
would make others resent her.

731
00:50:42,701 --> 00:50:43,734
Prosecutor.

732
00:50:44,367 --> 00:50:45,335
Yes?

733
00:50:50,801 --> 00:50:52,101
I'm sorry.

734
00:50:53,834 --> 00:50:57,068
I know it doesn't mean much
that I apologize in his place...

735
00:50:58,234 --> 00:51:01,701
But I'm still sorry.

736
00:51:06,601 --> 00:51:10,135
May I see those notes?

737
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:12,402
I want to take my time
to take a look at it.

738
00:51:14,167 --> 00:51:17,768
I've only been listening to
Attorney Lee's side of the story...

739
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:21,001
...but now I want to know yours as well.

740
00:51:23,234 --> 00:51:23,868
Sure.

741
00:51:27,868 --> 00:51:28,968
Thank you.

742
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,667
For speaking so highly...

743
00:51:34,467 --> 00:51:35,867
...of my Sookyung.

744
00:51:38,501 --> 00:51:39,534
Not at all.

745
00:51:48,868 --> 00:51:50,535
Thanks for coming today.

746
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:53,235
Why did you change your
attitude towards them?

747
00:51:54,501 --> 00:51:55,302
What do you mean?

748
00:51:55,501 --> 00:52:00,002
I thought you wanted to accuse
him and ask bunch of questions.

749
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,001
But why did you
suddenly soften up like that?

750
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,700
I was reminded of something.

751
00:52:12,868 --> 00:52:15,402
That I'm not someone
to show off as well...

752
00:52:16,033 --> 00:52:17,367
What do you mean?

753
00:52:19,934 --> 00:52:20,868
What are you doing?

754
00:52:26,133 --> 00:52:27,006
What are you doing?

755
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,300
Prosecutor Jung.

756
00:52:29,601 --> 00:52:31,035
Hey, Jaechan!

757
00:52:49,934 --> 00:52:52,934
Sir, I'm sorry but can you take
me to Seogu University Hospital?

758
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:53,968
Sure.

759
00:53:31,968 --> 00:53:32,869
"Little Pup"

760
00:53:37,834 --> 00:53:38,635
Hongjoo.

761
00:53:38,701 --> 00:53:39,868
Are you crazy?

762
00:53:40,167 --> 00:53:41,567
How could you come out like this?

763
00:53:42,434 --> 00:53:43,434
Let's go back.

764
00:53:43,534 --> 00:53:44,168
Wait...

765
00:53:44,534 --> 00:53:46,035
The visiting hours are over...

766
00:53:46,467 --> 00:53:47,767
Did you come to see me?

767
00:53:48,067 --> 00:53:51,301
You were going out to see me.

768
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:53,367
It's raining...

769
00:53:54,367 --> 00:53:56,367
You don't even know where I was.

770
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,400
Did you see this in your dream?

771
00:53:58,467 --> 00:54:00,168
Yes, I did.

772
00:54:00,501 --> 00:54:04,202
You were sick and yet
you were soaked in the rain...

773
00:54:06,934 --> 00:54:10,401
You were going crazy in your dream.

774
00:54:14,367 --> 00:54:17,034
You had fever and your
wounds were infected...

775
00:54:18,167 --> 00:54:20,968
And yet you were still looking for me.

776
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,367
Hongjoo.

777
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:28,501
Hongjoo.

778
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,037
So, did I end up finding
you in the dream?

779
00:54:43,234 --> 00:54:44,668
Yes, you did.

780
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,701
But you were half-dead.

781
00:55:12,501 --> 00:55:13,435
Jaechan!

782
00:55:15,567 --> 00:55:16,634
Jaechan!

783
00:55:22,801 --> 00:55:24,736
"You and I must meet each
other no matter what happens"

784
00:55:28,067 --> 00:55:31,200
What did I say when I met you?
Did you hear that part as well?

785
00:55:33,434 --> 00:55:37,935
That you were the same as me 13 years ago.

786
00:55:40,834 --> 00:55:45,268
I was the same as you and
yet I wasn't honest with you.

787
00:55:46,067 --> 00:55:48,968
What do you mean?

788
00:55:49,467 --> 00:55:51,001
I also hesitated back then.

789
00:55:52,634 --> 00:55:53,502
Save me.

790
00:55:53,968 --> 00:55:56,735
Save me and that man... You save us.

791
00:55:58,167 --> 00:55:59,401
If you don't want to regret it.

792
00:56:00,334 --> 00:56:01,367
I believe in you.

793
00:56:04,367 --> 00:56:06,201
I know it was only a brief moment.

794
00:56:06,501 --> 00:56:08,768
But I hesitated when
I was running to save him.

795
00:56:10,167 --> 00:56:11,668
Should I just not save him?

796
00:56:16,367 --> 00:56:21,134
I was also very angry
back then just like yourself.

797
00:56:24,267 --> 00:56:28,001
You said you were very angry like me.

798
00:56:29,033 --> 00:56:31,200
And that you were fighting
with those emotions...

799
00:56:31,267 --> 00:56:32,534
It was really tough.

800
00:56:33,801 --> 00:56:35,235
That moment was also...

801
00:56:36,767 --> 00:56:38,368
... a scar to me like it was for you.

802
00:56:43,667 --> 00:56:47,401
So I forgot about it
until I met you again.

803
00:56:50,934 --> 00:56:54,168
But both you and I made the choice.

804
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,467
That we shouldn't cross any lines.

805
00:56:58,067 --> 00:57:01,167
I ran into the water
and you pulled the rope.

806
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:05,867
I saved that man and you saved me...

807
00:57:09,167 --> 00:57:10,001
So?

808
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,168
Did I say it like this in your dream?

809
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:23,400
And that's how you told
me not to avoid anything.

810
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:26,101
You told me not to run away...

811
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,901
And not to disappear
when you're looking for me.

812
00:57:38,934 --> 00:57:41,001
And how did you answer?

813
00:59:16,267 --> 00:59:17,467
I'm happy...

814
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,501
...I get to meet you again, Nam Hongjoo.

815
00:59:23,868 --> 00:59:27,268
It's nice to meet you, Jung Jaechan.
