1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,068
"While You Were Sleeping"

2
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:09,709
Oh my gosh, Prosecutor Jung.

3
00:00:09,794 --> 00:00:12,279
What's going on?
You're giving me a call.

4
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:17,642
I'm at Sanggu Police Station
covering a story of those stray cats.

5
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,035
I have a favor to ask of you, Wootak.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,232
I can do anything for you as long
as it's not something strange.

7
00:00:22,317 --> 00:00:23,772
Just tell me. What is it?

8
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:35,446
April 11th, 10:12 PM. The rooftop
of Soojo Building at Sanggu-dong.

9
00:00:36,442 --> 00:00:37,404
I had a dream.

10
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:41,341
Hongjoo will be attacked by
Kang Daehee at that time in that place.

11
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,943
Kang Daehee? Who is that?

12
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:47,047
He's a defendant who is being
tried for murder right now.

13
00:00:47,273 --> 00:00:48,207
Murder?

14
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:49,642
There's no way he'll be found innocent.

15
00:00:49,746 --> 00:00:51,491
So I don't know why I had that dream.

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,790
Don't worry.

17
00:00:54,742 --> 00:00:58,358
I will not leave Hongjoo
alone at that time in that place.

18
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:01,909
Hello. Please go ahead.

19
00:01:02,794 --> 00:01:04,241
Where are you right now?

20
00:01:04,326 --> 00:01:05,693
Hello.

21
00:01:05,778 --> 00:01:06,878
Hello.

22
00:01:12,484 --> 00:01:14,310
Should we ask for help from
the nearby police station?

23
00:01:14,395 --> 00:01:15,662
Yes, please.

24
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:16,839
Call for support.

25
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,005
Yes.

26
00:01:18,175 --> 00:01:21,484
If you saw this moment in your dream,
please don't be late.

27
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:24,356
I'm on the rooftop of
Soojo Building in Sanggu-dong.

28
00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:28,819
It's April 11th at 10:12 PM.

29
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,140
This is the first floor
of Soojo Building.

30
00:01:45,225 --> 00:01:47,926
This is Soojo Building first floor.
We need an ambulance.

31
00:01:48,011 --> 00:01:49,718
-Han Wootak!
-A police officer has been stabbed.

32
00:01:50,061 --> 00:01:51,660
He's breathing.

33
00:01:51,809 --> 00:01:54,310
Just leave him to me.
You go catch that jerk.

34
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:55,743
He ran up to the roof.

35
00:01:56,876 --> 00:01:58,143
Please take care of him.

36
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,559
Prosecutor Jung.

37
00:01:59,776 --> 00:02:01,758
You cut off his escape
and preserve the scene.

38
00:02:01,843 --> 00:02:02,610
Yes, sir.

39
00:02:02,795 --> 00:02:04,459
-Prosecutor Jung.
-Jeez!

40
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:07,115
Ambulance.
Ambulance.

41
00:02:11,685 --> 00:02:12,775
Prosecutor Jung.

42
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:14,076
It's dangerous to go alone.

43
00:02:14,185 --> 00:02:15,468
Prosecutor Jung!

44
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,504
Prosecutor...

45
00:02:18,943 --> 00:02:20,076
I can't do this.

46
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,173
Hold still, you jerk.

47
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:12,759
Go ahead and hire an attorney, you jerk.

48
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:14,868
I was found innocent.

49
00:03:14,953 --> 00:03:16,691
Call Attorney Lee Yoobum.

50
00:03:16,776 --> 00:03:19,147
Call Attorney Lee Yoobum,
you jerks.

51
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:22,202
I had to run instead of taking
the elevator, you jerk.

52
00:03:23,642 --> 00:03:26,042
I had noodles for dinner,
but this jerk made me run.

53
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,831
Sir. How could you
come here all by yourself?

54
00:03:45,744 --> 00:03:47,242
Your legs are like ostrich legs...

55
00:03:47,342 --> 00:03:48,528
But our legs are just normal legs.

56
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,142
Are you okay?

57
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:51,310
Are you hurt?

58
00:04:00,442 --> 00:04:01,609
It's all over.

59
00:04:01,694 --> 00:04:02,542
It's okay now.

60
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:04,523
It's okay.

61
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:06,042
It's okay.

62
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:15,744
Wootak.

63
00:04:15,975 --> 00:04:17,257
Is Wootak okay?

64
00:04:46,897 --> 00:04:47,744
Are you awake?

65
00:04:48,542 --> 00:04:49,542
Are you okay?

66
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,190
Doctor!

67
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:53,997
The patient has
regained his consciousness.

68
00:04:54,187 --> 00:04:56,069
Sir! Sir

69
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:57,579
Where are you? He's awake.

70
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,985
Is Hongjoo safe?

71
00:05:02,309 --> 00:05:04,543
Yes. I'm here. I'm safe.

72
00:05:07,299 --> 00:05:09,953
I'm glad you're alive.

73
00:05:19,261 --> 00:05:20,628
You're the only one who isn't okay.

74
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:25,129
You almost died, you jerk.

75
00:05:25,817 --> 00:05:27,284
Are you really okay?

76
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,563
Can you recognize me?

77
00:05:28,747 --> 00:05:29,843
Who am I?

78
00:05:30,843 --> 00:05:32,386
Lieutenant Oh Kyunghan.

79
00:05:33,676 --> 00:05:34,901
Yes. That's right.

80
00:05:35,946 --> 00:05:37,696
It's me. Oh Kyunghan.

81
00:05:38,108 --> 00:05:39,271
You're senior officer.

82
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:43,030
You can finally recognize people.

83
00:05:46,342 --> 00:05:47,373
What about the perpetrator?

84
00:05:48,242 --> 00:05:49,935
Yes. We got him.

85
00:05:55,334 --> 00:05:59,357
You're asking me to fill
a bottomless barrel, Kang Daehee.

86
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,869
You have to tell me
where the hole is honestly.

87
00:06:01,954 --> 00:06:05,431
Then, I can see if I can patch
it up and fill it with water or not.

88
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:08,277
He can patch it up and fill it again.

89
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,575
He did it last time,
so why can't he do it this time too?

90
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,038
"Keep Quiet"

91
00:06:18,342 --> 00:06:20,351
Excuse me. Excuse me.

92
00:06:20,436 --> 00:06:22,373
Call Attorney Lee Yoobum for me.

93
00:06:22,843 --> 00:06:25,552
Hey. Call Attorney Lee Yoobum.

94
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,794
Call my attorney. Call him right now!

95
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:31,279
Bring Lee Yoobum to me!

96
00:06:35,576 --> 00:06:36,923
Bring Lee Yoobum.

97
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:41,267
Bring Attorney Lee Yoobum.
Bring him here quickly!

98
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,844
I was stabbed by
a knife for the first time.

99
00:06:46,943 --> 00:06:48,675
All the movies are lying.

100
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:51,909
In the movies, they fight well even
after getting stabbed few times.

101
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,655
But you can't do that in real life.

102
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:57,483
The moment I was stabbed,
I lost all my strength.

103
00:06:58,196 --> 00:07:00,043
I couldn't even move my fingers.

104
00:07:00,142 --> 00:07:01,290
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,976
This happened because
I asked you to do that.

106
00:07:03,075 --> 00:07:04,075
What are you talking about?

107
00:07:05,636 --> 00:07:08,103
Look at this.
I can't even open the bottle.

108
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:12,514
I asked you to protect Hongjoo.

109
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:13,842
What are you talking about?

110
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,603
I'm so thankful that you told me about it.

111
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,943
What will happen to
Kang Daehee now?

112
00:07:24,042 --> 00:07:25,342
It will be difficult for
him to get out of this.

113
00:07:25,427 --> 00:07:27,442
We secured the evidence that
he poisoned his brother to death.

114
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:29,702
And his younger sister will
be testifying at the trial also.

115
00:07:29,876 --> 00:07:31,696
And most importantly...

116
00:07:31,781 --> 00:07:33,809
...the prosecutor in the case
is quite trustworthy.

117
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:35,476
Who is it?

118
00:07:37,442 --> 00:07:38,475
It's me.

119
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:40,010
What?

120
00:07:49,297 --> 00:07:50,476
Oh my gosh, Prosecutor Jung.

121
00:07:50,576 --> 00:07:51,724
Look at your face.

122
00:07:51,809 --> 00:07:53,355
Did you get those from
getting hit by Kang Daehee?

123
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,743
I didn't get hit.

124
00:07:54,828 --> 00:07:58,056
I just got a minor injury
while suppressing him.

125
00:07:58,273 --> 00:07:58,843
A minor injury...

126
00:07:58,928 --> 00:08:01,823
But why is he the only who
got injured when you're fine?

127
00:08:01,908 --> 00:08:02,843
Didn't you go with him?

128
00:08:02,943 --> 00:08:03,911
I did.

129
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:05,458
I went to the scene also.

130
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:07,909
But he was going up four stairs at a time.

131
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:09,609
How am I supposed to keep up with him?

132
00:08:09,676 --> 00:08:11,010
The most I can do is two stairs.

133
00:08:11,108 --> 00:08:12,542
Four stairs at a time?

134
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:16,743
I guess you can go up four stairs
at a time if you have long legs.

135
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:18,552
Well...

136
00:08:18,637 --> 00:08:21,550
So did you fight that
murderer all by yourself?

137
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,163
That's what I'm saying.

138
00:08:23,248 --> 00:08:24,257
He went after him without fear
saying that...

139
00:08:24,342 --> 00:08:25,984
...he's fourth degree black belt
in Taekwondo.

140
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:27,524
Fourth degree in Taekwondo?

141
00:08:27,609 --> 00:08:28,257
What about you?

142
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,824
I'm certified too.

143
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,657
All men who serve in the military
are first degree black belt.

144
00:08:34,492 --> 00:08:35,643
Front kick.

145
00:08:36,412 --> 00:08:37,425
Side kick.

146
00:08:38,175 --> 00:08:40,009
Look. It's still very sharp.

147
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:42,143
Prosecutor Jung.

148
00:08:42,228 --> 00:08:45,211
What's the most important thing to
remember when you're serving a warrant?

149
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:47,458
Mr. Choi, let's talk privately
about that inside.

150
00:08:47,543 --> 00:08:49,877
No. Please answer me right now.

151
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:50,863
What is it?

152
00:08:52,776 --> 00:08:54,277
Arresting the suspect?

153
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,369
Wrong.
That's not it.

154
00:08:56,454 --> 00:08:59,477
My safety then the arrest.

155
00:09:01,342 --> 00:09:02,188
Hey.

156
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:04,143
That's true.

157
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:06,442
But you shouldn't complain just
because he got the order wrong.

158
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:07,401
Yes, sir.

159
00:09:07,486 --> 00:09:08,443
Good job.

160
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:11,210
I didn't know you went
through so much by yourself.

161
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:13,143
Mr. Choi worked hard as well.

162
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:14,363
You worked hard.

163
00:09:14,909 --> 00:09:16,724
Your arm is like a rock.

164
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:19,572
Prosecutor Jung was a talented
man who is intelligent and strong.

165
00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:22,240
Work hard.

166
00:09:24,108 --> 00:09:25,675
They're both men.

167
00:09:26,943 --> 00:09:28,076
Are they different types?

168
00:09:28,175 --> 00:09:30,053
Thank you for pointing that out to me.

169
00:09:30,401 --> 00:09:31,609
I'll remember it.

170
00:09:33,242 --> 00:09:34,143
I'm going to go first.

171
00:09:38,108 --> 00:09:39,424
When did I point it out?

172
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:41,410
Was this pointing it out? Was it?

173
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:43,776
You didn't point it out.
It was an insult.

174
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:45,176
It was insulting yourself.

175
00:09:45,261 --> 00:09:47,876
To make it simpler,
it was digging your own grave.

176
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,354
Kick.

177
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,542
Isn't it difficult to become a defense
lawyer after being a prosecutor?

178
00:10:11,943 --> 00:10:14,387
Taking a bad guy's side
when you know he's bad.

179
00:10:14,609 --> 00:10:16,994
I don't think I can do it even if he
says he'll give me a billion won.

180
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,633
Don't be so sure.

181
00:10:21,175 --> 00:10:23,143
My today might become your tomorrow.

182
00:10:23,228 --> 00:10:24,647
Aren't you going to represent
Kang Daehee again?

183
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:26,156
You said you secured all the evidence.

184
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:28,185
You confiscated the herbal medicine
with poison in it.

185
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,883
You also secured
the younger sister's testimony.

186
00:10:29,968 --> 00:10:32,012
That's why you can get more
legal fee than the last time.

187
00:10:35,242 --> 00:10:35,976
I won't do it.

188
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,173
Even if the stakes are high...

189
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:42,542
...I'll never bet on something
with low chance of winning.

190
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,190
Never.

191
00:10:52,656 --> 00:10:53,923
Mr. Kang Daehee.

192
00:10:56,411 --> 00:10:57,943
...attempted murder...

193
00:10:58,108 --> 00:10:59,375
...my goodness, causing bodily harm...

194
00:10:59,476 --> 00:11:01,391
...destruction of property and
violating animal rights?

195
00:11:01,476 --> 00:11:04,276
People are cold-hearted here.
You don't even offer coffee to a guest.

196
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,243
You're here as a suspect
of a crime, Mr. Kang Daehee.

197
00:11:07,328 --> 00:11:10,376
You don't know anything about
the presumption of innocence.

198
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,003
Until the investigation is finished,
the trial is over and...

199
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,758
...the Supreme Court
makes its decision, I'm innocent.

200
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,843
If you're acting like this because you
believe in Attorney Lee Yoobum...

201
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:18,877
...you should give it up.

202
00:11:19,324 --> 00:11:20,724
He won't represent you.

203
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:25,379
After going through trial last time,
I almost became a lawyer.

204
00:11:25,528 --> 00:11:28,437
Paragraph 4 of article 12
of the constitution says that...

205
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:35,176
...anyone has the right to have
a lawyer to represent his case.

206
00:11:35,275 --> 00:11:38,190
We have a relationship protected
by the laws of this country.

207
00:11:38,275 --> 00:11:41,540
Why are you interfering in this
when you're familiar with the law?

208
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,442
Paragraph 4 of article 12...

209
00:11:43,527 --> 00:11:46,840
...of the constitution says that if
a defendant cannot afford a lawyer...

210
00:11:46,925 --> 00:11:49,809
...one will be provided for you
by the state.

211
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,176
I think you qualify for this.

212
00:11:54,275 --> 00:11:57,768
That's why I'm trying to get
my lawyer but you're interfering.

213
00:11:58,465 --> 00:12:01,387
Call Attorney Lee Yoobum.
He'll come if I call him.

214
00:12:02,075 --> 00:12:03,623
Attorney Lee Yoobum said this.

215
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:06,476
He doesn't want to represent you
because he doesn't bet...

216
00:12:06,576 --> 00:12:09,595
...even if the stakes are high
when the winning changes are low.

217
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,372
That's right.

218
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:15,735
He also wanted me to tell you this.

219
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,343
Please tell Kang Daehee this
if you see him.

220
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:24,644
You're a broken barrel already,
so no matter what you do...

221
00:12:24,742 --> 00:12:28,142
...you won't be able to fill
it no matter what you do...

222
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:32,976
He said you would understand.

223
00:12:34,742 --> 00:12:35,409
No.

224
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:36,743
Did you understand?

225
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:37,910
I said no.

226
00:12:38,332 --> 00:12:40,066
Well, I guess you understand.

227
00:12:40,518 --> 00:12:42,776
Then let's start the questioning.

228
00:12:42,843 --> 00:12:44,310
Bring Lee Yoobum here.

229
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:46,709
He'll come if I call him.
Hurry up and call him!

230
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:49,381
Hurry up and bring him!

231
00:12:49,466 --> 00:12:52,143
Bring him here right now!

232
00:12:52,213 --> 00:12:56,242
Hurry up and bring him.
Hurry up and call him!

233
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,043
Bring him here now!

234
00:13:00,342 --> 00:13:02,809
You jerk!

235
00:13:10,642 --> 00:13:15,409
Spring flowers banquet will continue until
the royal azaleas bloom in early May.

236
00:13:15,774 --> 00:13:16,939
When will your case come on?

237
00:13:17,616 --> 00:13:18,509
It will come on in a bit.

238
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:21,890
A man who was investigated for killing
his younger brother for insurance money...

239
00:13:21,975 --> 00:13:25,188
...was arrested on the day he
was found innocent and released.

240
00:13:25,476 --> 00:13:26,691
Reporter Nam Hongjoo is reporting.

241
00:13:26,776 --> 00:13:27,710
It's Hongjoo.

242
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:30,657
Residential area of
Seoul Hangang-gu Sanggu-dong.

243
00:13:30,742 --> 00:13:32,710
Since January there were dead cats...

244
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:37,043
...which were killed due to
poisoning were found frequently.

245
00:13:37,522 --> 00:13:41,030
The suspect is 37 year old Mr. Kang
who runs a fried chicken restaurant.

246
00:13:41,342 --> 00:13:43,384
Mr. Kang was after
the insurance money on his siblings.

247
00:13:43,469 --> 00:13:47,493
He was on trial for murdering his brother
and covering it up as a car accident.

248
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:51,021
But he was found innocent
for lack of evidence.

249
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,574
But the prosecution
uncovered the truth that...

250
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:55,379
...he used the poison he used
to kill the stray cats in the murder...

251
00:13:55,464 --> 00:13:58,454
...of his brother by mixing
it into herbal medicine.

252
00:13:58,742 --> 00:14:00,851
Investigation revealed that he
covered up the murder as car accident...

253
00:14:00,936 --> 00:14:03,661
...and received 2.7 billion won
of insurance money.

254
00:14:03,746 --> 00:14:06,443
He was arrested by the prosecution again.

255
00:14:06,742 --> 00:14:09,809
The stray cats that were
poisoned to death left traces...

256
00:14:09,909 --> 00:14:14,343
...which became crucial
evidence in arresting Mr. Kang.

257
00:14:14,642 --> 00:14:16,433
This is Nam Hongjoo of SBC News.

258
00:14:17,476 --> 00:14:18,488
Do you not like it?

259
00:14:18,573 --> 00:14:19,928
Why do you look so unhappy?

260
00:14:21,442 --> 00:14:24,428
Tell me what are you not happy about?

261
00:14:27,275 --> 00:14:28,534
It's disappointing.

262
00:14:29,008 --> 00:14:29,858
About the beer?

263
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:31,270
No. I was talking about you.

264
00:14:31,512 --> 00:14:32,780
What are you talking about?

265
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,760
A victim and the defendant's brother,
Kang Byunghee...

266
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:39,273
...worked as a delivery man
in the day time...

267
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:41,483
...and as a substitute driver
in the evening to make money.

268
00:14:41,568 --> 00:14:43,742
With the money he earned,
he bought his older brother...

269
00:14:43,937 --> 00:14:45,671
...birthday gifts and gave his
younger sister her allowance.

270
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:46,962
That made him happy.

271
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:51,890
Being blinded by the greed of
wanting to make lots of money...

272
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,297
...the defendant took away...

273
00:14:53,382 --> 00:14:55,361
...all the happiness his brother
was going to enjoy in his life.

274
00:14:55,776 --> 00:15:00,176
Even though he committed
the most heinous crime by the law...

275
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,888
...he shed detestable tears
in front of the victim's body.

276
00:15:02,973 --> 00:15:04,442
He toyed with law enforcement...

277
00:15:04,527 --> 00:15:07,337
...and he does not show signs
of remorse and repentance.

278
00:15:08,943 --> 00:15:09,945
Therefore, I do not consider...

279
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:14,019
...the lifetime imprisonment to
be too heavy of a punishment.

280
00:15:15,426 --> 00:15:20,508
I recommend that the defendant
is given a life sentence.

281
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:43,276
"A secret that cannot be told"

282
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,090
"All thanks to you,
everything is my fault"

283
00:15:49,175 --> 00:15:53,542
Prosecutor Jung stopped a truly
horrible thing from happening.

284
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:57,491
This is all thanks to Prosecutor Jung.

285
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,781
He's not here, but let's give him a hand.

286
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:02,928
And...

287
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:06,465
...it's all my fault that Kang Daehee
was found innocent and released.

288
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:09,391
I knew that Prosecutor Lee is careless.

289
00:16:09,476 --> 00:16:10,385
So why didn't I...

290
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,129
...check on him thoroughly
when he was inspecting the body?

291
00:16:14,075 --> 00:16:18,013
I knew that Prosecutor Shin's
arrogance will cause a problem someday.

292
00:16:18,098 --> 00:16:20,786
So why did I entrust
her with such a big case?

293
00:16:20,871 --> 00:16:23,449
It's all my fault.

294
00:16:23,676 --> 00:16:25,859
No. It's my fault.

295
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:28,057
I should've checked on things
more since I'm their superior.

296
00:16:28,142 --> 00:16:32,601
No. I should've checked on
her more since I'm her senior.

297
00:16:32,686 --> 00:16:35,995
Yes. I also think that it's your fault.

298
00:16:43,975 --> 00:16:46,075
You're saying that I'm responsible,
but you're not responsible.

299
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:49,409
Yes. If you only inspected
the body properly...

300
00:16:49,494 --> 00:16:51,594
...Kang Daehee would not
have been found innocent.

301
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:56,003
Fine. I have no excuse.

302
00:16:56,088 --> 00:16:59,242
But you're the prosecutor
in charge of this case.

303
00:16:59,342 --> 00:17:01,574
Why didn't you find the herbal medicine
when you  executed search and seizure?

304
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:02,469
If you only found that...

305
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,876
If you figured out that it was
poisoning through autopsy...

306
00:17:05,975 --> 00:17:07,190
...I would've secured it.

307
00:17:07,275 --> 00:17:09,724
You concluded that it was a car accident.

308
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:11,454
That's why I only looked
for evidence relating to that.

309
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:12,743
That's why this terrible thing happened.

310
00:17:12,835 --> 00:17:14,310
Did I say that I did something great?

311
00:17:14,745 --> 00:17:15,546
I made a mistake too.

312
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,605
But I'm saying that you didn't
do anything to be proud of either.

313
00:17:19,157 --> 00:17:20,695
The policeman was stabbed because of us.

314
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,975
And there could've
been more victims easily.

315
00:17:23,173 --> 00:17:24,340
Aren't you scared?

316
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,745
I'm so scared that
my hand is still shaking.

317
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,407
Not at all.

318
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,974
Even if something like that happens,
I wouldn't think that it's my fault.

319
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:35,347
It's your fault.

320
00:17:42,307 --> 00:17:43,429
My goodness. Seriously!

321
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:57,808
You stay here.

322
00:17:57,907 --> 00:17:59,509
If something goes wrong, call the police.

323
00:17:59,748 --> 00:18:00,498
Do you understand?

324
00:18:06,137 --> 00:18:07,192
Run.

325
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:33,179
"Youngduk Crab"

326
00:18:34,807 --> 00:18:36,448
Why are you calling me at this hour?

327
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:38,050
Where are you?

328
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:39,551
Why do you ask?

329
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,091
I promised you that I'd take you to work.

330
00:18:43,357 --> 00:18:45,933
I'm at a police station right now.

331
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:48,014
I have a camp out here for few days.

332
00:18:49,284 --> 00:18:51,397
Yes. I'll send it to you right away.

333
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,220
What do I do?

334
00:18:53,287 --> 00:18:56,068
I'm so busy these days that
I don't have any time to be scared.

335
00:18:56,354 --> 00:18:58,423
So you don't need to take
me to work from now on...

336
00:19:11,673 --> 00:19:13,355
Is this the police station?

337
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,849
Are you camping out at the park?

338
00:19:15,848 --> 00:19:16,855
Where's your colleague?

339
00:19:28,988 --> 00:19:32,055
How did you know that I was here?

340
00:19:32,721 --> 00:19:33,721
I dreamt about it.

341
00:19:33,821 --> 00:19:35,821
I dreamt that you were blaming yourself...

342
00:19:35,906 --> 00:19:37,189
...and crying pathetically
all by yourself here.

343
00:19:41,521 --> 00:19:42,378
I cried?

344
00:19:43,495 --> 00:19:45,220
Me? And pathetically?

345
00:19:45,587 --> 00:19:48,803
Your imagination is amazing.

346
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:51,854
How can you dream about
such ridiculous thing?

347
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,088
Stop crying.

348
00:20:00,187 --> 00:20:02,093
You're going to fill up your
stomach with your runny nose.

349
00:20:02,906 --> 00:20:04,640
Please.

350
00:20:07,187 --> 00:20:09,680
Does it feel like Han Wootak
was hurt because of you?

351
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:13,222
"If it wasn't for me and..."

352
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:15,088
"...if I didn't say anything about
that fried chicken restaurant..."

353
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:16,674
You're blaming yourself
like that, aren't you?

354
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,665
I can't even sleep
because of those thoughts...

355
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:29,973
Then I should be wailing
and stay up every night.

356
00:20:32,721 --> 00:20:34,854
I owe a great debt to Wootak.

357
00:20:35,218 --> 00:20:36,861
What do you owe him?

358
00:20:37,754 --> 00:20:39,194
I'm more indebted to him than you.

359
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:41,185
That's why I'm feeling guilty myself too.

360
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,955
You're too normal for feeling guilty.

361
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,541
How are you okay?

362
00:20:46,934 --> 00:20:48,836
Put yourself in his shoes.

363
00:20:48,921 --> 00:20:50,315
If I'm Wootak...

364
00:20:50,718 --> 00:20:54,044
...I wouldn't want to show that
I'm injured and resent others.

365
00:20:54,742 --> 00:21:00,643
I think I'd be happy knowing
that you're safe and I'd be relieved.

366
00:21:04,787 --> 00:21:07,721
So, you should only cry for a moment.

367
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,954
You should only blame
yourself for a short while...

368
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,941
...but you shouldn't forget what happened.

369
00:21:40,068 --> 00:21:41,416
That's how you can repay him.

370
00:21:45,991 --> 00:21:47,425
Hello.

371
00:21:48,717 --> 00:21:49,984
I have to go over there.

372
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:54,480
Let's go this way.

373
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:56,951
"Investigation in progress"
"Do not interfere!"

374
00:21:57,036 --> 00:21:58,531
What good is it to regret?

375
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,192
It's no use crying over spilt milk.

376
00:22:01,183 --> 00:22:04,331
You'll just have to
fill it up again slowly.

377
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,802
You can't turn back time.

378
00:22:09,385 --> 00:22:10,775
Is that from a song?

379
00:22:11,032 --> 00:22:11,848
What do you mean?

380
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,133
That's not something you would say.

381
00:22:15,652 --> 00:22:17,169
You just repeated what
someone told you, right?

382
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:20,672
You're so good.

383
00:22:24,338 --> 00:22:26,011
I fabricated my report card.

384
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:30,205
Why did you lie about that?

385
00:22:33,738 --> 00:22:35,821
Sir.

386
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:47,705
Hey.

387
00:22:49,893 --> 00:22:50,841
Chief's son.

388
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:53,677
What's your name?

389
00:22:56,438 --> 00:22:57,910
Why do you want to know?

390
00:23:00,137 --> 00:23:00,980
Are you crying?

391
00:23:02,037 --> 00:23:03,148
I'm not crying.

392
00:23:04,482 --> 00:23:05,249
You brat.

393
00:23:06,004 --> 00:23:07,271
You should wipe your nose first.

394
00:23:10,872 --> 00:23:13,629
It would be nice if you can turn
back time but what can you do?

395
00:23:14,077 --> 00:23:15,611
It's no use crying over spilt milk.

396
00:23:20,404 --> 00:23:21,875
You have a lot time from now on.

397
00:23:22,037 --> 00:23:24,327
You just have to fill it up
again slowly starting now.

398
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:29,608
Then your father will take
back all of his disappointments.

399
00:23:30,805 --> 00:23:33,011
So, just cry for a moment.

400
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:34,947
Blame yourself for a short time.

401
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:37,935
But don't forget it for a long time.

402
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:39,919
Do you understand?

403
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:56,317
I heard it from someone long time ago.

404
00:23:56,402 --> 00:23:57,916
I knew it.

405
00:23:59,015 --> 00:24:00,045
Who was it?

406
00:24:00,664 --> 00:24:02,274
I don't know. I don't remember who it was.

407
00:24:03,197 --> 00:24:05,297
Who cares who said it?
Did it make you feel better?

408
00:24:13,164 --> 00:24:14,442
Is it okay for me to lean on you?

409
00:24:28,345 --> 00:24:29,868
Cry for a short time...

410
00:24:31,297 --> 00:24:32,832
Blame yourself for a short time.

411
00:24:35,489 --> 00:24:38,130
But don't forget it for a long time.

412
00:24:39,872 --> 00:24:41,917
I could've never imagined at that time.

413
00:24:43,931 --> 00:24:45,996
Those warm comforting words...

414
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,278
...would be someone's last words.

415
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:16,782
Please drink this.

416
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,065
Thank you.

417
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:22,598
I think it's all done.

418
00:25:22,698 --> 00:25:24,146
Why don't you test it out?

419
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,065
Okay.

420
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:34,733
Yes. It works.

421
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,318
Did I do something wrong and break it?

422
00:25:37,403 --> 00:25:39,805
I think someone from another house
tempered with a cable by mistake.

423
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:49,048
Miss. We live off of
customer service reviews.

424
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:52,651
Please put in a good word for me
when you receive a survey call.

425
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,001
Okay.

426
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:57,173
Then would you mind
throwing away these delivery boxes...

427
00:25:57,258 --> 00:25:58,931
...to the recycling bins?

428
00:25:59,064 --> 00:26:00,906
There are too many for
me to take out on my own.

429
00:26:00,991 --> 00:26:05,223
But I'll ask them to give you a lot of
points for your service today, Mr. Yoo.

430
00:26:05,698 --> 00:26:08,132
That's okay. Just leave it there.
I'll throw them out.

431
00:26:08,217 --> 00:26:10,031
It's okay.
I'll throw them out.

432
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,497
It's on my way out.

433
00:26:17,057 --> 00:26:19,798
Please give me a good rating
for my service today.

434
00:26:19,898 --> 00:26:20,762
Okay.

435
00:26:21,435 --> 00:26:23,832
-Goodbye.
-Yes. Goodbye.

436
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:24,984
Goodbye.

437
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,879
"Do Hakyoung:
Should I teach them a lesson?"

438
00:26:57,231 --> 00:26:58,550
Mr. Han Wootak.

439
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,031
You can be discharged in the afternoon.

440
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,222
You can pay at the administration office.

441
00:27:04,364 --> 00:27:05,057
Yes.

442
00:27:09,865 --> 00:27:10,599
Hey. Nam Hongjoo.

443
00:27:10,698 --> 00:27:11,630
What about the black box video?

444
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:14,213
I heard that the video was
taken care of by the police.

445
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,784
It will be a headache if we
don't have the black box video.

446
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:18,131
I want you to secure that no matter what.

447
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:18,998
Okay.

448
00:27:24,498 --> 00:27:25,199
Nam Hongjoo.

449
00:27:25,297 --> 00:27:26,698
I'm going to get
discharged a little later.

450
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:27,865
Would you be able to come?

451
00:27:31,397 --> 00:27:33,279
Mr. Bong. I'm going to get
off work a little early today.

452
00:27:33,364 --> 00:27:34,131
Okay.

453
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,479
And I'll do whatever I can to secure
the video from the black box.

454
00:27:37,564 --> 00:27:38,232
What did you say?

455
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:41,430
Hey. Nam Hongjoo.
Where are you going?

456
00:27:41,498 --> 00:27:42,598
Nam Hongjoo!

457
00:27:43,534 --> 00:27:45,004
How is she so gutsy?

458
00:27:45,598 --> 00:27:46,631
Is she out of her mind?

459
00:27:48,464 --> 00:27:50,265
I think she's gone nuts.

460
00:27:55,865 --> 00:27:57,825
You're quite muscular.

461
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,878
All the police officers
are as muscular as I am.

462
00:28:00,831 --> 00:28:03,499
The Lieutenant who
works with you doesn't...

463
00:28:03,584 --> 00:28:04,816
Han Wootak!

464
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:12,365
Don't you knock?

465
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:13,939
Jaechan. You're here too.

466
00:28:15,997 --> 00:28:17,865
Why are you covering him?
Let me take a look too.

467
00:28:17,965 --> 00:28:19,165
What do you want to see?

468
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,613
Hurry up and put on your clothes.

469
00:28:20,714 --> 00:28:22,415
Look somewhere else.

470
00:28:25,064 --> 00:28:26,398
Are you okay?
Did they say you can be discharged?

471
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:27,299
Yes.

472
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:28,369
Nam Hongjoo.

473
00:28:28,454 --> 00:28:30,647
Can I stay at your house for few days?

474
00:28:30,732 --> 00:28:31,534
Why?

475
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,464
Why does it have to be at her house?

476
00:28:36,564 --> 00:28:40,130
The doctor told me to
recuperate at home for few days.

477
00:28:40,215 --> 00:28:41,682
But I can't do that at
my house since I live alone.

478
00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:43,766
But I can't stay at
my parents' house either.

479
00:28:44,105 --> 00:28:46,153
Is your house far away?
Should I take you there?

480
00:28:46,238 --> 00:28:47,186
That's not it.

481
00:28:47,455 --> 00:28:49,194
I'm the only son in three generations.

482
00:28:49,531 --> 00:28:53,212
I got hit by a falling persimmon
when I was young.

483
00:28:53,297 --> 00:28:56,764
My parents cut down all
the persimmon trees that same day.

484
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,964
I had to write a promissory note
saying that...

485
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,597
...I'd quit being a policeman
if I get hurt.

486
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:03,499
If they find out that I got hurt,
I'd have to resign.

487
00:29:03,865 --> 00:29:04,632
Please do me a favor.

488
00:29:04,731 --> 00:29:05,432
Of course. Of course.

489
00:29:05,498 --> 00:29:06,965
Thank you for asking me.

490
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:09,131
You can recuperate at my house too.

491
00:29:09,231 --> 00:29:10,258
That's right.

492
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:13,618
I have a favor to ask of you too.

493
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,165
What's this?

494
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:26,028
Jaechan! Jaechan!

495
00:29:31,181 --> 00:29:32,170
Who are you?

496
00:29:32,531 --> 00:29:34,439
I called Jaechan, so why are you coming?

497
00:29:40,574 --> 00:29:42,681
Jaechan. What are you doing there?
Why don't you turn the light on?

498
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,631
Don't turn it on.

499
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:46,184
What's wrong with you?
You're being scary.

500
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:49,321
They're having
barbeque across the street.

501
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:51,298
It's Wootak.

502
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,529
We'll have soju next time.

503
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:02,716
I heard everything from Hongjoo.

504
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,262
I heard you saved him.

505
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,061
That's okay.

506
00:30:05,127 --> 00:30:07,973
I only did what any policeman
in Korea would've done.

507
00:30:08,594 --> 00:30:09,328
You should eat too.

508
00:30:09,427 --> 00:30:10,194
I'll cut it. Let me have the scissor.

509
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:11,746
It's okay. I'm all done eating.

510
00:30:12,149 --> 00:30:16,254
I'll take care of you
until you're much better.

511
00:30:16,339 --> 00:30:18,764
What kind of food does my policeman like?

512
00:30:19,709 --> 00:30:20,785
There are too many...

513
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:23,093
I think about it and
submit a report to you.

514
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:23,994
Yes, sir.

515
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:27,941
What are you looking for?

516
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,208
There aren't any perilla leaves.

517
00:30:29,293 --> 00:30:30,245
You need perilla leaves
when you eat barbeque.

518
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,132
Just eat the lettuce.
There are seasoned green onions here too.

519
00:30:32,217 --> 00:30:35,200
No. We can't leave out perilla leaves.

520
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:36,428
Hold on.

521
00:30:41,974 --> 00:30:43,290
Yes. Wootak.

522
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,995
Jaechan. Do you have
any perilla leaves at home?

523
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:47,861
No. I don't.

524
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:49,527
Then could you buy some
and bring them to me?

525
00:30:49,612 --> 00:30:52,250
I can't eat barbeque
without perilla leaves.

526
00:30:54,293 --> 00:30:56,393
Of course.
I'll go and buy some for you.

527
00:30:56,494 --> 00:31:00,091
Then I'd like some seasoned radish too.

528
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:00,894
Okay.

529
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:02,575
Perilla leaves and seasoned radish...

530
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:03,965
I got it.

531
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:07,328
Seungwon.

532
00:31:07,627 --> 00:31:09,701
I'm suddenly remembering a poem.

533
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:11,220
A poem?

534
00:31:11,574 --> 00:31:13,427
"She's pretty from afar."

535
00:31:14,314 --> 00:31:17,142
"She's lovely for only a moment."

536
00:31:17,761 --> 00:31:20,595
"That's who she is."

537
00:31:20,993 --> 00:31:22,460
Is there a poem like that?

538
00:31:23,193 --> 00:31:24,326
Do you think there is?

539
00:31:24,411 --> 00:31:25,517
You fool.

540
00:31:25,878 --> 00:31:27,782
Clean the house. I'll be back.

541
00:31:38,493 --> 00:31:39,146
I'll come with you.

542
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,028
There's no need for two people
to go and buy just perilla leaves.

543
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,585
He's wants us to buy more things.

544
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:47,220
He wants cotton sock and pajamas too.

545
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,175
Then we'll have to go
all the way to a mart.

546
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,791
The mart is kind of far, right?

547
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:52,960
Take my car.
I'll give you my car keys.

548
00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:53,978
Catch it.

549
00:31:57,469 --> 00:31:59,784
Yes. Thank you.

550
00:32:01,787 --> 00:32:02,428
Get in.

551
00:32:02,513 --> 00:32:03,214
Yes.

552
00:32:12,632 --> 00:32:13,798
Oh? Wootak.

553
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:18,418
Why are you making a video call?

554
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:20,027
I was wondering what you bought.

555
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,940
That penguin doll is cute.

556
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:24,063
Buy me that one too.

557
00:32:24,339 --> 00:32:25,207
This one?

558
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:29,472
Your taste is so strange.

559
00:32:29,557 --> 00:32:30,773
Do you like dolls like this?

560
00:32:30,858 --> 00:32:33,158
No. I thought it looks like you.

561
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:33,963
Me?

562
00:32:35,128 --> 00:32:36,097
It does look like you.

563
00:32:36,182 --> 00:32:36,772
All the limbs are short,

564
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:39,006
...space between the eyes are
big and its mouth sticks out.

565
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:48,356
Jaechan.
What is that next to you?

566
00:32:48,441 --> 00:32:49,474
Can you try that?

567
00:32:50,138 --> 00:32:51,205
This one?
Right here?

568
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:51,872
Yes.

569
00:32:51,957 --> 00:32:53,568
I need to see it on a person
to see if I want to buy it.

570
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:54,939
Ta-da.

571
00:32:58,477 --> 00:32:59,611
Ta-da.

572
00:33:02,038 --> 00:33:02,754
This is cute.

573
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:05,279
What do you think about this?

574
00:33:08,103 --> 00:33:10,405
Hongjoo. What's that on your left side?
The long one...

575
00:33:10,506 --> 00:33:12,888
I think this is massager.

576
00:33:12,973 --> 00:33:16,373
My colleague will like it.
His shoulders get stiff at work.

577
00:33:16,472 --> 00:33:17,780
Really?
Then should I buy one?

578
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:20,361
No. Not that chick one but a stick.

579
00:33:20,672 --> 00:33:22,833
Wait a minute.
Will a dinosaur be better?

580
00:33:23,372 --> 00:33:24,173
A dinosaur?

581
00:33:24,262 --> 00:33:27,539
I think a dinosaur is better.
Okay. Let's go with the chick.

582
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:38,075
We're late.

583
00:33:38,506 --> 00:33:40,101
He must've finished eating.

584
00:33:41,472 --> 00:33:43,521
Wootak didn't get
to eat perilla leaves...

585
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:45,030
He deserved it.

586
00:33:50,168 --> 00:33:51,729
I guess she's still not back at work.

587
00:33:53,939 --> 00:33:55,099
I guess not.

588
00:34:05,472 --> 00:34:07,571
Leave them. They're heavy.
I'll carry them for you.

589
00:34:08,272 --> 00:34:09,854
That's okay.
I'm right in front of my house.

590
00:34:09,939 --> 00:34:11,606
I don't want to be indebted
to you about things like these.

591
00:34:12,772 --> 00:34:13,918
Indebted to me?

592
00:34:14,091 --> 00:34:15,821
Do you think that you're indebted to me?

593
00:34:15,906 --> 00:34:19,673
Yes. I can't repay you. I keep
adding more worries instead.

594
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:21,459
Do you really hate being
indebted to someone?

595
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:23,261
Yes. I hate it.

596
00:34:25,873 --> 00:34:29,052
I want to repay it all at once,
but I'm not able to.

597
00:34:29,137 --> 00:34:29,872
What can I do?

598
00:34:29,957 --> 00:34:31,843
I need to pay it back
little at time at least.

599
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,773
Can't I be an exception?

600
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:37,758
Excuse me?

601
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:39,711
Don't pay me back even
if you're indebted to me.

602
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,778
Be shameless....

603
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:42,647
Can't you do that?

604
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:44,364
Why would you be an exception?

605
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,158
Do you want to help me
whenever you see me?

606
00:34:46,243 --> 00:34:49,863
Do you want to protect me
and worry about me all the time?

607
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:52,143
Yes.

608
00:34:57,977 --> 00:34:59,277
Why are you like this lately?

609
00:34:59,376 --> 00:35:03,368
I say it jokingly,
but answering me romantically.

610
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,738
You're embarrassing me.

611
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,776
Let's act like how we usually act.
Like how we usually are.

612
00:35:18,517 --> 00:35:21,452
Let's say that you paid
it all back with this.

613
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:23,809
Excuse me?

614
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,289
What are you doing?

615
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:27,852
Did she go somewhere?

616
00:36:30,485 --> 00:36:32,323
Is she sleeping already?

617
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:35,542
Please hold these for me for a moment.

618
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:36,836
Let me look for the keys.

619
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,568
Please open the door quickly.

620
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,600
I'm looking for it.

621
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:50,098
By the way, what were you
trying to do in the car just now?

622
00:36:50,197 --> 00:36:52,009
Please just let it go.

623
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:54,661
Something like this happened to you too.

624
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:56,076
When you tried to undo my apron...

625
00:36:56,161 --> 00:36:57,321
How did you feel back then?

626
00:36:57,406 --> 00:36:59,430
I considered your feelings
and didn't say anything.

627
00:36:59,515 --> 00:37:01,031
So you should just...

628
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:19,297
Wasn't this what we're talking about?

629
00:37:20,564 --> 00:37:22,331
I thought this was it.

630
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,510
I guess it wasn't.

631
00:37:32,063 --> 00:37:34,063
Then, let's pretend this didn't happen.

632
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,030
I must be crazy.

633
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:13,057
I keep hitting on him any time I want to.

634
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:17,161
How am I supposed to look at him tomorrow?

635
00:38:21,282 --> 00:38:22,011
You're back.

636
00:38:22,096 --> 00:38:23,723
You're still here.

637
00:38:23,808 --> 00:38:25,351
Yes. You're quite late.

638
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:27,679
I'm sorry. There was a bit of traffic.

639
00:38:27,831 --> 00:38:28,484
Take a look at what we bought.

640
00:38:28,569 --> 00:38:30,107
If you don't like them,
I'll exchange them for you.

641
00:38:32,464 --> 00:38:34,679
No. I like them all.

642
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,626
What is that?

643
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,561
Why is he saying that he
likes them without looking?

644
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:15,645
Jaechan. There's a big problem.

645
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,565
He pooped a big one in the kitchen.

646
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:18,603
Really?

647
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,911
Did you poop, Robin?

648
00:39:21,996 --> 00:39:23,230
Did it feel good?

649
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,398
Did you have a drink?

650
00:39:25,483 --> 00:39:26,490
No.

651
00:39:26,575 --> 00:39:27,680
Did you eat, Robin?

652
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:29,967
Was it delicious? Was it delicious?

653
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:38,543
Jaechan.

654
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,111
It came again.

655
00:39:40,363 --> 00:39:41,412
What are you talking about?

656
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,682
That man sent money again.

657
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:47,118
He somehow found out our
new address after we moved.

658
00:39:49,297 --> 00:39:51,289
He's been sending money for 10 years now.

659
00:39:51,456 --> 00:39:52,872
Can't we just use the money?

660
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:54,281
Once I find him,
I'm going to give it back to him.

661
00:39:54,366 --> 00:39:55,435
Where did you put that money?

662
00:39:56,173 --> 00:39:57,864
I just put in on your desk.

663
00:39:58,029 --> 00:39:58,930
Just as it is...

664
00:39:59,925 --> 00:40:00,765
Good job.

665
00:40:33,172 --> 00:40:35,131
I clearly saw them coming this way.

666
00:40:35,216 --> 00:40:36,022
Are you sure?

667
00:40:36,107 --> 00:40:38,533
Yes. The one with the mourning
clothes is the policeman's son.

668
00:40:38,618 --> 00:40:40,671
And the one dressed like a baseball
player is the bus driver's son.

669
00:40:41,062 --> 00:40:42,573
Sir. Sir.

670
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,465
This isn't the time
to look for the son.

671
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:46,687
That deserter soldier's older
brother is here right now.

672
00:40:46,772 --> 00:40:47,460
His older brother?

673
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:49,524
That guy deserted his post
and went to see his brother.

674
00:40:49,609 --> 00:40:50,876
That's when he did it.

675
00:40:51,301 --> 00:40:52,464
And on top of that, he's a policeman.

676
00:40:52,564 --> 00:40:53,750
-A policeman?
-Yes.

677
00:40:53,835 --> 00:40:57,622
Hey. That's a bigger story than the son.

678
00:41:01,897 --> 00:41:05,630
Are you the son of the bus
driver who passed away?

679
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:06,531
What?

680
00:41:08,497 --> 00:41:09,331
Yes.

681
00:41:11,197 --> 00:41:11,998
What is it?

682
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:14,071
Over there.

683
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,797
There's someone over there.

684
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:19,296
Who...

685
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:28,397
Sir...

686
00:41:34,163 --> 00:41:39,096
Are you the policeman that
those reporters were talking about?

687
00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:45,764
I'm sorry.

688
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:53,044
Was it your brother who killed my father?

689
00:41:55,497 --> 00:41:56,914
I didn't know either.

690
00:41:57,464 --> 00:41:59,583
I didn't know that brother
would do something like that.

691
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:08,693
I'm sorry.

692
00:42:09,263 --> 00:42:10,730
I'm so...

693
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:12,230
...sorry.

694
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:14,634
You said I had a lot of time.

695
00:42:14,997 --> 00:42:18,636
You said that I can show my father
how wonderful I can be from now on.

696
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:21,005
That's what you said.

697
00:42:22,774 --> 00:42:24,875
There wasn't that much time.

698
00:42:25,597 --> 00:42:27,378
There's no future...

699
00:42:27,996 --> 00:42:29,614
My father isn't here anymore.

700
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:31,464
How am I supposed to show him?

701
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:33,150
How!

702
00:43:47,897 --> 00:43:49,264
What are you doing there?

703
00:43:50,797 --> 00:43:51,495
Shhh.

704
00:43:56,501 --> 00:44:00,304
Mom. Jaechan is waiting
for me outside right now.

705
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,332
Yes.

706
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:07,077
Tell him that I went to work already.

707
00:44:08,446 --> 00:44:09,547
Okay.

708
00:44:19,096 --> 00:44:22,008
Hongjoo told me to tell you
that she went to work already.

709
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:23,894
Did something happen between you two?
Did you guys have a fight?

710
00:44:24,297 --> 00:44:25,596
No. No.

711
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:28,566
Nam Hongjoo. Come out right now.
You're going to be late.

712
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,498
Mom...

713
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:32,837
Nam Hongjoo.

714
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:35,473
Yes.

715
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,196
I'm sorry.

716
00:44:43,281 --> 00:44:44,396
I'm late.

717
00:44:44,897 --> 00:44:45,698
Let's go.

718
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,444
Goodbye, mother.

719
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:50,821
Go ahead.

720
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:53,064
Good bye.

721
00:44:53,163 --> 00:44:54,363
See you.

722
00:45:16,197 --> 00:45:18,249
Are you avoiding me because
of what happened last night?

723
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:20,397
What happened last night?

724
00:45:21,419 --> 00:45:22,553
What about last night?

725
00:45:23,297 --> 00:45:24,955
Did we see each other last night?

726
00:45:25,831 --> 00:45:27,165
I don't remember.

727
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,131
If you don't remember,
let's pretend that it didn't happen.

728
00:45:31,216 --> 00:45:32,298
Is that okay with you?

729
00:45:34,445 --> 00:45:35,592
What are you talking about?

730
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:38,569
I don't know what you're talking about.

731
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,374
Nothing happened last night.

732
00:45:43,641 --> 00:45:44,498
Are you satisfied?

733
00:45:46,304 --> 00:45:47,139
Yes.

734
00:45:48,201 --> 00:45:49,864
So please don't avoid me.

735
00:45:50,336 --> 00:45:52,570
Don't disappear when I'm looking for you.

736
00:45:59,464 --> 00:46:00,157
Let's go.

737
00:46:14,038 --> 00:46:17,541
Try to fix it correctly this time.

738
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:19,659
This is the third time this month.

739
00:46:19,744 --> 00:46:23,169
It's moving season so other
companies keep touching the cable.

740
00:46:23,254 --> 00:46:24,448
That's why it's happening.

741
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:27,799
Moving season is almost over,
so it won't happen again.

742
00:46:27,897 --> 00:46:29,131
You're always saying that.

743
00:46:29,263 --> 00:46:30,821
And it always stop working again.

744
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:35,993
Then you can just call for repairs again.

745
00:46:38,763 --> 00:46:46,152
Please give a good rating when
they call for a survey this time.

746
00:46:46,237 --> 00:46:48,236
I'd give you a good rating
if it doesn't stop working again.

747
00:46:56,881 --> 00:46:59,283
Do you want me to throw
those out on my way out?

748
00:47:03,087 --> 00:47:04,455
Goodbye.

749
00:47:17,096 --> 00:47:19,485
Lieutenant Oh. When is Lieutenant Han
coming back to work?

750
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,032
He said he's coming
back to work next week.

751
00:47:21,117 --> 00:47:22,039
Is that right?

752
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:25,825
Then should we call him
and have dinner together?

753
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:27,760
Just tell him to get
as much rest as possible.

754
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,563
And you're supposed to patrol tonight.

755
00:47:30,648 --> 00:47:32,585
So why are you trying
to have dinner with him?

756
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:35,052
That's why...

757
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:39,690
Since I have to patrol with you,
I wanted to have dinner with him.

758
00:47:41,197 --> 00:47:42,775
Sanggu patrol car 592.

759
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,349
Head for homicide case.

760
00:47:45,296 --> 00:47:46,764
Sanggu Patrol Car responding...

761
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:55,198
What's happened?

762
00:47:55,297 --> 00:47:58,798
-Are you alright?
-I work here.

763
00:47:58,897 --> 00:48:00,664
When I opened the door...

764
00:48:02,831 --> 00:48:03,881
What is this?

765
00:48:05,063 --> 00:48:05,964
Oh my goodness...

766
00:48:06,831 --> 00:48:09,031
I can't believe what I'm seeing.

767
00:48:18,691 --> 00:48:23,025
It was discovered that archery
gold medalist Yoo Sookyung's death...

768
00:48:23,134 --> 00:48:25,964
...on the 21st might be a homicide.

769
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:30,278
The police are searching for
the murder suspect Do Hakyoung.

770
00:48:30,363 --> 00:48:31,830
Here's Reporter Nam Hongjoo
with the report.

771
00:48:32,648 --> 00:48:38,167
The queen of archery was found
dead at her house on the 21st.

772
00:48:38,252 --> 00:48:40,592
The police revealed that Miss Yoo...

773
00:48:40,677 --> 00:48:43,053
...died of excessive bleeding from
the wound behind her head.

774
00:48:43,226 --> 00:48:46,612
The reason that Miss Yoo's death
is being considered a homicide...

775
00:48:46,697 --> 00:48:51,131
...is because someone drew
geometrical drawing with her blood.

776
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:54,180
The police performed the autopsy
of Miss Yoo's body...

777
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:57,487
...and speculated that
she died on the morning of the 21st.

778
00:48:57,572 --> 00:49:00,746
The only person who was
recorded to have entered the house...

779
00:49:00,831 --> 00:49:04,545
...during that time was 29 years old
internet installation technician...

780
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:06,712
...Do Hakyoung.
There's an APB out for the suspect.

781
00:49:06,797 --> 00:49:09,587
What are you looking so intently?
Do you know him?

782
00:49:09,672 --> 00:49:11,164
No. I've never seen him before.

783
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:13,484
That's right. Mrs. Yoon.

784
00:49:13,751 --> 00:49:15,813
I wrote down some
side dishes I want to eat.

785
00:49:15,898 --> 00:49:17,533
Could I take some to go?

786
00:49:17,618 --> 00:49:18,858
I want to have some at my house too.

787
00:49:18,943 --> 00:49:20,750
Of course.

788
00:49:20,835 --> 00:49:21,941
I was waiting for that.

789
00:49:22,026 --> 00:49:22,773
I accept it.

790
00:49:22,858 --> 00:49:23,645
Are you going back to your house?

791
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:25,278
Yes. I'm going
back to work soon.

792
00:49:25,363 --> 00:49:26,525
I should go home now.

793
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:28,184
-Really?
-Really?

794
00:49:32,464 --> 00:49:34,938
That's too bad. What do we do?

795
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:38,994
You should eat more.
Have some pork belly.

796
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:40,030
You're late.

797
00:49:40,115 --> 00:49:41,551
Yes. I'm late, aren't I?

798
00:49:47,952 --> 00:49:49,001
That's strange.

799
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:51,638
I think I'm taking three times more stuff
than when I came here.

800
00:49:51,723 --> 00:49:53,238
Of course there are more.

801
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:54,724
You asked us to buy so many
things since you came here.

802
00:49:54,809 --> 00:49:56,860
Did you ask for a lot of food too?

803
00:49:59,397 --> 00:50:01,213
We have to keep repaying him.

804
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:03,697
We shouldn't forget what he did for us.

805
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:06,884
I am paying him back.
How can I be any nicer to him?

806
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:13,289
Get in.
I'll drive you home.

807
00:50:13,374 --> 00:50:14,219
Thank you.

808
00:50:14,304 --> 00:50:15,479
You're welcome.

809
00:50:21,996 --> 00:50:23,536
Should I open the sunroof for you?

810
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:24,706
Are you comfortable?

811
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:26,456
I'm trying to drive carefully.

812
00:50:26,681 --> 00:50:27,724
It's great.

813
00:50:28,697 --> 00:50:29,675
It's Chohee.

814
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,636
-Really?
-Really?

815
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:36,597
I'm so glad.

816
00:50:36,682 --> 00:50:37,849
I was so worried.

817
00:50:37,959 --> 00:50:39,570
I know right. That's great.

818
00:50:51,197 --> 00:50:51,998
What is it?

819
00:50:53,751 --> 00:50:54,864
It's nothing.

820
00:51:04,128 --> 00:51:07,430
This is radish kimchi and
this is green onion kimchi.

821
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:11,050
And this is seaweed soup.
I'm going to put it in the freezer.

822
00:51:11,135 --> 00:51:12,479
So, you need to warm
it up before you eat it.

823
00:51:12,564 --> 00:51:13,468
Okay.

824
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:20,893
You don't need to go to
the hospital again, do you?

825
00:51:20,978 --> 00:51:23,180
No. They took the stitches out yesterday.

826
00:51:23,923 --> 00:51:24,846
Do you want to see it?

827
00:51:24,931 --> 00:51:28,652
Seriously? Why would I want to look at it?

828
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:30,536
What's wrong with you?

829
00:51:30,621 --> 00:51:31,889
Okay.

830
00:51:32,197 --> 00:51:33,205
Should I take a look?

831
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:33,932
That's okay.

832
00:51:34,017 --> 00:51:35,031
-It doesn't hurt, right?
-No.

833
00:51:35,797 --> 00:51:38,262
You're so tiring after a while.

834
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:42,415
My mom wants you to come to
our house for breakfast every day.

835
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,931
She said all she needs to do is put
down one more spoon on the table.

836
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:45,851
And if you run out of side dishes,
you need to tell her.

837
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:46,713
Okay.

838
00:51:46,798 --> 00:51:49,084
If you need anything else, just call me.
I'll come right away.

839
00:51:49,169 --> 00:51:50,235
It's okay.

840
00:51:50,597 --> 00:51:51,742
This is quite enough.

841
00:51:52,063 --> 00:51:52,658
Excuse me?

842
00:51:52,743 --> 00:51:55,679
Thanks to the two of you,
I had a great time for the past few days.

843
00:51:55,764 --> 00:51:57,598
So let's say that you've
paid off your debt to me.

844
00:51:57,683 --> 00:51:58,982
I don't want you to
feel burdened anymore.

845
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:00,332
What are you talking about?

846
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:01,974
You were right.

847
00:52:02,332 --> 00:52:05,764
I don't want to show that
I'm hurt nor would I resent you.

848
00:52:06,664 --> 00:52:09,927
I'm just glad that you're safe.

849
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:17,601
So, don't cry even for a moment
and don't blame yourself either.

850
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:24,290
Wait a minute. Does that mean...

851
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:26,342
Were you at the park perhaps?

852
00:52:26,427 --> 00:52:28,712
No. I saw it in my dream.

853
00:52:29,413 --> 00:52:31,198
You guys were being pathetic at the park.

854
00:52:37,597 --> 00:52:39,805
Is that why you ordered
us around on purpose?

855
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:41,096
Did you just figure it out?

856
00:52:41,384 --> 00:52:42,741
I'm disappointed.

857
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,264
Do you think I'd trouble
other people for no reason?

858
00:52:45,477 --> 00:52:46,372
Hurry up and get in.

859
00:52:57,363 --> 00:53:00,429
He ordered us around on
purpose so that we'd feel better.

860
00:53:00,797 --> 00:53:02,006
We didn't even know that.

861
00:53:05,664 --> 00:53:07,645
Why do you look like that?
Are you angry?

862
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:09,824
How could he say
something cool like that...

863
00:53:09,909 --> 00:53:11,679
...after putting us
through all that trouble?

864
00:53:11,764 --> 00:53:13,280
Don't you think that's a foul?

865
00:53:13,365 --> 00:53:15,178
He made me out to be a petty person.

866
00:53:15,263 --> 00:53:16,131
Excuse me?

867
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,562
I didn't think Wootak was like that.

868
00:53:18,896 --> 00:53:20,732
But there's a mysterious side to him.

869
00:53:24,435 --> 00:53:26,103
I'm the only son in three generations.

870
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:30,073
A persimmon fell on my head
once when I was young.

871
00:53:30,274 --> 00:53:33,697
My parents cut down all the persimmon
trees in the neighborhood that day.

872
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:37,497
I know.

873
00:53:38,616 --> 00:53:40,597
There's a mysterious side to him.

874
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:05,391
How do you know Do Hakyoung?

875
00:54:05,476 --> 00:54:07,329
We went to
the same high school together...

876
00:54:07,414 --> 00:54:09,261
...and he was my roommate
until a year and a half ago.

877
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:11,704
When you first heard about this murder...

878
00:54:11,789 --> 00:54:13,964
...did you also think that
he might be the culprit?

879
00:54:14,664 --> 00:54:15,532
Yes.

880
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:22,059
"Hongjoo"

881
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:37,908
"Hongjoo"

882
00:54:39,464 --> 00:54:40,365
Hello.

883
00:54:40,511 --> 00:54:42,262
Are you okay? Is everything alright?

884
00:54:42,347 --> 00:54:43,497
Everything is fine.

885
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:45,818
-What is it?
-I just dreamt about you.

886
00:54:45,903 --> 00:54:48,085
You know that suspect Do Hakyoung...

887
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:50,269
I dreamt that he just
barges into your house.

888
00:54:50,354 --> 00:54:51,830
Why would he come to my house?

889
00:54:52,803 --> 00:54:54,124
You know Do Hakyoung, don't you?

890
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:55,945
You know him, but you pretended
not to know him, didn't you?

891
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:58,328
No. I really don't know him.

892
00:54:58,675 --> 00:55:00,497
I think you had a silly dream.

893
00:55:02,266 --> 00:55:03,400
Did you lock the door?

894
00:55:03,897 --> 00:55:05,451
This won't do, Wootak.
Don't just stay there.

895
00:55:05,536 --> 00:55:07,170
Call the police right now.

896
00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:11,023
Hey. Why would I call
the police when I'm the police?

897
00:55:11,108 --> 00:55:13,959
That man grabbed you and threatened you.

898
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:16,213
Okay. Okay. Don't worry.

899
00:55:16,681 --> 00:55:18,329
I'll make sure to lock
the door before I go to bed.

900
00:55:18,414 --> 00:55:19,430
So, don't worry about me and go to bed.

901
00:55:19,618 --> 00:55:20,464
I'm hanging up.

902
00:55:33,097 --> 00:55:36,564
Why did you come here,
Do Hakyoung?

903
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:48,845
You didn't change the pass code.

904
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:55,731
Has it been over a year
since I left this house?

905
00:55:57,996 --> 00:56:02,192
He still remembers me.

906
00:56:26,676 --> 00:56:28,097
You didn't answer me yet.

907
00:56:29,263 --> 00:56:30,563
Why did you come here?

908
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:35,458
Wootak

909
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,397
I've become a murderer.

910
00:56:45,702 --> 00:56:47,864
I saw the news.
They have an APB out on you.

911
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:51,164
Hey.

912
00:56:51,864 --> 00:56:53,931
I really didn't do it.

913
00:56:54,051 --> 00:56:57,063
I only went to that house
to repair the internet.

914
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:59,901
But they're saying that I killed her.

915
00:56:59,986 --> 00:57:01,897
I really didn't do it.

916
00:57:01,996 --> 00:57:03,702
But the whole world
says that I'm a murderer.

917
00:57:06,963 --> 00:57:09,630
This is such a terrible situation.

918
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:14,731
Okay. Let's have you
turn yourself in first.

919
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:16,299
I'll come with you.

920
00:57:17,835 --> 00:57:19,102
I am going to turn myself in.

921
00:57:19,597 --> 00:57:20,797
I will...

922
00:57:25,397 --> 00:57:26,231
Wootak.

923
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:30,824
You're going to help me, aren't you?

924
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:33,797
You're the only successful
person among the guys I know.

925
00:57:33,864 --> 00:57:36,553
You have power and
smarts since you're police.

926
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:39,155
That's why I came here.

927
00:57:40,497 --> 00:57:41,597
You believe me, don't you?

928
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:43,593
You're going to be on my side, aren't you?

929
00:57:47,503 --> 00:57:48,898
Do I have to tell you that
I believe in you...

930
00:57:50,734 --> 00:57:51,868
...to have you turn yourself in?

931
00:57:56,363 --> 00:57:57,496
Hakyoung.

932
00:58:01,278 --> 00:58:06,483
If I become a murderer like this...

933
00:58:09,019 --> 00:58:11,187
...I'm going to reveal
your secret to the police.

934
00:58:28,163 --> 00:58:28,964
Do Hakyoung.

935
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,507
You don't want that, do you?

936
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:31,996
So...

937
00:58:32,697 --> 00:58:34,577
...you have to prove my innocence...

938
00:58:36,963 --> 00:58:38,214
...no matter what.

939
00:59:06,363 --> 00:59:08,145
"While You Were Sleeping"

940
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:09,131
Do Hakyoung is my friend.

941
00:59:09,216 --> 00:59:11,931
The law will reveal my innocence.

942
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:12,597
Hakyoung will never...

943
00:59:12,664 --> 00:59:14,802
How can you guarantee that
he's not someone who would commit murder?

944
00:59:14,887 --> 00:59:16,678
What will happen if I don't indict him?

945
00:59:16,763 --> 00:59:19,838
You'll get fired.
You'll be blamed by the whole country.

946
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:22,289
I want Do Hakyoung to pay for his crimes.

947
00:59:22,374 --> 00:59:24,497
I think I'll be disappointed if you fail.

948
00:59:24,597 --> 00:59:27,231
Jaechan can't indict him with
the evidence he has right now.

949
00:59:27,316 --> 00:59:29,695
You'll have to help Jaechan
so that he can indict him.

950
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:31,264
Do Hakyoung had
motives for murder.

951
00:59:31,363 --> 00:59:33,919
That's just assumption.
Assumption can't be evidence.

952
00:59:34,004 --> 00:59:38,234
I like you so much that I don't
want to disappoint you at all.

953
