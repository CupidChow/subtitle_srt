1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,034
"While You Were Sleeping"

2
00:00:05,801 --> 00:00:08,302
"Episode 15"

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,934
This is patrol vehicle number four
from Sanggu Police Station.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,334
We received a call about a kidnapping.

5
00:00:11,434 --> 00:00:12,668
The rooftop of
Haekwang Law Firm in Moguk-dong.

6
00:00:12,734 --> 00:00:14,435
We need assistance
from other patrol units.

7
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:17,033
Is the information reliable?

8
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:20,001
Yes. We have to get there in five minutes.

9
00:00:36,383 --> 00:00:37,218
Sir.

10
00:00:37,367 --> 00:00:38,601
Please go faster.

11
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:08,835
Once you receive this shot...

12
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:11,601
...your muscles in your entire
body will be paralyzed.

13
00:01:12,734 --> 00:01:14,767
Then you won't be able to breathe...

14
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,834
...and you'll die as if you're falling
asleep within 5 minutes.

15
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,400
It's a blessed death.

16
00:01:29,734 --> 00:01:31,134
What time is it?

17
00:01:33,734 --> 00:01:34,767
What time is it?

18
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:37,034
Where am I?

19
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:42,101
Do you want to know where and
what time you're going to die?

20
00:01:43,467 --> 00:01:47,467
This is the rooftop of
Haekwang Law Firm and its 10:30 PM.

21
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,300
Jaechan...

22
00:01:55,267 --> 00:01:56,300
Did you hear that?

23
00:01:57,334 --> 00:01:58,401
You heard her, right?

24
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:21,601
She's an interesting woman.

25
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,700
What's wrong with this?
Why isn't this working?

26
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:50,868
Oh?

27
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:53,601
What's going on?

28
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:55,402
How do we get to the roof?

29
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:57,668
There's power outage,
so the elevator has stopped.

30
00:02:58,934 --> 00:03:01,067
There's an emergency elevator
at the end over there.

31
00:03:02,868 --> 00:03:04,535
Let me borrow this flash light.

32
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:18,302
What's wrong?

33
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,467
You look scary.

34
00:03:23,968 --> 00:03:25,535
You look like you're about to kill me.

35
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,934
Yes.

36
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:29,469
That's what I'm going to do.

37
00:03:33,634 --> 00:03:35,701
Are you saying that you're
going to become a murderer?

38
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:37,934
No.

39
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:40,967
I'm saying that
I'm going to get rid of the trash.

40
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:49,701
You tried to kill that reporter and me.

41
00:03:50,467 --> 00:03:54,201
In the process of stopping you,
I had no choice but to kill you.

42
00:03:55,434 --> 00:03:59,734
I'll be acquitted for
self-defense of a third party.

43
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:04,233
You said yourself.

44
00:04:04,767 --> 00:04:06,067
I should clean it up.

45
00:04:07,267 --> 00:04:10,201
That I should makes sure that
it's a win-win for everyone.

46
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,101
This is the answer that I found.

47
00:04:29,701 --> 00:04:31,035
Wootak. It's there.

48
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,001
It's there.

49
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:46,001
Hongjoo!

50
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:50,001
Please help Nam Hongjoo.

51
00:05:05,968 --> 00:05:07,235
What's going on?

52
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:09,858
What happened?

53
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,334
Look here. Are you okay?

54
00:05:12,801 --> 00:05:14,402
Don't worry about me.
Please help Nam Hongjoo.

55
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:26,469
Hongjoo!

56
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:29,268
She has a pulse.

57
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:30,834
-Put her down.
-Excuse me?

58
00:05:33,868 --> 00:05:35,202
Her pulse is not the problem.

59
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,901
Her lungs are paralyzed,
so she can't breathe right now.

60
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,067
-Excuse me?
-Explain the situation to the paramedic...

61
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:40,367
...and tell them to come
quickly with the respirator.

62
00:05:40,434 --> 00:05:41,135
Okay.

63
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:45,634
Hongjoo. Please...

64
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,700
Please hold on.

65
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:50,201
Please...

66
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:01,734
Hongjoo...

67
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:03,200
Hongjoo. Please...

68
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:10,668
Hongjoo...

69
00:06:11,634 --> 00:06:12,734
Hongjoo, please...

70
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:30,088
Get up!

71
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:32,368
Hey!

72
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:34,669
Hongjoo.

73
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:37,134
Please hold on.

74
00:07:11,467 --> 00:07:18,268
"Stand By Me"

75
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:36,001
Are you alright?

76
00:07:37,234 --> 00:07:40,601
Yes. I'm a little dizzy, but I'm fine.

77
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:42,502
We're from Han River Police Station.

78
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,300
Would you be able to tell us
the circumstance of the incident?

79
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:53,734
I met with Nam Hongjoo and I was
interviewing her while drinking coffee.

80
00:07:54,601 --> 00:07:56,935
But suddenly I lost all
my strength in my body.

81
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:00,968
It looks like someone drugged me.

82
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:11,201
While my mind was hazy,
I saw a woman named...

83
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,333
...Ha Joohan carrying
Reporter Nam Hongjoo on her back.

84
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,734
I went after her to try to stop her...

85
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,393
...but my body wouldn't listen
to me because I was drugged.

86
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:22,268
Ha Joohan is the person who fell from
the roof and died. Is that right?

87
00:08:23,334 --> 00:08:24,068
Yes...

88
00:08:24,834 --> 00:08:26,702
She came to see me a little while ago.

89
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:28,667
She came to me
for consultation saying that...

90
00:08:28,734 --> 00:08:31,549
...she's the real culprit
of the IV serial murders.

91
00:08:31,634 --> 00:08:33,968
There was a real culprit of those murders?

92
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:35,783
Yes.

93
00:08:36,534 --> 00:08:37,534
My goodness.

94
00:08:37,868 --> 00:08:41,669
I advised her to turn herself in,
but she didn't listen to me.

95
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:45,034
She saw me meeting with Nam Hongjoo.

96
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:48,669
She must've misunderstood that I was going
to leak the information to the media.

97
00:08:48,734 --> 00:08:51,134
So, she drugged both of you
in order to murder you both.

98
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,433
Well. That's my assumption.

99
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:56,101
Then, what happened afterwards?

100
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:59,568
I felt weak, but I was conscious enough.

101
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,600
I thought I had to stop her
from committing another murder.

102
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,101
So, I was barely able to
follow her to the roof.

103
00:09:06,501 --> 00:09:07,035
No!

104
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,300
But Ha Joohan was already
injecting her with the drug.

105
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,135
I wanted to stop her...

106
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:14,634
...but my body wouldn't listen
to me because of the drugs.

107
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:18,334
Then, Ha Joohan started
attacking me right away.

108
00:09:21,734 --> 00:09:25,149
I was fighting her in order to stop her.

109
00:09:25,234 --> 00:09:27,068
I had no choice but
to push her off of me...

110
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,968
...and she fell off.

111
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:34,634
After that you lost consciousness
trying to save Reporter Nam Hongjoo.

112
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:35,735
Yes.

113
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:40,934
If I wasn't drugged...

114
00:09:41,634 --> 00:09:43,602
...I could've saved Nam Hongjoo...

115
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:47,035
Don't worry. Nam Hongjoo is safe.

116
00:09:55,534 --> 00:09:56,567
She's safe?

117
00:09:57,868 --> 00:09:59,268
Are you saying that she's alive?

118
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,034
Yes. She's alive.

119
00:10:03,267 --> 00:10:04,367
How did she...

120
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:07,935
I thought that you die in five minutes
once that drug is injected...

121
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:10,367
Yes. Everyone said that it was a miracle.

122
00:10:10,534 --> 00:10:12,868
They said she would've
died if they were a minute late.

123
00:10:13,434 --> 00:10:16,567
Prosecutor Jung Jaechan administered
CPR quickly and saved her.

124
00:10:16,934 --> 00:10:18,168
Prosecutor Jung Jaechan?

125
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:20,334
Did Prosecutor Jung come to the scene?

126
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:21,568
She was so fortunate,
don't you think so?

127
00:10:22,234 --> 00:10:24,234
You could say that the heaven helped her.

128
00:10:27,968 --> 00:10:28,902
You're right.

129
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:32,801
She was very fortunate.

130
00:10:58,567 --> 00:11:01,634
Doctor. How is Hongjoo doing?

131
00:11:01,734 --> 00:11:03,001
She's turned overcome the critical time.

132
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,701
Thankfully, she was administered
first-aid quickly so she survived.

133
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,318
However...

134
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,433
...we can't guarantee
when she will regain...

135
00:11:11,501 --> 00:11:13,135
...her consciousness at the moment.

136
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:14,801
What do you mean you can't guarantee it?

137
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,692
She couldn't breathe for
a lengthy period of time.

138
00:11:16,767 --> 00:11:19,434
There was no oxygen to her brain
for that period of time.

139
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:21,801
And there was
a psychological shock as well.

140
00:11:21,901 --> 00:11:25,435
It's difficult to be optimistic or
pessimistic at the current moment.

141
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:26,235
Goodness.

142
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:27,235
Mother.

143
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:30,101
I'm okay.

144
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:31,467
I'm sorry.

145
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,516
I should've stopped it a little sooner.

146
00:11:33,601 --> 00:11:36,734
No. Thank you. You saved her.

147
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,500
It's a miracle that she's alive.

148
00:11:39,934 --> 00:11:41,134
Don't worry.

149
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,334
Hongjoo will wake up...

150
00:11:43,734 --> 00:11:45,335
...without any problems.

151
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:13,734
How is Hongjoo?

152
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,034
She has overcome the critical time...

153
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:18,635
...but she hasn't regained
her consciousness yet.

154
00:12:20,534 --> 00:12:21,468
I...

155
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:25,401
...just heard Attorney Lee Yoobum
giving his side of the story.

156
00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:28,567
What did he say?

157
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:33,467
It looks like he's going
to claim self-defense.

158
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:42,502
Where is Lee Yoobum right now?

159
00:12:43,033 --> 00:12:44,233
Is he in the ER?

160
00:12:45,601 --> 00:12:46,535
Jaechan.

161
00:12:53,234 --> 00:12:54,234
Mr. Choi.

162
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:03,635
Just why...

163
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,467
Why?

164
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,767
Why did you suddenly...

165
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:11,601
How could you just leave like this?

166
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:13,667
Why did you have to do it now?

167
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,068
Why now...

168
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:18,967
How...

169
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:22,901
...could you...

170
00:13:24,334 --> 00:13:25,235
...just leave me...

171
00:13:27,334 --> 00:13:28,734
...alone like that?

172
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:41,635
Mr. Choi.

173
00:13:42,601 --> 00:13:44,569
I'm sorry, Prosecutor Jung.

174
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:04,668
No one knows that you resigned.

175
00:14:05,267 --> 00:14:07,501
Miss Hyangmi said she
didn't tell anyone either.

176
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,534
Just consider it as you were
on a vacation for few days.

177
00:14:10,968 --> 00:14:11,902
Then you can just return to work...

178
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,534
I'm not going to return to work.

179
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:18,135
I'm going to work at Haekwang Law Firm.

180
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,300
Are you saying that you're resigning so
that you can go work for Yoobum?

181
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,834
Yes.

182
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,501
Why would you...

183
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:34,600
Long time ago...

184
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,934
My younger brother
committed armed desertion.

185
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,635
Every time he called me and told
me that he was having a hard time...

186
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,901
...I just told him that everyone goes
through it and he'd mature through it.

187
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:56,235
I just scolded him like that.

188
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:59,401
I wouldn't even hear him out.

189
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:04,001
I felt sorry for that.

190
00:15:05,501 --> 00:15:07,268
I felt so sorry for that.

191
00:15:08,634 --> 00:15:11,201
So when he deserted and came to me...

192
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:16,068
...I was more in a hurry to feed
his hungry stomach rather than...

193
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,234
...making him turn himself in
and return him to the army.

194
00:15:29,534 --> 00:15:32,101
When I heard that he killed
the chief...

195
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,534
...and other people...

196
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:45,901
...I wanted to die.

197
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:49,234
I ended up aiding and abetting him.

198
00:15:53,868 --> 00:15:55,102
Why do you have to do it now?

199
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,334
You had a lot of time.

200
00:15:57,534 --> 00:15:59,168
You should've talked to
him when you met him.

201
00:15:59,267 --> 00:16:00,534
Then it would've been easier.

202
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,149
What do you want me to do about it now?

203
00:16:02,234 --> 00:16:03,367
Do you want me to forgive you?

204
00:16:03,467 --> 00:16:04,600
Or do you want me to hate you more now?

205
00:16:04,701 --> 00:16:05,602
No.

206
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,101
You asked me why I'm
going to work for Haekwang.

207
00:16:11,534 --> 00:16:13,168
That's why I'm answering you.

208
00:16:18,033 --> 00:16:20,133
I don't want to aid and abet him.

209
00:16:21,868 --> 00:16:24,335
I can't let it happen like before.

210
00:16:28,334 --> 00:16:29,901
That's why I'm quitting.

211
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,600
I don't have any other reason.

212
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:32,635
Mr. Choi.

213
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:35,501
Don't act rash now, Prosecutor Jung.

214
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:38,302
If you go after Attorney Lee Yoobum
and question him now...

215
00:16:38,801 --> 00:16:40,535
...it will only be a rash decision.

216
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:43,001
If you act rash now,
you won't be able to do anything else.

217
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,534
You won't be able to investigate
this case or try this case in court.

218
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:53,601
Make your choice between the two.

219
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:55,835
You can go to beat up Attorney Lee now...

220
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:58,734
...and get taken off
the investigation and trial.

221
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:00,935
Or you can hold yourself back for now...

222
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:03,400
...and beat him up properly...

223
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,601
...through investigation and trial.

224
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:41,568
How did you know that I was here?

225
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,567
I just sensed it like it was telepathy...

226
00:17:50,634 --> 00:17:53,034
I just sensed that you wouldn't
be able to do anything...

227
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,467
...if you beat up
Attorney Lee at this time.

228
00:17:54,634 --> 00:17:56,734
I have a bit of superhuman ability.

229
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,034
Why? Do I sound ridiculous?

230
00:18:04,601 --> 00:18:05,435
No.

231
00:18:06,968 --> 00:18:08,602
I don't think it's ridiculous.

232
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:13,535
I...

233
00:18:16,267 --> 00:18:17,567
...will not act rash.

234
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:22,901
That's right.

235
00:18:26,634 --> 00:18:29,201
That's how my chief's son would act.

236
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,801
I really missed you.

237
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:41,401
My chief's son...

238
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,986
Are you sure that Ha Joohan is
the suspect for the trailer arson case?

239
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:33,915
The person that was caught on
the CCTV at the gas station buying gas...

240
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,592
...and the footprints found at
the scene are a match to Ha Joohan.

241
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:38,349
We traced the burner phone...

242
00:19:38,434 --> 00:19:41,196
...that Ha Joohan had and it was
the same line as the suspect.

243
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:44,767
Then, let's conclude that Ha Joohan
was the culprit of the arson case.

244
00:19:44,868 --> 00:19:46,868
Now that she's dead,
there's no need to indict her.

245
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:48,402
So, wrap it up as no need to indict.

246
00:19:48,501 --> 00:19:50,501
-Yes, Sir.
-Yes, Sir.

247
00:19:51,334 --> 00:19:52,467
And...

248
00:19:52,634 --> 00:19:55,849
...we're also sure that Ha Joohan is
the real culprit of the IV murders, right?

249
00:19:55,934 --> 00:19:58,601
When we looked over the incidents
after Myung Yiseok was arrested...

250
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:01,417
...all the victims were in the same
hospital room as Ha Joohan.

251
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:02,835
We searched and seized Ha Joohan's house.

252
00:20:02,934 --> 00:20:05,001
And we found the syringe and
medicine bottles used in the crimes.

253
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:06,901
It's also a match to the medicine
bottle found at the scene.

254
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:11,034
Then this case is also no need to
indict due to Han Joohan's death.

255
00:20:13,801 --> 00:20:16,001
What about the evidence fabrication?

256
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:19,401
It was Ha Joohan who
fabricated the evidence.

257
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,202
It wasn't me.

258
00:20:22,968 --> 00:20:27,635
So, you're saying that it was Ha Joohan
who framed his father and not you?

259
00:20:27,734 --> 00:20:29,301
If my memory is correct...

260
00:20:29,868 --> 00:20:33,035
...we found those medicine bottles from
your father's office at the hospital.

261
00:20:33,434 --> 00:20:35,035
If it's the hospital office...

262
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,568
...Ha Joohan could've had access to it.

263
00:20:39,467 --> 00:20:41,467
What do you think?
Doesn't it make sense?

264
00:20:42,434 --> 00:20:43,368
It does...

265
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,034
It makes sense so easily,
so why was it so difficult back then?

266
00:20:49,534 --> 00:20:52,001
Why couldn't you think of that back then?

267
00:20:56,067 --> 00:20:57,301
-He knelt down.
-He knelt down.

268
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:01,735
I'm sorry.

269
00:21:03,834 --> 00:21:06,435
I should've kept questioning it.

270
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:10,669
I just didn't think that there would be
such a calculative culprit like Ha Joohan.

271
00:21:11,234 --> 00:21:13,001
Yes. It was my carelessness...

272
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:16,600
Then you should take responsibility
since it was your carelessness...

273
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,369
I want to take responsibility too.

274
00:21:20,767 --> 00:21:22,301
But carelessness...

275
00:21:25,634 --> 00:21:27,001
...is not against the law.

276
00:21:32,601 --> 00:21:36,102
-Bring my father back!
-Daegoo!

277
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,367
Shouldn't we stop him?

278
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:39,668
Bring my father back.

279
00:21:45,601 --> 00:21:50,035
Now that Ha Joohan is dead,
many cases are wrapped up in vain.

280
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,434
I know. It was concluded that
Ha Joohan did everything.

281
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:57,002
We just need to focus on concluding
this case.

282
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,334
"Maintenance of a public prosecution"

283
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:03,535
Hongjoo just regained her consciousness.

284
00:22:05,634 --> 00:22:07,335
Sir. I need to go somewhere.

285
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,067
Why? What is it?

286
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:10,701
Reporter Nam
has regained her consciousness.

287
00:22:10,834 --> 00:22:13,234
That's great. Hurry up and go.

288
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,301
Yes, Sir. I'll be back.

289
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,301
Go.

290
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,067
-All the best!
-That's really great.

291
00:22:17,133 --> 00:22:18,433
We were so worried.

292
00:22:20,634 --> 00:22:21,535
Prosecutor Lee.

293
00:22:21,767 --> 00:22:23,282
What do you think about
teaming up with Jaechan...

294
00:22:23,367 --> 00:22:24,901
...to go against the CEO of the law firm?

295
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,100
Mr. Ko himself will defend Lee Yoobum.

296
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,200
It will difficult for you
to handle him alone.

297
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:34,767
You think I can't handle him by myself?

298
00:22:34,968 --> 00:22:36,702
He might be a CEO,
but he's still just a lawyer.

299
00:22:36,801 --> 00:22:39,068
How good can he be?

300
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:42,135
He was able to turn down
the arrest warrant for Lee Yoobum.

301
00:22:42,234 --> 00:22:43,168
He's a murder suspect...

302
00:22:43,267 --> 00:22:45,001
...but he was able to let him be
investigated without being arrested.

303
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,182
Isn't that pretty amazing?

304
00:22:46,267 --> 00:22:48,868
That's why his annual
salary is 10 billion won.

305
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:49,735
10 billion won?

306
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:53,135
Wow. Then how much does he make a day?

307
00:22:53,234 --> 00:22:54,935
He makes about 27 million a day.

308
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,367
So, he makes more than you
make a year if he just works 4 days.

309
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,200
I calculate pretty fast, don't I?

310
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:00,967
That's fast.

311
00:23:01,033 --> 00:23:03,001
That's so fast that it's
making me want to swear.

312
00:23:05,868 --> 00:23:09,102
I'll team up with Jaechan and proceed.

313
00:23:16,834 --> 00:23:18,768
"Intensive Care Unit"

314
00:23:19,634 --> 00:23:21,901
"Visiting hours: 11:00 AM - 11:30 AM"

315
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,315
Excuse me. Let me go inside for a moment.

316
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,301
Just for five minutes.
No. Just for a minute.

317
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:33,500
I'll just look at her face and come out.

318
00:23:33,567 --> 00:23:35,616
I'm sorry. Please come
at the next visiting hours.

319
00:23:35,701 --> 00:23:38,602
Please let me just
check to see if she's okay.

320
00:23:38,801 --> 00:23:40,268
I'm okay.

321
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,400
Hongjoo.

322
00:23:57,601 --> 00:23:58,502
Are you okay?

323
00:23:58,601 --> 00:23:59,835
Are you able to move your arms and legs?

324
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,734
Do you recognize me?

325
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:03,734
Of course I do.

326
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,367
I also know that you
worked so hard to save me.

327
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,533
I heard everything
without missing anything.

328
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,067
I'm glad.

329
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:31,568
I'm so glad.

330
00:24:34,434 --> 00:24:35,402
Thank you...

331
00:24:36,801 --> 00:24:39,702
...for erasing the nightmare
that I've had for a long time.

332
00:24:55,567 --> 00:24:56,634
Are you able to walk?

333
00:24:56,701 --> 00:24:57,834
Are you sure you're not dizzy?

334
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,868
Yes. I was waiting out
here because I'm fine.

335
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,267
I'm going to get transferred to
a normal ward a little later.

336
00:25:04,934 --> 00:25:06,568
How did you know
that I was going to be late?

337
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:07,867
Did you dream about me again?

338
00:25:07,934 --> 00:25:10,134
I dreamt about you
a lot while I kept sleeping.

339
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,421
So, I know what's happening
with the case...

340
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:16,101
...and what ridiculous things
Lee Yoobum is saying.

341
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:20,233
And I also know about Mr. Choi too.

342
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:25,135
Mr. Choi was that policeman.

343
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:27,934
Yes.

344
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,934
You were crying in my dream.

345
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:43,268
I cried with you too.

346
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,034
Mr. Choi.

347
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:10,834
I came to deliver your coffee.

348
00:26:10,901 --> 00:26:12,201
Thank you.

349
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,501
What do you think?
Do you like your seat?

350
00:26:14,734 --> 00:26:19,201
Yes. My desk is bigger than
the Chief Prosecutor's desk.

351
00:26:19,467 --> 00:26:21,630
There are fitness
facility and sauna here...

352
00:26:21,701 --> 00:26:22,935
...so you should use them sometimes.

353
00:26:23,234 --> 00:26:26,434
I'll have to brag about it Hyangmi.

354
00:26:27,334 --> 00:26:28,634
That's right.

355
00:26:29,067 --> 00:26:32,668
I heard that Reporter Nam Hongjoo
regained her consciousness.

356
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:34,834
She regained her consciousness?

357
00:26:36,033 --> 00:26:36,867
What's wrong?

358
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:38,400
Isn't that great news?

359
00:26:39,334 --> 00:26:40,202
Of course.

360
00:26:41,501 --> 00:26:42,402
That's great.

361
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:45,035
That's great.

362
00:26:46,634 --> 00:26:50,335
Of course it's great.
We have another ally now.

363
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,234
Sir.

364
00:26:53,434 --> 00:26:54,534
Hello.

365
00:26:56,601 --> 00:26:59,801
I just have to read what you
wrote ate the trial, right?

366
00:27:00,901 --> 00:27:02,702
Did you prepare the draft?

367
00:27:02,801 --> 00:27:03,535
Yes.

368
00:27:13,901 --> 00:27:15,268
Is this it?

369
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:16,068
Yes.

370
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:20,115
Set up a dinner meeting with Miss Nam.

371
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,190
Since she's on our side...

372
00:27:21,267 --> 00:27:23,101
...we should be on the same
page for the trial.

373
00:27:26,606 --> 00:27:27,440
Mr. Ko.

374
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,334
-I have something to tell you.
-Yes?

375
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,001
What is it?

376
00:27:32,534 --> 00:27:35,571
Reporter Nam Hongjoo
might not be on our side.

377
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:36,901
Why isn't she on our side?

378
00:27:37,767 --> 00:27:39,501
You risked your life to save her.

379
00:27:39,601 --> 00:27:42,135
She might have
a misunderstanding about me.

380
00:27:42,234 --> 00:27:44,367
It was so chaotic at the time.

381
00:27:53,701 --> 00:27:55,535
Tell me what that misunderstanding is.

382
00:27:56,234 --> 00:27:58,085
I'm going into a trial after a long time.

383
00:27:58,167 --> 00:27:59,534
I don't want to be humiliated.

384
00:28:11,234 --> 00:28:12,468
Look here, Mr. Lee.

385
00:28:13,033 --> 00:28:13,700
Yes.

386
00:28:13,934 --> 00:28:16,802
Do you think I'm defending
you because I care about you?

387
00:28:17,367 --> 00:28:19,467
Do you think I'm doing this
to make some pocket money?

388
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:21,034
No.

389
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:22,644
I don't think that way.

390
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,867
I'm not interested in knowing
what kind of person you are.

391
00:28:24,934 --> 00:28:25,967
I wouldn't even believe you.

392
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,734
I don't care if you kill her
by mistake or on purpose.

393
00:28:32,334 --> 00:28:36,168
I just don't want
my law firm to be tainted.

394
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,867
I need you to tell me the truth,
so I can get rid of it or hide it.

395
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,200
So go ahead and tell me...

396
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,634
...what that misunderstanding is.

397
00:28:49,701 --> 00:28:50,435
Sir.

398
00:28:51,601 --> 00:28:52,601
The truth is...

399
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,333
Getting discharged is not a big deal.

400
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,533
We've could've gone home by ourselves.

401
00:28:59,868 --> 00:29:02,102
I know, right. I'm not a child.

402
00:29:02,434 --> 00:29:05,168
You're not a child but you're
an important witness in the trial.

403
00:29:05,467 --> 00:29:07,215
I requested for police protection
from Prosecutor's Office.

404
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,697
Police protection too?

405
00:29:08,767 --> 00:29:10,934
I'm sure nothing will happen,
but you never know.

406
00:29:11,033 --> 00:29:13,001
We have to make sure that
Yoobum doesn't hurt you.

407
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,133
So, are they going to follow
me around until the trial?

408
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,200
Yes. Just endure it for few days.
The trial will start soon.

409
00:29:22,567 --> 00:29:23,734
They're here.

410
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:31,768
Hello.

411
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:33,168
What?

412
00:29:33,267 --> 00:29:35,357
We've been assigned to handle
Miss Nam Hongjoo's protection.

413
00:29:35,434 --> 00:29:37,001
I'm Lieutenant Han Wootak
from Third Patrol Division.

414
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,467
I'm Lieutenant Oh Kyunghan.

415
00:29:39,067 --> 00:29:42,234
We'll protect you
until the trial starts.

416
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,200
Han Wootak.

417
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:46,534
I'm glad it's someone we know.

418
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:49,700
How are you feeling?
I was quite worried.

419
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:51,168
Yes. I'm okay.

420
00:29:51,868 --> 00:29:55,469
Jaechan told me everything.
You helped a lot to save me.

421
00:29:55,601 --> 00:29:57,182
He didn't do that much.

422
00:29:57,834 --> 00:30:00,401
Are you the only
policeman in your station?

423
00:30:00,501 --> 00:30:01,335
I know, right?

424
00:30:01,434 --> 00:30:03,801
I was quite surprised when
I was given this assignment.

425
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,569
What a coincidence...

426
00:30:06,067 --> 00:30:09,768
It's not a coincidence. That's nonsense.

427
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:11,868
Isn't it one of the two?

428
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:16,902
Prosecutor Jung Jaechan chose him or
Lieutenant Han Wootak volunteered.

429
00:30:16,968 --> 00:30:18,302
I didn't do it.

430
00:30:18,434 --> 00:30:19,501
I didn't do it, either.

431
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:25,040
One of you is acting coy.

432
00:30:25,133 --> 00:30:27,467
But I'm not interested. Please follow me.

433
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:29,934
Thank you.

434
00:30:30,067 --> 00:30:31,334
Move aside, brat.

435
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:35,268
You're acting coy.

436
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:36,667
Not at all.

437
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:38,168
Drive carefully.

438
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:52,201
Let's order food from
Dongchoonho for dinner.

439
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,836
And I want you to check this seizure list.

440
00:30:53,934 --> 00:30:54,568
Okay.

441
00:30:55,234 --> 00:30:57,639
Dongchoonho doesn't open on Sundays.
Should I boil water for cup ramyeon?

442
00:30:57,734 --> 00:30:59,101
That's okay. I'll make it.

443
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,467
Do you want me to make one for you too?

444
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:02,834
Yes, please. I'll have the kimchi one.

445
00:31:10,334 --> 00:31:11,935
How can you be so calm?

446
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,268
What do you mean?

447
00:31:13,334 --> 00:31:15,334
Reporter Nam almost died.

448
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:17,167
If I was you...

449
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,982
...I would've grabbed Lee Yoobum by
his throat at least a hundred times.

450
00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:21,568
Do I look calm?

451
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:23,700
Yes. I'm starting to get a little scared.

452
00:31:23,968 --> 00:31:25,101
I'm not, though.

453
00:31:25,534 --> 00:31:27,001
I'm very angry.

454
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,167
Lee Yoobum!

455
00:31:35,267 --> 00:31:37,849
I keep thinking about grabbing
Yoobum by his throat...

456
00:31:37,934 --> 00:31:39,034
...and beating him up.

457
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,167
But?

458
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,868
Stop it, you brat.

459
00:31:43,934 --> 00:31:46,601
When I imagine what would
happen next, it horrified me.

460
00:31:47,067 --> 00:31:49,200
I'd get taken off
of the investigation and the trial.

461
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:51,368
I'd just become a fool and
won't be able to do anything.

462
00:31:52,033 --> 00:31:54,667
I can't question him or approach him.

463
00:31:55,133 --> 00:31:56,166
I'd ruin everything.

464
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,868
That's why you're holding it in?

465
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:05,535
Yes. My jaw is numb every morning.

466
00:32:05,734 --> 00:32:07,268
Because I'm clinching
my teeth every night.

467
00:32:07,434 --> 00:32:09,567
I have a mouth guard.
Do you want me to lend it to you?

468
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:10,667
If you sleep with it,
it's a little better.

469
00:32:10,767 --> 00:32:12,601
You should've said so earlier.

470
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:14,734
Then, please bring it for me tomorrow.

471
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:18,336
Yes. I will.

472
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,667
Everything I have is yours, Jaechan.

473
00:32:21,334 --> 00:32:25,202
I need to let you have
my car and my mouth guard.

474
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,867
"Medicine bottle (Vecaron)"

475
00:32:27,934 --> 00:32:31,101
Whose writing is this?

476
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,233
It's my handwriting.

477
00:32:32,334 --> 00:32:35,701
Could you read the part
that has been marked here, please?

478
00:32:36,033 --> 00:32:37,433
I have bad eyesight.

479
00:32:38,033 --> 00:32:40,300
You cannot make a mistake.
Do you understand?

480
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,603
Witness. Why can't you remember
the colors of the umbrellas?

481
00:32:43,701 --> 00:32:45,222
What color was the umbrella?

482
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,333
I can't tell colors apart.

483
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,367
What do I do, Robin?

484
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,701
I think I'm going to ruin everything.

485
00:33:20,534 --> 00:33:21,934
Relax.

486
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:24,333
The first day will end with just
going through the evidence list.

487
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,934
There's 10 Billion Won.
10 Billion Won at 3 o'clock.

488
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:34,533
Prosecutor Lee Jikwang.
I heard a lot about you.

489
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:37,768
Take it easy on us, Prosecutor Jung.

490
00:33:38,467 --> 00:33:40,115
We should be asking you that.

491
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,901
10 Billion... I mean Mr. Ko.

492
00:33:43,434 --> 00:33:46,862
I can tell from the evidence list that
your investigation was quite thorough...

493
00:33:46,934 --> 00:33:47,986
Is that right?

494
00:33:48,167 --> 00:33:50,668
But still, don't disagree too much
with the evidence I have.

495
00:33:50,767 --> 00:33:53,368
-It will be a headache, you know?
-Yes, I do.

496
00:33:53,467 --> 00:33:56,034
I also hate if delays happen in trial.

497
00:34:05,434 --> 00:34:06,268
Defense Council.

498
00:34:06,534 --> 00:34:08,601
Would you like to dispute any evidence?

499
00:34:08,701 --> 00:34:09,602
Yes.

500
00:34:09,968 --> 00:34:12,735
We disagree on evidence number three...

501
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,201
...number seven and number eleven.

502
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,300
What's with that?
He said he wasn't going to disagree.

503
00:34:18,367 --> 00:34:20,567
Go ahead and disagree on everything.

504
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:23,067
I was going to disagree on
number 15 also...

505
00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:24,601
...but I'll let that go.

506
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:27,168
Oh my goodness. Thank you.

507
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:29,968
I disagree on number 17.

508
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:33,300
Number 17 is the victim,
Nam Hongjoo's testimony.

509
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:34,501
You're disagreeing on that?

510
00:34:34,567 --> 00:34:38,001
Yes. The victim Nam Hongjoo
is the only witness of this case.

511
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,968
Her testimony can decide
the outcome of this trial.

512
00:34:41,033 --> 00:34:45,700
Therefore, we need to hear her
testimony and decide on the credibility.

513
00:34:48,434 --> 00:34:49,901
Yes. I understand.

514
00:34:50,701 --> 00:34:52,296
Is there anything else
that you don't agree?

515
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,234
Yes. There's quite a bit more.

516
00:34:54,667 --> 00:34:56,001
I disagree on number 19.

517
00:34:56,601 --> 00:34:58,734
What? Why is he disagreeing
on Mr. Choi's testimony?

518
00:34:59,033 --> 00:35:00,934
Do we need to summon Choi Damdong, too?

519
00:35:01,033 --> 00:35:07,033
Yes. The prosecution indicted my client
for murdering Ha Joohan...

520
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:09,701
...to bury the evidence fabrication
in the case of IV serial murders.

521
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,801
We need to call upon Choi Damdong...

522
00:35:12,868 --> 00:35:14,968
...to find out what happened in detail.

523
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:23,567
And I disagree on number 34 and 44...

524
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:25,734
Number 44 also?

525
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:28,934
Then, do we need
to summon Han Wootak also?

526
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,001
The prosecution is claiming that
my client committed murder...

527
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,334
...and instigation of murder based
on Han Wootak's testimony.

528
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:39,602
We need to confirm
his witness at the trial.

529
00:35:40,567 --> 00:35:42,068
Then, the prosecutors.

530
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:43,601
Will you request
the witnesses, Nam Hongjoo...

531
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:46,134
...Choi Damdong and Han Wootak
to be summoned...

532
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,068
...at the next trial date in order for
the defense to question them?

533
00:35:48,501 --> 00:35:49,945
-Yes, Your Honor.
-Yes, Your Honor.

534
00:35:51,701 --> 00:35:55,035
He's trying to impeach all the witnesses.

535
00:35:55,934 --> 00:35:57,268
This is going to be a long trial.

536
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:09,667
What is all this?

537
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,701
You worked so hard to guard
Hongjoo for the past several days.

538
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:14,167
I wanted to treat you to something.

539
00:36:14,534 --> 00:36:16,768
This is my thanks.

540
00:36:16,868 --> 00:36:18,469
I've always felt this.

541
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:21,936
You're quite stingy when it
comes to expressing your emotion.

542
00:36:22,033 --> 00:36:23,133
-No...
-That's not right.

543
00:36:23,234 --> 00:36:24,735
He expresses his
emotion quite well to me.

544
00:36:26,734 --> 00:36:27,535
Oh my goodness.

545
00:36:28,667 --> 00:36:29,734
Who is this person?

546
00:36:31,234 --> 00:36:33,035
This is...

547
00:36:33,133 --> 00:36:34,667
Oh my gosh... It's her.

548
00:36:34,767 --> 00:36:36,368
The woman you like. Isn't it?

549
00:36:37,033 --> 00:36:37,667
What?

550
00:36:39,033 --> 00:36:39,867
Really?

551
00:36:40,834 --> 00:36:42,967
This shadow is the person you like?

552
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:44,435
Yes.

553
00:36:44,634 --> 00:36:46,535
Well... That's right.

554
00:36:47,033 --> 00:36:48,267
She's pretty.

555
00:36:48,467 --> 00:36:51,282
She seems innocent,
but also intellectual.

556
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:52,235
Am I right?

557
00:36:53,734 --> 00:36:54,535
You are?

558
00:36:54,767 --> 00:36:55,635
I meant this person.

559
00:36:55,734 --> 00:36:57,833
Hey. How can you tell how she is
just by looking at her shadow?

560
00:36:57,934 --> 00:36:59,535
I can tell right away.

561
00:36:59,834 --> 00:37:02,101
How could you not see that?

562
00:37:05,868 --> 00:37:06,868
Yes, Mr. Bong.

563
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,468
Yes. Are you going to
Lee Yoobum's trial tomorrow?

564
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,780
Jeez.

565
00:37:14,968 --> 00:37:18,502
How can she say that I don't see it?
She can't even recognize her own shadow.

566
00:37:22,067 --> 00:37:23,035
I know, right?

567
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,135
I guess you knew.

568
00:37:27,267 --> 00:37:29,434
You knew that I knew, too.

569
00:37:29,801 --> 00:37:30,502
Yes.

570
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:38,068
Let's not make things awkward between us.

571
00:37:38,901 --> 00:37:41,168
I'll pretend that I don't know,
so let's keep being friends.

572
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,434
You are quite generous.

573
00:37:45,267 --> 00:37:49,082
Then, should we start speaking
to each other informally?

574
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:51,734
Gosh. I'm not that generous.

575
00:37:53,133 --> 00:37:55,516
I think there will be a lot of
reporters at the trial tomorrow.

576
00:37:55,601 --> 00:37:56,935
I better not make any mistakes.

577
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,934
I'm so nervous.

578
00:37:59,701 --> 00:38:01,268
I'm sure you're not as nervous as me.

579
00:38:02,033 --> 00:38:03,634
I think my heart is aching.

580
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,901
Yesterday...

581
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:24,967
Today...

582
00:38:25,367 --> 00:38:26,434
And tomorrow.

583
00:38:27,434 --> 00:38:30,035
We were living each day normally,
like every other day.

584
00:38:31,367 --> 00:38:33,701
But a special day was
beginning for all of us.

585
00:38:37,267 --> 00:38:40,037
Please get in, Mr. Choi.
I'll drive you to the court.

586
00:38:41,734 --> 00:38:43,034
Sure.

587
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:46,868
It will be a delightful memory
to someone...

588
00:38:48,334 --> 00:38:49,168
Angry memory for someone else...

589
00:38:57,367 --> 00:38:59,801
And sad memory for someone else
for a very long time...

590
00:39:05,868 --> 00:39:08,015
"Today is an important day.
I'll be there to cheer you on."

591
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,934
Mr. Lee. Are you ready?

592
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,834
Of course. I'm perfectly ready.

593
00:39:20,801 --> 00:39:26,101
At the end of today,
we will hear someone's last words.

594
00:39:27,634 --> 00:39:30,701
Don't cry and beat yourself up
for just a little while.

595
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:42,001
But, don't forget it for a long time.

596
00:39:48,601 --> 00:39:49,701
You're nervous, aren't you?

597
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,167
Yes.

598
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,534
Relax.

599
00:39:58,033 --> 00:40:00,901
People will think that you're
the defendant and I'm the prosecutor.

600
00:40:01,834 --> 00:40:03,068
I'll try harder.

601
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:06,416
Don't think that trials are difficult.

602
00:40:06,501 --> 00:40:09,235
If you just think about which one makes
more sense, you'll get your answer.

603
00:40:09,934 --> 00:40:13,982
The law firm lawyer plotting together
with a serial killer to kill a reporter...

604
00:40:14,067 --> 00:40:18,367
Or a serial killer trying to kill
the lawyer and the reporter...

605
00:40:18,934 --> 00:40:20,168
Which one do you think makes more sense?

606
00:40:23,334 --> 00:40:24,135
I don't know.

607
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:26,667
I think our side makes more sense.

608
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,701
Is that right?

609
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,902
I'm curious to see...

610
00:40:31,767 --> 00:40:33,867
...which side the judge will believe.

611
00:40:34,467 --> 00:40:35,667
I'm curious, too.

612
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,134
I wonder whose words will they
believe in this time.

613
00:40:54,067 --> 00:40:54,968
Just a moment.

614
00:40:58,167 --> 00:40:59,200
Hello.

615
00:41:00,367 --> 00:41:02,868
Miss Nam. It's been a while.

616
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,034
Are you feeling better now?

617
00:41:06,501 --> 00:41:08,435
Yes. I've recovered fully.

618
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,067
I'm glad to hear that.

619
00:41:17,177 --> 00:41:18,611
It's been a long time, hasn't it?

620
00:41:19,234 --> 00:41:20,168
Mister...

621
00:41:28,067 --> 00:41:28,834
Yes.

622
00:41:30,501 --> 00:41:32,168
I missed you a lot.

623
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:35,802
Me too.

624
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,201
All rise.

625
00:41:53,267 --> 00:41:54,601
Please be seated.

626
00:41:58,501 --> 00:42:01,835
Defense Council and Prosecution.
Is everyone present?

627
00:42:01,934 --> 00:42:03,868
-Yes.
-Yes.

628
00:42:10,534 --> 00:42:12,514
The prosecution claims that...

629
00:42:12,601 --> 00:42:15,868
...the defendant murdered
Ha Joohan in order to bury...

630
00:42:15,968 --> 00:42:19,368
...the evidence fabrication
of the IV serial killer case.

631
00:42:19,701 --> 00:42:23,001
Whether the defendant fabricated
the evidence or not...

632
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,500
...is an important issue of this case.

633
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,868
Witness.

634
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:30,267
Did you went to Myung Yiseok's office
on 2014, December 12th...

635
00:42:30,801 --> 00:42:34,268
...to execute a search and seizure?

636
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,367
Yes, I did.

637
00:42:36,501 --> 00:42:40,135
The last entry on this list
says three bottles of Vecaron.

638
00:42:40,234 --> 00:42:41,416
What is Vecaron?

639
00:42:41,501 --> 00:42:45,302
It's the drug that the IV serial killer
used in her murders.

640
00:42:45,501 --> 00:42:50,168
At the time, the culprit injected
that drug and murdered 11 patients.

641
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:52,501
The real culprit
of the IV serial murders...

642
00:42:52,567 --> 00:42:54,558
...has been revealed
to be Ha Joohan now.

643
00:42:54,634 --> 00:42:57,901
There's an opinion that says,
this Vecaron bottles were fabricated.

644
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,734
Do you agree with that opinion?

645
00:43:00,801 --> 00:43:01,535
Yes.

646
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:03,334
I think that evidence was fabricated.

647
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:08,801
When I look at this list, I notice
that this important medicine bottle...

648
00:43:08,868 --> 00:43:11,968
...is written at the end of the list
with a different pen.

649
00:43:12,067 --> 00:43:13,234
What was it like this?

650
00:43:13,334 --> 00:43:16,534
We created the list of seized
items at the scene first.

651
00:43:16,734 --> 00:43:21,468
Then we came back to the office and
compared the seized items and the list.

652
00:43:21,834 --> 00:43:25,702
At that moment, we found the omitted
items and wrote it down at the end.

653
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,734
Then, whose handwriting...

654
00:43:29,901 --> 00:43:31,201
...is this?

655
00:43:33,767 --> 00:43:37,101
Whose handwriting is this?

656
00:43:38,252 --> 00:43:39,785
It's my handwriting.

657
00:43:41,734 --> 00:43:43,235
"Medicine bottle (Vecaron)"

658
00:43:46,367 --> 00:43:47,934
It's my handwriting.

659
00:43:52,434 --> 00:43:54,817
You're the one who went
out to execute the seizure.

660
00:43:54,901 --> 00:43:57,101
You're the one who wrote down the list.

661
00:43:57,167 --> 00:44:00,334
And you're the one who wrote
the additional seized item.

662
00:44:00,734 --> 00:44:01,535
Then...

663
00:44:02,234 --> 00:44:03,434
...who do you think...

664
00:44:03,534 --> 00:44:06,901
...is the prime suspect in this
evidence fabrication case?

665
00:44:11,601 --> 00:44:12,402
What is this?

666
00:44:12,767 --> 00:44:15,368
Is he trying to frame Mr. Choi
in such a dirty way right now?

667
00:44:15,834 --> 00:44:16,738
Your Honor.

668
00:44:16,834 --> 00:44:19,535
It's inappropriate to ask
questions based on speculation.

669
00:44:19,634 --> 00:44:21,301
Please disregard this question.

670
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,946
Leading questions are
allowed in cross examinations.

671
00:44:24,033 --> 00:44:25,667
I don't see any problems.

672
00:44:26,234 --> 00:44:27,068
Witness.

673
00:44:27,601 --> 00:44:28,350
Yes.

674
00:44:28,434 --> 00:44:32,121
You may refuse to answer
this question according to...

675
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,734
...the Article 148 of
the Criminal Procedure Code.

676
00:44:33,901 --> 00:44:35,702
Will you refuse to answer this question?

677
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,133
Yes. I will refuse to
answer this question.

678
00:44:41,367 --> 00:44:44,767
Then it will create suspicion that
Mr. Choi may have fabricated the evidence.

679
00:44:45,534 --> 00:44:46,667
This is a big problem.

680
00:44:48,167 --> 00:44:49,101
That is all.

681
00:44:51,367 --> 00:44:52,335
Prosecution.

682
00:44:52,434 --> 00:44:54,168
Do you have
additional question for the witness?

683
00:44:54,267 --> 00:44:55,567
Yes. We do.

684
00:44:59,767 --> 00:45:00,601
Witness.

685
00:45:01,267 --> 00:45:04,135
Where did you verify and compare
the seized items to the list?

686
00:45:05,834 --> 00:45:08,535
It was at
Prosecutor Lee Yoobum's office.

687
00:45:08,634 --> 00:45:12,235
Then who were the ones who verified
the seized items at the scene?

688
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:17,915
It was me, Mr. Seo and the prosecutor
in charge at the time, Mr. Lee Yoobum.

689
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,534
Then, there were three people
who had access to the seized items.

690
00:45:20,601 --> 00:45:22,037
And there were also three
suspects who could have...

691
00:45:22,133 --> 00:45:23,867
...fabricated the evidence.
Is that correct?

692
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,034
Yes.

693
00:45:25,367 --> 00:45:26,434
Among the three of you...

694
00:45:26,534 --> 00:45:28,534
...there was someone who received
an award from the Prosecutor General...

695
00:45:28,634 --> 00:45:30,535
...after the IV serial murder case
was concluded. Isn't that right?

696
00:45:30,868 --> 00:45:31,435
Excuse me?

697
00:45:32,834 --> 00:45:34,034
Prosecutor General's Award?

698
00:45:34,133 --> 00:45:36,166
Why is he asking such
an off the wall question?

699
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:38,702
Yes.

700
00:45:39,067 --> 00:45:40,067
Who received the award?

701
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,934
It was Attorney Lee Yoobum.

702
00:45:45,501 --> 00:45:46,720
Why didn't all three of
you receive the award?

703
00:45:46,801 --> 00:45:50,068
Well, it's because
we were mere investigators.

704
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:54,234
The responsibility and the glory of the
investigation belong to the prosecutor.

705
00:45:54,634 --> 00:45:56,349
Then, when did Attorney Lee Yoobum...

706
00:45:56,434 --> 00:45:58,567
... got scouted by Haekwang Law Firm?

707
00:45:58,667 --> 00:45:59,883
It was right after he received the award.

708
00:45:59,968 --> 00:46:02,968
What reward did you receive
after the case was closed?

709
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,667
I didn't receive any reward.

710
00:46:06,334 --> 00:46:08,202
When you have several suspects
of fabrication...

711
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,834
...if you change the question of
who fabricated the evidence...

712
00:46:11,901 --> 00:46:13,335
...the answer is easily found.

713
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,600
"Who benefitted from the fabrication?"

714
00:46:16,567 --> 00:46:19,101
"Who benefitted the most
from the fabrication?"

715
00:46:21,434 --> 00:46:22,368
Who was it?

716
00:46:27,467 --> 00:46:29,134
It was Attorney Lee Yoobum.

717
00:46:31,734 --> 00:46:32,668
That is all.

718
00:46:37,701 --> 00:46:39,435
There's a good score.

719
00:46:39,868 --> 00:46:46,402
"The one who benefitted from
the fabrication is Lee Yoobum."

720
00:46:46,834 --> 00:46:48,768
It seems like he was
able to turn the corner.

721
00:46:49,701 --> 00:46:50,602
I think so.

722
00:46:51,734 --> 00:46:53,201
Is it my turn next?

723
00:47:05,334 --> 00:47:06,601
In this case...

724
00:47:06,834 --> 00:47:09,867
...the most important point that can
determine if the defendant's action...

725
00:47:09,934 --> 00:47:12,934
...was self-defense or murder
and instigation of murder is...

726
00:47:13,033 --> 00:47:16,267
...how the witness, Nam Hongjoo,
got to the roof.

727
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:19,634
The defense council claims that Ha Joohan
carried you to the roof on her back.

728
00:47:19,734 --> 00:47:20,901
Do you remember what happened?

729
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,601
Yes. I remember.

730
00:47:23,634 --> 00:47:26,135
But I was carried up to the roof
by the defendant Lee Yoobum.

731
00:47:28,667 --> 00:47:30,268
The defendant is claiming that...

732
00:47:30,334 --> 00:47:32,701
...he couldn't carry you up to
the roof because he was drugged.

733
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:33,601
No.

734
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:37,334
The defendant was not drugged
before he got up to the roof.

735
00:47:37,934 --> 00:47:39,568
How can you be certain?

736
00:47:39,901 --> 00:47:41,568
When I was half-conscious at the roof...

737
00:47:41,667 --> 00:47:43,434
...I saw the both of them using umbrellas.

738
00:47:47,501 --> 00:47:50,235
The two of them were
clearly using umbrellas.

739
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:54,467
If Ha Joohan carried me on her
back like the defendant is claiming...

740
00:47:54,534 --> 00:47:56,335
...she couldn't have used an umbrella.

741
00:47:57,467 --> 00:47:59,268
And the defendant who has been drugged...

742
00:47:59,601 --> 00:48:02,502
...couldn't have brought
two umbrellas in that situation.

743
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,834
She's right.

744
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:08,166
Miss Nam is no joke. She's smart.

745
00:48:08,868 --> 00:48:12,335
But if the defendant wasn't drugged,
the umbrellas can be explained.

746
00:48:16,501 --> 00:48:19,335
The defendant carried me
to the roof in his right mind.

747
00:48:20,033 --> 00:48:22,767
And Ha Joohan probably followed
him while carrying two umbrellas.

748
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,433
The defendant is claiming that...

749
00:48:28,501 --> 00:48:30,901
...he was also drugged with
the same sleeping pills as you.

750
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:31,701
And the drug was found...

751
00:48:31,801 --> 00:48:34,035
...in his system when his blood was
tested right after the incident.

752
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:38,701
He probably took the drug right
after he murdered Ha Joohan.

753
00:48:44,367 --> 00:48:46,301
In order to claim self-defense.

754
00:48:53,501 --> 00:48:56,268
That's speculation,
but he's not objecting.

755
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:57,400
I know, right?

756
00:48:57,868 --> 00:48:59,569
Does it mean that he's acknowledging it?

757
00:49:00,067 --> 00:49:03,501
Why do you think Ha Joohan
carried two umbrellas?

758
00:49:04,801 --> 00:49:09,268
It means that she intended to come
back with Lee Yoobum afterwards.

759
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,634
That's true.

760
00:49:15,067 --> 00:49:17,728
If she was going to come back by herself,
she would've carried just one.

761
00:49:17,834 --> 00:49:18,934
It means that Lee Yoobum...

762
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,133
...murdered Ha Joohan who
didn't have murderous intent.

763
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,201
And that isn't self-defense but murder.

764
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,234
That's right.

765
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:32,135
That is all.

766
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:39,800
Next. The defense council
may question the witness.

767
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:40,934
Yes.

768
00:49:45,634 --> 00:49:48,401
According to your memory...

769
00:49:48,934 --> 00:49:53,768
...the defendant didn't take the drug
and carried you up to the roof. Right?

770
00:49:54,767 --> 00:49:55,468
Yes.

771
00:49:58,334 --> 00:49:59,268
This is the drug...

772
00:49:59,367 --> 00:50:02,407
...that you and the defendant took
on the day of the incident.

773
00:50:03,267 --> 00:50:06,367
There is warning statements on it.

774
00:50:08,267 --> 00:50:10,734
Could you read the part
that has been marked here, please?

775
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,234
I have bad eyesight.

776
00:50:17,501 --> 00:50:20,701
Could you read the part
that has been marked here, please?

777
00:50:20,801 --> 00:50:22,001
I have bad eyesight.

778
00:50:28,167 --> 00:50:29,786
Wootak. What's wrong?
Is something wrong?

779
00:50:30,067 --> 00:50:30,901
No.

780
00:50:34,667 --> 00:50:36,901
There may be various...

781
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:46,535
...types of side effects...

782
00:50:46,634 --> 00:50:49,268
...and behavioral changes that can occur
upon intake of this medicine.

783
00:50:50,501 --> 00:50:52,801
Reported behavioral
changes include hallucination...

784
00:50:52,901 --> 00:50:53,835
Hallucination.

785
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:57,634
Auditory hallucination
and depersonalization.

786
00:50:58,033 --> 00:50:59,267
That's what it says, right?

787
00:50:59,367 --> 00:51:00,634
"Depersonalization: Feeling disconnected
or detached from one's body and thoughts"

788
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:05,601
Are you saying that I was hallucinating?

789
00:51:05,701 --> 00:51:08,582
No. I didn't mean it that way.

790
00:51:08,667 --> 00:51:12,134
I'm just talking about the reported
effects of taking this drug.

791
00:51:12,601 --> 00:51:15,070
I did not experience
those effects at the time.

792
00:51:15,133 --> 00:51:18,600
Most people who experience
those effects say those words.

793
00:51:18,667 --> 00:51:21,568
"I'm fine."

794
00:51:23,601 --> 00:51:26,901
Hey. He just turned Miss Nam's
words into useless words in one shot.

795
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,133
That's why he didn't object.

796
00:51:29,868 --> 00:51:34,569
He was going to discredit
Miss Nam's testimony.

797
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,301
This is nuts.
Do we have to just take this?

798
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:41,467
I clearly remember.

799
00:51:41,567 --> 00:51:44,315
That person over there
carried me up to the roof.

800
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,467
He used an umbrella.

801
00:51:45,534 --> 00:51:47,534
And he aided and abetted
Ha Joohan's attempted murder of me.

802
00:51:47,601 --> 00:51:50,601
Your testimony of the defendant
carrying you up the roof...

803
00:51:50,701 --> 00:51:53,335
...using an umbrella and aiding
and abetting...

804
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:57,368
...Ha Joohan's murder of you is from a
memory after you took the drug, isn't it?

805
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Your Honor.

806
00:52:06,501 --> 00:52:07,868
It wasn't just the witness
that took the drug.

807
00:52:07,968 --> 00:52:10,168
The defendant also claims
that he took the same drug.

808
00:52:10,334 --> 00:52:13,334
If you impeach the witness' testimony
because of this drug...

809
00:52:13,434 --> 00:52:16,402
...then it's only appropriate to
impeach the defendant's claim as well.

810
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:20,168
The defendant claims that he
tried to save Nam Hongjoo...

811
00:52:20,434 --> 00:52:22,601
That he pushed off Ha Joohan
to her death only as self-defense...

812
00:52:22,667 --> 00:52:24,568
All of those could be the hallucination...

813
00:52:24,634 --> 00:52:28,068
...and auditory hallucination
due to taking that drug.

814
00:52:29,367 --> 00:52:30,467
That's right.

815
00:52:30,868 --> 00:52:32,569
We can't just let him get away with that.

816
00:52:37,734 --> 00:52:40,435
You really are my chief's son...

817
00:52:52,901 --> 00:52:56,235
Now your testimony is
the most important one.

818
00:52:56,567 --> 00:52:58,334
The score is even now.

819
00:53:05,367 --> 00:53:07,434
Now Han Wootak is the key.

820
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:11,582
Lee Yoobum's side and our side have both
lost some credibility in the testimonies.

821
00:53:11,667 --> 00:53:14,301
The only witness left is Han Wootak.

822
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:15,234
Yes.

823
00:53:15,334 --> 00:53:16,282
When will he be questioned?

824
00:53:16,367 --> 00:53:18,335
It will begin as soon as
the trial resumes at 4 PM.

825
00:53:18,434 --> 00:53:21,901
Mr. Ko wouldn't impeach
him as well, will he?

826
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,749
Why are you saying that, Ms. Son?

827
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:26,001
That won't happen.

828
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,567
We have the two umbrellas as evidence.

829
00:53:28,634 --> 00:53:31,168
And Lee Yoobum and Ha Joohan's
fingerprints were found on them.

830
00:53:31,234 --> 00:53:34,468
Frankly, do we even need
Han Wootak's testimony?

831
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:39,482
But those umbrellas were found in
the first floor garden not on the roof.

832
00:53:39,567 --> 00:53:41,149
It's because the wind blew them down.

833
00:53:41,234 --> 00:53:43,301
I heard there was a strong wind
on the day of the incident.

834
00:53:43,367 --> 00:53:45,068
That's what we're claiming.

835
00:53:45,133 --> 00:53:48,367
Don't you think that they will just claim
that they left them on the first floor?

836
00:53:49,334 --> 00:53:52,768
We need the testimony that
he saw them on the roof...

837
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,367
What do you think of Han Wootak?

838
00:53:57,133 --> 00:53:58,400
You don't need to worry.

839
00:53:58,901 --> 00:54:01,808
He arrived at the scene
first as a police officer.

840
00:54:01,901 --> 00:54:03,769
He can testify with certainty.

841
00:54:08,834 --> 00:54:09,960
What do I do?

842
00:54:10,234 --> 00:54:12,868
If I make a mistake,
we'll lose the culprit...

843
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,600
Wootak. You don't know the colors
of the umbrellas, do you?

844
00:54:21,167 --> 00:54:22,035
Listen carefully.

845
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:25,166
One of the umbrellas is green.
The other one is red.

846
00:54:25,701 --> 00:54:28,669
When you're questioned, they'll
ask you to describe the umbrellas.

847
00:54:28,767 --> 00:54:30,201
If you don't answer it...

848
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:31,801
...they'll find out that
you're color blind.

849
00:54:32,367 --> 00:54:34,068
Then you won't be able to
be a police officer anymore.

850
00:54:34,167 --> 00:54:36,868
So memorize it now.
The long umbrella is green.

851
00:54:36,934 --> 00:54:38,435
The three-fold umbrella is red.

852
00:54:39,267 --> 00:54:40,201
Nam Hongjoo.

853
00:54:41,434 --> 00:54:42,634
How did you know?

854
00:54:42,734 --> 00:54:44,468
That's not important right now.

855
00:54:46,434 --> 00:54:48,668
You cannot make a mistake.
Do you understand?

856
00:54:53,901 --> 00:54:56,735
No. Just say that
you're sick and leave.

857
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,001
If that lawyer keeps asking you,
he might find out.

858
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:02,701
Leave quickly.
I'll tell them that you fainted.

859
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,200
Then, Lee Yoobum might go free.

860
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,600
Is that important right now?

861
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,934
You can't quit being a police officer.

862
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,928
You said you can't quit being
a police officer even if it kills you.

863
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,484
If they find out that
you're color blind...

864
00:55:14,567 --> 00:55:15,867
...you have to give it up.

865
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:21,500
Leave while people aren't here.
I'll explain it to Jaechan.

866
00:55:21,834 --> 00:55:22,834
So...

867
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,234
Wootak...

868
00:55:49,334 --> 00:55:50,501
I'm not going to run away.

869
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,600
I won't make a mistake.

870
00:55:56,834 --> 00:55:57,802
Don't worry.

871
00:56:21,601 --> 00:56:22,435
Witness.

872
00:56:23,367 --> 00:56:25,268
Please read the written oath.

873
00:56:25,934 --> 00:56:29,735
If you lie after taking the oath,
you can be punished for perjury.

874
00:56:29,834 --> 00:56:31,034
You do understand that, right?

875
00:56:32,133 --> 00:56:34,200
Yes. I understand.

876
00:56:35,467 --> 00:56:36,401
Wootak...

877
00:56:42,133 --> 00:56:43,001
I solemnly swear...

878
00:56:43,801 --> 00:56:45,115
...that I will tell the truth...

879
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,801
...and nothing but the truth
according to my conscience.

880
00:56:47,968 --> 00:56:49,569
If any lies are found...

881
00:56:51,567 --> 00:56:53,567
...I will be punished for perjury.

882
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,201
Nam Hongjoo.

883
00:57:30,601 --> 00:57:31,469
Why are you by all by yourself today?

884
00:57:31,501 --> 00:57:32,235
Where is Jaechan?

885
00:57:32,334 --> 00:57:35,235
He went back home
because he left his phone.

886
00:57:35,334 --> 00:57:36,235
He'll be here soon.

887
00:57:36,501 --> 00:57:37,735
Where is your car?

888
00:57:37,834 --> 00:57:39,034
I can't drive it because
it's under restriction today.

889
00:57:39,667 --> 00:57:41,334
It's been so long since the three
of us rode the bus together.

890
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,200
What are you doing?

891
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,500
No. It's nothing.

892
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,400
Why isn't Jung Jaechan coming yet?

893
00:58:13,734 --> 00:58:15,068
We're going to be late.

894
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:20,000
"While You Were Sleeping"
