00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:01,134
"While You Were Sleeping"

2
00:00:05,868 --> 00:00:08,168
I'm going to give up playing the piano...

3
00:00:08,267 --> 00:00:09,400
...so I don't need dad's money.

4
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:10,577
It's okay.

5
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:11,606
I'm fine.

6
00:00:11,691 --> 00:00:13,280
So, don't give up on playing the piano.

7
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:16,467
I'll meet with the prosecutor tomorrow.
I will beg him.

8
00:00:16,552 --> 00:00:18,402
Please don't beg.

9
00:00:22,247 --> 00:00:23,168
Hongjoo.

10
00:00:23,687 --> 00:00:24,700
Oh no, Hongjoo.

11
00:00:24,785 --> 00:00:26,892
What do we do? What do we do?

12
00:00:26,977 --> 00:00:29,863
What do we do? What do we do?

13
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:35,735
No!

14
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:40,700
"Episode 4"

15
00:00:40,934 --> 00:00:41,842
Sir.

16
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:44,778
How do I interpret it
if I keep on seeing...

17
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,746
...the same person in my dream?

18
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,497
There's only one answer.

19
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:49,583
Lovesick.

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,385
Who is the woman?

21
00:00:56,567 --> 00:00:58,468
Seungwon! Seungwon!

22
00:00:59,334 --> 00:01:00,649
It's not a woman.

23
00:01:01,234 --> 00:01:02,596
It's usually a man.

24
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:06,214
Was that your preference all this time?

25
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,439
Preference?

26
00:01:10,193 --> 00:01:11,168
No.

27
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,800
I don't lean that way.

28
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,204
Really?

29
00:01:14,786 --> 00:01:17,250
Then why do you keep seeing
the same man in your dream?

30
00:01:17,335 --> 00:01:18,408
I don't know.

31
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,114
But do you know what is more absurd?

32
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:24,001
What is it?

33
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:25,785
I think that...

34
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:28,696
...that dream might actually come true.

35
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:31,658
You're crazy. That's crazy talk.

36
00:01:32,543 --> 00:01:35,315
I think you've been feeling too weak.

37
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,533
I'll buy you barbeque meat later.

38
00:01:37,634 --> 00:01:38,568
Let's go eat pork belly later.

39
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:39,599
Pork belly.

40
00:01:43,901 --> 00:01:44,732
No, thank you.

41
00:01:45,884 --> 00:01:48,816
I think I'm going to have
plans with someone else later.

42
00:01:48,968 --> 00:01:50,711
You think
you're going to have plans later?

43
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:57,550
I'm curious.

44
00:01:58,234 --> 00:02:00,253
I've made a trivial change.

45
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:02,756
Will that one decision...

46
00:02:03,436 --> 00:02:05,792
...change the terrible event...

47
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,567
...which will happen soon?

48
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,112
Don't worry.

49
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,672
I won't tell Mr. Park that
I met the two of you here.

50
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:33,086
Why did you come to see us?

51
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,654
I'll be honest with you.

52
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:36,589
I used to be a prosecutor
before I became an attorney.

53
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,992
I handled a lot of cases like
this when I was a prosecutor.

54
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,642
At first, I was blinded to
increase my performance that...

55
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,502
...I was always in a hurry
to indict the offenders.

56
00:02:42,634 --> 00:02:44,164
Just like Prosecutor Jung Jaechan.

57
00:02:44,934 --> 00:02:46,182
But I'm different now.

58
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:49,244
I don't care whether
Mr. Park goes to jail or not.

59
00:02:49,405 --> 00:02:51,647
The people I'm worried
about are the two of you.

60
00:02:52,073 --> 00:02:53,388
If we go to trial like this...

61
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,607
...that Park Junmo...

62
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:58,111
...will stop supporting you financially.

63
00:02:58,571 --> 00:03:02,476
You won't be able to send Soyun to
study overseas or do concerts anymore.

64
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:05,601
Your daughter's talent
and future will be gone.

65
00:03:06,512 --> 00:03:09,682
I can't stand to hear you
bark like a dog anymore.

66
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:12,963
Do you think the world will end for her
if she doesn't have her husband anymore?

67
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,694
Don't let him intimidate you.

68
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:18,331
You can just divorce him and divide
the assets and get alimony from him.

69
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:20,101
Yes

70
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,402
I've already prepared the paperwork.

71
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:27,674
Do you think Park Junmo
hasn't thought of that?

72
00:03:28,234 --> 00:03:29,783
I am not entirely sure
but I'm sure he's put...

73
00:03:29,868 --> 00:03:32,858
...all of his assets under disguised
ownership or hid them overseas.

74
00:03:33,638 --> 00:03:37,884
Even if you divorce him, I'm sure he made
it that you won't get anything from him.

75
00:03:40,522 --> 00:03:43,123
Due to Mr. Park Junmo
and Soyun's social standing...

76
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,492
...the trial will be on the newspaper.

77
00:03:45,717 --> 00:03:46,721
Then people will think ...

78
00:03:46,806 --> 00:03:49,967
...Soyun's ex-convict father every
time she performs at a concert.

79
00:03:50,052 --> 00:03:52,932
Mr. Park isn't the only one who
will lose something due to the trial.

80
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:54,534
The two of you will lose something too.

81
00:03:56,334 --> 00:03:58,687
That's why I wrote a statement saying
that I won't be pressing charges.

82
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,399
What more do you want from me?

83
00:04:00,484 --> 00:04:03,262
But Prosecutor Jung Jaechan
is ignoring that statement...

84
00:04:03,347 --> 00:04:04,760
...and he's going to indict him.

85
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:05,873
You need to do something.

86
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,802
You should cry and
beg him if you have to.

87
00:04:09,077 --> 00:04:10,050
For your daughter's sake.

88
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,962
What will happen after
she cries and begs...?

89
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,869
Dad will be released...

90
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,171
...and it will be hell again.

91
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:33,934
It will be different this time.

92
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,910
This is the letter of apology
that your father wrote.

93
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,062
You'll be able to tell that
he changed if you read it.

94
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,735
I'm going to give up playing the piano...

95
00:04:43,195 --> 00:04:44,818
...so, I don't need my dad's money.

96
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:47,420
I don't need this either.

97
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,322
I'll meet with the prosecutor.

98
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,357
Mom.

99
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:52,834
It's okay.

100
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,595
I'm fine.
Don't give up on playing the piano.

101
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:57,913
I'll meet with the prosecutor tomorrow.

102
00:04:57,998 --> 00:04:59,709
I'll cry and beg him if I have to.

103
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,908
Please don't beg!

104
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,250
You don't need to do that.

105
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:25,725
Jaechan.

106
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:30,430
I see this case as a fraud
rather than an assault.

107
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,533
I'm going to indict him
even if you cry and beg me.

108
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:36,730
No matter what.

109
00:05:38,467 --> 00:05:41,408
I read through
Park Junmo's letter of apology.

110
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,792
And I found that it's almost
identical to the previous letter.

111
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:46,867
I don't know if he isn't creative
or he just can't change.

112
00:05:47,134 --> 00:05:49,475
"If you forgive me just this once,
I'll never do it again."

113
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:51,897
It's the same as the one
from four months ago.

114
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,834
But the same thing happened again.

115
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:58,584
My goodness, it's the same here as well.

116
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,860
"I'll get rid of my old self
and become a new person."

117
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:02,929
But you know what?

118
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:05,031
Something that can
take off its old self is not a human.

119
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:08,568
Isn't it a snake?

120
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:12,272
A snake slips out of its skin
and gets bigger and creepier...

121
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,542
Please excuse us,
Prosecutor Jung Jaechan.

122
00:06:15,868 --> 00:06:17,868
I came here to give
the two of them an advice.

123
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,712
This isn't an advice but a threat.

124
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,449
If you really care for them, you should
give an advice to Park Junmo.

125
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,252
If he confesses, I'll go easy on him.

126
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,960
Don't cry. Don't be afraid either.

127
00:06:34,553 --> 00:06:36,134
I know this man well.

128
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:38,280
He's afraid that he will lose if
we were to follow the law...

129
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,508
...that's why he's trying to
growl at you.

130
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,702
But in actuality, he just meowed.

131
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,172
So, we just have to do it by the law.

132
00:06:46,534 --> 00:06:49,576
You have to bite them hard so
that he won't dare to attack you.

133
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,804
Don't worry.

134
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,058
I'll protect your mother no matter what.

135
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:08,361
That's so childish.

136
00:07:11,334 --> 00:07:12,665
Do you think I'm a child?

137
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:15,101
Why did you say growled and meowed?

138
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,034
I'm sorry.

139
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,188
What I was trying to say...

140
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,241
That's okay.

141
00:07:22,801 --> 00:07:23,977
I understood what you're trying to say.

142
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,109
Hongjoo! My goodness!

143
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,056
I made a trivial change...

144
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,158
...but it changed the horrible outcome.

145
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:29,435
I'll wash them.
Go inside.

146
00:08:29,534 --> 00:08:30,868
It will be bad if you hurt your hand.

147
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,979
That would be even better.

148
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,263
Then I don't have to play the piano...

149
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,734
...and my mom won't have to cry and beg.

150
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,034
That would be great.

151
00:08:39,439 --> 00:08:43,643
So, were you going to stab your
hand with the chopstick earlier?

152
00:08:45,467 --> 00:08:46,326
Yes.

153
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,465
I can live without playing the piano.

154
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,568
But I can't live without my mom.

155
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,676
I know exactly how you feel.

156
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:06,035
You don't know.

157
00:09:08,634 --> 00:09:10,335
I know. I totally know that feeling.

158
00:09:11,534 --> 00:09:13,353
You don't. You don't know at all.

159
00:09:34,868 --> 00:09:36,175
What? What is it?

160
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,393
Since we're neighbors,
I can help them if they need help.

161
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:41,501
Yes. I knew it ever since you tried
to give rice cakes to the neighbors.

162
00:09:41,586 --> 00:09:43,518
You're the leader of loving the neighbors.

163
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:46,301
You're so full of love and justice.

164
00:09:46,534 --> 00:09:48,221
I guess I take after you.

165
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:49,856
Me?
What?

166
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:53,634
You better keep your promise to Soyun.

167
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:55,161
I trust you.

168
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,663
Take off your apron, you brat.

169
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:03,985
Two orders of pork belly and
two orders of soybean paste stews.

170
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:04,801
The total comes out to 32,000 won.

171
00:10:04,868 --> 00:10:05,938
-Credit card?
-Yes.

172
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:13,413
I'm glad.

173
00:10:13,727 --> 00:10:14,847
About what?

174
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:17,617
Just about everything.

175
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,489
Han Wootak.

176
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:24,834
They're not coincidences, are they?

177
00:10:24,922 --> 00:10:27,129
When you met me earlier,
and you took me here to this restaurant.

178
00:10:27,214 --> 00:10:28,550
And the fact that Yoobum came here...

179
00:10:28,635 --> 00:10:29,662
You came here knowing everything, right?

180
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:32,965
I'll answer you.

181
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,301
If you treat me to the second round...

182
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,767
Shouldn't it be equal to
what I treated you before?

183
00:10:44,868 --> 00:10:47,346
I treated you to pork belly
and soybean stews.

184
00:10:48,968 --> 00:10:50,583
What are these?
This is so cheap.

185
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,786
I'm not going to consider
this a second round.

186
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:57,523
Stop changing the subject and answer me.

187
00:10:57,834 --> 00:10:59,525
If what happened today isn't
a coincidence, what is it?

188
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:03,001
You might call me a crazy
person when you hear this.

189
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,200
But honestly, I can't even
believe this situation.

190
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:07,810
Actually...

191
00:11:09,534 --> 00:11:11,637
I saw the situation earlier in my dream.

192
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,256
You have those dreams too?

193
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,656
What do you mean?

194
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:18,244
Can you explain what you meant by that?

195
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:19,932
I have those dreams too.

196
00:11:20,234 --> 00:11:22,664
I dream things that will
happen in the future.

197
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:23,701
That's ridiculous.

198
00:11:23,786 --> 00:11:25,225
I was able to stop the car accident
on Valentine's Day...

199
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,070
...because I dreamt about it
before it happened.

200
00:11:28,901 --> 00:11:30,390
That's amazing.

201
00:11:31,652 --> 00:11:32,652
Is...

202
00:11:33,324 --> 00:11:34,646
...this common?

203
00:11:34,731 --> 00:11:36,314
I don't know about that.

204
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,598
But even she has the same ability.

205
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:44,968
Why?

206
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:52,946
"A few good men"

207
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:58,268
Is this contagious?

208
00:11:58,734 --> 00:11:59,952
I don't know.

209
00:12:00,267 --> 00:12:02,604
I haven't figured out why
this happened yet either.

210
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:05,154
Is there anyone one else have these
dreams besides the three of us?

211
00:12:05,334 --> 00:12:06,202
No.

212
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:08,628
I've been having these
dreams for a long time.

213
00:12:08,713 --> 00:12:09,701
But I haven't met
anyone else besides us.

214
00:12:09,801 --> 00:12:12,164
Then do you think there's
a commonality between the three of us?

215
00:12:14,465 --> 00:12:16,035
We're all born in the year of dragons.

216
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:19,672
There are at least 40 million people
who are born in the year of dragon.

217
00:12:20,534 --> 00:12:21,674
What's your blood type?

218
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:22,891
-B.
-O.

219
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:23,635
Which month were you born in?

220
00:12:23,734 --> 00:12:24,635
-September.
-April.

221
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,279
That's not it either.

222
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:34,554
Wait. Stop.

223
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:35,770
This is it.

224
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,802
All three of us licked the cover.

225
00:12:37,935 --> 00:12:38,791
I'm getting goose bumps.

226
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,647
Except for the 1 percent of
our country's high class...

227
00:12:41,732 --> 00:12:42,929
...everyone else lick the cover.

228
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:44,998
Is that so?

229
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,374
Wait.

230
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:50,662
If all of these are true,
we' just accomplished something great.

231
00:12:50,747 --> 00:12:53,435
You stopped, your brother from committing
murder because of Park Junmo's case.

232
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:55,423
We protected your hand too.

233
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:56,909
Look at it from another point of view.

234
00:12:57,334 --> 00:13:00,216
If we didn't stop it, something
terrible could've happened.

235
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:02,448
And Park Junmo's case
isn't over yet either.

236
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:07,835
That will wrap up cleanly
if Jaechan indicts him.

237
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,333
You're confident about
keeping that promise, right?

238
00:13:10,434 --> 00:13:11,524
I'm looking forward to it.

239
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,301
You don't need to look forward to it.

240
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,466
By the way, why did you follow
us to the convenience store earlier?

241
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:23,601
That's right.

242
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:24,904
It's because I wanted
to tell you something.

243
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:27,268
If you're going to say that
you're looking forward to it...

244
00:13:27,353 --> 00:13:28,256
...and I better keep that promise
or you believe in me...

245
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:29,434
...please don't say it.

246
00:13:29,534 --> 00:13:30,983
I heard enough for today.

247
00:13:31,068 --> 00:13:33,853
And I don't want to hear
that from you especially.

248
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:36,282
That's not it.

249
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:40,368
If you're going to wear
our apron to advertise our restaurant...

250
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:43,467
...you should open up your coat
so that it can be seen well.

251
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:47,560
What in the world...

252
00:13:49,689 --> 00:13:51,998
Is it painful for you to hear people
say that they're looking forward to it?

253
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,367
We're just cheering for you.

254
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,295
It's not cheering but it's a threat.

255
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,193
It means that I should do my best
and accomplish it and if I don't...

256
00:13:58,278 --> 00:13:59,297
...you'll be disappointed.

257
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:01,741
That means that you
don't want to disappoint me.

258
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:03,009
Oh?

259
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:07,001
But why is it me?

260
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,815
Why do you hate disappointing me?

261
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,934
You're starting again.

262
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:15,955
I hate disappointing anyone,
even dogs on the street.

263
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:20,226
I get the idea.

264
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:24,934
I have a talent for understanding things
well even when people say it terribly.

265
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,191
Jeez.

266
00:14:26,267 --> 00:14:27,634
What in the world...

267
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,410
Why does she have to understand it well?
She should understand it terribly.

268
00:14:44,601 --> 00:14:45,618
He's leaving. He's leaving.

269
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:49,605
Hey. Why are we hiding?

270
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,368
We didn't do anything weird.

271
00:14:51,453 --> 00:14:52,299
No.

272
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,393
It's because my brother
might misunderstand the situation.

273
00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:57,961
By the way, where is your
brother going at this hour?

274
00:14:58,046 --> 00:14:59,165
I think he's going to work.

275
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:00,241
Right now?

276
00:15:00,619 --> 00:15:01,767
Why is he going to work at this hour?

277
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:02,835
I'm not sure.

278
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:07,907
I guess he doesn't want to
disappoint even the dog on the street.

279
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:48,215
Good morning.

280
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,367
What's he doing over there?

281
00:15:50,434 --> 00:15:51,603
Why is he like that?

282
00:15:51,688 --> 00:15:53,419
Will I be standing in awe
if I knew the reason?

283
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:55,403
Good morning.

284
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,701
Did you work all night long?

285
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,055
Then do you think
I exercised all night long?

286
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,476
Hyangmi.

287
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,831
Could you borrow all the past
cases of Park Junmo?

288
00:16:04,462 --> 00:16:05,546
It's about Park Junmo again?

289
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,759
I think I've become best friends
with Park Junmo.

290
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:11,769
Mr. Choi. You should come with me
to investigate the scene of the crime.

291
00:16:11,854 --> 00:16:12,687
Investigate the scene of the crime?

292
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:15,248
If it isn't for the rules,
I want to go by myself.

293
00:16:15,634 --> 00:16:18,310
I'll do the investigation,
so I just want you to be there for show.

294
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:19,313
Let's go.

295
00:16:19,781 --> 00:16:20,682
Yes.

296
00:16:25,882 --> 00:16:27,454
Why are we going on
an investigation out of the blue?

297
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:29,801
I didn't wear long johns today.

298
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:32,266
Let me have some lotion.

299
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:35,485
Why are you putting lotion on your legs?

300
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,171
Prosecutor Jung. Wait for me.

301
00:16:39,014 --> 00:16:40,298
He's so persistent.

302
00:16:54,534 --> 00:16:55,530
Did you draw it?

303
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:56,391
Yes.

304
00:16:56,476 --> 00:16:58,310
You're good at drawing.

305
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:21,454
Darn it.

306
00:17:21,601 --> 00:17:23,523
Nothing is working out.

307
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,882
Would you please let me see
the records for February 10th?

308
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,447
How could it be morning
as soon as I lay down?

309
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:12,607
Have some breakfast.
I made some rice with eggs.

310
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,110
I'm busy. I'll skip it.

311
00:18:14,398 --> 00:18:15,506
Bye.

312
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:24,803
Woobin. Is it delicious?

313
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,015
It might be better than mine.

314
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,042
Do you make monkfish stew at home?

315
00:18:45,127 --> 00:18:47,157
I've been craving it for a while...

316
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:49,395
...but it's just the two of us,
so I couldn't make it at home.

317
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,969
But since there are four of us,
I wanted to try making it today.

318
00:18:53,054 --> 00:18:54,466
We have something to celebrate also.

319
00:18:55,305 --> 00:18:56,611
Something to celebrate? What is it?

320
00:18:56,696 --> 00:18:59,026
I received a call from Evan Foundation.

321
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:00,906
Regarding Soyun's scholarship.

322
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:01,923
Really?

323
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,464
Then will you be able to study abroad?

324
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,400
As long as there aren't any changes...

325
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:09,907
And I think we'll be able to go
back home within this week.

326
00:19:09,992 --> 00:19:10,946
That's right.

327
00:19:11,031 --> 00:19:12,605
The investigation is supposed
to end by this week, right?

328
00:19:12,695 --> 00:19:14,787
I received a call from
Prosecutor Jung earlier.

329
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,205
He told me that my husband
will not get off easily this time.

330
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,940
He told me not to worry.

331
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,836
My goodness. He's a nice guy.

332
00:19:20,901 --> 00:19:22,309
He even called you?

333
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:23,311
Yes.

334
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:25,297
He's so trustworthy.

335
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:26,865
I know.

336
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:31,070
He has good character and he's talented.

337
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,705
We're here. Wake up.

338
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:15,923
Thank you.

339
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,800
You should get up if you're thankful.

340
00:21:17,885 --> 00:21:19,085
Hurry up.

341
00:21:20,033 --> 00:21:20,946
Jung Jaechan.

342
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,752
You must've had a dream.

343
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,387
What did you dream about?

344
00:21:28,634 --> 00:21:30,322
Is it something that's going to happen?

345
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:33,668
No.

346
00:21:33,968 --> 00:21:35,001
What is that?

347
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:37,068
Hurry up and ring the bell.
We have to get off now.

348
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:38,980
Ah...

349
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,567
What do you do for living, Nam Hongjoo?

350
00:21:55,652 --> 00:21:57,507
-Don't you have a job?
-Oh?

351
00:21:57,925 --> 00:21:59,905
Are you interested in me now?

352
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,735
That interest will become a motive
then the motive will turn into love...

353
00:22:02,861 --> 00:22:06,498
Is it going to turn out to
be an old-fashioned event?

354
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:09,435
Then I'm all for it.

355
00:22:10,048 --> 00:22:11,370
What are you talking about?

356
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,681
It's just because you
always follow me around.

357
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:15,333
It hasn't been every day.
This is just the second time.

358
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:16,227
Do you want me to do it daily?

359
00:22:16,312 --> 00:22:19,550
No. I don't want it even for a day,
but you keep following me.

360
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:21,740
I followed you because I have a reason.

361
00:22:22,367 --> 00:22:23,224
A reason?

362
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:25,252
I dreamt about you and saw
that you fell asleep on the bus...

363
00:22:25,337 --> 00:22:26,907
...and ended up
riding it to the final stop.

364
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,368
Because of that you were late to
work and got scolded by your boss.

365
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:32,291
I'm sorry, Sir.

366
00:22:32,376 --> 00:22:33,986
How dare you get to work at this hour?

367
00:22:34,071 --> 00:22:34,925
Get out!

368
00:22:35,737 --> 00:22:39,024
It will be a tiring day thanks
to Park Junmo's case.

369
00:22:39,857 --> 00:22:42,843
I wanted to lessen your burden.
That's why I followed you.

370
00:22:44,767 --> 00:22:45,998
A tiring day?

371
00:22:48,484 --> 00:22:49,618
That won't happen.

372
00:22:50,074 --> 00:22:52,107
I had to clear out other cases
on top of Park Junmo's case...

373
00:22:52,192 --> 00:22:54,329
...so I couldn't even sleep for more
than five hours for the past four days.

374
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,591
Once I finish questioning
Park Junmo today...

375
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:57,831
...I should be able to indict him.

376
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:59,665
If this is baseball,
it's right before calling it a cold game.

377
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,134
No outs and bases loaded.

378
00:23:15,818 --> 00:23:17,190
Why do you have that expression?

379
00:23:17,275 --> 00:23:18,768
Did you have a bad dream?

380
00:23:19,033 --> 00:23:20,040
No, I didn't.

381
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:23,105
Then don't have an expression
like if you know something.

382
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,101
You're making me so nervous.

383
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,138
I'm going to go.

384
00:23:27,234 --> 00:23:28,373
Jung Jaechan.

385
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:30,075
What is it now?

386
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:31,568
All the best!

387
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,929
-All the best!
-Seriously...

388
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:36,715
I told you not to cheer me on.

389
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,363
I didn't think I need to be
questioned at the prosecutor's office.

390
00:23:52,448 --> 00:23:54,003
How did this get so big?

391
00:23:54,088 --> 00:23:56,466
Your wife changed her mind and
she now wants to press charges.

392
00:23:56,551 --> 00:23:57,451
What else can we do?

393
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:58,903
You have to be questioned.

394
00:24:02,513 --> 00:24:04,315
I don't think one pill would be enough.

395
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,612
You're weaker than I think.

396
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,017
This is my first time being questioned.

397
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:11,531
We have the original CCTV file
and we have the story straight...

398
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,981
...with the doctor who
wrote the medical report.

399
00:24:16,236 --> 00:24:19,424
We even have the backup plan,
so what are you afraid of?

400
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:22,482
Other lawyers can't even say
anything at the prosecutor's office.

401
00:24:22,567 --> 00:24:23,595
But I'm different.

402
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:27,199
If it looks bad,
I'll cover it so don't worry.

403
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:28,434
Let's go.

404
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:31,325
No. I'm not worried.
I know very well how meticulous you are.

405
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,250
Just a moment.

406
00:24:32,968 --> 00:24:34,836
You need to relax.

407
00:24:35,467 --> 00:24:36,908
You're not a criminal.

408
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,144
Of course I'm not.

409
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:40,913
Don't be too relaxed.

410
00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:42,714
You look arrogant.

411
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,919
This is difficult.

412
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:55,643
Year of the dragon.

413
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:57,238
Birthday.

414
00:24:57,323 --> 00:24:58,397
Blood type.

415
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:02,001
Singles.

416
00:25:04,133 --> 00:25:06,433
Han Wootak. Get some lunch.

417
00:25:06,701 --> 00:25:07,302
Yes.

418
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:09,808
By the way, I don't see Mr. Oh.

419
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:12,734
He went to give his statement
for Park Junmo's case.

420
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,663
I hope he's not intimidated
because he's kind-hearted.

421
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:18,517
Then you'll be eating lunch alone today.

422
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:21,295
Do you want me to go with you?

423
00:25:21,534 --> 00:25:24,001
I didn't eat much just now.

424
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,224
No. I think I'm going to have plans.

425
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:28,894
Right?
I thought so.

426
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:32,031
"Hongjoo Samgyeopsal"

427
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:38,030
Knock. Knock.

428
00:25:40,267 --> 00:25:41,371
I'm right. It's you.

429
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,616
You're the one who
returned my phone, right?

430
00:25:43,701 --> 00:25:44,733
Yes.

431
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:45,841
Hello.

432
00:25:45,926 --> 00:25:46,934
What are you doing here?
You should come in.

433
00:25:47,033 --> 00:25:49,549
-Come in.
-Yes.

434
00:25:49,634 --> 00:25:50,335
Yes.

435
00:25:52,834 --> 00:25:54,535
What do they say when someone eats alone?

436
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,286
I heard only the highest level
people eats barbeque meat alone.

437
00:25:56,371 --> 00:25:56,968
Yes.

438
00:25:57,518 --> 00:25:59,367
I enjoyed it the last time I came here.

439
00:25:59,452 --> 00:26:01,309
It tasted like my mother's food.

440
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:03,161
Okay. I acknowledge it.

441
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,831
You don't need to flatter me that much.

442
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,401
I wonder what the real
reason for you coming here.

443
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,015
I don't have any other reason.

444
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,548
The food is really good here.

445
00:26:15,234 --> 00:26:16,102
Hongjoo.

446
00:26:17,234 --> 00:26:18,501
Did you come here for lunch?

447
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:19,526
Yes.

448
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:21,262
Alone?
To eat barbeque pork belly?

449
00:26:21,347 --> 00:26:21,901
Yes.

450
00:26:22,092 --> 00:26:24,616
I really enjoy eating pork belly
for lunch alone.

451
00:26:24,968 --> 00:26:26,151
That's so strange.

452
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,602
Hongjoo. I'm going to
work on the bookkeeping...

453
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:29,834
...so I want you to serve him.

454
00:26:29,934 --> 00:26:30,868
Okay.

455
00:26:31,634 --> 00:26:32,480
Let's eat together.

456
00:26:32,565 --> 00:26:33,658
I ordered for two.

457
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:37,958
How about the three flying dragons
eating dinner together tonight?

458
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:39,166
Let's have Jaechan treat us.

459
00:26:39,267 --> 00:26:40,168
No.

460
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:41,804
Jaechan won't be
in good mood today.

461
00:26:41,889 --> 00:26:42,610
Why not?

462
00:26:42,695 --> 00:26:44,501
Park Junmo is
being questioned today.

463
00:26:44,586 --> 00:26:46,672
I had a dream that he's going
to mess up the questioning...

464
00:26:46,757 --> 00:26:48,050
...and fail to indict him.

465
00:26:48,135 --> 00:26:50,601
So we can comfort him,
but we can't have a party.

466
00:26:51,219 --> 00:26:52,310
I had an opposite dream.

467
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:56,414
In my dream, Jaechan indicts
him in awesome fashion.

468
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,567
Park Junmo even begged.

469
00:26:58,634 --> 00:26:59,535
Really?

470
00:27:06,267 --> 00:27:07,325
Mr. Park Junmo.

471
00:27:08,033 --> 00:27:10,447
You said this
at the questioning last year, right?

472
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:13,734
"It's all because my wife
deserves to be beaten."

473
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,284
If you think that way...

474
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:20,639
...being secretly taped is the fault
of a woman for wearing short skirt.

475
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:24,168
Getting pick pocketed is the fault
of a person for showing his wallet.

476
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:26,344
If that's the case...

477
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,319
...even if I did something
to you right here and now...

478
00:27:36,033 --> 00:27:38,857
...it would your fault for
saying the wrong things.

479
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:40,992
It's your fault.

480
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,901
It's your fault. Your fault?

481
00:27:50,436 --> 00:27:51,670
Is that too short?

482
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:53,672
It is your fault!

483
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,201
It sounds awkward. That hurts.

484
00:27:57,977 --> 00:27:59,793
Is there anything else
that has more impact?

485
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:03,201
A strong shot that has impact?

486
00:28:14,056 --> 00:28:15,342
What's wrong with him?

487
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,383
In this day and age,
what does he think he's doing?

488
00:28:17,468 --> 00:28:19,257
Do you think you're a royal inspector
from the previous century or something?

489
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,785
He's doing that because he
doesn't know that we're here, right?

490
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,868
Do you think he'll do that
if he knew we were here?

491
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,224
I'm sure he's doing that
because he wants to do well.

492
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:32,134
Let's pretend that we didn't see him.

493
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,600
Do you think Park Junmo will
confess just because he does that?

494
00:28:34,701 --> 00:28:36,507
Prosecutor Jung will not
be able to indict him. Hands up.

495
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,952
My goodness. Look at him.
Look at him.

496
00:28:58,767 --> 00:28:59,501
Let's go.

497
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:09,915
Yes. Wootak.

498
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:16,254
I'm here to give
my statement for a case.

499
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:17,555
My name is Bong Doohyun.

500
00:29:18,901 --> 00:29:21,175
Did you confirm whether the suspect
and the witnesses have left yet?

501
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,801
Yes. Everyone has said that
they'll be here by 2 PM.

502
00:29:26,901 --> 00:29:28,466
Yes. I just got here.

503
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,082
That's a bit awkward.

504
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:32,792
Can we help you?

505
00:29:33,426 --> 00:29:34,882
I'm Lieutenant Oh Kyunghan.

506
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:36,234
I came as a witness.

507
00:29:36,345 --> 00:29:38,048
You're here too early.

508
00:29:38,133 --> 00:29:39,849
Please wait outside. We'll call for you.

509
00:29:39,934 --> 00:29:40,601
Yes.

510
00:29:41,087 --> 00:29:44,266
But I have a call for
Prosecutor Jung Jaechan.

511
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,265
For me?

512
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,235
Yes. This is Lieutenant Han Wootak.

513
00:29:47,334 --> 00:29:49,949
He said it's urgent.
Please answer the call.

514
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:53,874
Yes. This is Jung Jaechan.

515
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,128
I didn't know your phone number.

516
00:29:56,464 --> 00:29:58,341
You haven't started questioning
Park Junmo yet, have you?

517
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:00,091
Yes.

518
00:30:00,176 --> 00:30:01,851
You shouldn't question
Park Junmo yourself later...

519
00:30:01,936 --> 00:30:03,193
...but leave it for your investigator.

520
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,067
Excuse me?

521
00:30:06,577 --> 00:30:08,206
Why do I have to do that?

522
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,808
Just listen to him.

523
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,525
I don't know why...

524
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:15,328
...but Wootak and I both dreamt
of you questioning Park Junmo.

525
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:17,860
But in my dream Park Junmo
was found innocent and released.

526
00:30:17,945 --> 00:30:19,235
But in Wootak's dream,
he was indicted.

527
00:30:19,334 --> 00:30:20,801
That is ridiculous.

528
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:24,338
So we compared our dreams and
there was one thing that was different.

529
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:26,742
In Hongjoo's dream,
you investigated Park Junmo.

530
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:29,327
In my dream, the investigator did it.

531
00:30:29,868 --> 00:30:32,297
Someone who looks like an anchovy.

532
00:30:35,234 --> 00:30:36,004
Are you sure?

533
00:30:36,089 --> 00:30:37,302
Are you sure you don't
have it backwards?

534
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:39,319
My beloved Mr. Choi.

535
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:40,438
We're not late, are we?

536
00:30:41,619 --> 00:30:44,743
The color yellow really
looks great on you, Hyangmi.

537
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:47,445
You're still on time as usual.

538
00:30:49,367 --> 00:30:52,015
I told him that we should just
do a documentary investigation...

539
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,233
...but he just won't listen.

540
00:30:53,334 --> 00:30:55,987
He insisted that he wants
to question him face to face. Gosh.

541
00:30:57,205 --> 00:31:00,632
Mr. Choi and Yoobum has such
a special relationship that it's peculiar.

542
00:31:00,717 --> 00:31:01,502
They are so close.

543
00:31:01,587 --> 00:31:02,734
But what can we do?

544
00:31:02,834 --> 00:31:03,924
That's how the dream was.

545
00:31:04,751 --> 00:31:06,446
In our dream,
he claimed that he was innocent.

546
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,967
Excuse me? That's ridiculous.

547
00:31:12,067 --> 00:31:16,107
How can he claim that he's innocent
when there's overwhelming evidence?

548
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,710
Even if that's true,
you can't handle Yoobum.

549
00:31:19,467 --> 00:31:21,446
So, please let Mr. Choi handle
the questioning.

550
00:31:23,571 --> 00:31:26,192
But when is Prosecutor Jung
going to hang up his call?

551
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:30,067
I get it. Let's hang up for now.

552
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:40,923
If I question him, he won't be indicted.

553
00:31:41,008 --> 00:31:42,706
But if Mr. Choi questions him,
he'll be indicted?

554
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,302
Does that make any sense?

555
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:49,268
How can I trust Mr. Choi who acts
that way to handle the questioning?

556
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:50,809
This is driving me crazy.

557
00:31:53,649 --> 00:31:55,680
That phone is mine.

558
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:56,901
Yes.

559
00:31:59,434 --> 00:32:01,920
Prosecutor Jung. Aren't you going
to start the questioning?

560
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:04,068
Mr. Choi.

561
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:05,301
Yes.

562
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:09,661
Why don't you do the questioning?

563
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:24,142
Why are our dreams different?

564
00:32:24,701 --> 00:32:26,644
It means that one of us is wrong?

565
00:32:27,033 --> 00:32:28,680
Have the dreams ever been wrong?

566
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:29,566
No.

567
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:31,489
Not until I met Jaechan.

568
00:32:31,667 --> 00:32:32,855
What about after you met him?

569
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:36,712
The dream changed thanks to Jaechan.

570
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:39,024
"Dream changes after meeting Jaechan"

571
00:32:41,033 --> 00:32:42,594
I hope it will change this time to too.

572
00:32:43,734 --> 00:32:44,682
I know.

573
00:32:44,767 --> 00:32:46,701
I hope your dream is was the right one.

574
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:58,076
How are you?
Did you have lunch?

575
00:32:58,341 --> 00:33:00,312
I barely ate.

576
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,569
I see.

577
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:07,986
The victim wants to press charges
so the situation has gotten complicated.

578
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,121
As you know very well...

579
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:13,106
...even if it's just an assault if
the victim wants to press charges...

580
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:16,588
I never assaulted my wife.

581
00:33:18,467 --> 00:33:19,965
He really is claiming that he's innocent.

582
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:21,848
Is it going to be like the dream?

583
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:24,816
Listen. Why are you
saying such ridiculous things?

584
00:33:24,901 --> 00:33:26,302
Just a moment.

585
00:33:27,515 --> 00:33:29,102
Didn't you admit to the assault?

586
00:33:29,187 --> 00:33:31,409
I'm the one who
suggested him to admit that.

587
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:32,600
Excuse me?

588
00:33:32,701 --> 00:33:34,575
Since there is a previous case...

589
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:36,581
...I told him that
we should just admit it first.

590
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,683
But when I looked into it carefully...

591
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,968
...I realized that he got caught
up in his wife's scheme.

592
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:42,002
Her scheme?

593
00:33:45,534 --> 00:33:48,493
This is the letter of apology she received
from him after the previous assault.

594
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:52,997
He wrote that he'll give her 1 billion won
if he assaults her again.

595
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:57,168
So you're saying she staged everything
in order to get 1 billion won...

596
00:33:57,736 --> 00:34:00,867
I was suspicious...

597
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,101
Do you think that her world...

598
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,411
...will end just because she doesn't
have her husband anymore?

599
00:34:06,623 --> 00:34:07,828
Don't be intimidated.

600
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:11,348
You can divide up the assets and
get alimony after getting divorced.

601
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:14,686
Yes. I've already
prepared the documents.

602
00:34:27,868 --> 00:34:29,836
That's what happened.

603
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:31,403
Now I understand.

604
00:34:31,567 --> 00:34:34,101
I know very well because I've
seen so many cases like these.

605
00:34:34,193 --> 00:34:36,449
This is not something that only
comes out in "Love and War."

606
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:39,071
This happens in real life, too.

607
00:34:39,156 --> 00:34:41,641
You write up a bad letter of
apology after hitting your wife...

608
00:34:41,726 --> 00:34:43,934
...and end up giving her money forever.

609
00:34:46,193 --> 00:34:47,768
What kind of questioning is like this?

610
00:34:47,853 --> 00:34:50,296
Why are you only listening to
the offender and making assumptions.

611
00:34:50,381 --> 00:34:52,091
I saw the whole thing right next to him.

612
00:34:52,176 --> 00:34:55,691
There were many of his
footprints on his wife's blouse.

613
00:34:55,776 --> 00:34:57,595
That's unfair also.

614
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:01,701
Those footprints aren't Mr. Park's.

615
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:03,686
Excuse me?

616
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:07,672
The investigation record says
that the footprint size is 285, right?

617
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:11,612
Yes. 285.

618
00:35:11,697 --> 00:35:13,956
Mr. Park's feet size...

619
00:35:20,033 --> 00:35:20,885
...is 260.

620
00:35:24,162 --> 00:35:26,157
That's right.
It's 260.

621
00:35:27,586 --> 00:35:28,730
There's no way.

622
00:35:28,815 --> 00:35:31,322
Did you arrest him without
measuring his feet then?

623
00:35:31,467 --> 00:35:33,414
There were so many
people around at the time.

624
00:35:34,015 --> 00:35:35,068
It was really chaotic.

625
00:35:35,153 --> 00:35:37,379
This is not right even if it was chaotic.

626
00:35:37,508 --> 00:35:40,049
A person can be found innocent or
guilty just by the size of his feet.

627
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:42,034
Please follow the manual.

628
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:43,412
How could you
not follow A. B. C. D.?

629
00:35:43,497 --> 00:35:44,875
A is to put him under arrest.

630
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,600
B is to have the KCIS do their work.

631
00:35:46,701 --> 00:35:48,980
Please be quiet.

632
00:35:49,362 --> 00:35:50,581
Then, Attorney Lee...

633
00:35:51,183 --> 00:35:54,534
How does this story go then?

634
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:57,117
Unfortunately, I think
the story goes like this.

635
00:35:57,473 --> 00:36:01,416
Do Geumseok used the letter of
apology from the previous case...

636
00:36:01,501 --> 00:36:03,435
...and decided to get money out of him.

637
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:04,549
"Letter of apology"

638
00:36:04,634 --> 00:36:06,666
Then she was waiting for an opportunity.

639
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:10,568
When she broke her ribs
from the skiing accident...

640
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:14,468
...she decided to fabricate the story
and accused her husband of assault.

641
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:18,801
That's why the date of
that X-ray didn't match.

642
00:36:19,337 --> 00:36:22,790
And she secretly put
footprints on her blouse...

643
00:36:24,501 --> 00:36:28,035
Then she collapsed while
many people were watching.

644
00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:35,860
She totally fabricated the story.

645
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,724
What's wrong with Mr. Choi?

646
00:36:37,894 --> 00:36:40,164
Why is he just listening to that garbage?

647
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:43,000
Do I have to keep believing that dream?

648
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,467
I really trusted my wife and loved her...

649
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,101
But after hearing this story,
all the puzzle pieces fit.

650
00:36:53,334 --> 00:36:55,235
You'll see after you read that report.

651
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:00,613
But Mr. Park has never
admitted to the assault.

652
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,472
Then, did you call the police
just by circumstantial evidence?

653
00:37:03,557 --> 00:37:04,651
Even when he denied it?

654
00:37:04,736 --> 00:37:07,202
Who would admit it in that situation?

655
00:37:07,287 --> 00:37:09,976
Have you ever seen someone who poops
on the street and puts his name on it?

656
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,898
I just had lunch...

657
00:37:12,983 --> 00:37:13,934
I'm sorry.

658
00:37:14,019 --> 00:37:17,752
What did Park Junmo say
when his wife collapsed?

659
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,872
He said he didn't do it.

660
00:37:21,803 --> 00:37:22,763
And when he was arrested?

661
00:37:22,848 --> 00:37:25,743
Yes. He kept saying that he didn't do it.

662
00:37:27,644 --> 00:37:28,744
I see.

663
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,034
Now it's starting to make sense.

664
00:37:34,901 --> 00:37:38,773
I'm sure you felt so wronged after
being betrayed by your beloved wife...

665
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:42,894
Why did she do that?

666
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:44,904
Let's take a look.

667
00:37:44,989 --> 00:37:46,282
Pay attention here for a moment.

668
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:50,101
Your beloved wife lost her
consciousness and collapsed.

669
00:37:50,336 --> 00:37:52,397
Then as soon as you saw her...

670
00:37:52,482 --> 00:37:55,690
...you clearly said that
you didn't hit her.

671
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:59,377
But you were arrested anyway. Right?

672
00:38:01,019 --> 00:38:01,903
Prosecutor Jung.

673
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,549
Am I the only one who finds that strange?

674
00:38:08,567 --> 00:38:09,114
Excuse me?

675
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:10,988
This part...

676
00:38:11,941 --> 00:38:12,957
This part...

677
00:38:13,669 --> 00:38:17,895
The part when you clearly
said that you didn't hit her.

678
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,590
That part bothers me.

679
00:38:23,871 --> 00:38:26,276
Yes. I'm bothered by that also.

680
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,048
Park Junmo.

681
00:38:28,133 --> 00:38:30,741
When your wife collapsed,
what was the first thing you said?

682
00:38:31,897 --> 00:38:33,254
I didn't do it.

683
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:36,948
You love your wife, don't you?

684
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,287
Of course. I love her.

685
00:38:38,372 --> 00:38:39,029
Mr. Park.

686
00:38:39,114 --> 00:38:40,251
Attorney Lee, please be quiet.

687
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:44,834
Your beloved wife
just collapsed suddenly...

688
00:38:44,901 --> 00:38:47,058
...but the first thing you
said was "I didn't do it."

689
00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:48,949
What's wrong with that?

690
00:38:49,034 --> 00:38:51,462
"Honey, are you okay?" or
"Please help her"...

691
00:38:52,067 --> 00:38:53,920
...shouldn't you be saying that instead?

692
00:38:58,463 --> 00:38:59,953
That's right.

693
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:01,081
He should've said that.

694
00:39:01,166 --> 00:39:04,639
You should be worried about her
first instead of making excuses.

695
00:39:04,724 --> 00:39:07,227
You shouldn't have given excuses
like "I didn't hit her" to the police.

696
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:08,787
You should've asked
the police to find the culprit.

697
00:39:08,872 --> 00:39:11,682
You're right.
That's logical.

698
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:15,844
That part made me so suspicious
of him when I arrested him.

699
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:19,090
That's because everyone
said that I probably hit her.

700
00:39:20,823 --> 00:39:21,505
Mr. Choi.

701
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,075
Yes. Here is the video...

702
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:28,266
...that Reporter Bong Doohyun
recorded at the time of the incident.

703
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,801
Many people are supporting me.

704
00:39:33,901 --> 00:39:36,841
So, I want to do my best
and not disappoint them.

705
00:39:37,135 --> 00:39:38,003
Mom!

706
00:39:39,801 --> 00:39:41,084
Call 911!

707
00:39:41,334 --> 00:39:42,268
What is this?

708
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,168
I didn't do it.

709
00:39:48,367 --> 00:39:50,268
No one accused you of hitting her.

710
00:39:50,367 --> 00:39:52,416
But you're so busy
covering up the footprints.

711
00:39:53,067 --> 00:39:54,534
As if you caused it...

712
00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:55,835
I said I didn't do it.

713
00:39:55,934 --> 00:39:58,367
You measured my feet earlier.

714
00:39:58,452 --> 00:39:59,742
You should've measured your shoe size

715
00:39:59,827 --> 00:40:01,035
...why did you take it off?

716
00:40:02,183 --> 00:40:03,482
The size of your feet...

717
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,147
...and the size of your shoes are
about 2 to 3 centimeters different.

718
00:40:05,232 --> 00:40:06,934
Attorney Lee should know that.

719
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:11,943
Why don't you put your feet up with your
shoes on so that we can re-measure it?

720
00:40:15,093 --> 00:40:17,292
-Put your feet up again.
-Wait.

721
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:19,884
That's okay.

722
00:40:20,734 --> 00:40:21,927
Stop it.

723
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:25,268
The letter of apology, the feet size
and the cell phone audio recording...

724
00:40:25,367 --> 00:40:27,701
Are those the only evidence
to prove your innocence?

725
00:40:28,251 --> 00:40:30,149
Hyangmi, would you bring
me that cart over there?

726
00:40:30,234 --> 00:40:30,901
Yes.

727
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,336
Are these all evidence?

728
00:40:40,446 --> 00:40:42,930
I think you went down the wrong path.

729
00:40:43,015 --> 00:40:45,663
If you keep lying using
these evidence you fabricated...

730
00:40:45,748 --> 00:40:47,878
...it may have a negative effect later on.

731
00:40:49,634 --> 00:40:50,435
I was just...

732
00:40:50,534 --> 00:40:51,715
Please don't answer.

733
00:40:54,067 --> 00:40:55,301
This is the end of questioning for today.

734
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:56,534
Please choose.

735
00:40:57,033 --> 00:41:00,124
Are you going to leave right now
or be honest and tell the truth?

736
00:41:00,209 --> 00:41:02,410
I was going to tell
the truth honestly, but...

737
00:41:02,495 --> 00:41:03,569
I told you not to answer.

738
00:41:03,654 --> 00:41:05,096
You don't need to answer.

739
00:41:05,895 --> 00:41:07,427
The attitude you showed
us during your testimony.

740
00:41:07,512 --> 00:41:09,341
The false medical report,
falsifying CCTV footage...

741
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:12,070
These are enough to cause
suspicion on the case.

742
00:41:14,801 --> 00:41:16,669
These are enough for an indictment.

743
00:41:16,767 --> 00:41:18,310
How you cooperate with
the questioning from this moment...

744
00:41:18,395 --> 00:41:20,170
...will determine how long
the minimum sentence...

745
00:41:20,477 --> 00:41:22,968
...and the actual length
of your sentence will be...

746
00:41:24,803 --> 00:41:26,001
Are you threatening him?

747
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,534
I'm giving him an advice.

748
00:41:28,367 --> 00:41:30,788
Are you going to jump out of the car
that has a broken brakes pedal?

749
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:33,033
Or are you going to keep
riding it and explode with it?

750
00:41:33,118 --> 00:41:34,640
I wanted to admit my fault
from the beginning...

751
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:36,253
...but Attorney Lee insisted that
I should claim innocence.

752
00:41:36,338 --> 00:41:37,668
The statement of not pressing charges...

753
00:41:37,753 --> 00:41:39,084
...and the false medical reports
were all done by him.

754
00:41:39,169 --> 00:41:40,182
I don't even know what they are.

755
00:41:40,267 --> 00:41:41,399
Mr. Park.

756
00:41:42,345 --> 00:41:44,528
Attorney Lee. If you interfere with
the questioning from this moment...

757
00:41:44,613 --> 00:41:46,543
...I have no choice, but to prohibit
you from participating in this case.

758
00:41:46,628 --> 00:41:48,870
If there's suspicion of you fabricating,
concealing or destroying the evidence...

759
00:41:48,955 --> 00:41:50,017
...it will have the same result.

760
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:52,217
Prosecutor Jung.
I've committed a terrible crime.

761
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:55,313
If I ever put my hand on
my wife again, I'll burn my hand.

762
00:41:55,434 --> 00:41:57,402
So, please be lenient on me.

763
00:41:57,531 --> 00:42:01,469
Let's consider what your crimes are first,
then I'll consider being lenient on you.

764
00:42:01,942 --> 00:42:02,843
Prosecutor Jung.

765
00:42:03,048 --> 00:42:04,215
Please sit over here.

766
00:42:04,634 --> 00:42:05,310
All right.

767
00:42:05,968 --> 00:42:07,123
Shall we get started?

768
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:25,153
Thank you, Prosecutor Jung.

769
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:37,688
It's done.

770
00:42:41,326 --> 00:42:42,302
It's been resolved.

771
00:42:42,402 --> 00:42:43,587
-It did?
-Yes.

772
00:42:49,501 --> 00:42:50,735
Such a nice weather.

773
00:42:52,547 --> 00:42:53,435
Wow.

774
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,240
Attorney Lee. You really have good luck.

775
00:42:56,954 --> 00:42:58,309
Please have a cup of coffee.

776
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:01,271
If you give this to me,
you're not going to have enough.

777
00:43:01,356 --> 00:43:03,144
I just won't give one
to Prosecutor Jung.

778
00:43:04,881 --> 00:43:08,791
By the way, I almost got
disappointed with you.

779
00:43:09,147 --> 00:43:11,822
If he had that much evidence,
you could've given me a warning.

780
00:43:13,567 --> 00:43:16,716
I didn't know that he had prepared
that much.

781
00:43:16,801 --> 00:43:18,162
He was just pretending to be dumb.

782
00:43:18,247 --> 00:43:21,041
I thought you'd be on my side forever...

783
00:43:21,654 --> 00:43:22,700
...but you've changed.

784
00:43:24,592 --> 00:43:27,068
I don't take sides in this field.

785
00:43:27,153 --> 00:43:29,252
I was the same way
when I was working with you...

786
00:43:29,337 --> 00:43:30,501
...and I'm still the same now.

787
00:43:31,367 --> 00:43:34,245
But if you feel that I've changed...

788
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:37,815
...don't you think you're the one
who changed instead of me?

789
00:43:49,689 --> 00:43:51,077
Prosecutor Jung.
You did a good job.

790
00:43:51,162 --> 00:43:53,230
You were a little bit cool today.

791
00:43:55,334 --> 00:43:56,282
Mr. Choi.

792
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:56,955
Yes.

793
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,703
I've been wrong about you all this time.

794
00:44:00,634 --> 00:44:04,634
I thought you were giving
Attorney Lee Yoobum special treatment.

795
00:44:04,992 --> 00:44:07,367
I was even suspicious of you that
you've accepted something from him.

796
00:44:09,603 --> 00:44:11,682
When you got off work early I wonder
if he was taking you out for drinks.

797
00:44:11,767 --> 00:44:13,601
If you come to work late, I wonder
if you drank too much with him.

798
00:44:13,701 --> 00:44:15,047
That's what I thought.

799
00:44:15,429 --> 00:44:17,816
When did I get off work that early?

800
00:44:17,901 --> 00:44:20,099
And I was only late to work once.

801
00:44:20,184 --> 00:44:22,068
When you would text
often during work hours...

802
00:44:22,133 --> 00:44:23,749
...I thought that it was proof
that you were close with him.

803
00:44:23,834 --> 00:44:28,101
The texts were from my bank
telling me to pay back the loan.

804
00:44:28,501 --> 00:44:31,135
I'm really sorry for
doubting you all this time.

805
00:44:43,191 --> 00:44:46,116
You shouldn't text too
much during work hours.

806
00:44:46,968 --> 00:44:48,654
Sir, that's...

807
00:44:48,739 --> 00:44:49,949
You've changed Mr. Choi.

808
00:44:50,501 --> 00:44:52,282
You were always on time before.

809
00:44:52,367 --> 00:44:54,467
No. That's not it.

810
00:44:54,853 --> 00:44:56,755
I thought your liver is in bad condition.

811
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,329
Please stop drinking.

812
00:45:01,901 --> 00:45:04,435
He said it was all a misunderstanding.

813
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:07,302
He said that everything he said in
the beginning was a misunderstanding.

814
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,310
Prosecutor Jung.

815
00:45:16,234 --> 00:45:17,434
I want to speak to you for a moment.

816
00:45:23,467 --> 00:45:24,306
What is this?

817
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,783
He worked with me...

818
00:45:25,868 --> 00:45:28,752
...at Changwon Prosecutor's Office
and his nickname is Viper.

819
00:45:28,998 --> 00:45:31,967
He recently quit being a prosecutor
and became a divorce lawyer.

820
00:45:32,934 --> 00:45:35,989
You have to hire a successful viper
to get money out of a bastard...

821
00:45:36,074 --> 00:45:38,871
...like Park Junmo who hides
his assets in different places.

822
00:45:38,956 --> 00:45:40,209
Give this to Do Geumseok.

823
00:45:40,294 --> 00:45:41,391
He will be helpful to her.

824
00:45:41,476 --> 00:45:43,207
I didn't think of this.

825
00:45:44,868 --> 00:45:46,115
I'm sure you didn't.

826
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,367
You didn't think of that because you
were too busy catching Park Junmo.

827
00:45:48,721 --> 00:45:50,482
Thank you.
You really are my senior at work.

828
00:45:50,567 --> 00:45:51,549
Right?

829
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,729
I have an impact, right?

830
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:55,802
I can leave a mark.

831
00:45:55,887 --> 00:45:56,793
One shot.

832
00:46:00,534 --> 00:46:02,356
Did you see me?

833
00:46:02,441 --> 00:46:03,268
Yes.

834
00:46:03,979 --> 00:46:06,685
All of us watched you through this.

835
00:46:13,475 --> 00:46:14,368
Everybody.

836
00:46:14,453 --> 00:46:16,499
Shake your body.

837
00:46:16,584 --> 00:46:18,937
Everybody. Sunshine.

838
00:46:19,022 --> 00:46:20,534
Everyone enjoy!

839
00:46:20,601 --> 00:46:22,246
-Enjoy!
-Enjoy!

840
00:46:24,934 --> 00:46:26,234
Hey. Do you think
you're drinking alcohol?

841
00:46:26,334 --> 00:46:30,991
Our Prosecutor Jung took
care of the case so smartly.

842
00:46:31,076 --> 00:46:35,367
He already moved our residence and he's
already looking into scholarships too.

843
00:46:35,613 --> 00:46:38,934
He even got a restraining
order against my husband too.

844
00:46:39,057 --> 00:46:41,498
Do you think my brother
is still an idiot prosecutor?

845
00:46:44,133 --> 00:46:46,119
He's not an idiot prosecutor.

846
00:46:46,204 --> 00:46:47,538
But he's not a noble either.

847
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:49,673
I'll bring him in.

848
00:46:52,467 --> 00:46:55,179
By the way, don't you think
those two guys come here often?

849
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:58,135
That's because the food is good here.

850
00:46:58,608 --> 00:46:59,741
I don't think so.

851
00:46:59,868 --> 00:47:01,591
I think there's a different reason.

852
00:47:01,676 --> 00:47:02,502
A different reason?

853
00:47:02,764 --> 00:47:03,498
What is it?

854
00:47:06,569 --> 00:47:08,459
I heard you indicted Park Junmo.

855
00:47:08,901 --> 00:47:10,314
Great job.

856
00:47:10,399 --> 00:47:11,801
What's a big deal about
getting him indicted?

857
00:47:12,367 --> 00:47:13,400
Isn't that obvious?

858
00:47:13,501 --> 00:47:14,260
Really?

859
00:47:14,345 --> 00:47:15,127
Did you indict him?

860
00:47:15,212 --> 00:47:17,344
Amazing.
I didn't know.

861
00:47:17,429 --> 00:47:18,302
Come here.

862
00:47:19,111 --> 00:47:20,313
I'll give you a hug.

863
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:22,954
Come on. Come on.

864
00:47:23,877 --> 00:47:25,175
Come on.

865
00:47:28,784 --> 00:47:30,547
Why isn't he here yet?

866
00:47:31,834 --> 00:47:32,750
Is he eating out with his team?

867
00:47:33,868 --> 00:47:34,918
Is he working late tonight?

868
00:48:02,634 --> 00:48:03,801
I'm sorry.

869
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:13,858
You know that man with long arms?

870
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,800
Did he come here today?

871
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:16,842
No.

872
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:18,449
He didn't come here today.

873
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:21,901
I see.

874
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:24,501
Welcome.

875
00:48:24,683 --> 00:48:27,404
Americano with double shot
and extra hazelnut syrup please.

876
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:32,258
By the way, you know that woman
who comes every morning?

877
00:48:32,343 --> 00:48:33,334
A woman with short hair...

878
00:48:33,419 --> 00:48:37,867
That short hair woman
was here looking for you.

879
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,397
Do you not know each
other's phone numbers yet?

880
00:48:42,334 --> 00:48:43,387
No. Not yet...

881
00:48:46,334 --> 00:48:48,701
She really is a terrible woman.

882
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:50,227
I can't find her when I need her.

883
00:49:12,734 --> 00:49:14,235
What are you looking for so urgently?

884
00:49:33,604 --> 00:49:34,938
Save my number on your phone.

885
00:49:35,773 --> 00:49:38,242
I was so frustrated because
I couldn't get in touch with you.

886
00:49:38,831 --> 00:49:40,005
What is this?

887
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:41,140
It's my business card.

888
00:49:41,429 --> 00:49:43,282
I'm taking a break right now,
but my number is the same...

889
00:49:43,367 --> 00:49:44,667
...so you can call me at that number.

890
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:49,503
Have you heard what happened
to Park Junmo's case?

891
00:49:49,667 --> 00:49:52,816
Yes. I heard that you brought
back even the previous cases...

892
00:49:52,901 --> 00:49:54,591
...and indicted him.

893
00:49:57,267 --> 00:49:59,889
I was so glad that my dream was wrong.

894
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:02,115
Why didn't you tell me about
the dream in the morning?

895
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:05,168
I just wanted to cheer you on.

896
00:50:06,801 --> 00:50:08,495
I told you that I don't
want you to cheer me on.

897
00:50:09,029 --> 00:50:09,863
By the way...

898
00:50:10,111 --> 00:50:11,779
...why were you looking for me?

899
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:14,215
Were you going to brag about the fact
that you indicted Park Junmo?

900
00:50:14,367 --> 00:50:15,639
I wasn't looking for you.

901
00:50:15,724 --> 00:50:17,311
I came here straight from my office.

902
00:50:19,381 --> 00:50:20,801
By the way, why are
you wearing that apron?

903
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:22,587
It looks like you
stopped by my restaurant.

904
00:50:23,767 --> 00:50:25,101
Is it for advertisement?

905
00:50:25,325 --> 00:50:26,323
Is it to keep warm?

906
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:28,728
Damn it.

907
00:50:30,501 --> 00:50:33,833
You said you don't want me to cheer you
since it felt like I was threatening you.

908
00:50:34,467 --> 00:50:36,335
Because you think that you'd
disappoint me if you're not successful.

909
00:50:36,434 --> 00:50:38,295
Gosh. Yes. I don't like it.

910
00:50:40,834 --> 00:50:42,301
Stay still.
I'll loosen it for you.

911
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,743
I won't be disappointed.

912
00:50:47,494 --> 00:50:49,901
If you're successful, I'd be thankful.

913
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,249
Even if you're not successful, I'd be
thankful for you for giving your best.

914
00:50:52,501 --> 00:50:53,884
So why would I be disappointed?

915
00:51:00,801 --> 00:51:03,944
So, don't hate it when I cheer you on.

916
00:51:08,033 --> 00:51:09,044
All the best.

917
00:51:20,801 --> 00:51:21,735
Thank you.

918
00:52:14,501 --> 00:52:15,901
What are you doing?

919
00:52:21,767 --> 00:52:23,674
I taking off the apron. The apron.

920
00:52:24,701 --> 00:52:25,901
I must be crazy.

921
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,590
I closed my eyes.

922
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,165
Why is he here?

923
00:52:58,734 --> 00:53:00,221
I called him over. Why?

924
00:53:00,306 --> 00:53:01,443
I'm glad you did.

925
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:04,214
Do you eat breakfast
like this every morning?

926
00:53:04,434 --> 00:53:05,035
Yes.

927
00:53:05,149 --> 00:53:07,214
We had five-spice sliced steamed
pork for breakfast yesterday.

928
00:53:07,617 --> 00:53:09,712
By the way, what happened
to Soyun studying overseas?

929
00:53:09,797 --> 00:53:13,301
Evan Foundation contacted me that
final approval was given yesterday.

930
00:53:13,415 --> 00:53:15,634
The scholarship will more
than take care of the tuition.

931
00:53:15,737 --> 00:53:18,535
That's great.
That's really great.

932
00:53:18,636 --> 00:53:21,216
Will you be staying in
the dorm when you go overseas?

933
00:53:21,899 --> 00:53:22,532
Yes.

934
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:24,631
But don't worry.

935
00:53:24,716 --> 00:53:25,897
The Wi-Fi is strong...

936
00:53:25,982 --> 00:53:27,655
...so I should be able
to message you every day.

937
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:28,602
Everyday?

938
00:53:29,106 --> 00:53:29,967
Don't you want to?

939
00:53:30,868 --> 00:53:31,669
I'd love that.

940
00:53:33,362 --> 00:53:37,178
Did you check the water pressure
in the bathrooms at the dorm?

941
00:53:37,263 --> 00:53:39,597
You need to make sure it's strong.

942
00:53:40,424 --> 00:53:42,152
What are you talking about?
Why is that important?

943
00:53:42,237 --> 00:53:43,901
You better be quiet.

944
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,341
If you clog it like the last time,
you might get sent back.

945
00:53:47,426 --> 00:53:49,302
I told you to be quiet.

946
00:53:49,872 --> 00:53:52,262
That was my poop.

947
00:53:56,498 --> 00:53:57,228
Excuse me?

948
00:53:57,313 --> 00:53:58,158
Really?

949
00:53:58,587 --> 00:54:00,111
Why are you just telling us now?

950
00:54:00,196 --> 00:54:02,339
I was too embarrassed at that time.

951
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,157
What are you talking about?

952
00:54:04,242 --> 00:54:06,700
It would've been done
if you just said it was yours.

953
00:54:06,801 --> 00:54:08,830
I just said it right now.

954
00:54:09,355 --> 00:54:11,082
I'm so disappointed in you.

955
00:54:11,171 --> 00:54:12,879
You're disappointed
over such trivial things.

956
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,733
It's really delicious.

957
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,326
I don't know when I had such
wonderful breakfast the last time.

958
00:54:19,411 --> 00:54:21,870
Why didn't Prosecutor Jung come with you?
Why are you alone?

959
00:54:21,955 --> 00:54:24,135
Jaechan said he had
to go somewhere today.

960
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:24,986
Where?

961
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:50,521
"The late Jung Ilsong"

962
00:54:51,934 --> 00:54:53,181
How about becoming a prosecutor?

963
00:54:53,266 --> 00:54:56,300
If you become a prosecutor,
I'd be so happy.

964
00:54:56,401 --> 00:54:58,901
I'll give it a try.

965
00:54:59,029 --> 00:54:59,704
All the best.

966
00:55:04,624 --> 00:55:05,470
Father.

967
00:55:06,868 --> 00:55:09,402
I became a prosecutor
just like you told me to.

968
00:55:10,667 --> 00:55:14,538
I was so afraid of disappointing
you that I worked so hard.

969
00:55:15,448 --> 00:55:18,334
It was so hard difficult that
I wanted to run away sometimes...

970
00:55:25,273 --> 00:55:30,727
I think I loved you that much.

971
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:34,398
"Christian Columbarium"

972
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:37,835
"SBC Reporter Nam Hongjoo."

973
00:55:38,448 --> 00:55:41,905
I have someone who cheers me on now
like how you used to do for me.

974
00:56:20,665 --> 00:56:22,212
I won't be disappointed.

975
00:56:22,571 --> 00:56:24,721
If you're successful, I'd be thankful.

976
00:56:24,806 --> 00:56:26,816
Even if you're not successful, I'd be
thankful for you for giving your best.

977
00:56:27,304 --> 00:56:28,752
So why would I be disappointed?

978
00:56:30,165 --> 00:56:31,521
She's someone who will say...

979
00:56:31,874 --> 00:56:33,675
...that she'll be fine whether
I'm successful or not.

980
00:56:34,501 --> 00:56:37,627
So, don't hate it when I cheer you on.

981
00:56:41,721 --> 00:56:42,754
All the best.

982
00:56:45,868 --> 00:56:47,134
But still...

983
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,243
...I keep on wanting to be successful.

984
00:56:52,701 --> 00:56:53,643
Thank you.

985
00:56:56,033 --> 00:56:57,214
Thank you.

986
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,200
I'm afraid of that feeling.

987
00:58:09,768 --> 00:58:10,654
Jaechan.

988
00:58:18,589 --> 00:58:19,796
You must've had a dream.

989
00:58:20,283 --> 00:58:21,476
What did you dream about?

990
00:58:21,807 --> 00:58:23,421
Did you dream about what
will happen in the future?

991
00:58:25,095 --> 00:58:27,233
Before it makes things difficult...

992
00:58:29,033 --> 00:58:31,015
Before my feelings get deeper...

993
00:58:33,644 --> 00:58:35,022
I want to run away from it.

994
00:59:25,634 --> 00:59:27,564
"While You Were Sleeping"

995
00:59:27,861 --> 00:59:28,931
Are you a stalker?

996
00:59:29,016 --> 00:59:29,915
Is everything okay?

997
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:30,681
Yes. Everything is fine.

998
00:59:30,766 --> 00:59:31,812
Nam Hongjoo!

999
00:59:31,897 --> 00:59:33,568
She was an SBC reporter.

1000
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,915
She was so vicious.

1001
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,143
Why is such a great reporter
working at a restaurant?

1002
00:59:39,228 --> 00:59:40,259
Are you going to return to work?

1003
00:59:40,344 --> 00:59:42,511
You said you died as a reporter.

1004
00:59:42,596 --> 00:59:43,737
The future can be changed.

1005
00:59:43,822 --> 00:59:46,353
Did he say he's going to save you?
Is he going to protect you?

1006
00:59:47,033 --> 00:59:47,923
How did you...?

1007
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:51,749
I just wish it'd be
more wonderful today.

1008
00:59:51,834 --> 00:59:54,155
Should I return to work or not?

1009
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,967
It wasn't because she didn't like it.
She wanted to do it but was just scared.

1010
01:00:00,634 --> 01:00:07,901
