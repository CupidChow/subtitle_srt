00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,410
Hakyoung.

4
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:19,619
If the verdict points
me as the murderer...

5
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,381
...I'm going to reveal
your secret to the police.

6
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,203
Do Hakyoung.

7
00:00:29,288 --> 00:00:30,681
You don't want that, do you?

8
00:00:31,714 --> 00:00:32,781
So...

9
00:00:33,314 --> 00:00:35,314
...do whatever you can...

10
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:38,815
...to prove my innocence.

11
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:49,648
You know Do Hakyoung, right?

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,685
And you pretended not to know him.

13
00:00:52,448 --> 00:00:54,721
No, I really don't know him.

14
00:01:01,114 --> 00:01:02,015
Let's go.

15
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:05,750
You can turn yourself in
and I can quit being a cop...

"Resignation Letter"

17
00:01:06,947 --> 00:01:08,201
Then, everything will be over, right?

18
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:13,889
Hey, you jerk!

19
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:15,475
You crazy jerk!

20
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,178
Do you think I would really do that?

21
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,348
You jerk...

22
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,751
I'm like this because I'm so frustrated.

23
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:29,489
Can't you just say that you
understand and that you trust me!

24
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,395
You jerk...

25
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:37,998
You jerk...

26
00:02:00,214 --> 00:02:01,788
Sir, can you please go faster?

27
00:02:17,181 --> 00:02:18,848
I don't trust you yet.

28
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:20,415
So, tell me.

29
00:02:21,114 --> 00:02:22,742
If I believe in you
after I hear everything...

30
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:24,778
...then perhaps others...

31
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:27,881
...will believe in you as well.

32
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,492
Han Wootak!

33
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,215
Hongjoo.

34
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,497
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

35
00:02:45,047 --> 00:02:46,499
No, I'm okay.

36
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:48,668
That's good.

37
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,472
See? I was right, right?

38
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,524
I told you he would come to your place.

39
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,877
Didn't I tell you to lock your doors?

40
00:02:58,047 --> 00:03:00,513
You seriously don't listen!

41
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:04,548
That hurts.

42
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,488
Are you crying?

43
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,577
Yes, that really hurts.

44
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,462
I'm crying because it hurts so much.

45
00:03:19,648 --> 00:03:20,701
Wootak...

46
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,229
Yes, sir.

47
00:03:26,314 --> 00:03:29,282
Do Hakyoung is being taken to
Han River Police Station right now.

48
00:03:29,367 --> 00:03:30,844
Why did he suddenly turn himself in?

49
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:36,732
I heard someone convinced him to.

50
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:37,584
Who?

51
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:41,788
I'll look more into that
and report it to you later.

52
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:48,644
You must be curious about a lot of
things but you're holding yourself well.

53
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,620
Are you kidding?

54
00:03:49,705 --> 00:03:51,708
I have so much to ask,
but I'm just holding myself back.

55
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,248
What's this? Are you going
to have an interview with me?

56
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,597
Can I ask?

57
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,936
No.

58
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,176
How much did you see in your dreams?

59
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,615
Do Hakyoung went into your house...

60
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:12,185
...and asked you to be on
his side because he thinks it's unfair.

61
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:14,487
That's it?

62
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,024
Yes, that's it.

63
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:21,294
Why? Were there
more important parts after that?

64
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,481
No, there wasn't. That's all.

65
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,707
Regarding today...

66
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,980
Thanks for worrying.

67
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:57,997
He hugged her?

68
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,317
Hey, why would he hug
her when he's thankful?

69
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:03,715
Do you hug people when you're thankful?

70
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:08,608
They can if it's American style.

71
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:09,976
American style?

72
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,746
Well I guess I can hug Hyemin
or Hyangmi when I'm thankful...

73
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,416
That's nonsense.

74
00:05:16,514 --> 00:05:17,499
I can never do that.

75
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:19,525
Not just a friend, but even if someone
saved this nation I can't do that.

76
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,352
Why? Because this is Korea.

77
00:05:21,437 --> 00:05:24,042
Then you can think that they hugged
because they like each other.

78
00:05:24,127 --> 00:05:25,741
Hey, that's not right.

79
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,442
Why not?

80
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,928
That's because I'm...

81
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:30,957
I'm...

82
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:43,009
It's not like I'm anything...
I should stop thinking about it.

83
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,242
Have breakfast with me while you're here.

84
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:03,648
Forget it, I feel bad since I had
breakfast at your place a lot already.

85
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:05,665
Okay.

86
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,232
Anyways, thanks for driving me home.

87
00:06:07,317 --> 00:06:08,032
Bye.

88
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:10,467
Hey, Hongjoo.

89
00:06:13,565 --> 00:06:14,999
Regarding today...

90
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:20,899
Han Wootak!

91
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:35,499
Are you going to have breakfast?

92
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:37,096
I'm also going...

93
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:38,698
The thing is...

94
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,999
Did you also think that
Hakyoung could initially...

95
00:06:42,098 --> 00:06:44,304
...be the culprit when you
came across this case?

96
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,442
Yes, I'm here early to have breakfast.

97
00:06:49,966 --> 00:06:51,366
Let's go in, I'm hungry.

98
00:06:52,165 --> 00:06:52,799
Okay.

99
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,155
It's Do Hakyoung.

100
00:07:07,832 --> 00:07:09,266
Do you have anything to
say to the bereaved family?

101
00:07:09,365 --> 00:07:10,932
How do you feel right now?

102
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,299
I didn't kill her!

103
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:14,816
Why did you kill her?

104
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,046
I'm wrongly accused!

105
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:17,632
Does that mean you're not
admitting to the charges?

106
00:07:17,734 --> 00:07:19,472
Then, why are you turning yourself in?

107
00:07:20,204 --> 00:07:21,574
My friend told me...

108
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,910
...to trust that the law
will protect me and turn myself in.

109
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,281
He told me that the law
will prove my innocence!

110
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:32,131
I trusted his words and turned myself in.

111
00:07:32,265 --> 00:07:34,988
Why is that guy talking so much
as if he did something good?

112
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:39,759
All I did was go into the house
to fix the internet and came out.

113
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,527
I really didn't...

114
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:45,647
Now, let's turn off the news
and focus on the breakfast.

115
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:49,800
I'm so happy to have you join
us for our breakfast as well.

116
00:07:49,885 --> 00:07:50,552
Thank you.

117
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:51,778
Come by more often.

118
00:07:51,863 --> 00:07:53,449
It'd be nicer if you came every day.

119
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:55,594
Should I talk about the dream or not?

120
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:57,210
What am I worrying about?

121
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:59,779
Why isn't he telling me anything?

122
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:01,014
Jaechan.

123
00:08:02,046 --> 00:08:03,813
Jaechan. I have something
I need to talk to you about.

124
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:04,613
What?

125
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,150
Did you just hear me?

126
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,747
What? What do you mean?

127
00:08:07,832 --> 00:08:10,090
No, never mind.

128
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:11,348
What is it?

129
00:08:12,981 --> 00:08:15,328
Hakyoung, who just came
out on the news, is my friend.

130
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:16,729
Friend?

131
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:17,463
What?

132
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:21,234
We graduated high school together
and we were roommates until recently.

133
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:24,095
Oh my goodness...

134
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,617
Then the friend that
convinced Hakyoung is...

135
00:08:26,702 --> 00:08:27,540
It's me.

136
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:29,146
He came over to my place
in the middle of the night...

137
00:08:29,247 --> 00:08:31,460
...so I convinced him to turn himself in.

138
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:32,314
Goodness.

139
00:08:34,064 --> 00:08:37,150
His case will be assigned to you.

140
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:38,751
I saw it in my dream.

141
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,148
To me?

142
00:08:40,247 --> 00:08:41,888
That's why I told him to turn himself in.

143
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,916
If it's you, I feel like you will be
able to prove his innocence.

144
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:47,560
How do you know he's innocent?

145
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:50,263
Did you see that in your dream as well?

146
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,866
No, but I've known him
for a long time so I know.

147
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,703
-Hakyoung would never...
-He would never kill someone?

148
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,247
How do you know that for certain?

149
00:09:05,088 --> 00:09:05,865
Well.

150
00:09:06,064 --> 00:09:08,413
It'd be nice for me to
know someone that well too.

151
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,195
That way we don't need
to go through the trial...

152
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,985
It would be much simpler to just ask a
friend or a parent and it'll all be over.

153
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,088
Do you think he's guilty?

154
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:16,181
No.

155
00:09:17,747 --> 00:09:19,459
But I also don't think he's innocent.

156
00:09:22,013 --> 00:09:25,098
I can't be certain of anything
until I investigate him.

157
00:09:25,814 --> 00:09:27,600
I'll have to see if he's guilty or not...

158
00:09:36,747 --> 00:09:38,811
Wootak hugged
me in your dream?

159
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:39,896
Why?

160
00:09:39,981 --> 00:09:42,422
He said something like he was
thankful for you to worry for him...

161
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,183
No way...

162
00:09:44,847 --> 00:09:45,572
Also...

163
00:09:45,914 --> 00:09:48,314
...I'm not someone who'd just hug
anyone who hugs me.

164
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:50,105
No, you hugged him tightly.

165
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,920
Not only did you hug him,
but you also patted his back.

166
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:54,187
Do you usually do that for anyone?

167
00:09:54,272 --> 00:09:54,814
No.

168
00:09:54,866 --> 00:09:57,562
Oh, that probably means that
Wootak isn't just anyone for you.

169
00:09:57,647 --> 00:09:59,932
What's so special about him?
I'd like to know.

170
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,383
Just say there's
nothing special about him.

171
00:10:06,468 --> 00:10:08,903
I think Mr. Youngdeok Crab is jealous...

172
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,580
I can hear you. I'm not jealous.
Don't misunderstand.

173
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:13,980
I'm sorry.

174
00:10:15,146 --> 00:10:17,580
What's so special about Wootak?

175
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,880
Mr. Youngdeok Crab...

176
00:10:21,981 --> 00:10:23,471
Is it because of the uniform?

177
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,615
Uniform?

178
00:10:25,305 --> 00:10:31,948
I'm a little fond of men who wear
uniforms like police, navy, or pilot.

179
00:10:33,447 --> 00:10:39,071
Sometimes I have a crush on
Wootak when he's in his uniform.

180
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,007
Only sometimes.

181
00:10:42,347 --> 00:10:44,315
Prosecutors wear robes as well.

182
00:10:44,413 --> 00:10:46,312
Why were you so indifferent
when I was wearing a robe?

183
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:48,314
Those robes are nothing.

184
00:10:48,413 --> 00:10:50,546
They look like you're in a choir...

185
00:10:50,631 --> 00:10:51,617
Such a turn off.

186
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,020
A choir...

187
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,243
I imagined it.

188
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,512
Darn it.

189
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,881
I feel it's a little unfair.

190
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:24,699
Why am I trying to explain myself to you?

191
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,559
Especially when it hasn't even happened?

192
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,788
It probably would've
happened if I didn't go out.

193
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:32,249
This isn't jealousy. It's pure curiosity.

194
00:11:32,995 --> 00:11:33,708
Curiosity?

195
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,622
Wootak is a friend of the offender.

196
00:11:35,707 --> 00:11:37,376
I'm asking this as a prosecutor...

197
00:11:37,461 --> 00:11:40,433
...because I want to know
why you're being protective.

198
00:11:41,814 --> 00:11:43,436
I'm not on Wootak's side.

199
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,271
I'm not being protective as well.

200
00:11:46,593 --> 00:11:49,396
I'm 100 percent certain
that Hakyoung is guilty.

201
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,459
100 percent? Based on what?

202
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,404
Hakyoung is the only person who
was caught on the security camera.

203
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:57,316
And it's really suspicious
that he fled the police.

204
00:11:58,318 --> 00:11:58,918
And...

205
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,988
If the verdict
points me as the murderer...

206
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,390
...then I'm going to reveal
your secret to the police.

207
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,870
Wootak only said he trusts
that murderer...

208
00:12:08,955 --> 00:12:11,789
...because he's a friend and not because
he really believes him.

209
00:12:11,881 --> 00:12:12,615
Jeez.

210
00:12:12,961 --> 00:12:14,656
Are you siding with Wootak?

211
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:17,370
Seriously...

212
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:22,575
If I had to choose,
I'd be on your side and not his.

213
00:12:22,914 --> 00:12:25,293
I wish Hakyoung pays
for what he's done...

214
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:29,015
...and I wish not to see him get
released like Kang Daehee did.

215
00:12:29,922 --> 00:12:32,552
If it's you,
I believe that you can do that.

216
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,622
Are you cheering for me?

217
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,491
No, I'm threatening you.

218
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,695
I think I'd be disappointed
if you can't prove him guilty.

219
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:56,008
Is it your brother that killed my father?

220
00:12:56,398 --> 00:13:00,537
I didn't know either that my
brother would do such a thing.

221
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:19,113
Hey, where are you going?

222
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:19,914
Let go.

223
00:13:20,013 --> 00:13:21,567
I have to tell him something.

224
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:22,647
What?

225
00:13:22,747 --> 00:13:24,470
It's none of your business.
Let go!

226
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,005
Let's go together.

227
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,111
I also have something I have to tell him.

228
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:50,163
"Price and Prejudice"

229
00:13:52,742 --> 00:13:54,567
People can be so diligent.

230
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:58,137
We clean these every day
and they still write every day.

231
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:01,707
Madam, how about closing
the store for few days?

232
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,943
At least until the trial is over...

233
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,413
Wootak, is Hakyoung a psycho?

234
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:09,181
A psychopath.

235
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:13,334
Psychopaths have no emotions,
so is he a psycho?

236
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:16,437
He cried his eyes out when
Little Mermaid became sea foam...

237
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,024
...so how could he be a psycho?

238
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,726
I know, there's no way.

239
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,030
I know he's not a nice guy.

240
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,465
He stole your money
when you two were young...

241
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,335
...and he put me through a lot.

242
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,762
But he's still not evil enough
to kill a person, right?

243
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,740
Of course not.

244
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:40,913
Those jerks...

245
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,804
It's been a while since
Hakyoung turned himself in.

246
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,301
When are you going to prove him guilty?

247
00:14:52,386 --> 00:14:56,747
Why is that Prosecutor Jung
so slow with the case?

248
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,168
He has the least experience
in his department.

249
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,014
He's never had such a big case...

250
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:06,221
...so he's probably investigating
it over and over again.

251
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:08,908
Each day must be a pain for you two...

252
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:10,676
...and he's not even being considerate...

253
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:15,014
Attorney Lee.

254
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:17,881
I have pancreatic cancer.

255
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,620
I only have few more months to live.

256
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:30,262
I have to see that jerk, Hakyoung,
going to jail before I die.

257
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,431
If by any chance...

258
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,900
...the law lets him walk away...

259
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:37,436
...I'd probably...

260
00:15:43,347 --> 00:15:44,810
Don't worry.

261
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:49,215
I'll make sure to prosecute him
within a week.

262
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,682
You didn't take your watch off
nor did you roll a paper today.

263
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,511
I didn't?

264
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:04,956
Aren't you going to charge
them for the consultation?

265
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:05,994
It's okay.

266
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,234
I was also a fan of Yoo Sookyung.

267
00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:10,015
So, let's just say that it was my way
to pay my respect to her.

268
00:16:10,113 --> 00:16:11,604
You look like you're in a good mood.

269
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,105
Of course I am.

270
00:16:14,447 --> 00:16:17,925
I always had to fight against the law,
but this time, I'm on the law's side.

271
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:22,982
It feels as if I'm a big-time player
who used to be a small-time player.

272
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,418
Please prepare the complaint file.

273
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:27,381
Yes, sir.

274
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,628
What's your girlfriend's ring size?

275
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:39,832
I don't really know her exact size...

276
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:13,332
Wow.

277
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,381
I have dreams like this too?

278
00:17:19,146 --> 00:17:20,272
What's wrong with my heart?

279
00:17:21,612 --> 00:17:24,353
Am I going to die from my heart exploding?

280
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,280
A ring is too much for me right now...

281
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,786
It's Vietnamese food for today.

282
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:38,701
-Thank you for the meal.
-Thank you for the meal.

283
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:43,061
These rice noodles are so good.

284
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:44,353
Did you run
a Vietnamese restaurant before?

285
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,729
Yea, I did three years ago,
but it didn't go well.

286
00:17:46,814 --> 00:17:48,580
There was another
Vietnamese restaurant next to mine...

287
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:50,369
...and the head chef was Vietnamese.

288
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,372
Do you have a fever?

289
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,208
Why is your face so red?

290
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,546
It's probably because I had hot soup.

291
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:04,515
What time should I get to
the Prosecutor's office today?

292
00:18:04,614 --> 00:18:05,446
2 PM.

293
00:18:05,531 --> 00:18:06,663
Why are you going there?

294
00:18:06,748 --> 00:18:08,038
For the witness investigation.

295
00:18:08,123 --> 00:18:11,056
You have to be honest and not take
his side because you're his friend.

296
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:12,382
That's a given.

297
00:18:12,637 --> 00:18:17,278
Can the prosecutors tell
if a witness is lying or not?

298
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:18,644
Yes, of course.

299
00:18:18,729 --> 00:18:22,541
I can't believe it either, but he's
known to be a human lie detector.

300
00:18:22,626 --> 00:18:24,588
Really?

301
00:18:24,673 --> 00:18:26,453
Police Han, how's breakfast today?

302
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:27,140
Is it good?

303
00:18:27,225 --> 00:18:29,087
Of course.
It's really good.

304
00:18:29,172 --> 00:18:31,907
Prosecutor Jung,
is he lying or telling the truth?

305
00:18:32,706 --> 00:18:33,594
He's telling the truth.

306
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,440
Police Han, do you think you're handsome?

307
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,231
No, not at all.

308
00:18:38,965 --> 00:18:39,540
That's a lie.

309
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,035
What the, such a coy.

310
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,306
Such a liar.

311
00:18:42,391 --> 00:18:43,989
He's good.

312
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,458
Do you have someone you like?

313
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,799
Yes, I do.

314
00:18:55,206 --> 00:18:56,769
It's the truth.

315
00:18:59,173 --> 00:19:00,472
Is it Hongjoo?

316
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,280
Mom.

317
00:19:03,365 --> 00:19:05,076
It's okay, this is just for fun.

318
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:06,144
Is it Hongjoo?

319
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,007
It's not.

320
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:23,341
He's telling the truth.

321
00:19:25,173 --> 00:19:26,231
You're very accurate.

322
00:19:26,606 --> 00:19:28,467
I'm looking forward
to today's investigation.

323
00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:32,271
Yes, please be honest
as you are right now.

324
00:19:32,907 --> 00:19:33,574
Sure.

325
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:40,854
Work on it.

326
00:19:40,939 --> 00:19:42,214
Put on some red lipsticks.

327
00:19:47,573 --> 00:19:48,821
Okay. Sure.

328
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:50,006
You're here.

329
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:53,674
Don't unpack and just go.
You're in trouble.

330
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:54,479
What is it?

331
00:19:54,564 --> 00:19:57,663
Yoo Sookyung's family sued
Do Hakyoung for murdering her.

332
00:19:57,972 --> 00:19:59,954
He's already being investigated right now.

333
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:00,688
Can they still sue him?

334
00:20:00,773 --> 00:20:03,117
They're probably frustrated
at the slow prosecution.

335
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,853
Go listen to what the proxy
of the plaintiff has to say.

336
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:06,864
Who's' the proxy?

337
00:20:06,949 --> 00:20:08,998
Um... it's Attorney Lee from Haekwang.

338
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,012
Do you want his number?

339
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:14,780
No, I have it.

340
00:20:19,273 --> 00:20:20,252
Wootak.

341
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,956
I did everything you told me to do.

342
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:28,761
I confessed everything to Prosecutor Jung
and also went through the lie detector...

343
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,499
But why am I still in here?

344
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,040
It's because he's being really cautious.

345
00:20:38,139 --> 00:20:41,873
Him being cautious is going to kill me.

346
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,476
They will only let me have
a public defender when I have a trial...

347
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,673
What did the prosecutor say?

348
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:49,806
Is he looking for evidence?

349
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,250
I'll ask him later.

350
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:54,019
I'm going to be investigated as a witness.

351
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,608
Really?

352
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,873
I was the top for criminal law
when I was in the police academy.

353
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:03,239
I'll do my best and defend
you when you go on trial.

354
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:04,374
Oh.

355
00:21:05,606 --> 00:21:07,068
Oh... yes...

356
00:21:07,153 --> 00:21:09,902
Thank you so much, Wootak...

357
00:21:11,406 --> 00:21:15,574
I seriously have no
one else but you, Wootak.

358
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:22,681
Okay, man.

359
00:21:33,202 --> 00:21:36,328
Wootak, have you visited my mom?

360
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,808
Is she doing well?

361
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:43,435
She's hanging in there.

362
00:21:44,134 --> 00:21:45,604
You have to hang in there as well.

363
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:56,097
That restaurant serves
the best buckwheat noodle.

364
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:58,183
Sir, let's change shifts.
You must be hungry.

365
00:21:58,268 --> 00:21:59,634
Yes.

366
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:00,469
By the way, Wootak...

367
00:22:00,568 --> 00:22:02,016
Where's Lieutenant Han?

368
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:05,350
He went to the Prosecutor's office
for investigation on Hakyoung's case.

369
00:22:05,435 --> 00:22:07,479
Wootak is so weak-hearted...

370
00:22:07,564 --> 00:22:10,852
He should stand strong against
the prosecutors unlike how you did.

371
00:22:10,937 --> 00:22:14,834
He's on a different level than me.

372
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:17,683
He's smart because he finished
police academy and he's also brave.

373
00:22:17,768 --> 00:22:20,235
He's not the type of person to
be intimidated by a prosecutor.

374
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:27,962
And I'm not saying that I'm not smart,
but he's just a little smarter than me.

375
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:33,034
I'm not saying that I'm a coward,
but he's just really brave.

376
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:35,002
Go, I know what you're saying.

377
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,360
And I'm also big...

378
00:22:37,445 --> 00:22:38,850
That's not something to brag about.

379
00:22:38,935 --> 00:22:39,968
You should go for your lunch.

380
00:22:43,335 --> 00:22:47,399
I heard that Wootak has
an amazing background.

381
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,284
He graduated from police academy
with high grades that he received...

382
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,704
...an award from the prime minister.

383
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:55,107
I talked to him earlier for a bit...

384
00:22:55,508 --> 00:22:57,658
...and he's really good with his words
that he may win over us...

385
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:00,279
...if we don't focus today
during the investigation.

386
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:04,750
My gosh. Burnt food is not good for you.

387
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:10,071
Mr. Choi, what will happen
if I can't prosecute this case?

388
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:11,617
You're in big trouble.

389
00:23:11,702 --> 00:23:15,330
You'll not only be blamed by
the chief but by the entire nation.

390
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:17,536
Why?

391
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:19,898
Are you not confident?

392
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,969
No, not that I'm not confident, but...

393
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:25,504
Can I ask you something?

394
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,482
Hyangmi, what are you doing?

395
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:38,784
I'm just getting older.

396
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:41,848
There are 7,000 pages of
Do Hakyoung's case and...

397
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:46,750
...the chief told me to double check so
there are 14,000 pages in total.

398
00:23:46,835 --> 00:23:52,276
I copied them, punched holes,
and stapled them, so I'm getting older.

399
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:55,807
What's this?

400
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,188
We brought it because it's so pretty.

401
00:23:57,273 --> 00:23:59,202
The spring flowers have been
blossoming a lot the past few days.

402
00:23:59,301 --> 00:24:00,269
Really?

403
00:24:00,668 --> 00:24:03,035
I couldn't even see flowers
because of Do Hakyoung.

404
00:24:03,134 --> 00:24:05,668
I'm the only one who
hasn't seen spring yet.

405
00:24:05,768 --> 00:24:07,241
There are many days of spring left.

406
00:24:07,326 --> 00:24:08,790
When?

407
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:12,384
When will I go when these
papers don't get any smaller?

408
00:24:16,134 --> 00:24:17,102
Yes?

409
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:22,628
Is Prosecutor Jung Jaechan around?

410
00:24:24,168 --> 00:24:24,969
Amazing.

411
00:24:25,068 --> 00:24:25,902
Wow.

412
00:24:26,538 --> 00:24:27,733
Nice.

413
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,134
Who might you be?

414
00:24:37,235 --> 00:24:39,623
I'm Han Wootak, I came for
a witness investigation today.

415
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:43,448
I see, Mr. Wootak,
if you just go right this way...

416
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:48,268
Do you have any perfume?

417
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:49,301
I don't have any right now.

418
00:24:49,401 --> 00:24:50,289
What should I do?

419
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,992
It's here...

420
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:55,961
Her spring is here.

421
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,270
This is sad.

422
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:08,622
I called you first before all the other
reporters because we have a past.

423
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:11,149
Thank you. It's such an honor.

424
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:13,294
You're still as usual.

425
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:14,709
What would you like to drink?

426
00:25:14,794 --> 00:25:16,969
Can I have a coke?

427
00:25:17,068 --> 00:25:17,769
Sure.

428
00:25:19,196 --> 00:25:21,268
Having a proxy for
plaintiff is quite unusual...

429
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,601
...but what do you do as a plaintiff?

430
00:25:24,668 --> 00:25:26,602
You know Prosecutor Jung, right?

431
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,645
He's really slow since he's
a newbie and he's also stubborn...

432
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,768
He's following his beliefs
and he's being cautious.

433
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:36,036
Evidence gets polluted
and even disappears...

434
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,239
...if he keeps listening
to what the suspect has to say...

435
00:25:38,324 --> 00:25:39,812
...and tolerate the suspect's
right to remain silent.

436
00:25:39,897 --> 00:25:42,957
It must be your job to
gossip about a prosecutor.

437
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:46,178
What if we end up losing the culprit?

438
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:50,816
That's why I'm here to sue
him on behalf to the family.

439
00:25:53,168 --> 00:25:56,688
Mr. Lee Yoobum, what is it
that you want to say right now?

440
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,093
Can't you tell what I'm trying to say?

441
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:04,550
With all the evidence he has right now...

442
00:26:04,635 --> 00:26:06,015
...he can't win the case.

443
00:26:06,401 --> 00:26:10,168
Do Hakyoung will not be prosecuted
and he can walk away freely.

444
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:13,004
Then, this means that the prosecutor
in charge will get all the blame.

445
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:15,006
I'm here to stop that from happening.

446
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:21,269
I'm saying that I'm on the same
side as Prosecutor Jung this time around.

447
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:29,388
So, can you help me out as well?

448
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:39,903
Ms. Shin, can you take
a look at my investigation?

449
00:26:39,988 --> 00:26:41,233
I don't want to make a mistake.

450
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:45,837
I must take a look since you're asking.

451
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,636
Mr. Lee.

452
00:26:48,935 --> 00:26:49,736
What?

453
00:26:51,101 --> 00:26:52,069
Ms. Son.

454
00:26:54,747 --> 00:26:56,670
Chief, we are starting the witness
investigation right now.

455
00:26:56,768 --> 00:26:57,369
Can you join us?

456
00:26:57,454 --> 00:27:01,269
Of course, I have to watch since it's the
most important case in our department.

457
00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:03,955
What in the world...

458
00:27:04,401 --> 00:27:07,441
When did the police uniform look so good?

459
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:10,303
Police had someone as handsome as him.

460
00:27:10,401 --> 00:27:11,452
Seriously...

461
00:27:11,537 --> 00:27:13,845
Why don't prosecutors have
someone as handsome as him?

462
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:16,168
Prosecutor Jung is handsome.

463
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:18,233
Didn't you used to like him?

464
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:19,702
Briefly.

465
00:27:19,768 --> 00:27:21,135
Only for a moment in the beginning.

466
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,383
You get bored of him easily
when you see him every day.

467
00:27:24,468 --> 00:27:28,079
What else does he have apart from
his job as a prosecutor?

468
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,568
A handsome face and height probably.

469
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:39,135
How much was he listening to what I said?

470
00:27:39,235 --> 00:27:42,036
From the beginning to the end.

471
00:27:42,101 --> 00:27:44,162
Oh no...
What am I going to do?

472
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:50,468
You're early.

473
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,086
Did you have lunch?

474
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:53,819
Yes, I did.

475
00:27:55,268 --> 00:27:58,143
The other prosecutors
are on that side, right?

476
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,214
Can he see us?

477
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:04,549
Do you think so?

478
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:08,787
He's the friend that convinced
Do Hakyoung to turn himself in, right?

479
00:28:09,068 --> 00:28:09,683
Yes.

480
00:28:09,768 --> 00:28:12,317
I hope he doesn't convince
Prosecutor Jung as well.

481
00:28:12,402 --> 00:28:14,462
No matter how I see it...

482
00:28:14,547 --> 00:28:17,002
...I think this case is a bit too big
for our junior Prosecutor Jung.

483
00:28:17,468 --> 00:28:20,768
Don't call him a junior.

484
00:28:21,101 --> 00:28:26,004
He's more reliable than someone
like you who skipped the autopsy.

485
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:30,976
We can't let this case be like Daehee's
case in which he was found innocent.

486
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:34,194
And who's the one that fixed
all your mistakes in the end?

487
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,650
Who's the one that brought
Daehee back to prosecution...

488
00:28:35,735 --> 00:28:36,902
...after he walked away freely?

489
00:28:36,987 --> 00:28:38,701
-Prosecutor Jung.
-Prosecutor Jung.

490
00:28:38,786 --> 00:28:41,261
Do you still think he can't handle it?

491
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:43,003
-No.
-No.

492
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:47,302
This reminds me of Daehee's
case in many ways.

493
00:28:47,401 --> 00:28:51,078
He's certainly the culprit and
yet there's only indirect evidence...

494
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:53,389
I believe in Prosecutor Jung.

495
00:28:53,474 --> 00:28:57,235
He will find one crucial and direct
evidence from today's investigation.

496
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:58,670
Let's do this.

497
00:28:58,770 --> 00:28:59,836
Let's do this.

498
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,884
What kind of relationship
do you have with Do Hakyoung?

499
00:29:03,969 --> 00:29:05,460
We graduated high school together...

500
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:07,835
...and he was my roommate
until a year and a half ago.

501
00:29:15,435 --> 00:29:17,771
Did you also think the culprit
could've been Hakyoung...

502
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:20,098
...when you first encountered
the incident?

503
00:29:21,435 --> 00:29:22,350
Yes.

504
00:29:22,435 --> 00:29:23,270
How so?

505
00:29:23,702 --> 00:29:26,698
I saw the security footage through
the news and it was Hakyoung.

506
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,049
There was no one else that
got caught in the camera, right?

507
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:32,389
No, no one else was caught.

508
00:29:33,201 --> 00:29:37,401
We checked all the footage
from the elevators, stairs, balcony...

509
00:29:37,502 --> 00:29:40,912
...and even the dashcam and
Hakyoung was the only one.

510
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,936
Yes, that what I've heard.

511
00:29:43,802 --> 00:29:46,217
That's why I was also misunderstood
that Hakyoung was the culprit.

512
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:49,669
Misunderstood?

513
00:29:50,301 --> 00:29:51,656
Why do you think it's a misunderstanding?

514
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:54,927
There's a chance it
could've been an accident.

515
00:29:56,168 --> 00:29:57,277
An accident?

516
00:29:57,362 --> 00:30:00,335
If I was his attorney,
I would've insisted it that way.

517
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:05,236
The victim must've died from
an excessive bleeding on the head.

518
00:30:05,902 --> 00:30:07,436
A unfortunate accident
that happened when...

519
00:30:07,535 --> 00:30:08,789
...she slipped and fell on her own.

520
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:10,111
That's nonsense.

521
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:12,802
Then, the picture drawn
by the blood on the floor...

522
00:30:12,902 --> 00:30:14,202
...can't be explained.

523
00:30:14,301 --> 00:30:16,029
There's no evidence
that Hakyoung drew that.

524
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,268
If not him, then who else did it?

525
00:30:17,368 --> 00:30:20,852
There were only Hakyoung and
Sookyung at the scene on that day.

526
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:22,603
If she drew that...

527
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:24,271
...then there must've been some blood
stains left on her hands and feet.

528
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:26,169
But she didn't have any
stains when we checked her.

529
00:30:26,969 --> 00:30:27,903
That's goes for Hakyoung as well.

530
00:30:28,001 --> 00:30:29,191
He didn't have any
stains on his hands, feet...

531
00:30:29,276 --> 00:30:31,573
...his clothes, and even his
shoes didn't have a hint of stain.

532
00:30:31,668 --> 00:30:33,169
This fact keeps him from being convicted.

533
00:30:33,268 --> 00:30:35,182
That's because...

534
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:36,702
The stains must've been
erased after the incident.

535
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:38,202
There was plenty of time
to take a shower...

536
00:30:38,301 --> 00:30:40,154
...and wash his clothes even
before he turned himself in.

537
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:41,506
That's an assumption.

538
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,842
Assumptions can't be evidence.

539
00:30:46,435 --> 00:30:51,269
Then, how do you explain
the drawing by blood?

540
00:30:51,368 --> 00:30:52,650
What did Hakyoung say about that?

541
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:54,786
He said he doesn't know about that.

542
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:57,371
He can't just say he doesn't know.

543
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:59,783
He has to prove that he didn't draw
the picture to walk away freely.

544
00:30:59,868 --> 00:31:04,763
No, the prosecutor must prove that
he drew it so that he can be charged.

545
00:31:06,476 --> 00:31:08,466
You don't know what
it was drawn by, right?

546
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:13,368
Look, he's the only one who
went into the house at that time.

547
00:31:13,468 --> 00:31:15,402
What more evidence do you need?

548
00:31:15,502 --> 00:31:16,903
He must've used a tool to draw that.

549
00:31:16,988 --> 00:31:18,350
What kind of a tool?

550
00:31:18,651 --> 00:31:20,260
Are you playing around?

551
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:22,002
We don't know what that is,
so I just referred it as a tool.

552
00:31:22,101 --> 00:31:24,535
You have to mention that specifically.

553
00:31:24,688 --> 00:31:27,237
You can't specify a charge if you don't.

554
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:31,370
Not specifying can lead
to the trial being dismissed.

555
00:31:34,702 --> 00:31:36,310
Who is that cop?

556
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:37,611
Is he an attorney or something?

557
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:40,198
This feels more like
a trial than an investigation.

558
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:44,184
He's going to take over Prosecutor Jung...

559
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:47,407
He should ask why he ran
away if he didn't kill her.

560
00:31:47,635 --> 00:31:48,668
Run away.

561
00:31:48,902 --> 00:31:50,442
Then, why did he run away?

562
00:31:51,435 --> 00:31:52,332
He can hear me.

563
00:31:52,849 --> 00:31:53,699
He can hear...

564
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:54,768
I'm sorry.

565
00:31:54,935 --> 00:31:57,436
If he's innocent, why didn't he
explain himself instead of running away?

566
00:31:57,535 --> 00:31:59,668
Because you still went
after him when he's innocent.

567
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,455
He thought that he may end up
in jail even when he's innocent.

568
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,583
You convinced him to turn himself
him last month on the 25th, right?

569
00:32:12,668 --> 00:32:15,008
No, I told him to run away.

570
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:18,870
If you really killed her, then run away.

571
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:21,788
I'll pretend I don't know anything.

572
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:22,669
Wootak.

573
00:32:22,768 --> 00:32:23,605
However...

574
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:27,144
...if you're innocent, turn yourself in.

575
00:32:28,869 --> 00:32:29,996
Trust the law.

576
00:32:32,638 --> 00:32:34,461
He turned himself in when I told him that.

577
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,488
He said that he will trust the law...

578
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,629
Do you think he's the real culprit?

579
00:32:45,468 --> 00:32:46,710
What's with you now?

580
00:32:46,795 --> 00:32:48,837
There's no other suspect
other than Hakyoung.

581
00:32:48,935 --> 00:32:51,903
I'm worried that we're assuming an answer
just because there's no other answer.

582
00:32:55,268 --> 00:32:58,802
Why do you believe that he's innocent?

583
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:03,648
When he first came over to my place,
he asked me to prove him innocent.

584
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:08,770
So you must prove my innocence no matter.

585
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:10,455
When I met him earlier...

586
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,757
...he asked me if I'm
looking for the real culprit...

587
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:14,269
What did the prosecutor say?

588
00:33:14,969 --> 00:33:16,427
Are they looking for the real culprit?

589
00:33:16,935 --> 00:33:21,014
Those are words that you say
to prove you are innocent anyway.

590
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:24,068
If he's guilty, he wouldn't ask
me to prove him innocent.

591
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:26,169
But would've asked
me to make him innocent.

592
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:28,288
He wouldn't have asked
me to find the real culprit...

593
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,542
...but would've asked me
to make up some alibi.

594
00:33:32,101 --> 00:33:33,144
That's true.

595
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,162
What does he mean, that's true?

596
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:36,814
How can he agree to that?

597
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:41,370
He's losing to the cop.
He's completely lost...

598
00:33:41,468 --> 00:33:44,789
However, I think that's a bit weird.

599
00:33:45,134 --> 00:33:48,601
He wouldn't have asked like
that if he really did kill her.

600
00:33:48,969 --> 00:33:51,011
He would've just insisted
that it wasn't him.

601
00:33:51,096 --> 00:33:52,268
Be quiet.

602
00:33:57,045 --> 00:33:59,837
Hakyoung has a motive to kill her.

603
00:33:59,922 --> 00:34:01,869
Can you fix it correctly this time?

604
00:34:01,969 --> 00:34:06,085
Can you please give me
a good rating this time?

605
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,213
I will if it doesn't break again.

606
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:11,950
Sookyung gave poor
ratings on his services.

607
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,352
She even asked him to take
the trash out on his way out.

608
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:18,468
So he got angry and
killed her out of rage.

609
00:34:18,568 --> 00:34:22,961
Then, why would he take
the trash out after he's killed her?

610
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:24,468
He would've left it there...

611
00:34:24,568 --> 00:34:28,269
...if he's gotten so mad from
her telling him to throw them out.

612
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:32,637
Why did he go out of his way
to take the trash out for her?

613
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,206
There's no reason for that.

614
00:34:36,935 --> 00:34:38,142
That's true...

615
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:39,926
That's true...

616
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:41,479
Why would he take the trash out for her?

617
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:44,731
Well, I mean...

618
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:47,378
Are you also agreeing to him?

619
00:34:47,463 --> 00:34:48,769
No, I'm just...

620
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:50,717
He's saying things that make sense...

621
00:34:50,802 --> 00:34:52,036
Stop grumbling.

622
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:54,134
I'm sorry, my neck is...

623
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:02,768
Why?

624
00:35:03,113 --> 00:35:04,835
Are you not confident?

625
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:09,269
Do you really think
Hakyoung killed Sookyung?

626
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:11,969
We worked really hard to get
evidence for the past two weeks.

627
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:14,060
You remember the lie detector, right?

628
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:15,644
It couldn't determine the lie.

629
00:35:15,729 --> 00:35:18,536
If he was the real culprit,
then it should've said that he was lying.

630
00:35:18,635 --> 00:35:19,436
That's right.

631
00:35:19,535 --> 00:35:23,327
Hakyoung was at the apartment for only 13
minutes according to the security camera

632
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:26,400
Do you really think it's
possible that in the 13 minutes...

633
00:35:26,485 --> 00:35:29,359
...he killed her, draw a picture,
clean and wipe?

634
00:35:29,444 --> 00:35:31,995
No, I don't think
it's right either, but...

635
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,191
We don't have any other
suspect other than him.

636
00:35:35,276 --> 00:35:37,669
Not having any other suspect
doesn't make him the culprit.

637
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:41,283
That doesn't mean the chief
will release him from prison.

638
00:35:41,368 --> 00:35:44,106
Prosecutors work individually.

639
00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:46,402
I don't need anyone's approval
if it's done according to procedure.

640
00:35:46,502 --> 00:35:49,209
If I just undo his imprisonment...

641
00:35:49,294 --> 00:35:50,335
You'll get fired.

642
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:52,250
You'll get fired right away.

643
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:56,002
I've also seen many prosecutors
get fired for doing this.

644
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,957
Then, what should we do?
Do I just prosecute him?

645
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:06,097
Prosecutor Jung, how about
you be a little more modest?

646
00:36:09,156 --> 00:36:10,802
Am I being cocky?

647
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:15,173
Why do you think you're the only one who
sees the truth and no one else sees it?

648
00:36:17,242 --> 00:36:22,602
From today's investigation,
just show your seniors what you saw.

649
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:27,169
Then, they may be able to see
the truth since they're seniors...

650
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:33,668
This is why he called us.

651
00:36:34,168 --> 00:36:36,735
He wanted to show us and convince us...

652
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:45,036
I'm sure they'll understand
what you're thinking.

653
00:36:45,504 --> 00:36:46,971
They will join you
and think about it as well.

654
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,178
"Cancellation of Arrest"

655
00:37:05,702 --> 00:37:07,091
Sir.

656
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:10,161
Leave me alone, so I can think on my own!

657
00:37:10,523 --> 00:37:12,556
I know what you're trying to say.

658
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,490
Oh my goodness...

659
00:37:19,826 --> 00:37:23,060
I hope this case doesn't
end up like Daehee's case.

660
00:37:23,145 --> 00:37:25,441
Who's the one that defended him?

661
00:37:25,526 --> 00:37:27,045
It was you.

662
00:37:29,107 --> 00:37:30,158
I already told you.

663
00:37:30,243 --> 00:37:32,425
I'm on the same side
as Prosecutor Jung right now.

664
00:37:34,926 --> 00:37:37,926
He'll be fine even if
you don't side with him.

665
00:37:38,025 --> 00:37:40,125
Prosecutor Jung can never do this alone.

666
00:37:41,647 --> 00:37:45,596
I'm not saying that he lacks
anything but it's the nature of this case.

667
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:52,826
He only has this much of evidence.

668
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:55,893
But he'll need evidence up to this
much in order to charge the suspect...

669
00:37:55,993 --> 00:37:58,993
...but a prosecutor alone can
never make the evidence full.

670
00:38:01,158 --> 00:38:02,759
You need to help him.

671
00:38:16,058 --> 00:38:18,559
You didn't know that Hakyoung's father is
a former convicted drug dealer, right?

672
00:38:20,192 --> 00:38:24,893
Hakyoung also followed his father's
crime path when he was a student.

673
00:38:25,192 --> 00:38:28,606
Assault and theft,
he got into a lot of trouble.

674
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:32,009
He was a trash.

675
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,948
Just tell the world what you saw.

676
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:39,817
Then, you'll have evidence...

677
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:42,687
...that fills up to this point.

678
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:45,772
What do you mean?

679
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:47,391
Right now, Hakyoung's case...

680
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:51,706
...is very popular story
among the reporters.

681
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:58,759
You'll need more useful sources
and I think this can be the one.

682
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:00,760
Other media will go after him...

683
00:39:00,859 --> 00:39:02,856
...if you just provide them
with his personal information...

684
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:06,725
Then, you'll have hundreds of
reporters who will work as detectives.

685
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:11,626
Hey, Hakyoung is
an ex-convict of assault.

686
00:39:11,726 --> 00:39:13,533
Is he a psychopath that only kills women?

687
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:14,659
This is creepy.

688
00:39:14,759 --> 00:39:16,000
Hakyoung went to our high school.

689
00:39:16,085 --> 00:39:16,967
Wow.

690
00:39:17,052 --> 00:39:18,369
Then, his picture
must be in the yearbook.

691
00:39:18,454 --> 00:39:19,492
Of course.

692
00:39:23,526 --> 00:39:26,063
Revealing killer
Hakyoung's graduation photo.

693
00:39:26,498 --> 00:39:29,182
I went to the same high school
Hakyoung went to and...

694
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:31,825
...I found his picture
in the graduation picture.

695
00:39:31,926 --> 00:39:34,009
Revealing a real killer's face.

696
00:39:34,094 --> 00:39:35,811
Hakyoung's father is a drug dealer.

697
00:39:35,896 --> 00:39:37,959
I used to live next to Hakyoung.

698
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,914
And as soon as the news gets released...

699
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:45,917
...thousands of people
will share information on him.

700
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:49,926
Anyone related to him
will share every little detail.

701
00:39:58,626 --> 00:40:03,893
Hakyoung will be a killer and people will
demand the prosecutor to charge him...

702
00:40:03,993 --> 00:40:05,660
You're asking us to
manipulate the media...

703
00:40:05,759 --> 00:40:08,193
Manipulate? That's too harsh.

704
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:12,594
I meant that you shouldn't
go against the public.

705
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:18,516
No matter how we look at it,
he's the culprit.

706
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,974
We shouldn't just let him go.

707
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:22,980
Do you think we should just let him go?

708
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:31,125
Prosecutor Jung will never win
if we followed the law.

709
00:40:34,267 --> 00:40:36,212
You'll have to help him...

710
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:41,239
...to fill it until it's 100 percent...

711
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:44,475
...and gets to this point.

712
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:18,284
Where did he go?

713
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,490
He's not here.

714
00:42:44,262 --> 00:42:45,058
Sir.

715
00:42:45,363 --> 00:42:47,396
Sir, what are you doing?

716
00:42:47,497 --> 00:42:48,664
Get out of there!

717
00:42:51,697 --> 00:42:54,298
Sir, get out!

718
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:08,319
I'll go get him, so you pull us up.
Understand?

719
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:22,129
Why do we need to do that?

720
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:27,004
It's because you look like a weak
guy who doesn't know how to swim.

721
00:43:28,573 --> 00:43:29,774
I'm a good swimmer.

722
00:43:32,463 --> 00:43:33,511
Not that...

723
00:43:35,396 --> 00:43:36,997
Why do I have to save that guy?

724
00:43:37,096 --> 00:43:38,430
Of course we have to save him.

725
00:43:38,883 --> 00:43:39,732
Do you want to leave him to die?

726
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:40,918
Let him die.

727
00:43:41,797 --> 00:43:43,478
He's the brother of
the guy who killed my father.

728
00:43:43,563 --> 00:43:45,641
I hate him so why do I have to save him?

729
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:48,245
Tell him to go to hell
and meet his brother!

730
00:43:48,506 --> 00:43:52,696
Tell him to ask his brother
why he killed my father!

731
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,064
You crazy jerk.

732
00:43:56,163 --> 00:43:57,701
You let him die because you hate him?

733
00:43:58,497 --> 00:43:59,570
You call that a reason?

734
00:44:01,196 --> 00:44:02,064
Yes!

735
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:04,157
I hate him...

736
00:44:04,242 --> 00:44:06,407
I hate him so just let him die!

737
00:44:06,492 --> 00:44:07,912
Get a hold of yourself.

738
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:09,747
He's just like us.

739
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:11,615
He can't believe the accident
that happened yesterday...

740
00:44:11,716 --> 00:44:14,364
...and wants to turn time back
and stop what happened.

741
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:17,930
He must've wished that
this was all just a dream.

742
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:22,693
Save him.

743
00:44:23,196 --> 00:44:25,963
You have to save him and even myself.

744
00:44:27,697 --> 00:44:28,899
If you don't want to regret it...

745
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,068
I'm trusting you.

746
00:45:06,363 --> 00:45:07,204
Taxi.

747
00:45:14,463 --> 00:45:15,646
Jung Jaechan.

748
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,983
Nam Hongjoo, I was just
about to go pick you up.

749
00:45:20,068 --> 00:45:21,326
I came to pick you up today.

750
00:45:21,411 --> 00:45:23,278
I wanted to get a cup of coffee with you.

751
00:45:23,363 --> 00:45:24,197
Get in.

752
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:29,616
Your two drinks that
you ordered are ready.

753
00:45:29,701 --> 00:45:31,231
I didn't order the cookie.

754
00:45:31,316 --> 00:45:32,879
I'm just giving it to you.

755
00:45:32,964 --> 00:45:35,764
I thought you two will come,
so I got it ready.

756
00:45:37,069 --> 00:45:38,169
Thank you.

757
00:45:42,385 --> 00:45:44,008
How did the investigation go with Wootak?

758
00:45:44,225 --> 00:45:45,497
Well, it was okay.

759
00:45:45,597 --> 00:45:47,111
Then, is Hakyoung being charged?

760
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,531
Oh, I didn't ask as a reporter.

761
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:50,748
It's off the record.

762
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:54,714
He's not charged yet.

763
00:45:54,799 --> 00:45:55,905
He's not?

764
00:45:56,096 --> 00:45:57,554
He's going to be released soon.

765
00:45:58,089 --> 00:45:59,864
Are you letting him go?

766
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:02,708
Maybe.

767
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:05,380
Do you not have enough evidence?
You were convinced by Wootak.

768
00:46:13,404 --> 00:46:14,805
Listen to me.

769
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,209
I thought Hakyoung was
the culprit in the beginning.

770
00:46:19,563 --> 00:46:21,946
So, I tried to put the pieces of
the puzzle together to prove that.

771
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:25,131
But the wrong pieces kept coming out.

772
00:46:25,216 --> 00:46:26,483
Wrong pieces?

773
00:46:26,847 --> 00:46:27,381
Yes.

774
00:46:28,024 --> 00:46:30,397
We conducted autopsy on the body,
but they're all too clean.

775
00:46:30,793 --> 00:46:32,633
There was no blood that shows resistance.

776
00:46:32,718 --> 00:46:35,232
So, I searched thoroughly
through his house.

777
00:46:35,317 --> 00:46:37,063
But there wasn't a hint of blood.

778
00:46:37,163 --> 00:46:40,097
But, it all made sense...

779
00:46:40,598 --> 00:46:42,366
...when I started to think
that he wasn't the culprit.

780
00:46:44,096 --> 00:46:47,237
Sookyung fainted many
times due to otolithiasis.

781
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:49,145
That's why she retired early.

782
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:50,733
Then, did she die because...

783
00:46:50,818 --> 00:46:53,732
...she fainted from otolithiasis
after Hakyoung left?

784
00:46:55,217 --> 00:46:58,030
Yes, that would make
the autopsy result correct.

785
00:46:58,516 --> 00:47:00,366
It said that she died from...

786
00:47:00,451 --> 00:47:02,264
...a cerebral hemorrhage
and she had no scars...

787
00:47:07,592 --> 00:47:09,742
The fact that he threw away
the trash for her...

788
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:12,309
...and having no hint of blood on him
all makes sense as well.

789
00:47:13,965 --> 00:47:15,663
Then, what about the drawing
on the floor drawn by blood?

790
00:47:15,763 --> 00:47:17,163
How do you explain that?

791
00:47:17,296 --> 00:47:18,969
That's the hardest to explain...

792
00:47:19,597 --> 00:47:21,487
After analyzing
the drawing drawn by blood...

793
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:22,694
...it was drawn in one single stroke.

794
00:47:22,779 --> 00:47:24,997
One single stroke?
Without stopping?

795
00:47:25,243 --> 00:47:29,462
Hakyoung couldn't have
done all of that in 13 minutes...

796
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:32,549
...without getting any stains on him.
Do you think that was possible?

797
00:47:34,763 --> 00:47:36,053
Then, who drew that?

798
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:38,589
I don't know either.

799
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:40,858
But I know that it wasn't Hakyoung.

800
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:43,894
I'm sure it's something we haven't found.

801
00:48:06,263 --> 00:48:09,720
Because we couldn't find that,
Hakyoung got into this mess.

802
00:48:16,363 --> 00:48:18,128
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

803
00:48:19,672 --> 00:48:21,902
So you're going to let him go?

804
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:23,734
The prime suspect?

805
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:25,102
Yes.

806
00:48:26,996 --> 00:48:28,338
I'm very incompetent, right?

807
00:48:29,497 --> 00:48:33,710
I lost to Wootak's words and
I'm losing the prime suspect...

808
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:36,513
I'm sorry, that I can't say no to that.

809
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:48,292
I like you.

810
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:52,598
What?

811
00:48:52,697 --> 00:48:57,434
I like you so much that I hate
the fact that I've disappointed you.

812
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:04,708
What's with you?
Why are you suddenly confessing?

813
00:49:10,381 --> 00:49:12,850
That's why I wanted to charge
Hakyoung no matter what.

814
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:15,853
But I can't charge an innocent man.

815
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:18,555
I may destroy one's life...

816
00:49:25,596 --> 00:49:27,431
I like you a lot...

817
00:49:28,032 --> 00:49:31,301
...but my feelings are nothing...

818
00:49:32,597 --> 00:49:33,637
...compared to his life.

819
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,083
I'm sorry...

820
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:44,782
...that I've disappointed you.

821
00:50:23,454 --> 00:50:24,555
What's this?

822
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:28,025
I just thought you might need it.

823
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:34,398
You look a lot like someone.

824
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:35,781
Who?

825
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,310
A guy who hit me when I was young.

826
00:50:37,395 --> 00:50:39,937
He hit a girl? That crazy jerk...

827
00:50:40,697 --> 00:50:43,364
I don't know his name
or where he lives...

828
00:50:43,463 --> 00:50:45,124
But he's not a bad guy.

829
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:47,746
He's a crazy jerk.
He's not normal if he hit a girl.

830
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,562
Don't ever get in touch
with someone like him.

831
00:50:49,647 --> 00:50:50,924
This is so unpleasant.

832
00:50:51,009 --> 00:50:52,807
How do I look like someone like him?

833
00:50:52,892 --> 00:50:54,364
Okay, fine...

834
00:50:54,449 --> 00:50:56,353
You don't look like him.

835
00:51:22,814 --> 00:51:25,215
"Personal Information"

836
00:51:27,985 --> 00:51:29,987

837

"Indictment without detention

838
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:41,907
Hey, Hongjoo, did you
meet with Attorney Lee?

839
00:51:41,992 --> 00:51:43,819
Yes, I did.

840
00:51:43,904 --> 00:51:44,797
What did he say?

841
00:51:46,295 --> 00:51:48,163
He gave me some of Hakyoung's documents.

842
00:51:48,262 --> 00:51:48,963
What is it?

843
00:51:49,061 --> 00:51:49,995
Have you gone through them?

844
00:51:50,095 --> 00:51:52,914
Yes, these are the crime records
of him when he was a student.

845
00:51:52,999 --> 00:51:54,560
I knew he was crazy.

846
00:51:54,645 --> 00:51:56,591
I knew he committed the crime...

847
00:51:56,747 --> 00:51:58,282
How is it? Can you make a story with it?

848
00:52:04,028 --> 00:52:04,888
You're crazy...

849
00:52:05,256 --> 00:52:06,823
You let him die just
because you hate him?

850
00:52:07,725 --> 00:52:08,663
Save him.

851
00:52:08,762 --> 00:52:11,162
You save him and even myself.

852
00:52:11,729 --> 00:52:13,063
If you don't want to regret it...

853
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:16,504
Wake up!

854
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:19,089
Hey, wake up!

855
00:54:25,853 --> 00:54:26,663
No...

856
00:54:27,152 --> 00:54:30,434
Wake up!
Please wake up!

857
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:36,373
Hey, wake up!

858
00:54:41,337 --> 00:54:43,046
Wake up!

859
00:54:43,553 --> 00:54:45,749
Get up!

860
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:49,186
Wake up!

861
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:55,459
Wake up!

862
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:28,492
Thanks for saving me...

863
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:56,820
Sir.

864
00:55:58,455 --> 00:55:59,723
This doesn't make a story.

865
00:56:00,157 --> 00:56:02,941
Why not?
I thought they were his crime records?

866
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,911
Yes, but they're irrelevant
to the current case.

867
00:56:05,996 --> 00:56:08,965
It'll only cause confusion for
the prosecutor's investigation.

868
00:56:09,266 --> 00:56:10,233
Are you sure about that?

869
00:56:11,052 --> 00:56:11,635
Yes.

870
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:13,570
Would you like to take a look?

871
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:15,353
It's fine.

872
00:56:15,746 --> 00:56:17,476
It's probably not if you say it's not.

"Cancellation of Arrest"

874
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:36,860
Okay, I have decided.

875
00:56:38,886 --> 00:56:39,720
Here.

876
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:50,707
Thank you.

877
00:56:54,178 --> 00:56:56,713
I'm going to get in trouble
by the prosecutor general.

878
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:01,818
Sir, Hakyoung's been freed.

879
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:05,055
Jung Jaechan, that crazy jerk!

880
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:12,511
Write up a press release and
request for media interviews.

881
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:13,697
Yes, sir.

882
00:57:17,886 --> 00:57:19,803
I can't go easy on him.

883
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,210
Hello, Reporter Hwang.

884
00:57:28,586 --> 00:57:30,614
This is Yoobum from Haekwang.

885
00:58:18,219 --> 00:58:18,986
Are you okay?

886
00:58:19,071 --> 00:58:20,190
It's blood!

887
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:23,486
Jaechan!

888
00:58:24,134 --> 00:58:26,419
Jaechan... Please help!

889
00:58:27,019 --> 00:58:29,005
Someone please call an ambulance!

890
00:58:48,386 --> 00:58:50,960
The sweetest dream I have
ever dreamed in my life...

891
00:58:52,596 --> 00:58:56,032
...has turned into a terrible nightmare.

"While You Were Sleeping"

893
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:20,824
This investigation has clearly
been a poor investigation.

894
00:59:20,909 --> 00:59:22,719
Do you know
a guy named Han Wootak?

895
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:24,287
Well, Attorney Lee.

896
00:59:24,386 --> 00:59:26,519
What's going on? What's wrong?

897
00:59:27,252 --> 00:59:29,748
Describe how the person who
stabbed him looks like.

898
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:32,401
He was wearing black
clothes and a black hat.

899
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:34,817
How would you find him here?

900
00:59:34,902 --> 00:59:37,267
I'm sure it's easier than
finding cocaine in a flour factory.

901
00:59:37,352 --> 00:59:38,719
Did you see the picture I sent?

902
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:45,040
You were seriously injured in my dream.

903
00:59:45,586 --> 00:59:46,719
Don't worry.

904
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:49,054
It won't happen like how it
happened in your dream.

905
00:59:54,853 --> 01:00:03,687
