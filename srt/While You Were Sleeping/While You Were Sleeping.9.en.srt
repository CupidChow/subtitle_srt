1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:00,534
'While You Were Sleeping'

2
00:00:05,901 --> 00:00:07,349
'Episode 9'

3
00:00:07,434 --> 00:00:08,335
Where are the reporters?

4
00:00:08,434 --> 00:00:09,768
They've all arrived.

5
00:00:09,934 --> 00:00:11,468
Are all the cameramen here too?

6
00:00:11,567 --> 00:00:12,268
Yes.

7
00:00:13,634 --> 00:00:14,502
Just a moment.

8
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:17,800
Do you have that by any chance?
That thing that makes you cry...

9
00:00:17,901 --> 00:00:19,001
Are you talking about the tear stick?

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,001
You're awesome.

11
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:29,834
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:32,535
I'm just got here from visiting
Yoo Sookyung's father at the hospital.

13
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:35,635
Is Yoo Sookyung's father sick?

14
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:40,435
Yes.

15
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,034
He's in the last stage
of his pancreatic cancer.

16
00:00:43,968 --> 00:00:46,968
He suddenly collapsed after hearing
about Do Hakyoung's release.

17
00:00:47,234 --> 00:00:48,601
As you know already...

18
00:00:48,767 --> 00:00:51,967
...Do Hakyoung is the only suspect
in Yoo Sookyung's murder.

19
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,834
I can't even accept it myself even
though I used to be a prosecutor.

20
00:00:56,934 --> 00:00:59,468
Currently, the prosecution is
saying there's higher possibility...

21
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:01,034
...that it was an accidental
death than a homicide.

22
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,500
There are no defensive
wounds or signs or a homicide.

23
00:01:03,701 --> 00:01:06,202
You're saying that it's not a homicide
because there are no defensive wounds.

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,001
But there are lot of homicides that
doesn't have defensive wounds.

25
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,500
It's called a blitz attack.

26
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:13,734
If you're attacked suddenly,
there can't be defensive wounds.

27
00:01:13,834 --> 00:01:15,368
Then do you think that the culprit...

28
00:01:15,434 --> 00:01:18,302
...can draw the drawing
with her blood in 13 minutes?

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,368
It's difficult.

30
00:01:19,934 --> 00:01:22,468
I simulated as well and it was difficult.

31
00:01:25,934 --> 00:01:27,301
But Mr. Bong Doohyun.

32
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:29,301
What do you think is more impossible?

33
00:01:29,734 --> 00:01:33,235
Drawing something on
the floor in 13 minutes or...

34
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:37,333
...her blood being drawn automatically
on the floor without anyone present?

35
00:01:38,734 --> 00:01:41,867
This was clearly a poor investigation.

36
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:43,868
It's obvious what will happen, if the
public opinion calms down this way.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,701
The prosecution will say
that it can't be indicted.

38
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:49,235
I'd like to ask all of you...

39
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:52,533
...to pay close attention to this case
so, the culprit will pay for his crime.

40
00:01:52,734 --> 00:01:54,268
Please press them to investigate further.

41
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:06,235
Jaechan, when did you get home?

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,834
You look terrible because
you didn't sleep for few days.

43
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:14,834
-Jaechan, go inside and get some sleep.
-Yes...

44
00:02:15,242 --> 00:02:17,158
Sir. Do Hakyoung's record.

45
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:19,601
Cell phone records...

46
00:02:19,868 --> 00:02:21,135
It's Yoobum, isn't it?

47
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:33,868
Jaechan. Let's go.

48
00:02:34,634 --> 00:02:35,667
Jaechan.

49
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:41,401
Jeez. You're heavy.

50
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,101
Who is it?

51
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,300
Who is it at this hour?

52
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,600
-Jaechan. It's Hongjoo.
-What?

53
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,001
What?

54
00:03:28,701 --> 00:03:30,335
What are you doing here
at this hour, Hongjoo?

55
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:32,701
Hongjoo.

56
00:03:33,501 --> 00:03:34,835
Where's Jaechan's room?

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,167
Over there.

58
00:03:38,234 --> 00:03:39,276
Where's Hongjoo?

59
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:41,168
She went into your room.
What's wrong with her?

60
00:03:43,267 --> 00:03:44,400
What are you doing, Hongjoo?

61
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:54,901
What's wrong? Why are you doing this?

62
00:03:57,434 --> 00:03:58,601
Jaechan...

63
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:03,702
What do we do?
What do we do, Jaechan?

64
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:05,601
In my dream...

65
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:07,900
You're...

66
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:11,168
You're...

67
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:15,467
You bleed...

68
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:19,101
And you get seriously hurt...

69
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:26,401
What do we do?

70
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,167
What do we do?

71
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:36,502
It's okay. It's alright.

72
00:04:52,968 --> 00:04:57,082
You need to avoid what you can avoid.

73
00:04:57,167 --> 00:04:58,734
You have to listen to me.

74
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:02,302
Do not wear a suit because
you got hurt while you're wearing a suit.

75
00:05:02,868 --> 00:05:05,202
Don't use a crosswalk either.

76
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:10,168
No. You just have to not see me.

77
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:16,500
You got hurt while
you're trying to meet me.

78
00:05:20,944 --> 00:05:24,244
So, from now on...

79
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,166
No.

80
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:33,235
I'm a prosecutor.

81
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:35,101
I have nothing to wear besides suits.

82
00:05:35,634 --> 00:05:37,435
I don't want to give up
on crosswalk either.

83
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:40,368
If I don't use a crosswalk,
are you telling me to jaywalk?

84
00:05:40,434 --> 00:05:41,534
That doesn't make any sense.

85
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:45,600
And voiding you wouldn't
make any sense at all.

86
00:05:53,434 --> 00:05:56,601
We can't stop it by being cunning.
You know that better than anyone.

87
00:05:57,667 --> 00:05:59,134
Tell me about the dream in detail.

88
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:03,001
Let's talk carefully about why
something like that happened.

89
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:05,401
That's how we can stop it. Okay?

90
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,034
It happened at the crosswalk.

91
00:06:14,767 --> 00:06:16,735
I could see the lantern behind you...

92
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:19,433
...and you were standing
among other people.

93
00:06:19,934 --> 00:06:24,435
And a man in black clothing
approached you.

94
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:08,235
It's my turn to protect you this time.

95
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,734
Will I be able to do it?

96
00:07:28,634 --> 00:07:29,868
Don't worry.

97
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:48,934
Your dream will not come true.

98
00:07:53,534 --> 00:07:54,468
Please...

99
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:57,668
...don't get hurt.

100
00:08:02,534 --> 00:08:03,268
Okay.

101
00:08:19,267 --> 00:08:20,400
I like you.

102
00:08:59,968 --> 00:09:01,469
What's wrong with everyone?

103
00:09:01,534 --> 00:09:04,335
I feel like a person who is scheduled
to die soon since you're like this.

104
00:09:04,601 --> 00:09:06,135
Let's eat.

105
00:09:06,634 --> 00:09:07,568
Eat.

106
00:09:08,575 --> 00:09:09,775
Eat, you brat.

107
00:09:10,698 --> 00:09:13,099
Who stabbed him? Did you see his face?

108
00:09:13,934 --> 00:09:15,501
No, I didn't.

109
00:09:17,801 --> 00:09:21,435
But what I'm sure of is that
he's related to Do Hakyoung.

110
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:22,934
With Hakyoung?

111
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:24,368
Why?

112
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:26,867
My dream changed after
Do Hakyoung was released.

113
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:31,135
In my first dream,
he crossed the crosswalk safely.

114
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:33,734
But in my dream I had after
Do Hakyoung was released...

115
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:35,774
...Jaechan wasn't able to cross
the crosswalk and collapsed...

116
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:39,369
...even though it was
the same place with same situation.

117
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:43,335
Something must have happened
because of the Do Hakyoung case.

118
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:52,982
Yes, Sir.

119
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:54,301
Why are you calling me at this hour?

120
00:09:55,901 --> 00:09:56,802
The news?

121
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:05,501
Due to the lack of evidence...

122
00:10:05,601 --> 00:10:09,082
...Mr. Do, the only suspect in
Yoo Sookyung's murder, was released...

123
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:11,537
...and the prosecution
will not indict him.

124
00:10:11,601 --> 00:10:14,569
The prosecution released the only suspect
even though they secured the CCTV.

125
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:16,601
It looks like it will be difficult
for the prosecution to escape...

126
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:18,667
...from being criticized by
the public for poor investigation.

127
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:22,267
Do Hakyoung has criminal record
of assault and theft.

128
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:24,549
If they release him
for lack of evidence...

129
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:28,852
...and he might commit another crime in
the future there will be other victims.

130
00:10:29,234 --> 00:10:32,068
The prosecution must
take responsibility for that.

131
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:35,433
Do Hakyoung was an ex-convict?
Assault and theft?

132
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:36,868
That theft was...

133
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:39,868
...for stealing a g.o.d autograph from
a stir-fried rice cake restaurant.

134
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:42,068
He wanted to put it
on his mom's restaurant.

135
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:44,467
An autograph? Is that considered a theft?

136
00:10:44,567 --> 00:10:46,967
Yes, it was.

137
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:50,784
And that restaurant owner came and
caused ruckus at his mother's restaurant.

138
00:10:50,869 --> 00:10:52,370
He got arrested for assault
while trying to stop him.

139
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:55,568
And that was already 10 years ago.

140
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:56,834
Jaechan.

141
00:10:57,467 --> 00:10:59,134
They even revealed your face.

142
00:10:59,234 --> 00:11:00,601
They're saying you're
an incompetent prosecutor.

143
00:11:01,968 --> 00:11:02,802
"He looks like someone
who will betray the country"

144
00:11:02,901 --> 00:11:03,735
"Lowest rank prosecuter in
Han River District Prosecuter's Office"

145
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:04,635
"He has only three years
of experience"

146
00:11:04,701 --> 00:11:05,734
"He got famous for being in charge
of pianist, Park Soyoon's case"

147
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:09,968
"This pisses me off. Crazy jerks"

148
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:10,901
"Such an opportunist"

149
00:11:10,968 --> 00:11:12,402
"What a  jerk",
"Shouldn't he get fired?"

150
00:11:12,801 --> 00:11:16,769
There's no way of finding out
who stabbed Jaechan in my dream.

151
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,634
But I can guess.

152
00:11:19,634 --> 00:11:22,552
It's someone who was enraged
after watching that news.

153
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:26,702
"Take responsibility
of the fraudulent investigation"

154
00:11:26,801 --> 00:11:27,635
"Psycopath murderer, Do Hakyoung
must be imprisoned"

155
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:29,501
This is an order from the citizens!

156
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:32,468
It could be a fan who
lost their beloved star.

157
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,401
Isn't that Do Hakyoung?

158
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:36,200
You know.

159
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,433
That guy who murdered Yoo Sookyung
and drew on the floor with her blood.

160
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:43,408
It could be someone who has to endure
the wrath of the world unfairly...

161
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:45,002
Honey, what do we do?

162
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,133
If he's not indicted what will
happen to our poor Sookyung?

163
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,333
It could be her parents who
couldn't find the one...

164
00:11:55,434 --> 00:11:58,734
...who is responsible
for their beloved daughter's death.

165
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:14,333
What's certain is that in order
to stop that horrible event...

166
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:19,535
Before this rage bubbles any further...

167
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:24,667
Before that rage turns
into a knife and stabs him...

168
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:32,301
I need to change the course of time.

169
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,500
"The usual suspect"

170
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:52,168
Do you call that an article?

171
00:12:52,968 --> 00:12:55,769
Did you even find out what his theft
charge was before you wrote it?

172
00:12:56,334 --> 00:12:58,534
He stole a g.o.d. autograph
from a tteokbokki shop.

173
00:12:58,634 --> 00:13:00,034
And it was from 11 years ago.

174
00:13:00,434 --> 00:13:03,402
Well, do you think it's only
theft if you steal money?

175
00:13:03,501 --> 00:13:06,801
Do you know how precious
g.o.d. autograph was 11 years ago?

176
00:13:06,934 --> 00:13:08,902
That's theft too, you brat.

177
00:13:10,334 --> 00:13:12,497
What does that have to do
with Yoo Sookyung's murder?

178
00:13:12,601 --> 00:13:14,469
Do you think he murdered her because Yoo
Sookyung didn't give him her autograph?

179
00:13:14,567 --> 00:13:15,767
My gosh.

180
00:13:16,033 --> 00:13:18,467
Other people will think
that you're my superior.

181
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:21,367
You should be glad
that you're my superior.

182
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,035
If I was your superior...

183
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,034
Hongjoo.

184
00:13:29,534 --> 00:13:30,934
She must've gone crazy.

185
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:39,001
Hello. Did you get there safely?

186
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,667
Yes. I'm almost there.

187
00:13:40,968 --> 00:13:41,936
Are you okay?

188
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:43,534
Yes. I'm fine.

189
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:45,001
Our probationary employees
are saying that...

190
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,534
...people are protesting in front of
the Han River Prosecutor's Office.

191
00:13:47,601 --> 00:13:50,202
They know your face,
so use the rear entrance.

192
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,567
Or you should put on a disguise.

193
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:53,901
Did I commit a crime or something?

194
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,035
Let them come at me.

195
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:58,400
I can handle them whether
it's debate and fighting.

196
00:13:59,067 --> 00:14:00,467
Yes. Don't worry.

197
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:10,635
Mr. Jung.

198
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:13,702
What are you doing?

199
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,168
Mr. Lee.

200
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:18,035
Good morning.

201
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:30,801
How could you release him?
Prosecution is an accomplice too.

202
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:32,625
Mr. Jung.

203
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:34,435
This won't do.

204
00:14:38,334 --> 00:14:39,302
Why are you putting this on me?

205
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:40,434
Try it on.

206
00:14:42,801 --> 00:14:45,335
They won't recognize you.
They'll recognize you.

207
00:14:47,901 --> 00:14:48,835
Take it off.

208
00:14:49,234 --> 00:14:50,501
Take it off. Take it off.

209
00:14:57,434 --> 00:15:00,135
If they catch you,
say that you're Lee Jikwang.

210
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,034
Do you understand?

211
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:04,734
Thank you, Sir.

212
00:15:06,734 --> 00:15:10,934
If you are grateful to me, don't
forget to hook me up with a girl.

213
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:12,768
Okay.

214
00:15:14,801 --> 00:15:15,568
Let's go.

215
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:17,867
Follow me.

216
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,034
Prosecution is an accomplice too.

217
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:23,400
How could you release him?
Prosecution is an accomplice too.

218
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:25,002
This is an order from the citizens.

219
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,934
Arrest Do Hakyoung.

220
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,734
Isn't that Prosecutor Jung Jaechan?

221
00:15:28,925 --> 00:15:29,859
Where?
Where?

222
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:31,834
Run.

223
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,367
I'm not Jung Jaechan.

224
00:15:42,467 --> 00:15:43,901
Look at the picture.
I look totally different.

225
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,701
What?
You look exactly like the picture.

226
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:47,234
Talk if you have something to say.

227
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,567
Why did you release Do Hakyoung?

228
00:15:48,634 --> 00:15:51,048
It's not me.

229
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:53,233
What are you doing? He's lying.

230
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:56,334
It's illegal to be protesting within
100 meters of Prosecutor's Office.

231
00:15:57,968 --> 00:16:01,402
If you touch me, you'll be arrested
for obstruction of justice.

232
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,367
Mr. Jung!

233
00:16:09,434 --> 00:16:14,834
That guy over there with glasses and
collar sticking up is Jung Jaechan!

234
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:17,168
-What is he saying?
-Catch the corrupt prosecutor!

235
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:21,835
Mr. Choi.

236
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,067
The security has been called,
so it will be fine.

237
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,034
If you go over there right now,
it will be bad.

238
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,100
But still, Mr. Lee is...

239
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,434
Let Mr. Lee go.

240
00:16:29,501 --> 00:16:31,601
You can't save him
even if you go over there.

241
00:16:32,968 --> 00:16:35,368
The two of them are talking over there.

242
00:16:35,434 --> 00:16:36,901
The one on the left is Mr. Choi...

243
00:16:36,968 --> 00:16:38,968
...and the one on
the right is Jung Jaechan.

244
00:16:40,901 --> 00:16:45,034
I'm Jung Jaechan from
Han River Prosecution!

245
00:16:45,701 --> 00:16:47,368
What is he saying?

246
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:51,233
My gosh! What did you just say? Mr. Jung!

247
00:16:51,601 --> 00:16:52,634
Jung Jaechan!

248
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:55,202
-Catch the corrupt prosecutor!
-Let justice prevail!

249
00:16:55,267 --> 00:16:57,267
Save the innocent people!

250
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,167
Hey. Did you see the news?

251
00:17:08,934 --> 00:17:12,768
That crazy  jerk Do Hakyoung
even has a record of assault and theft.

252
00:17:12,868 --> 00:17:14,982
Why did that prosecutor
release a  jerk like that?

253
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,516
It's either one of two things.

254
00:17:16,601 --> 00:17:18,668
He's completely incompetent
or he's been bribed.

255
00:17:18,734 --> 00:17:20,435
That incompetent prosecutor...

256
00:17:21,334 --> 00:17:22,601
Isn't that Seungwon's older brother?

257
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:23,783
That's right. That's right.

258
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:27,035
That  jerk bragged about having
a prosecutor as an older brother.

259
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,334
That's right. Jung Jaechan.

260
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,034
That's a big case.

261
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,901
Let's text in a group chat.

262
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,567
If Jung Seungwon
records our conversation...

263
00:17:37,634 --> 00:17:39,667
...and gives it to his brother,
we'll be arrested.

264
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,934
I'm sure he'll release us.

265
00:17:43,033 --> 00:17:44,700
All he does is releasing criminals.

266
00:17:44,767 --> 00:17:46,101
"Agreed"

267
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,700
What are you guys doing?

268
00:17:58,701 --> 00:18:00,402
Did you guys start
a group chat without me?

269
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,335
How did they get confused?

270
00:18:24,434 --> 00:18:26,382
No matter how many
times I look at you both...

271
00:18:26,467 --> 00:18:28,435
...there isn't a single point that
they should be confused about.

272
00:18:28,534 --> 00:18:32,749
They grabbed me after hearing
that Mr. Jung was handsome.

273
00:18:32,834 --> 00:18:34,168
Because I was handsome.

274
00:18:34,267 --> 00:18:35,449
They'll grab you if you're handsome.

275
00:18:35,534 --> 00:18:37,315
I'm a sinner.
I've committed a grave sin.

276
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,334
Does that make any sense? My gosh.

277
00:18:39,434 --> 00:18:41,201
That doesn't make sense at all.

278
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:45,101
They'll grab you and interrogate
you if you just wear a suit.

279
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,434
You better be careful.

280
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:47,469
Let's go.

281
00:18:49,968 --> 00:18:51,265
Where are you going without me?

282
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:52,682
Are you going out to lunch?

283
00:18:52,767 --> 00:18:54,716
-Mr. Lee!
-Close it.

284
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:59,035
It's dangerous. Don't go outside
for now and have lunch at the cafeteria.

285
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:01,834
Chief. Chief.

286
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,367
Mr. Choi!
Mr. Choi.

287
00:19:11,334 --> 00:19:13,868
Do you want to have lunch with me?

288
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:15,767
Okay.

289
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:24,082
Do Hakyoung's case
will be wrapped up soon.

290
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:26,634
So what did you decide to do with him?

291
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,434
Mr. Choi. What should I do?

292
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:31,535
What's wrong?

293
00:19:31,734 --> 00:19:34,668
Are you afraid that you'll be
criticized if you don't indict him?

294
00:19:34,968 --> 00:19:36,968
I'm a human being too,
so I'm quite scared.

295
00:19:37,901 --> 00:19:39,368
No, I'm not scared.

296
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:40,616
If someone is suspicious of
a crime after the investigation...

297
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:41,135
...I'll indict that person.

298
00:19:41,234 --> 00:19:42,868
If there isn't any suspicion,
I won't indict that person.

299
00:19:42,968 --> 00:19:44,154
I'll do it by the law.

300
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:45,934
What's wrong with you?

301
00:19:46,901 --> 00:19:49,435
Oh! Attorney Lee. Hello.

302
00:19:49,734 --> 00:19:51,749
If you do it by the law,
you should indict him.

303
00:19:51,834 --> 00:19:53,967
You should be considerate of
the victim first if you're the prosecutor.

304
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,001
You should leave the suspect
to the defense lawyer.

305
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:58,241
If you take the suspect's
side as a prosecutor...

306
00:19:58,334 --> 00:19:59,835
...who is going to be on
the side of the victim?

307
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:02,868
When did this country's
prosecutor start taking sides?

308
00:20:02,934 --> 00:20:05,468
My goodness...

309
00:20:05,534 --> 00:20:10,301
How come you two get into a fight
every time you see each other?

310
00:20:11,634 --> 00:20:13,168
By the way,
what brings you here, Attorney Lee?

311
00:20:13,267 --> 00:20:14,168
Do you remember Hyunwoo...

312
00:20:14,234 --> 00:20:15,135
...from back when we used to work
for Yeonju Prosecutor's Office?

313
00:20:15,234 --> 00:20:16,135
He was our assistant.

314
00:20:16,234 --> 00:20:17,632
Of course. I know him pretty well.

315
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:19,535
That's right.

316
00:20:19,934 --> 00:20:21,616
He texted me few days ago saying
that he's getting married soon.

317
00:20:21,701 --> 00:20:23,135
That's today.

318
00:20:23,234 --> 00:20:24,768
I thought you forgot,
so I came to pick you up.

319
00:20:24,868 --> 00:20:25,935
Yes. I should go.

320
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,067
Mr. Choi. You said you're
going to have lunch with me.

321
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:31,834
What can I do? It's his wedding.
I'm going to eat at the buffet.

322
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:33,967
What are you doing? Don't be childish.

323
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:35,349
Let's go.

324
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:36,567
Mr. Choi.

325
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:41,268
Just a moment. Just a moment.
Attorney Lee. Just a moment.

326
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,635
Fine. Prosecutor Jung.

327
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:47,001
If you have some cash,
let me borrow 50,000 won.

328
00:20:48,434 --> 00:20:49,734
You can just go.

329
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:51,867
I have to give a gift.

330
00:20:51,934 --> 00:20:53,101
I'll let you borrow it from me.
Let's go.

331
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:53,967
Okay.

332
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:00,267
I'm hungry.

333
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:04,735
The weather is nice.

334
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:07,228
What did Jaechan say?

335
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,267
Is he going to indict Do Hakyoung or not?

336
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:11,268
I wouldn't know.

337
00:21:11,334 --> 00:21:14,701
It's not like I've been
inside Prosecutor Jung's head.

338
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,400
This car is nice.

339
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:19,601
Do you know Han Wootak by any chance?

340
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,134
It seems like Jaechan
is quite close to him.

341
00:21:23,901 --> 00:21:28,668
I heard that he used to be
Do Hakyoung's roommate.

342
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,968
You're not connecting them in
a suspicious way, are you, Attorney Lee?

343
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:36,568
This case and their relationship
have nothing to do with each other.

344
00:21:36,701 --> 00:21:38,734
I'm sure they're not related.

345
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:41,468
I know how clear Jaechan
is about those things.

346
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:43,968
But I'm worried.

347
00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:46,300
If the reporters or the victim's
family hears about it...

348
00:21:46,567 --> 00:21:48,201
...they won't think like I do.

349
00:21:50,801 --> 00:21:53,602
If Jaechan doesn't indict Do Hakyoung...

350
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:56,416
...they'll think that he released him
because of his relationship with him.

351
00:21:56,501 --> 00:21:57,716
Attorney Lee...

352
00:21:57,801 --> 00:21:59,735
That's why you should
convince him to indict him.

353
00:21:59,834 --> 00:22:02,101
Does it make sense not to indict
him when he murdered someone?

354
00:22:02,334 --> 00:22:03,768
If you're a prosecutor,
you have to do anything...

355
00:22:03,868 --> 00:22:06,135
...to indict him even if you have to
fabricate documents or evidence.

356
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,600
Please convince him.

357
00:22:12,167 --> 00:22:13,267
If you don't do that...

358
00:22:13,367 --> 00:22:14,701
...I'll tell the reporters about his
relationship with Han Wootak.

359
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,606
Prosecutor Jung might get
hurt if you do that.

360
00:22:16,701 --> 00:22:18,726
That's why I'm asking you to help me.

361
00:22:20,334 --> 00:22:22,534
I don't want Jaechan to get hurt either.

362
00:22:39,634 --> 00:22:41,934
The person who stabbed
Jaechan in your dream...

363
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,467
Tell me what he looks like.

364
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:45,867
I only saw him from behind,
so I don't know very well.

365
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:48,734
Maybe he's about 5'9"?

366
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,467
He was wearing black clothing
and a black fisherman's hat.

367
00:23:03,968 --> 00:23:05,769
It won't come off at all.

368
00:23:09,968 --> 00:23:11,335
Hey, you fool.

369
00:23:11,567 --> 00:23:13,700
Do you think you can take
the paint off by rubbing it off?

370
00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:15,701
You have to wipe it with this.

371
00:23:17,534 --> 00:23:19,035
You know everything, you  jerk.

372
00:23:19,968 --> 00:23:21,936
You must be happy that you're smart.

373
00:23:26,434 --> 00:23:29,235
I'm glad that you were released.

374
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:36,101
What's the use?

375
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,400
People are still doing things like
these saying that I'm a murderer.

376
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:16,401
I knew you would do this.

377
00:24:17,067 --> 00:24:20,568
You said that it could've been bad because
people found out what you look like.

378
00:24:21,534 --> 00:24:24,168
So why are you going
to work like this again?

379
00:24:24,534 --> 00:24:25,667
Hey. Jung Seungwon.

380
00:24:25,934 --> 00:24:27,435
You should've tried to stop him.

381
00:24:27,734 --> 00:24:28,402
I was just...

382
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:30,235
Get changed and come out. Right now!

383
00:24:31,434 --> 00:24:32,068
Okay.

384
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:39,334
Jaechan. There's a hoodie in my room.

385
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:51,394
I think I might get scolded by
Chief if I go to work like this.

386
00:24:51,567 --> 00:24:52,634
My gosh...

387
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:55,349
You can get changed at work.

388
00:24:55,434 --> 00:24:57,834
And getting scolded is
better than getting hurt.

389
00:24:58,834 --> 00:24:59,834
Let go of me.

390
00:25:04,133 --> 00:25:06,101
When are you going to make your
decision regarding Do Hakyoung's case?

391
00:25:06,167 --> 00:25:08,634
Once I finish interviewing the last
witness, I'll have to make a decision.

392
00:25:08,834 --> 00:25:10,368
There's no reason for
me to drag it any longer.

393
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:28,401
Can't you just indict him?

394
00:25:33,701 --> 00:25:36,001
I think you'll only be safe
if you do that.

395
00:25:39,734 --> 00:25:42,568
Never mind, I was just saying.
Don't worry about it.

396
00:26:00,634 --> 00:26:03,849
How can you release him?
Prosecution is an accomplice too.

397
00:26:03,934 --> 00:26:05,268
It's an order from the citizens.

398
00:26:05,334 --> 00:26:06,768
Arrest Do Hakyoung.

399
00:26:06,868 --> 00:26:09,982
It's an order from the citizens.
Arrest Do Hakyoung.

400
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:13,067
How can you release him?
Prosecution is an accomplice too.

401
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:14,734
How can you release him?

402
00:26:14,801 --> 00:26:16,669
Prosecution is an accomplice too.

403
00:26:16,734 --> 00:26:18,468
Isn't that Prosecutor Jung from yesterday?

404
00:26:18,534 --> 00:26:20,035
I'm not him.

405
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:25,115
It is Jung Jaechan.

406
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,667
I said I'm not.

407
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:30,301
Of course you are.
Then why are you in disguise?

408
00:26:37,968 --> 00:26:39,869
I heard that there are more
people protesting today.

409
00:26:39,968 --> 00:26:40,802
Did you see them?

410
00:26:40,968 --> 00:26:41,869
Yes.

411
00:26:41,968 --> 00:26:43,635
Prosecutor Jung is in big trouble.

412
00:26:44,033 --> 00:26:46,300
He's going to have
so many people against him.

413
00:26:46,367 --> 00:26:48,001
There's one right here too.

414
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,300
I'm not against him.

415
00:26:49,367 --> 00:26:50,801
I'm going to get fired if you say that.

416
00:26:56,734 --> 00:26:57,867
Prosecutor Jung.

417
00:26:58,501 --> 00:26:59,435
Your clothes are...

418
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:03,667
I have a reason.
I'm going to get changed.

419
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,201
Oh my gosh...

420
00:27:08,267 --> 00:27:10,968
Now that he's wearing clothes like that
instead of the suits he wears everyday...

421
00:27:11,067 --> 00:27:12,234
He looks refreshing.

422
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:17,500
Isn't it so fun to have a character
like that among the prosecutors?

423
00:27:18,133 --> 00:27:19,300
He's so cute.

424
00:27:19,868 --> 00:27:21,469
I thought you said you're sick of him.

425
00:27:22,901 --> 00:27:25,101
I want to look at him
until I get sick of him.

426
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:26,601
Excuse me.

427
00:27:27,067 --> 00:27:29,935
Where is Prosecutor Jung Jaechan's office?

428
00:27:30,033 --> 00:27:30,767
Yes.

429
00:27:30,868 --> 00:27:33,968
What business do you have
with Prosecutor Jung Jaechan?

430
00:27:34,067 --> 00:27:35,768
I came for an interview.

431
00:27:36,033 --> 00:27:38,500
My name is Kim Sungja.

432
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:40,834
You used to work at Yoo Sookyung's house.

433
00:27:40,934 --> 00:27:42,501
Yes. That's right.

434
00:27:42,601 --> 00:27:44,068
Please follow me.

435
00:27:45,033 --> 00:27:47,734
Prosecutor Jung will
come to the office soon...

436
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:50,034
-...so please wait at his office.
-Okay.

437
00:27:52,601 --> 00:27:54,502
By the way, who was that?

438
00:27:54,734 --> 00:27:55,901
You know.

439
00:27:56,033 --> 00:27:59,033
She's the first person to
discover Yoo Sookyung's body.

440
00:27:59,868 --> 00:28:01,001
I remember.

441
00:28:01,434 --> 00:28:02,701
She's the only witness, right?

442
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:04,234
No. She's just a witness.

443
00:28:05,968 --> 00:28:08,235
She's just a witness.

444
00:28:08,968 --> 00:28:09,702
"Do Hakyoung gets released..."

445
00:28:09,767 --> 00:28:12,434
"It will be difficult for prosecution to
avoid getting criticized by the public."

446
00:28:15,033 --> 00:28:16,367
"Reporter Bong Doohyun."

447
00:28:16,434 --> 00:28:17,868
"Total number of comments 9783"

448
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:22,635
Mr. Bong.

449
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,635
You know that article you posted?

450
00:28:24,701 --> 00:28:26,235
The article where you
criticized the prosecutor.

451
00:28:26,601 --> 00:28:28,768
There are more than 9,000 comments.

452
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,801
Congratulations. What's your secret?

453
00:28:31,901 --> 00:28:33,802
Seriously, are you really
going to keep that up?

454
00:28:40,167 --> 00:28:42,871
I guess it's popular to be
commenting on things these days.

455
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:44,635
Do they give you a right to criticize...

456
00:28:44,701 --> 00:28:47,268
...people's character just because
you become a netizen?

457
00:28:47,367 --> 00:28:49,268
I understand Prosecutor Jung Jaechan.

458
00:28:49,367 --> 00:28:51,801
How can he punish garbage
like that when he's garbage too?

459
00:28:51,868 --> 00:28:53,235
Garbage?

460
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:55,035
These people...

461
00:28:59,467 --> 00:29:02,834
You can be sued for
malicious comment like this.

462
00:29:04,267 --> 00:29:05,601
I'm not scared at all.

463
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:09,101
It's because Prosecutor Jung will release
me after doing a poor investigation.

464
00:29:09,901 --> 00:29:12,001
Do you have proof that it
was a poor investigation?

465
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,967
Prosecutor Jung Jaechan.
You shouldn't be doing this here.

466
00:29:16,067 --> 00:29:17,100
Prosecutor Jung has
a lot of time on his hands.

467
00:29:17,167 --> 00:29:19,068
You should be investigating
if you have time to comment.

468
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:24,801
These cockroaches.
I should break their fingers.

469
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:33,135
What is this?

470
00:29:33,434 --> 00:29:35,402
"A photo that reminds me..."

471
00:29:35,467 --> 00:29:37,834
"...when you look at the blood trails
at Yoo Sookyung's murder case."

472
00:29:45,234 --> 00:29:46,068
Mr. Bong.

473
00:29:47,033 --> 00:29:48,133
Mr. Bong, look at this.

474
00:29:48,234 --> 00:29:49,634
What now?

475
00:29:53,133 --> 00:29:57,133
Miss Sookyung was so honest that
the laws were unnecessary to her.

476
00:29:57,634 --> 00:30:00,135
She was never arrogant for being a star.

477
00:30:00,234 --> 00:30:02,467
She gave me presents on holidays.

478
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:04,446
And when I went to her house to work...

479
00:30:04,534 --> 00:30:07,934
...there wasn't much to work,
so I felt bad.

480
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,767
Oh my goodness,
he killed someone like that.

481
00:30:11,567 --> 00:30:14,634
Do Hakyoung must be
punished for what he's done.

482
00:30:15,767 --> 00:30:18,234
How many times did you
go to Yoo Sookyung's house?

483
00:30:18,334 --> 00:30:19,534
Three times a week.

484
00:30:19,701 --> 00:30:20,822
Monday, Wednesday and Friday...

485
00:30:20,934 --> 00:30:22,608
What did you do at the house usually?

486
00:30:22,701 --> 00:30:24,268
I did laundry and cooking.

487
00:30:24,367 --> 00:30:25,634
Didn't you do any cleaning?

488
00:30:25,734 --> 00:30:29,901
She was so clean that
there wasn't much to clean.

489
00:30:29,968 --> 00:30:33,469
I cleaned the hairs off
the sofa with a lint roller.

490
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:37,001
And she used a robot vacuum every day.

491
00:30:38,567 --> 00:30:39,535
Wait a minute.

492
00:30:39,901 --> 00:30:41,001
A robot vacuum?

493
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:44,834
What is that?

494
00:30:45,067 --> 00:30:47,968
Are you saying that robot
vacuum ran over the dog poop?

495
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,167
That's so funny.

496
00:30:49,767 --> 00:30:51,668
This picture isn't just funny.

497
00:30:52,734 --> 00:30:55,134
Don't those stains
remind you of something?

498
00:30:55,234 --> 00:30:55,935
What do you mean?

499
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,734
This...

500
00:30:59,634 --> 00:31:00,268
"Yoo Sookyung's murder scene video"

501
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,418
Hey. Can that be...

502
00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:10,135
What do you think?

503
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,467
They're very similar, aren't they?

504
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,968
Hey. Then the blood at the scene
of the murder might be...

505
00:31:15,934 --> 00:31:17,835
Don't you think the robot
vacuum drew the drawing?

506
00:31:18,901 --> 00:31:20,149
-The robot vacuum?
-The robot vacuum?

507
00:31:20,234 --> 00:31:22,634
The puzzle fits
if the robot vacuum did it.

508
00:31:22,701 --> 00:31:26,402
We struggled all this time
because we couldn't figure that part out.

509
00:31:27,601 --> 00:31:29,235
That's right.

510
00:31:29,334 --> 00:31:31,101
Excuse me. You said that...

511
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,467
...Miss Yoo Sookyung fainted
often due to otolithiasis, right?

512
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:34,335
Yes.

513
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:37,135
She had to be taken to
the ER because she fainted.

514
00:31:37,334 --> 00:31:40,168
That's how it makes sense.

515
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,089
Miss Yoo Sookyung fainted and
she died because she hurt her head.

516
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:49,101
And the robot vacuum...

517
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:51,501
...drew on the floor with the blood
that was spilled out.

518
00:31:55,067 --> 00:31:57,096
Wow. I just got goose bumps.

519
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,934
But there was no robot
vacuum in that house.

520
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,300
There is one there.

521
00:32:01,501 --> 00:32:03,002
Did you look for it carefully?

522
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:03,767
Of course.

523
00:32:03,868 --> 00:32:06,235
I even memorized what dishes
she has in her cupboards.

524
00:32:06,334 --> 00:32:09,202
Did you look for it
outside the house too?

525
00:32:09,501 --> 00:32:10,202
Outside the house?

526
00:32:10,267 --> 00:32:12,534
I have a robot vacuum at my house too.

527
00:32:12,619 --> 00:32:15,102
But that thing goes everywhere.

528
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,934
It goes outside if the door
is left open...

529
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
...and it sometimes
falls out of the patio too.

530
00:32:21,734 --> 00:32:25,168
Don't you think Miss Yoo Sookyung's
robot vacuum went outside too?

531
00:32:26,901 --> 00:32:29,268
What color was that robot cleaner?

532
00:32:29,534 --> 00:32:30,667
It's red.

533
00:32:36,501 --> 00:32:40,735
Have you seen a robot vacuum going around
in the hallway or in the elevator?

534
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:41,702
I'm not sure.

535
00:32:41,868 --> 00:32:44,001
I don't know about
the hallway or the elevator.

536
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,233
Last month little kids picked up...

537
00:32:45,334 --> 00:32:48,235
...something that fell from
building 103 and brought it over.

538
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,333
From building 103?

539
00:32:50,534 --> 00:32:52,068
That's right.

540
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:54,934
Yoo Sookyung's apartment
is number 209 in building 103.

541
00:32:55,734 --> 00:32:57,001
The robot vacuum's color was...

542
00:32:57,234 --> 00:32:58,768
I think it was red.

543
00:32:59,534 --> 00:33:00,301
We got it.

544
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,867
If we find it and Yoo Sookyung's
blood is found on it...

545
00:33:01,968 --> 00:33:03,101
...the case will be closed.

546
00:33:03,534 --> 00:33:04,868
Where is that robot vacuum right now?

547
00:33:04,968 --> 00:33:06,669
I already threw it away.

548
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:09,967
It should be at
the disposal facility by now.

549
00:33:17,934 --> 00:33:21,334
How are we going to find
the robot vacuum here?

550
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:24,001
It should easier than finding
narcotics at a flour factory.

551
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,734
I can't do it. I can't.

552
00:33:25,834 --> 00:33:28,134
I'll call the person...

553
00:33:28,234 --> 00:33:31,468
...who can find the robot vacuum
in this place my big brother.

554
00:33:31,534 --> 00:33:32,335
Really?

555
00:33:33,033 --> 00:33:38,233
I'm getting motivated
right now all of a sudden.

556
00:33:38,334 --> 00:33:40,401
Prosecutor Jung.
Prosecutor Jung.

557
00:33:40,467 --> 00:33:43,692
Let's go back to the office
and ask for support.

558
00:33:43,801 --> 00:33:47,602
Let's ask for help
from other offices too.

559
00:33:47,667 --> 00:33:50,168
Hey. Be quiet. That dog...

560
00:33:51,234 --> 00:33:52,168
Why?

561
00:33:53,434 --> 00:33:57,868
I'm wearing brand new shoes today.
Goodness!

562
00:33:57,968 --> 00:34:00,902
It's so irritating.

563
00:34:15,868 --> 00:34:17,402
Someone threw this away with kimchi in it.

564
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:22,595
Hongjoo. I found another robot vacuum.

565
00:34:24,901 --> 00:34:27,068
-How many times have I told you?
-That voice...

566
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:28,601
It's not green, but red.

567
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:29,501
It's red!

568
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:32,634
That's right I forgot.

569
00:34:38,091 --> 00:34:39,091
Nam Hongjoo.

570
00:34:40,334 --> 00:34:41,268
Jaechan.

571
00:34:41,567 --> 00:34:44,401
I was going to call you if we find it.
How did you know I was here?

572
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,534
Hongjoo. What are you doing here?

573
00:34:47,634 --> 00:34:49,335
I was looking through
comments on the article.

574
00:34:49,434 --> 00:34:52,068
And someone posted an accident
that a robot vacuum caused.

575
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:56,068
But it was so similar to
the blood stains on the floor.

576
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:59,634
Netizens in our country are amazing.
They really are investigators.

577
00:34:59,734 --> 00:35:03,801
Yoo Sookyung's blood stains are
clearly made by the robot vacuum.

578
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:05,668
We found few robot vacuums already.

579
00:35:05,767 --> 00:35:07,434
So if you test them for blood...

580
00:35:12,801 --> 00:35:13,702
Thank you.

581
00:35:20,567 --> 00:35:21,934
Oh my gosh...

582
00:35:22,033 --> 00:35:25,634
There are so many of
us that worked so hard.

583
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:27,449
So, how can you be
nice to just one person?

584
00:35:27,534 --> 00:35:28,968
The rest of us are disappointed.

585
00:35:29,067 --> 00:35:30,149
Don't be like that.

586
00:35:30,234 --> 00:35:34,035
You should be nice to the rest of us.
Couldn't you give hugs to all of us?

587
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:34,834
Yes.

588
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:36,634
Thank you.

589
00:35:37,534 --> 00:35:38,968
You reek of sweat.

590
00:35:40,367 --> 00:35:41,268
Thank you.

591
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,234
You don't need to.

592
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,101
It's to prove Hakyoung's innocence.
I should be the one to be thankful.

593
00:35:46,133 --> 00:35:49,133
All of you should be thankful to me.

594
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:10,501
Mr. Bong.

595
00:36:11,901 --> 00:36:12,934
No way...

596
00:36:13,934 --> 00:36:15,268
He found three of them.

597
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:27,934
Once the blood test... I'm sorry.

598
00:36:28,601 --> 00:36:30,001
Once you finish testing them for blood...

599
00:36:30,567 --> 00:36:32,474
...you have to give us
an exclusive interview.

600
00:36:32,567 --> 00:36:33,967
Yes. I understand.

601
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:38,368
Big brother. Thank you.

602
00:36:38,934 --> 00:36:39,601
Excuse me?

603
00:36:40,767 --> 00:36:41,502
Big brother.

604
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,201
Big sister.

605
00:36:43,767 --> 00:36:48,201
And obese big brother.
You all worked hard.

606
00:36:49,033 --> 00:36:51,333
I know it's hard to believe it,
but I don't have a big belly...

607
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,934
...but small chest.

608
00:36:53,601 --> 00:36:55,435
Wootak. Let's go.

609
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:00,234
Goodbye, big brother.

610
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:15,900
Did the forensics call us yet?

611
00:37:15,968 --> 00:37:16,802
No.

612
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:18,801
They said they'll call us
as soon as the test is done.

613
00:37:18,868 --> 00:37:20,268
I guess it's taking a while.

614
00:37:20,934 --> 00:37:24,635
What if they don't find Sookyung's
DNA on the robot vacuum?

615
00:37:24,734 --> 00:37:25,435
Well...

616
00:37:25,934 --> 00:37:27,635
We'll have to go back
to look for it again.

617
00:37:27,934 --> 00:37:29,635
We have to go back there again?

618
00:37:32,534 --> 00:37:34,502
I'm sorry.
I fell asleep for a moment.

619
00:37:34,601 --> 00:37:37,039
I dreamt about getting
draft notice again.

620
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:39,300
No. Please save me.

621
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,134
Yes. Hello.

622
00:37:42,534 --> 00:37:43,801
Yes. That's right.

623
00:37:44,367 --> 00:37:45,934
Do you have the result?

624
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,201
Yes.

625
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:51,634
Is that so? Yes. I understand. Thank you.

626
00:37:54,901 --> 00:37:58,201
Blood was found in one
of the six robot vacuums.

627
00:37:58,534 --> 00:38:00,201
And after testing for DNA...

628
00:38:00,701 --> 00:38:02,801
...it was verified that it was
Yoo Sookyung's blood.

629
00:38:02,868 --> 00:38:05,335
We got it! We got it!

630
00:38:11,601 --> 00:38:13,035
Good job.

631
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,934
Yes. Good job.

632
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,367
Are you certain?

633
00:38:24,901 --> 00:38:25,769
I'm so glad.

634
00:38:26,033 --> 00:38:27,967
Okay. I'll write the article right away.

635
00:38:29,133 --> 00:38:31,233
It was verified that it's
Yoo Sookyung's blood.

636
00:38:32,033 --> 00:38:32,661
That's a relief.

637
00:38:32,734 --> 00:38:34,801
Which one did they find the blood from?

638
00:38:34,868 --> 00:38:36,335
Was it from the one that I found?

639
00:38:36,434 --> 00:38:38,834
Mr. Oh.
Is that important right now?

640
00:38:39,133 --> 00:38:40,467
I have to go back to work
and write up the article.

641
00:38:40,534 --> 00:38:42,201
-Bye.
-Bye.

642
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,200
Nam Hongjoo.

643
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,434
Yes. What is it?

644
00:38:51,834 --> 00:38:54,301
The man that you saw hurting
Jaechan in your dream...

645
00:38:55,434 --> 00:38:56,567
I think it's Hakyoung.

646
00:38:57,467 --> 00:38:59,101
How do you know that?

647
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:03,534
I saw him recently and he was
wearing a black fisherman's hat.

648
00:39:04,767 --> 00:39:07,334
Now that he's found innocent,
you dream won't come true.

649
00:39:07,868 --> 00:39:09,802
But since we never know,
let me ask you for a favor.

650
00:39:10,033 --> 00:39:11,100
What is it?

651
00:39:11,185 --> 00:39:13,485
Please interview Hakyoung
when you write up your article.

652
00:39:14,334 --> 00:39:17,001
I'm sure everyone has been
cursing at him all this time.

653
00:39:17,501 --> 00:39:19,274
I'm sure he has a lot to say.

654
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,701
If he doesn't get to tell his story,
it will turn into a grudge.

655
00:39:22,133 --> 00:39:24,500
And it can make someone
do something foolish.

656
00:39:25,033 --> 00:39:26,133
You're right.

657
00:39:26,267 --> 00:39:28,434
Don't worry. I'll hear him out.

658
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:31,167
Thanks, Nam Hongjoo.

659
00:39:34,534 --> 00:39:36,335
Why are you so happy?

660
00:39:36,434 --> 00:39:38,315
I'm going to submit
my report for approval.

661
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,544
He's cleared from any suspicion,
so he's not being indicted.

662
00:39:39,601 --> 00:39:40,734
Prosecutor Jung.

663
00:39:43,501 --> 00:39:44,835
I want to talk to you.

664
00:39:47,801 --> 00:39:49,468
Are you telling me to indict him
when there's no suspicion about him?

665
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:50,482
Are you crazy?

666
00:39:50,567 --> 00:39:51,600
I'm perfectly fine.

667
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:53,501
I also know that he shouldn't be indicted.

668
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:54,668
Then why are you saying that?

669
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,401
If you decide that he's
not going to be indicted...

670
00:39:56,501 --> 00:39:58,801
...the reporters will write articles and
say that it's poor investigation again.

671
00:39:58,868 --> 00:40:00,968
Hey. Why is this poor investigation?

672
00:40:01,067 --> 00:40:02,516
We found the evidence
which proves his innocence.

673
00:40:02,601 --> 00:40:05,502
We found Yoo Sookyung's
blood on the robot vacuum.

674
00:40:05,601 --> 00:40:07,368
Do you think the reporters
will write it that way?

675
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,033
We realized that we were wrong
and the prosecution was right.

676
00:40:12,501 --> 00:40:13,935
Do you think they'll write it that way?

677
00:40:15,434 --> 00:40:17,701
Just say that he wasn't indicted.

678
00:40:17,767 --> 00:40:19,402
Just like a 15 second
segment for accidents...

679
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,701
Then what about the story
of the robot vacuum?

680
00:40:21,801 --> 00:40:22,968
We have to explain it so that...

681
00:40:23,033 --> 00:40:26,033
...people will not say that
it was a poor investigation.

682
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:27,867
Why should we be worried about it?

683
00:40:29,234 --> 00:40:30,334
Just wrap it up simply.

684
00:40:30,434 --> 00:40:33,434
Then the people will continue to
treat Do Hakyoung as a murderer.

685
00:40:33,534 --> 00:40:34,850
Hey. Then what do we do?

686
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:36,048
We kept putting out articles...

687
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:37,900
...about the prosecution doing
a poor job with the prosecution.

688
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,868
Do you want us to change
our mind over night?

689
00:40:38,968 --> 00:40:39,669
That's humiliating.

690
00:40:39,734 --> 00:40:40,934
We have to change our mind.

691
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,134
Do you want us to pretend that we don't
know anything even though we do?

692
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:44,534
Yes. Just pretend that we don't know.

693
00:40:45,033 --> 00:40:46,767
That's better than humiliating ourselves.

694
00:40:46,834 --> 00:40:48,034
-Captain!
-Captain!

695
00:40:49,334 --> 00:40:50,367
You guys.

696
00:40:50,667 --> 00:40:52,700
The news also has what you call inertia.

697
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:53,668
What will people think of us...

698
00:40:53,767 --> 00:40:56,668
...if we make a sudden U-turn
after going straight for a while?

699
00:40:56,767 --> 00:40:58,205
Hey. Do you think I didn't
do that long time ago?

700
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:02,500
How can people watch the news
if we keep changing our minds?

701
00:41:02,601 --> 00:41:03,402
Just do it.

702
00:41:04,434 --> 00:41:08,129
No media outlets will write about
Do Hakyoung case properly.

703
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,200
Never.

704
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,256
Why don't you just curse him?

705
00:41:11,334 --> 00:41:13,939
I'm not cursing him.
I'm just telling you the reality.

706
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,133
The news will never be on our side.

707
00:41:16,267 --> 00:41:17,934
The public opinion will
never change either.

708
00:41:18,234 --> 00:41:20,835
The protestors will continue
to complain and criticize it.

709
00:41:20,901 --> 00:41:22,702
And they'll continue to pick on you...

710
00:41:22,767 --> 00:41:25,468
...for every case saying
that it's poor investigation.

711
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,968
Hey. Yoon Daegoo.

712
00:41:40,267 --> 00:41:42,634
Why don't you sit with Seungwon?

713
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:45,635
Yes. Be friends with Seungwon.
His older brother is a prosecutor.

714
00:41:45,734 --> 00:41:46,602
You never know.

715
00:41:46,667 --> 00:41:49,669
Maybe his older brother will
release your father who is in prison.

716
00:41:49,734 --> 00:41:51,301
That's right.

717
00:41:51,367 --> 00:41:54,335
His brother's specialty
is releasing criminals.

718
00:41:54,767 --> 00:41:55,534
Hey!

719
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,433
Hey. Daegoo!

720
00:42:03,367 --> 00:42:04,275
Let go of me!

721
00:42:05,033 --> 00:42:05,967
You  jerk!

722
00:42:10,167 --> 00:42:11,267
Daegoo.

723
00:42:11,367 --> 00:42:13,268
Daegoo. Stop it.

724
00:42:15,601 --> 00:42:16,302
Daegoo.

725
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:18,001
That's why you should indict him.

726
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:19,855
In any case...

727
00:42:19,934 --> 00:42:22,268
...once you go to trial and
Do Hakyoung has an attorney...

728
00:42:22,334 --> 00:42:23,901
...he'll be found innocent.

729
00:42:24,367 --> 00:42:27,601
Then Do Hakyoung will be released
and the people who used to criticize...

730
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:29,535
...the prosecutor will start to
criticize the defense attorney.

731
00:42:29,868 --> 00:42:32,669
And the prosecution will wrap up the
case saying that we did all we could.

732
00:42:34,968 --> 00:42:36,902
Why do you insist on getting criticized?

733
00:42:37,133 --> 00:42:40,001
Indict him and wash your hands off of it.

734
00:42:51,601 --> 00:42:53,035
"Chief Prosecuter: Park Daeyong"

735
00:43:11,901 --> 00:43:12,869
Are you okay?

736
00:43:14,734 --> 00:43:15,501
Yes.

737
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,200
I'm sorry for hitting you earlier.

738
00:43:28,467 --> 00:43:30,001
Why did you save me?

739
00:43:30,601 --> 00:43:32,135
Why did you save me?

740
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,634
You should've just let me die.
Why did you save me?

741
00:43:34,701 --> 00:43:36,268
-Let go of me.
-Bring me the sedative.

742
00:43:36,367 --> 00:43:37,400
Let go of me.

743
00:43:37,634 --> 00:43:39,834
Just let me die.

744
00:43:40,734 --> 00:43:42,034
You need to live, Mister.

745
00:43:51,601 --> 00:43:52,435
I...

746
00:43:54,067 --> 00:43:55,634
...don't blame you anymore.

747
00:43:56,834 --> 00:44:00,168
I'm glad that you're alive.

748
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,067
So...

749
00:44:09,634 --> 00:44:10,834
...please live, Mister.

750
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,467
My father told me that anger
makes the obvious difficult to do.

751
00:45:28,467 --> 00:45:30,467
It's obvious to save a person...

752
00:45:30,567 --> 00:45:33,308
...but it was so difficult
because I was so angry.

753
00:45:34,067 --> 00:45:35,134
Thank you.

754
00:45:35,701 --> 00:45:38,535
If it wasn't for you, I would've
regretted it for the rest of my life.

755
00:45:39,734 --> 00:45:40,734
From Chestnut.

756
00:46:02,167 --> 00:46:03,668
Are you still thinking about it?

757
00:46:04,868 --> 00:46:07,202
No. I made up my mind.

758
00:46:09,701 --> 00:46:10,502
Are you going to indict him?

759
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:11,402
No.

760
00:46:11,734 --> 00:46:14,435
There's no suspicion on him, so isn't it
obvious that he shouldn't be indicted?

761
00:46:14,968 --> 00:46:16,769
You stubborn fool.

762
00:46:16,834 --> 00:46:18,702
You don't listen to a word I say, do you?

763
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,534
I understood what you said.

764
00:46:20,767 --> 00:46:22,568
And I know what you're worried about too.

765
00:46:23,267 --> 00:46:24,367
But who knows?

766
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:27,268
There might be a stubborn fool
like me among the reporters.

767
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:29,201
Is there anyone else who has a story?

768
00:46:29,934 --> 00:46:31,048
Except you two!

769
00:46:31,133 --> 00:46:33,266
It's the news about Do Hakyoung
not being indicted.

770
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:35,084
And not a sentence news,
but a minute and a half news.

771
00:46:36,067 --> 00:46:37,868
Hey. Let's stop this.

772
00:46:37,968 --> 00:46:40,101
We're going to be
a laughing stock if write that.

773
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,534
Who is going to watch the news
that keeps changing their minds?

774
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:47,667
Even the navigation recalculates
the route if you take a wrong turn.

775
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,701
Can you drive with the navigation that
keeps insisting that the wrong is right?

776
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,701
If it's wrong, we need to change it.

777
00:46:54,767 --> 00:46:57,501
Who will believe the news that insists
on being right even when it's wrong?

778
00:46:57,634 --> 00:46:58,535
My goodness...

779
00:46:58,901 --> 00:46:59,869
Fine.

780
00:47:00,033 --> 00:47:01,534
You're my supervisor.

781
00:47:01,634 --> 00:47:04,268
You should be glad that
she's not your supervisor.

782
00:47:04,601 --> 00:47:06,268
If she was your supervisor...

783
00:47:10,667 --> 00:47:12,401
Oh my gosh. I must be out of my mind.

784
00:47:26,234 --> 00:47:27,634
Please eat this on your way back.

785
00:47:27,734 --> 00:47:31,301
The yellow ones are salad kimbap
and the blue ones are beef kimbap.

786
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,700
No. You don't need to.

787
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:35,001
It's because I'm grateful.

788
00:47:36,968 --> 00:47:38,135
Thank you.

789
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,034
Hey. That jacket makes
you look like a punk. Wear this instead.

790
00:47:42,267 --> 00:47:43,135
Really?

791
00:47:43,901 --> 00:47:45,135
Hey. Thanks.

792
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:52,101
When I was arrested there
were so many reporters.

793
00:47:52,367 --> 00:47:53,567
But now that I'm released...

794
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:56,134
...there's only one team
of reporters that came.

795
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,068
I know, right?

796
00:48:10,133 --> 00:48:11,367
Are you ready?

797
00:48:11,467 --> 00:48:12,101
Yes.

798
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,534
Jeez. Wootak.

799
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,834
What do I say?

800
00:48:38,334 --> 00:48:41,868
Just say what you want to say.

801
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,600
So I...

802
00:49:18,901 --> 00:49:20,034
I...

803
00:49:36,801 --> 00:49:40,235
I didn't kill her.

804
00:49:42,601 --> 00:49:44,502
I really didn't kill her.

805
00:49:49,501 --> 00:49:50,302
I...

806
00:49:51,501 --> 00:49:53,369
...did not kill...

807
00:49:55,133 --> 00:49:56,967
...Miss Yoo Sookyung.

808
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:05,749
Since being arrested for
the suspicion of murdering...

809
00:50:05,834 --> 00:50:07,335
...the national heroine Yoo Sookyung...

810
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,400
...Mr. Do has been receiving
the rage of the entire country.

811
00:50:11,067 --> 00:50:12,982
After the prosecution
decided not to indict him...

812
00:50:13,067 --> 00:50:15,100
...he spoke of his innocence.

813
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,801
But he couldn't continue
because he was getting choked up.

814
00:50:17,534 --> 00:50:19,713
Did you see the news?

815
00:50:19,801 --> 00:50:22,468
It wasn't homicide, but accidental death.

816
00:50:22,567 --> 00:50:23,883
Does this make any sense?

817
00:50:23,968 --> 00:50:25,202
Is this true?

818
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,161
It's true.

819
00:50:27,267 --> 00:50:29,367
He didn't do that with her blood.

820
00:50:29,467 --> 00:50:31,318
But it was the robot vacuum that did it.

821
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,834
Robot vacuum...

822
00:50:33,667 --> 00:50:34,434
Goodness.

823
00:50:34,534 --> 00:50:37,534
The prosecution conducted
a proper investigation.

824
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:41,468
We just have to listen to
what the prosecution has to say.

825
00:50:42,367 --> 00:50:44,400
The sky is so clear.

826
00:50:53,767 --> 00:50:57,101
After the robot vacuum with
Miss Yoo's blood was discovered...

827
00:50:57,234 --> 00:50:58,568
...the criticism of the prosecution...

828
00:50:58,667 --> 00:51:01,301
...regarding poor investigation
has been subsiding.

829
00:51:02,133 --> 00:51:06,900
The prosecution decided not to
indict Mr. Do and closed the case.

830
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,101
Crazy  jerk.

831
00:51:08,601 --> 00:51:12,235
Miss Yoo was beloved by
the entire nation as a sports star.

832
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,001
So Mr. Do who was suspected
of murdering Miss Yoo...

833
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:18,968
I guess the only reporter that's
explaining our intentions is Miss Nam.

834
00:51:19,834 --> 00:51:20,668
I know.

835
00:51:20,767 --> 00:51:23,701
Anger made the obvious difficult to do.

836
00:51:24,834 --> 00:51:27,934
Anger made the obvious difficult to do.

837
00:51:29,634 --> 00:51:34,834
My father said anger
makes the obvious difficult to do.

838
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,434
You look so similar to someone.

839
00:51:45,634 --> 00:51:46,435
Who?

840
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,400
A  jerk who hit me when I was little...

841
00:51:51,868 --> 00:51:53,435
But the investigation
by the prosecution...

842
00:51:53,534 --> 00:51:54,968
...revealed that Yoo Sookyung
death wasn't a homicide...

843
00:51:55,067 --> 00:51:56,234
...but an accidental death.

844
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,700
That's why we're correcting our stance.

845
00:51:57,801 --> 00:52:00,568
We apologize to Mr. Do Hakyoung
and all of our viewer.

846
00:52:01,133 --> 00:52:03,266
This is Nam Hongjoo from SBC news.

847
00:52:09,234 --> 00:52:10,168
No way...

848
00:52:11,033 --> 00:52:11,867
What's wrong?

849
00:52:12,734 --> 00:52:14,901
Where did the owner go?

850
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,868
She went to the nearby pharmacy
to buy some indigestion medicine.

851
00:52:27,534 --> 00:52:29,565
I ended up having those darn dreams.

852
00:52:30,334 --> 00:52:32,068
Why did it come to me too?

853
00:52:32,367 --> 00:52:33,367
Why does it have to be me?

854
00:52:35,467 --> 00:52:38,767
I don't know why it's you either.

855
00:52:40,834 --> 00:52:42,401
I don't know why,
but there must be a reason.

856
00:52:42,467 --> 00:52:43,767
Why it's you and me...

857
00:53:02,567 --> 00:53:06,301
Wasn't the person who
saved you, Nam Hongjoo?

858
00:53:12,567 --> 00:53:14,634
You dream about Nam Hongjoo.

859
00:53:14,734 --> 00:53:17,134
So the one who saved
you is Nam Hongjoo.

860
00:53:17,801 --> 00:53:19,801
The one who saved me was a boy.

861
00:53:20,334 --> 00:53:21,701
It wasn't Nam Hongjoo.

862
00:53:38,033 --> 00:53:39,133
Oh my goodness.

863
00:53:41,701 --> 00:53:42,604
Prosecutor Jung.

864
00:53:42,701 --> 00:53:46,235
Was Nam Hongjoo's nickname,
Chestnut by any chance?

865
00:53:46,601 --> 00:53:48,801
My gosh. How did you know that?

866
00:53:49,934 --> 00:53:51,967
When she was young,
she wanted to become a baseball player...

867
00:53:52,067 --> 00:53:54,501
...so she had short hair back then.

868
00:53:55,367 --> 00:53:57,500
Thank you. Thank you so much.

869
00:53:58,234 --> 00:54:00,301
Thank you. Thank you.

870
00:54:00,367 --> 00:54:02,201
You're welcome.

871
00:54:02,934 --> 00:54:04,134
Thank you.

872
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,834
What is he thankful for?

873
00:54:11,267 --> 00:54:12,901
"President Yoo Manho"

874
00:54:15,334 --> 00:54:17,367
Yes. Mr. Yoo. I saw the news.

875
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:22,268
The prosecution found some ridiculous
thing and found him innocent.

876
00:54:24,133 --> 00:54:27,800
Don't worry. I have one more
bomb to set off to the reporters.

877
00:54:28,901 --> 00:54:30,769
You saw the pictures I sent you, right?

878
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,637
He's Lieutenant Han Wootak.

879
00:54:32,701 --> 00:54:35,135
He's a good friend of
Prosecutor Jung Jaechan.

880
00:54:35,701 --> 00:54:40,635
But I found out that Do Hakyoung
used to be Han Wootak's roommate.

881
00:54:41,234 --> 00:54:45,568
Then are you saying that a prosecutor used
his authority to release Do Hakyoung?

882
00:54:45,968 --> 00:54:46,836
I'm not sure.

883
00:54:46,934 --> 00:54:48,334
I was hoping that Jaechan...

884
00:54:48,834 --> 00:54:51,535
I mean Prosecutor Jung
wouldn't be like that.

885
00:54:52,133 --> 00:54:55,734
Now that he didn't indict him,
I wonder if I'm right about him.

886
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,435
I'll take the second one from the left.

887
00:55:11,501 --> 00:55:12,335
That ruby ring.

888
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:14,035
You have good taste.

889
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,134
What's your girlfriend's ring size?

890
00:55:18,634 --> 00:55:20,968
I don't know her ring size.

891
00:55:22,434 --> 00:55:23,601
What is this?

892
00:55:24,067 --> 00:55:26,501
I thought you might need it.

893
00:55:29,901 --> 00:55:32,168
I guess I saw it in my dream.

894
00:55:34,767 --> 00:55:36,368
Here. Please use this.

895
00:55:36,567 --> 00:55:37,368
Okay.

896
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:40,468
Since you're picking out a ruby ring,
are you confessing your love to her?

897
00:55:42,367 --> 00:55:44,767
I'm meeting an old friend of mine.

898
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:54,636
Where are you?

899
00:55:54,734 --> 00:55:56,068
I want to meet you and
tell you something.

900
00:56:04,868 --> 00:56:06,102
Wootak. It's me.

901
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,834
Do you know where
Do Hakyoung is right now?

902
00:56:12,834 --> 00:56:13,834
Wootak.

903
00:56:15,634 --> 00:56:22,101
To tell you the truth,
I lost my mind for a moment.

904
00:56:22,934 --> 00:56:25,635
The  jerk who damaged
my mother's restaurant...

905
00:56:25,734 --> 00:56:27,834
...the police and the prosecutor...

906
00:56:29,234 --> 00:56:31,135
Should I just kill everyone?

907
00:56:33,934 --> 00:56:35,835
I thought about it.

908
00:56:37,734 --> 00:56:39,067
My gosh.

909
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:41,467
Why did I think that?

910
00:56:46,534 --> 00:56:48,901
I'm glad you came to your senses.

911
00:56:55,033 --> 00:56:58,433
I'll keep your secret,
so don't quit being a police officer.

912
00:56:59,567 --> 00:57:03,068
That's just luck.

913
00:57:03,534 --> 00:57:05,968
A luck created by a misunderstanding.

914
00:57:10,167 --> 00:57:12,334
Hakyoung is having
a drink with me right now.

915
00:57:12,467 --> 00:57:14,101
You don't have to worry
about that dream now.

916
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,334
Where should I meet you?

917
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:38,034
If I really change the future...

918
00:57:38,133 --> 00:57:39,467
Let's say that I did change the future,

919
00:57:39,734 --> 00:57:41,335
what will happen then?

920
00:57:41,801 --> 00:57:42,968
I don't know.

921
00:57:48,501 --> 00:57:49,402
Lieutenant Oh.

922
00:57:49,701 --> 00:57:53,001
Mr. Yoo Manho's personal
firearm hasn't been returned yet.

923
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,300
Did you call him directly?

924
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,232
Yes, but I can't get in touch with him.

925
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:57,201
Really?

926
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,500
Yoo Manho.

927
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,901
I think I've heard of
that name somewhere.

928
00:58:03,767 --> 00:58:07,201
If you stop the water that's flowing,
it will flow to a different direction.

929
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:10,534
Since we stopped the event
that was supposed to happen...

930
00:58:10,834 --> 00:58:12,901
...the time will flow to
a different direction.

931
00:58:15,067 --> 00:58:17,035
If the time flows down
to a different direction...

932
00:58:17,133 --> 00:58:18,834
...which direction will it flow to?

933
00:58:19,467 --> 00:58:22,335
A better direction or a worse direction?

934
00:58:23,901 --> 00:58:26,502
I don't know since I've
never changed it before.

935
00:58:26,801 --> 00:58:31,901
What I'm certain is that the time
will flow to a different direction.

936
00:58:32,601 --> 00:58:36,335
To a better direction
or to a worse direction...

937
00:59:42,968 --> 00:59:45,268
Jaechan. Jaechan.

938
00:59:45,734 --> 00:59:51,134
Please call an ambulance.

939
00:59:51,434 --> 00:59:55,701
Jaechan... Jaechan...

940
00:59:56,601 --> 01:00:00,535
Please call an ambulance.

941
01:00:54,133 --> 01:00:56,067
"While You Were Sleeping"

942
01:00:56,167 --> 01:00:57,768
I couldn't change it.

943
01:00:57,868 --> 01:01:01,168
I changed it,
but it turned out to be worse.

944
01:01:01,267 --> 01:01:02,768
You were Chestnut.

945
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:04,302
Why didn't I recognize you?

946
01:01:04,501 --> 01:01:08,202
If this is the end,
don't cry because of me.

947
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:10,201
Did I fire the gun? Instigation?

948
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:11,734
What's my crime?

949
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:13,001
13 years ago...

950
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:16,001
...you were just scar and wounds to me.

951
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,233
Jaechan.

952
01:01:17,868 --> 01:01:19,602
There's something I want to tell you.

953
01:01:19,734 --> 01:01:21,968
"It's nice to see you again."

954
01:01:22,167 --> 01:01:23,434
And there's something
else I want to tell you.

955
01:01:30,033 --> 01:01:39,066
"While You Were Sleeping"
