1
00:00:00,344 --> 00:00:01,144
"While You Were Sleeping"

2
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:41,274
There are moments in your
life that you're terrified to face.

3
00:00:43,203 --> 00:00:44,449
-Jaechan!
-He's my brother!

4
00:00:46,601 --> 00:00:48,901
And the moment before
you face that terrifying moment...

5
00:00:49,904 --> 00:00:53,369
...there are trivial decisions that you
made which created that moment.

6
00:00:53,876 --> 00:00:57,190
Yes. I'm Mr. Park Junmo's
daughter Park Soyun.

7
00:00:58,203 --> 00:01:01,396
I was wondering what's going
to happen with my dad's case.

8
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:03,909
We've received documents saying
that she's not pressing charges.

9
00:01:03,994 --> 00:01:06,268
So I don't think
he's going to be indicted.

10
00:01:09,007 --> 00:01:11,536
Yes. I understand.

11
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:24,785
"Episode 3"

12
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,522
And those trivial decisions
will return to us...

13
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:33,267
...as regrets one day.

14
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:39,001
If we can change those
trivial decisions we made...

15
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:43,474
Wouldn't we be able to stop that
terrifying moments from happening?

16
00:01:48,272 --> 00:01:49,409
Seungwon.

17
00:01:50,048 --> 00:01:52,169
Let's go.
I'll take you home.

18
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:53,835
Let me go.

19
00:01:54,029 --> 00:01:55,353
Pretend you didn't see me and just leave.

20
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,518
Why don't you go to report to the
police or the Prosecutors' office with me?

21
00:01:58,707 --> 00:01:59,578
There must be a way.

22
00:01:59,663 --> 00:02:01,071
No, there isn't any.

23
00:02:01,744 --> 00:02:04,464
I heard the prosecutor had already
dropped the charge.

24
00:02:04,868 --> 00:02:06,987
They made a very quick decision,
which was unfortunately wrong.

25
00:02:07,072 --> 00:02:10,063
Who the heck is that stupid prosecutor?

26
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,232
Who is Seungwon?

27
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,267
He's my brother.

28
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:15,435
What is it?

29
00:02:16,348 --> 00:02:17,570
In my dream...

30
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:19,943
...the guy named Seungwon...

31
00:02:21,982 --> 00:02:23,610
...killed someone.

32
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:25,702
Excuse me?

33
00:02:25,934 --> 00:02:28,115
His name is Jung Jaechan?

34
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,206
That's right.
Prosecutor Jung Jaechan.

35
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,801
That prosecutor and the attorney
are in it together with.

36
00:02:33,367 --> 00:02:34,467
No way...

37
00:02:34,941 --> 00:02:35,842
What is it?

38
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:37,542
That prosecutor...

39
00:02:40,907 --> 00:02:41,974
...is my older brother.

40
00:02:44,567 --> 00:02:45,363
What?

41
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:50,937
"Jaechan"

42
00:02:55,868 --> 00:02:56,836
He isn't answering?

43
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:06,166
Jaechan!

44
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,106
Soyun. It's mom.

45
00:03:11,498 --> 00:03:13,496
Why don't you sleep
over at Sunghee's house?

46
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:19,368
I need to talk to dad about something.

47
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:21,834
Why can't I come home?

48
00:03:22,934 --> 00:03:24,472
Mom. Mom.

49
00:03:28,534 --> 00:03:29,346
Soyun!

50
00:03:31,724 --> 00:03:32,757
Please...

51
00:03:33,368 --> 00:03:34,435
Seungwon.

52
00:03:35,186 --> 00:03:36,653
Come to your senses.

53
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:40,634
You said you had a dream too, right?

54
00:03:40,868 --> 00:03:42,402
Compare it with my dream.

55
00:03:42,734 --> 00:03:43,801
When was the dream about?

56
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:44,703
It's tonight.

57
00:03:44,788 --> 00:03:46,535
We're wearing the same clothes
from my dream. You and I both...

58
00:03:46,634 --> 00:03:48,168
Then we don't have much time.

59
00:03:48,267 --> 00:03:49,734
Tell me about the dream in detail.

60
00:03:51,434 --> 00:03:53,400
It looked like the living room
of a rich house.

61
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,501
But there was a piano in the middle.

62
00:03:56,227 --> 00:03:57,060
Piano?

63
00:03:58,202 --> 00:04:00,910
Yes. A married couple was fighting there.

64
00:04:00,995 --> 00:04:02,774
No. They weren't fighting.

65
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:05,268
It felt like the wife
was getting beaten up.

66
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:10,767
At that moment, the couple's
daughter and Seungwon came in.

67
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,167
Please stop, Sir.

68
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,898
Who are you, jerk!

69
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,791
Seungwon, watch out!

70
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:29,669
Seungwon was trying
to stop them from fighting.

71
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,280
So, he pushed the husband
and he fell out of the window.

72
00:05:06,827 --> 00:05:08,540
This is all your fault.

73
00:05:09,623 --> 00:05:12,335
I became a murderer because of you.

74
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:14,347
That's how he resented you.

75
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:17,183
He said that he became
a murderer because of you.

76
00:05:19,868 --> 00:05:21,588
But why is it your fault?

77
00:05:25,236 --> 00:05:26,192
No way...

78
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:28,439
Is this about Park Junmo's case?

79
00:05:29,434 --> 00:05:30,603
Park Junmo's case?

80
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:33,759
My friend is having
a piano concert today.

81
00:05:33,844 --> 00:05:34,655
Do you want to go?

82
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,668
You know the piano prodigy
Park Soyun, don't you?

83
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:37,401
It's her father.

84
00:05:37,501 --> 00:05:38,557
The name is Park Junmo.

85
00:05:38,642 --> 00:05:42,035
The victim stated that she
didn't want to press charges.

86
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,889
Therefore, he will not be indicted.

87
00:05:44,974 --> 00:05:45,667
The end.

88
00:05:45,734 --> 00:05:47,571
Wow. It didn't even take five minutes.

89
00:05:50,772 --> 00:05:52,885
That's why he said it's my fault.

90
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,369
Because I let Park Junmo go.

91
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:59,192
Do you remember where
the apartment in your dream was?

92
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,403
I saw two moons outside
the apartment window.

93
00:06:21,797 --> 00:06:22,515
"Kyomun Securities"

94
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,086
"Starland Exhibition"

95
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,602
Hey. Wootak.

96
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:42,768
Do you want to switch?

97
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:44,865
You brat.

98
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,873
I don't know what he does every night.

99
00:06:50,934 --> 00:06:53,108
Who the heck did this?

100
00:06:53,193 --> 00:06:55,568
A student killed this guy while he
was trying to stop the fight.

101
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:57,434
He's coming out.

102
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,865
That's terrible.

103
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,268
He's still so young.

104
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:02,322
He looks like a good kid.

105
00:07:06,534 --> 00:07:10,997
I was just trying to save
my friend's mother.

106
00:07:14,107 --> 00:07:15,801
Seungwon!

107
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:17,034
Jaechan. Save me.

108
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:18,266
Jaechan. I didn't do it.

109
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:20,406
Wait.

110
00:07:22,686 --> 00:07:23,627
He's my brother.

111
00:07:23,712 --> 00:07:25,157
I said he's my brother.

112
00:07:25,242 --> 00:07:26,477
Let me go!

113
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:34,237
Are you awake?

114
00:07:34,534 --> 00:07:35,449
I wasn't sleeping.

115
00:07:35,534 --> 00:07:36,901
Wipe your drool.

116
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,900
Okay.

117
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,094
Should we switch, sir?

118
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:42,118
Yes.

119
00:07:50,627 --> 00:07:51,644
Does your stomach hurt?

120
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:53,868
Is it because of the oyster rice
I had for lunch?

121
00:07:53,934 --> 00:07:55,234
Why is my stomach turning so much?

122
00:07:57,133 --> 00:07:59,212
Then we should go back to the station
so that you can go to the bathroom.

123
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,994
What is it?

124
00:08:14,534 --> 00:08:16,095
It's nothing.

125
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:17,701
Let's go quickly.

126
00:08:29,547 --> 00:08:32,172
You would've killed him
if I didn't stop him.

127
00:08:33,493 --> 00:08:35,316
Seungwon. Seungwon.

128
00:08:38,544 --> 00:08:40,138
Hey. Please step on it.

129
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,201
I'm going to soil myself.
Please hurry.

130
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,600
Hey. Turn off the siren.

131
00:08:49,685 --> 00:08:51,235
It's not that bad.

132
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,598
Turn off the siren, you brat.

133
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:02,354
You want me to divorce you and pay
Soyun's tuition for her overseas studies?

134
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:04,752
Do you think I'm UNICEF or Mother Teresa?

135
00:09:05,543 --> 00:09:07,082
You wrote a letter of promise.

136
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:09,868
You said you'll do anything
if I didn't press charges.

137
00:09:10,434 --> 00:09:12,657
You must think that you won something
big just because I wrote you that.

138
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,822
The prosecutor and
the law are on my side now.

139
00:09:17,501 --> 00:09:18,781
So why should I do this for you?

140
00:09:25,012 --> 00:09:26,479
Do you know why the law is on my side?

141
00:09:26,989 --> 00:09:28,038
Even if I do this...

142
00:09:40,103 --> 00:09:41,105
Even if I do this!

143
00:09:48,423 --> 00:09:49,772
Even if I do this, no one can touch me.

144
00:09:49,857 --> 00:09:53,001
Why? It's because all of these are mine.

145
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:54,867
It's because I can do
whatever I want to my things.

146
00:09:54,952 --> 00:09:57,549
The law is fair,
so it knows that very well.

147
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:01,424
I'll write up the documents again.

148
00:10:48,701 --> 00:10:49,482
Jaechan.

149
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:10,203
"Secretly, greatly"

150
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,576
What's happening?

151
00:11:17,334 --> 00:11:19,475
Someone set off the alarm.

152
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,453
Mom.

153
00:11:20,903 --> 00:11:22,014
Soyun.

154
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,867
Are you okay? Are you okay?

155
00:11:25,968 --> 00:11:27,335
I am okay.

156
00:11:29,434 --> 00:11:31,932
It's so cold.
Just what is going on?

157
00:11:32,017 --> 00:11:34,527
Do you think someone
set off the alarm falsely?

158
00:11:34,701 --> 00:11:35,575
You set off the alarm, didn't you?

159
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,605
I saw you set off the alarm
in the hallway earlier.

160
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:41,215
I thought I saw smoke.

161
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,438
Don't you smell something burning?

162
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,337
I don't smell it.

163
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,855
Where did you smell
and what did you smell?

164
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,535
I think you pulled a prank.

165
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,635
Miss. Did you set off the alarm falsely?

166
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,536
I saw it.

167
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:58,548
Was it over there?

168
00:12:00,684 --> 00:12:03,152
I saw the smoke too.

169
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,759
So she didn't set off the alarm falsely.

170
00:12:21,868 --> 00:12:22,729
I told you earlier, didn't I?

171
00:12:22,814 --> 00:12:24,501
I told you not to go anywhere
and come straight home.

172
00:12:24,586 --> 00:12:25,645
Why didn't you listen to me?

173
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:27,381
I had my reasons.

174
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:29,192
If you hear me out,
you'll know why I did it...

175
00:12:29,277 --> 00:12:31,517
I know that your friend is
Park Junmo's daughter.

176
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:33,434
I know that you came here
because you're worried about her.

177
00:12:33,534 --> 00:12:34,335
You know?

178
00:12:34,434 --> 00:12:35,434
You're acting like this
when you know that?

179
00:12:35,534 --> 00:12:37,080
How can I ignore it when
I'm worried about my friend?

180
00:12:37,165 --> 00:12:38,534
Ignore it!

181
00:12:38,619 --> 00:12:40,440
If you interfere needlessly,
you'll get hurt.

182
00:12:42,133 --> 00:12:43,298
Why didn't you answer my call?

183
00:12:43,476 --> 00:12:45,798
I didn't answer it because I was
embarrassed. I was embarrassed of you.

184
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:47,435
What?

185
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:48,634
You want me to ignore it?

186
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,942
You're telling me to ignore her when
something bad might happen to my friend.

187
00:12:51,027 --> 00:12:52,020
How can you say that?

188
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,001
And you call yourself a prosecutor?

189
00:12:53,097 --> 00:12:54,867
If I didn't stop you,
you would've become a murderer.

190
00:12:54,968 --> 00:12:56,779
You shouldn't be saying that, Jaechan!

191
00:12:57,634 --> 00:12:59,753
"I was wrong. I'm sorry for
being an idiot prosecutor."

192
00:12:59,838 --> 00:13:01,159
That's what you should say.

193
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:05,636
"I'll investigate properly now.
Just trust me and don't worry."

194
00:13:05,721 --> 00:13:07,296
That's what a prosecutor should do.

195
00:13:10,467 --> 00:13:11,525
That's who my brother is.

196
00:13:17,812 --> 00:13:19,098
I guess a prosecutor is not big deal.

197
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:21,535
You're not a big deal at all.

198
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,867
Yes.

199
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:28,756
I'm not a big deal.

200
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:31,542
But you're not a big deal either.

201
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:33,601
I'd get hurt if I interfere
even though I'm a prosecutor.

202
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:35,135
So what makes you think
that you can interfere?

203
00:13:35,234 --> 00:13:37,035
You're really embarrassing me to the end.

204
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:39,051
Being embarrassed is better
than you getting hurt.

205
00:13:39,849 --> 00:13:41,420
Don't get involved with
Soyun's matters anymore.

206
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:54,333
I want you to sleep over
at Sunghee's house tonight.

207
00:13:54,435 --> 00:13:56,135
It's too late for that.

208
00:13:56,234 --> 00:13:57,615
And what do you think you're going to do?

209
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,168
I'm fine.

210
00:14:00,157 --> 00:14:01,758
The two of you should
come to my house for now.

211
00:14:02,397 --> 00:14:03,064
Excuse me?

212
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,388
Who are you?

213
00:14:04,473 --> 00:14:06,012
I'm your friend's
older brother's girlfriend.

214
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,567
We should go before your father sees us.

215
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:08,922
Soyun's Mom!

216
00:14:10,831 --> 00:14:11,917
Soyun.

217
00:14:13,634 --> 00:14:14,854
Soyun's Mom!

218
00:14:16,968 --> 00:14:18,090
Soyun.

219
00:14:22,234 --> 00:14:23,868
There aren't any taxis.

220
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,852
We have a lot of places to go.

221
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:28,859
Really?

222
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,934
Where?

223
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,834
Tell me. I'll take you there.

224
00:14:31,963 --> 00:14:32,730
No.

225
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,108
I just want you to know that
we have many places to go to.

226
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:44,901
Sir. I had an unbelievable
dream earlier.

227
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,901
-In my dream...
-I can't believe the current situation.

228
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,368
Wootak. I have to go to the bathroom.

229
00:14:52,453 --> 00:14:54,436
Yes. We'll go right away.

230
00:14:54,521 --> 00:14:55,568
Please hold it for five minutes.

231
00:14:55,668 --> 00:14:56,433
Five minutes?

232
00:14:56,518 --> 00:14:58,497
No. My sphincter...

233
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:02,501
I can't even hold it for a minute.

234
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,581
Why are you stopping?

235
00:15:15,802 --> 00:15:16,503
Why?

236
00:15:21,857 --> 00:15:23,387
What is it now?

237
00:15:24,634 --> 00:15:25,568
What's wrong?

238
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:30,234
We have to go home,
but there aren't any buses or taxis.

239
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,101
Where are you headed?

240
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,168
I really have to go.

241
00:15:33,253 --> 00:15:34,935
To the bathroom...

242
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,282
We're heading to Sanggu-dong.

243
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:37,101
Please get in.

244
00:15:37,196 --> 00:15:39,238
We're on our way there to patrol.

245
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:42,863
Thank you.

246
00:16:08,394 --> 00:16:09,557
We met each other before, didn't we?

247
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,901
Excuse me?

248
00:16:11,534 --> 00:16:13,773
Don't you remember?
On Valentine's Day.

249
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,109
We almost got into a big accident.

250
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,482
That's right.

251
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:23,215
That's why I thought you looked familiar.

252
00:16:26,734 --> 00:16:28,767
It's not that kind of accident.

253
00:16:28,868 --> 00:16:30,623
We're talking about a car accident.

254
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,070
So, you're a policeman.

255
00:16:34,304 --> 00:16:36,868
It was so chaotic back then, so I didn't
even get a chance to apologize to you.

256
00:16:36,968 --> 00:16:38,936
No. That's okay.

257
00:16:42,033 --> 00:16:46,534
I'm not fine.

258
00:16:56,067 --> 00:17:00,134
I'm sorry for burdening you.

259
00:17:00,868 --> 00:17:03,689
I heard a little bit about your situation.

260
00:17:04,492 --> 00:17:07,159
What are you doing, Soyun?

261
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:09,995
Are there only two rooms?

262
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,516
Yes. Please sleep in the master bedroom.

263
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:13,249
I can sleep in Hongjoo's room.

264
00:17:13,334 --> 00:17:14,101
That's okay.

265
00:17:14,186 --> 00:17:16,222
I think it'd be best for us
to sleep in the living room.

266
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:17,691
That's okay.
It's cold out here.

267
00:17:17,776 --> 00:17:19,802
You don't need to feel bad.
Just sleep in the master bedroom.

268
00:17:19,901 --> 00:17:20,769
It's not because I feel bad.

269
00:17:20,868 --> 00:17:22,836
I'm just used to sleep on the floor.

270
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,300
My mom is used to
sleeping on the sofa also.

271
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,257
Right, Mom?

272
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:26,301
What?

273
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,922
Yes. Of course.

274
00:17:29,145 --> 00:17:31,149
I'm used to sleeping on the sofa.

275
00:17:31,234 --> 00:17:34,401
I'll bring out the electric mat,
so you should sleep on that.

276
00:17:34,501 --> 00:17:35,968
If you sleep without it,
you'll get Bell's palsy.

277
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:37,923
I said I'm used to sleeping on the floor.

278
00:17:38,501 --> 00:17:39,935
Hongjoo. Then we should
at least bring out a heater.

279
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,734
That's okay.

280
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:41,982
I don't need it.

281
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:44,872
I have dry skin, so heater is bad for me.

282
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,901
She's an only daughter,
so she's not very sociable.

283
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,068
I'm sorry.

284
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:51,616
You don't need to be sorry.

285
00:17:51,701 --> 00:17:55,107
My only daughter has dry skin too.
So I know it very well.

286
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,596
It's because I'm embarrassed.
I'm embarrassed.

287
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:21,948
I can't even go around the neighborhood
because I'm embarrassed of Jaechan.

288
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:23,667
Honey. Let's calm down.

289
00:18:23,734 --> 00:18:26,291
Let's calm down and
put down the briquette.

290
00:18:26,376 --> 00:18:27,367
Let's just talk.

291
00:18:27,434 --> 00:18:29,568
Why are you acting so scary?

292
00:18:29,653 --> 00:18:30,602
I'm acting scary?

293
00:18:30,934 --> 00:18:32,539
Are you scared of this?

294
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:35,491
I'm more scared of money.

295
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:40,415
I'm more scared of the 5 million won
he owes after getting ripped off.

296
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,734
5 million won.

297
00:18:42,534 --> 00:18:45,135
To be exact, if we consider
the property damage...

298
00:18:45,234 --> 00:18:46,782
...and compensation
for interfering their business...

299
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:48,749
...it's quite reasonable.

300
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:52,435
The offender has to pay for the damages.

301
00:18:53,478 --> 00:18:54,411
Is that right?

302
00:18:54,496 --> 00:18:56,683
Then should we talk about that?

303
00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:59,149
Our oldest son deceived his parents...

304
00:18:59,234 --> 00:19:00,968
...and took money from us
a bought a motorcycle.

305
00:19:01,067 --> 00:19:03,601
Then he crashed into a store
and threw away more money.

306
00:19:03,701 --> 00:19:06,182
You work your wife to death
because you make such little money.

307
00:19:06,267 --> 00:19:07,934
If you consider all of that...

308
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:09,482
...both of you
should be sentenced to death.

309
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:12,866
Fine. We're all going to die today.

310
00:19:14,538 --> 00:19:16,382
Oh my gosh.
What do we do?

311
00:19:16,467 --> 00:19:17,467
My goodness!

312
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:19,901
-It's hot.
-My gosh!

313
00:19:20,815 --> 00:19:22,102
What are you doing, Mom?

314
00:19:22,187 --> 00:19:23,443
You said we're all going to die.

315
00:19:23,528 --> 00:19:25,302
Are you that worried about the mat?

316
00:19:27,186 --> 00:19:28,022
You get out.

317
00:19:28,763 --> 00:19:31,502
I don't want to look at you.
Just get out!

318
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,872
-Get out!
-Honey!

319
00:19:53,834 --> 00:19:54,901
Seungwon.

320
00:19:55,354 --> 00:19:57,400
Mom told me to say that
these are not from mom.

321
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:00,887
Jaechan. Try to behave yourself.

322
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:02,601
You little...

323
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:10,101
Seungwon.

324
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:19,451
Are you asleep?

325
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:47,246
I'm sorry...

326
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,583
You resented me at the police
station earlier, didn't you?

327
00:20:55,968 --> 00:20:57,556
It's because I'm not good enough.

328
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,659
It's because I'm not good enough.

329
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,262
It's because I have many regrets.

330
00:21:06,601 --> 00:21:08,901
I don't want you to become like me.

331
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:14,773
I want your life to be better than mine.

332
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:18,534
That's why my expectation
of you gets bigger and bigger.

333
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:26,084
I hope that you'll be taller than me.

334
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:33,201
I hope you'll drive your own
car instead of taking the bus.

335
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:42,868
I want you to fly first class on
planes that I've never even been on.

336
00:21:45,334 --> 00:21:50,042
I started out my career as a ninth level,
so I want you to start out higher.

337
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,649
The fact that you had to fabricate
your report card means that...

338
00:21:59,267 --> 00:22:04,189
...I made things that hard for you.

339
00:22:08,968 --> 00:22:10,729
I'm sorry for making things hard for you.

340
00:22:13,868 --> 00:22:15,334
I'm sorry...

341
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:18,570
...for being a bad father.

342
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:26,738
Nam Hongjoo...

343
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:28,434
I am sick of you.

344
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,275
What are you looking for?

345
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,044
Kiss?

346
00:23:32,178 --> 00:23:35,180
And you did it first?

347
00:23:36,434 --> 00:23:37,668
This is not right.

348
00:23:37,767 --> 00:23:40,419
You look too pathetic.

349
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:51,512
I can't eat food made
by anyone else but mom.

350
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:52,968
I'm used to eat homemade food.

351
00:23:53,469 --> 00:23:54,315
Please sit down.

352
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,334
I was already making food,
so I made some extra.

353
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,571
Okay. Thank you.

354
00:24:00,634 --> 00:24:02,368
Mom. Where's the plunger?

355
00:24:02,453 --> 00:24:04,349
The toilet is clogged.

356
00:24:04,434 --> 00:24:08,201
This is not human poop.
It's cow poop.

357
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,220
It's not my poop.

358
00:24:13,738 --> 00:24:16,154
Hey. I'll unclog it later,
so come out.

359
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:17,408
Hurry up.

360
00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:19,919
We're troubling you too much.

361
00:24:20,033 --> 00:24:21,715
No. That's okay.

362
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,867
Just consider that it's my poop...

363
00:24:22,952 --> 00:24:26,465
I mean just consider that this is
your home and be comfortable.

364
00:24:26,586 --> 00:24:27,901
Relax.

365
00:24:33,047 --> 00:24:34,304
Thank you.

366
00:24:37,482 --> 00:24:38,944
Relax.

367
00:24:47,048 --> 00:24:48,649
That's hot.

368
00:25:08,534 --> 00:25:09,499
Hey. Have breakfast before you go.

369
00:25:09,584 --> 00:25:10,867
I don't have any appetite.

370
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:14,346
When did you eat it
because it's delicious?

371
00:25:16,964 --> 00:25:19,349
I'll never become
a prosecutor no matter what.

372
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:20,775
Don't worry.

373
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,488
You'll never be a prosecutor no matter
how hard you try with your grades.

374
00:25:25,033 --> 00:25:27,066
It's delicious.

375
00:25:27,634 --> 00:25:29,227
Are you really not going to eat?
You're going to regret it.

376
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,901
It's really terrible.

377
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:41,506
How about trusting
the prosecutor with this?

378
00:25:44,133 --> 00:25:44,800
That's right.

379
00:25:44,885 --> 00:25:48,569
Just trust him and stay here
comfortably until the case is over.

380
00:25:49,098 --> 00:25:51,383
The case is over.

381
00:25:51,944 --> 00:25:54,133
That prosecutor will not indict him.

382
00:25:54,634 --> 00:25:56,235
I asked him too.

383
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,497
He hasn't reported to his superior...

384
00:25:58,582 --> 00:26:00,118
...so it's not over yet.

385
00:26:00,982 --> 00:26:03,001
So if you can help him...

386
00:26:03,086 --> 00:26:04,867
How is he supposed to help?

387
00:26:05,234 --> 00:26:08,568
Dad's attorney and the idiot prosecutor
are in it together. So, it's over.

388
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,734
Why is the prosecutor an idiot?

389
00:26:10,834 --> 00:26:12,501
Prosecutors are idiots.

390
00:26:12,934 --> 00:26:13,653
They don't indict the offenders...

391
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,335
...if the victims write a letter
saying they won't press charges...

392
00:26:15,434 --> 00:26:16,968
Then don't write the letter saying
that she won't press charges.

393
00:26:17,053 --> 00:26:20,213
If she doesn't write it,
he'll threaten her and beat her.

394
00:26:20,298 --> 00:26:22,467
Tell the prosecutor that
he threatens her and beat her.

395
00:26:22,567 --> 00:26:24,732
I told you that attorney and
idiot prosecutor is in it together.

396
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:25,767
It's useless.

397
00:26:25,868 --> 00:26:28,635
Hey. How can he be in it
with him if he's an idiot?

398
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,134
Look. You admitted that
he's in it with that attorney.

399
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,726
That's not it. Wow.

400
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:35,827
Do you want to make a bet?

401
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,498
If that prosecutor investigates your dad
and puts him in prison, I will...

402
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,569
I will...

403
00:26:46,434 --> 00:26:47,739
Don't try so hard.

404
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:50,776
From what I can tell,
you have nothing to bet.

405
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:53,768
Hey!

406
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,516
That cow poop was yours, wasn't it?

407
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:01,465
So childish.

408
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,096
Right back at you.

409
00:27:03,734 --> 00:27:05,005
That girl...

410
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,823
Hey. You're going to poop
out cow poop again, aren't you?

411
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:12,601
She's difficult because
she's an only child.

412
00:27:12,701 --> 00:27:16,368
I also think that it's better
that I don't have two of her.

413
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:20,839
She doesn't take after me.
She takes after her dad.

414
00:27:24,133 --> 00:27:25,010
How much is it?

415
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:26,444
It's 12,000 won.

416
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,901
Here.

417
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:43,861
What is it?

418
00:27:44,067 --> 00:27:46,258
Did you see me come out
of here in your dream already?

419
00:27:46,343 --> 00:27:47,867
No. I was waiting for you.

420
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,679
Oh? What's wrong with your forehead?

421
00:27:53,826 --> 00:27:55,160
And what's wrong with your hand?

422
00:27:56,757 --> 00:27:58,699
I hurt myself making breakfast.

423
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,834
What is it now?

424
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:24,379
I'm sorry.

425
00:28:43,111 --> 00:28:46,656
If you don't treat burns properly,
it can leave a wound.

426
00:28:48,488 --> 00:28:49,416
Let me see your face.

427
00:28:49,501 --> 00:28:51,480
That's okay.
I'll put it on myself.

428
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,212
What are you doing?

429
00:28:58,655 --> 00:28:59,749
What in the world?

430
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:01,215
You're getting blisters.

431
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,875
You'll have to get admitted
if you make breakfast again.

432
00:29:07,934 --> 00:29:09,868
I said I'll apply it by myself.

433
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,764
Have you spoken to your brother yet?

434
00:29:13,968 --> 00:29:15,048
Don't even bring it up.

435
00:29:15,133 --> 00:29:17,500
He got mad at me saying
that I'm not even a prosecutor.

436
00:29:17,601 --> 00:29:19,495
He has no idea how worried I was of him.

437
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,700
He doesn't that I saved him.

438
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:22,048
There's no recognition.

439
00:29:22,133 --> 00:29:23,431
I know.

440
00:29:23,767 --> 00:29:25,101
Soyun is the same way.

441
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,600
I was worried about her,
so I brought her home.

442
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:31,048
It wouldn't be enough even
if she bowed down to thank me.

443
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:32,961
She keeps lashing out at me just
because her poop is bigger than mine.

444
00:29:36,586 --> 00:29:39,344
There's no benefit to us for helping them.

445
00:29:42,809 --> 00:29:44,610
I saw that you got your hand hurt too.
Show it to me.

446
00:30:02,896 --> 00:30:07,651
I don't know about other people,
but I know that we went through a lot.

447
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:20,962
You really worked hard.

448
00:30:25,434 --> 00:30:26,284
You too.

449
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:19,611
Oh my goodness.

450
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:20,849
What is it?

451
00:31:20,934 --> 00:31:22,174
What are you doing here, Jaechan?

452
00:31:22,734 --> 00:31:24,355
I have something to tell you.

453
00:31:24,834 --> 00:31:25,643
What is it?

454
00:31:26,601 --> 00:31:29,854
I'll try to start my career
higher than level nine.

455
00:31:30,067 --> 00:31:30,734
What?

456
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,726
Did you hear everything?

457
00:31:37,538 --> 00:31:39,464
You brat.
Do you even know what it is?

458
00:31:39,934 --> 00:31:40,718
I don't know.

459
00:31:40,968 --> 00:31:42,058
What is that?

460
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,868
Don't you have contact lenses
instead of glasses?

461
00:31:52,968 --> 00:31:55,007
I do, but it's troublesome.

462
00:31:57,581 --> 00:31:58,382
What is it?

463
00:31:58,534 --> 00:31:59,849
Do I look better without glasses?

464
00:31:59,934 --> 00:32:02,677
I saw that your glasses were fogging up,
so I thought it must be uncomfortable.

465
00:32:02,762 --> 00:32:04,329
I'm not uncomfortable at all.

466
00:32:04,462 --> 00:32:05,716
Why are you uncomfortable about it?

467
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:06,835
Do I look different without my glasses?

468
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,288
Do you notice me again?
Did you fall for me again?

469
00:32:08,696 --> 00:32:10,564
If it's not uncomfortable,
why don't you keep wearing it?

470
00:32:12,362 --> 00:32:14,445
If it's uncomfortable for you,
I'll gladly take it off.

471
00:32:16,348 --> 00:32:18,736
By the way,
how is Park Junmo's case going?

472
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,171
You're going to re-investigate it, right?

473
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,048
How can I re-investigate it
when the case is already over?

474
00:32:24,133 --> 00:32:25,767
You're going to ignore it again?

475
00:32:25,852 --> 00:32:27,249
Even after what you
went through last night?

476
00:32:27,334 --> 00:32:29,174
Even after your younger
brother became a murderer?

477
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,934
It's fine now that I saved my brother.

478
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:35,334
What are you talking about?

479
00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:37,535
You have to find more evidence
and indict Park Junmo.

480
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,001
How can I indict him?

481
00:32:39,086 --> 00:32:40,634
Do you think I can indict him just because
you saw him beating her up in your dream?

482
00:32:40,719 --> 00:32:42,535
How can I ignore the law and
indict him without any evidence?

483
00:32:42,634 --> 00:32:43,368
I have to submit the report today.

484
00:32:43,467 --> 00:32:44,134
You should postpone it.

485
00:32:44,219 --> 00:32:45,655
I can't postpone it any longer.

486
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,335
I have over 300 cases
that I have to clear.

487
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,015
If I insist on investigating
this obviously simple case...

488
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,505
...I'm going to get transferred
to a faraway place.

489
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:55,783
No. I don't have any connections,
so I might get fired too.

490
00:32:55,868 --> 00:32:58,286
You're going to give up just because
you're scared of getting fired?

491
00:32:58,371 --> 00:33:00,627
Yes. I'm scared of getting fired.

492
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,305
My car was totaled
because of that accident.

493
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,289
I have 36 months left in
my installment payment.

494
00:33:05,374 --> 00:33:08,482
If I add the loan interest to that,
my entire monthly salary will disappear.

495
00:33:08,567 --> 00:33:11,389
I'm crying again.

496
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:12,790
Taxi.

497
00:33:15,418 --> 00:33:16,428
Memorize this.

498
00:33:16,888 --> 00:33:20,220
45, 15, 35, 43, 27, 33.

499
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:22,623
What is that?

500
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:24,167
Those are the numbers
for this week's lotto.

501
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,290
I saw it in my dream.

502
00:33:26,613 --> 00:33:30,416
I cannot in all conscience buy
a lotto ticket even if I dreamt about it.

503
00:33:30,501 --> 00:33:31,976
But I'll just tell you.

504
00:33:32,314 --> 00:33:33,981
It's worth 2.8 billion won.

505
00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:36,161
That's ridiculous.

506
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:38,189
You want me to believe what you said?

507
00:33:38,634 --> 00:33:40,035
Believe it and give it a try.

508
00:33:40,491 --> 00:33:41,468
You're saying I should give it a try...

509
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:43,438
...because getting fired wouldn't
matter if I win 2.8 billion won?

510
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:45,594
I'm saying that you should give it
a try thinking that you have insurance.

511
00:33:48,724 --> 00:33:50,085
Do I look like a pathetic fool...

512
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:52,835
...who can't say anything just
because I don't have any money?

513
00:33:53,007 --> 00:33:58,007
Well, it's because you were talking
about your monthly loan payments.

514
00:33:58,092 --> 00:34:00,951
I'm not someone who wouldn't
say something that should be said...

515
00:34:01,036 --> 00:34:02,568
...or not say something I
should say because of money.

516
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:03,808
Taxi.

517
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,297
What is that?

518
00:34:17,554 --> 00:34:20,288
Why is he bluffing so inconsistently?

519
00:34:22,033 --> 00:34:22,961
He's so cool.

520
00:34:48,767 --> 00:34:49,816
What is that on your forehead?

521
00:34:49,901 --> 00:34:50,869
Do you have a pimple?

522
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:53,224
Let's have lunch together.

523
00:34:53,767 --> 00:34:56,127
I'll buy you the sushi
that I promised you.

524
00:34:56,701 --> 00:34:58,714
I'm the prosecutor in
the case you're defending.

525
00:34:58,831 --> 00:35:00,231
You're not the prosecutor now.

526
00:35:00,901 --> 00:35:03,594
You were acting so difficult.
Were you just acting coy?

527
00:35:04,067 --> 00:35:06,508
I saw that you wrapped up
the case by not indicting him.

528
00:35:06,934 --> 00:35:08,139
Who said I wrapped it up?

529
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:10,535
Mr. Choi told me.

530
00:35:10,624 --> 00:35:11,492
I see.

531
00:35:11,577 --> 00:35:13,286
I haven't reported it
to the superior yet.

532
00:35:13,667 --> 00:35:15,449
When I looked through the documents...

533
00:35:15,534 --> 00:35:17,315
...I realized that
I shouldn't just let him go.

534
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,433
Hey!

535
00:35:21,534 --> 00:35:24,601
It's just an assault case and
the victim isn't pressing charges.

536
00:35:26,734 --> 00:35:28,942
Why are you talking nonsense, Jaechan?

537
00:35:32,734 --> 00:35:34,401
That's when it was just assault.

538
00:35:35,234 --> 00:35:38,234
When I looked at his record,
I began to see some suspicious things.

539
00:35:38,434 --> 00:35:40,501
There are some people
that I have to summon also.

540
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:43,301
Suspicious things?

541
00:35:43,954 --> 00:35:45,755
People you have to summon?

542
00:35:48,534 --> 00:35:50,081
There are no such things.

543
00:35:50,901 --> 00:35:53,051
You won't find anything no matter how many
times you look through the documents.

544
00:35:53,701 --> 00:35:57,435
So you should know
who you're bluffing to.

545
00:35:57,901 --> 00:35:58,856
Jaechan.

546
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,534
I know what cards you're holding.

547
00:36:11,434 --> 00:36:12,168
Yoobum.

548
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,073
Do you know what's scarier
than not knowing?

549
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:22,334
Thinking that you know everything.

550
00:36:48,151 --> 00:36:49,888
You must be crazy, Jung Jaechan.

551
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:52,542
What are you planning
to do by bluffing like that?

552
00:36:53,133 --> 00:36:54,342
Jeez!

553
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:59,298
45, 15, 35, 43, 27, 33.

554
00:37:00,634 --> 00:37:03,701
45, 15, 35, 43, 27, 33.

555
00:37:07,627 --> 00:37:09,467
Miss Moon Hyangmi.
Just a moment.

556
00:37:10,925 --> 00:37:12,184
You're taking them to get approval
from Senior Prosecutor, right?

557
00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:14,401
Then do I think I'm going
to recycle them right now?

558
00:37:14,501 --> 00:37:15,526
Just a moment.

559
00:37:16,635 --> 00:37:17,839
What are you doing?

560
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:20,671
I'm going to dig into
Park Junmo's case again.

561
00:37:22,901 --> 00:37:24,040
Here it is.

562
00:37:28,451 --> 00:37:29,682
He's always digging.

563
00:37:29,767 --> 00:37:30,885
He must be a mole.

564
00:37:31,545 --> 00:37:33,212
This is why he can't clear cases quickly.

565
00:37:33,297 --> 00:37:36,783
Working slowly drives you
crazier than being an idiot.

566
00:37:36,868 --> 00:37:38,702
You're going through a lot.

567
00:37:53,015 --> 00:37:55,629
Mr. Choi. Please summon Mr. Park Junmo.

568
00:37:55,714 --> 00:37:58,334
And please set the date for
cross-examination of...

569
00:37:58,434 --> 00:38:00,068
...the doctor from Kiyoung Hospital
and Do Geumseok.

570
00:38:00,167 --> 00:38:02,847
Wasn't that case finished since
we can't issue an indictment?

571
00:38:03,791 --> 00:38:04,973
I brought it back.

572
00:38:06,734 --> 00:38:07,268
And, yes.

573
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:09,850
Please tell the doctor to bring copies
of the medical history when he comes.

574
00:38:09,935 --> 00:38:10,694
Yes.

575
00:38:12,868 --> 00:38:14,459
I'm going to work overnight again.

576
00:38:14,623 --> 00:38:16,725
I love you, Mr. Choi.

577
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:20,149
Why are you calling my office
instead of calling my cell phone?

578
00:38:20,234 --> 00:38:22,249
This makes it seem like our
relationship is only official business.

579
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:24,482
It's because I'm calling
on official business.

580
00:38:24,567 --> 00:38:26,887
Prosecutor Jung would like to summon
Chairman Park Junmo and examine him.

581
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,506
So I wanted to set a date.

582
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,526
Summoning him would be going too far.

583
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:34,835
Why don't we just go through
documentary examination instead?

584
00:38:34,934 --> 00:38:36,902
It doesn't seem like we can do that.

585
00:38:37,345 --> 00:38:40,068
He looks like he's going to
summon him and issue a warrant.

586
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:41,534
He's giving me a headache.

587
00:38:42,006 --> 00:38:43,292
That won't do.

588
00:38:43,948 --> 00:38:47,449
I'll try to talk to him so that
he won't give you a headache.

589
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:48,268
Bye.

590
00:38:48,567 --> 00:38:49,360
Thank you.

591
00:38:51,267 --> 00:38:53,270
Jung Jaechan, that jerk!
He really did it!

592
00:38:57,033 --> 00:38:58,166
Yes, Attorney Lee.

593
00:38:58,481 --> 00:39:01,549
I want you to find out where
Park Junmo's wife and daughter are.

594
00:39:01,634 --> 00:39:02,593
Yes, Sir.

595
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:06,386
I did inform him of the summons,
but I don't think it will be easy.

596
00:39:06,734 --> 00:39:08,149
I didn't think it will be easy.

597
00:39:08,234 --> 00:39:09,328
Yes. I agree.

598
00:39:10,067 --> 00:39:11,754
Prosecutor Jung.

599
00:39:12,197 --> 00:39:13,948
Chief Park is calling for you.

600
00:39:21,975 --> 00:39:25,054
45, 15, 35, 43, 27, 33.

601
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:26,516
45...

602
00:39:26,601 --> 00:39:27,810
Jeez.

603
00:39:29,879 --> 00:39:33,126
45, 15, 35, 43, 27, 33.

604
00:39:38,707 --> 00:39:40,144
Come in, Prosecutor Jung.

605
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:47,610
Thanks to you the average
height of our office went way up.

606
00:39:48,891 --> 00:39:51,061
It will be icing on the cake...

607
00:39:51,146 --> 00:39:53,568
...if you can raise the performance
level of our office.

608
00:39:54,969 --> 00:39:56,090
I'll try my best.

609
00:39:58,990 --> 00:39:59,802
Thanks.

610
00:40:04,247 --> 00:40:08,439
I saw from the reports earlier that
Park Junmo's case was missing.

611
00:40:08,569 --> 00:40:11,115
I heard that it's just an assault and
the victim isn't pressing charges.

612
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,315
It's an obvious case.

613
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,018
Don't you think you're
holding onto it too long?

614
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,267
There are suspicions that
the medical report was fabricated...

615
00:40:16,352 --> 00:40:18,197
...and there may have been habitual abuse.

616
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:22,553
You're not doing that because Attorney
Lee Yoobum is defending that case?

617
00:40:27,797 --> 00:40:28,864
No, Sir.

618
00:40:29,874 --> 00:40:33,927
Then you should report it
and focus on other cases.

619
00:40:34,012 --> 00:40:37,727
Aren't you piling up cases and
lowering our performance rate?

620
00:40:39,634 --> 00:40:41,755
I'm going to dig into a little more.

621
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:44,170
There are more urgent cases.

622
00:40:44,255 --> 00:40:46,601
So why are you so
meticulous about that case?

623
00:40:46,801 --> 00:40:47,834
If you keep working like this...

624
00:40:47,934 --> 00:40:50,535
...it will become a revenge
just like Attorney Lee said.

625
00:40:50,634 --> 00:40:51,682
What's wrong with that?

626
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:52,817
What?

627
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:54,037
Whether it's because of revenge or not...

628
00:40:54,122 --> 00:40:56,315
...is it wrong for a prosecutor
to be meticulous about a case?

629
00:40:56,433 --> 00:40:59,322
Are you playing around with my words?

630
00:40:59,407 --> 00:41:01,525
It doesn't matter if you misunderstand
me and think that it's revenge.

631
00:41:01,968 --> 00:41:03,936
If I don't indict him just because I
choose to avoid that misunderstanding...

632
00:41:04,033 --> 00:41:06,467
...it will come back to us
as a more terrifying case.

633
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:10,268
That's why I'm going to look into
all the previous cases involving him.

634
00:41:10,685 --> 00:41:12,867
Very meticulously.

635
00:41:13,701 --> 00:41:14,801
Hey. You!

636
00:41:18,641 --> 00:41:21,469
Gosh! Chief Park called him "Hey!"

637
00:41:21,822 --> 00:41:22,613
"Hey. You!"

638
00:41:24,751 --> 00:41:29,508
Chief Park wouldn't say
"Hey. You!" that often.

639
00:41:31,734 --> 00:41:36,204
I guess Prosecutor Jung's motto is
to live a short life like fireworks.

640
00:41:36,918 --> 00:41:40,479
He talked back to
Chief Park for every word.

641
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,679
Prosecutor Jung is a hero!

642
00:41:45,764 --> 00:41:48,034
A hero who lives for one day!

643
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,412
I used to get hit when
I acted like that before.

644
00:41:54,925 --> 00:41:57,958
I guess he has to say what he
wants even if he's about to die.

645
00:41:58,231 --> 00:41:59,567
Was he like this in college too?

646
00:42:00,234 --> 00:42:01,284
No.

647
00:42:01,412 --> 00:42:02,946
What does he have
that he's acting so ballsy?

648
00:42:04,427 --> 00:42:05,855
Did he win the lotto or something?

649
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:21,816
How is the ride?

650
00:42:21,901 --> 00:42:23,402
Isn't it artistic?

651
00:42:23,767 --> 00:42:26,266
This has better mileage
among the luxury vehicles...

652
00:42:26,351 --> 00:42:28,915
...so it will run on the smell of gas.

653
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
That's technology.

654
00:42:30,067 --> 00:42:31,434
This is our technology.

655
00:42:31,534 --> 00:42:33,357
Would you take a picture of me driving?

656
00:42:33,442 --> 00:42:34,885
Of course.

657
00:42:37,947 --> 00:42:39,159
It's great.

658
00:42:39,244 --> 00:42:42,001
I'm not sure if it's
because it has red interior...

659
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,834
...but you seem like a young CEO.

660
00:42:44,934 --> 00:42:46,244
Young CEO.

661
00:42:47,133 --> 00:42:49,690
If I buy this car,
what should I buy for my second car?

662
00:42:49,844 --> 00:42:50,828
Second car?

663
00:42:52,601 --> 00:42:53,571
My gosh...

664
00:42:55,434 --> 00:42:56,268
That's right.

665
00:42:56,519 --> 00:42:59,966
People buy separate cars for
business and leisure these days.

666
00:43:00,051 --> 00:43:00,790
Of course.

667
00:43:00,875 --> 00:43:02,834
Buying a second car isn't indulgence.

668
00:43:02,934 --> 00:43:03,448
Just a moment.

669
00:43:03,533 --> 00:43:04,600
Yes.

670
00:43:18,774 --> 00:43:19,797
Where are you going?

671
00:43:20,167 --> 00:43:21,182
None of your business.

672
00:43:21,267 --> 00:43:22,034
Why?

673
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:23,645
I wanted to tell you something.

674
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:28,371
I yelled at my boss that I'm going
to re-investigate Park Junmo.

675
00:43:28,634 --> 00:43:31,020
I'm going to dig into it no
matter what other people say.

676
00:43:31,105 --> 00:43:32,067
Really?

677
00:43:34,057 --> 00:43:37,360
Why did you give me a hard
time if you were going to do this?

678
00:43:37,445 --> 00:43:39,978
Are your words and
actions always different?

679
00:43:40,101 --> 00:43:40,934
Are you always two-faced?

680
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:41,501
No.

681
00:43:41,586 --> 00:43:43,068
If you have to say it,
I'm a man of my words.

682
00:43:43,167 --> 00:43:44,580
I don't think so.

683
00:43:45,501 --> 00:43:46,957
By the way, why are you driving that car?

684
00:43:47,534 --> 00:43:48,926
I'm test driving.

685
00:43:50,798 --> 00:43:52,797
Are you going to buy that car?

686
00:43:53,398 --> 00:43:54,465
Maybe...

687
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:59,759
You're doing this because you believed
my lies about the lotto, are you?

688
00:44:01,192 --> 00:44:03,908
It was a lie?

689
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,011
Did you really believe me?

690
00:44:07,989 --> 00:44:08,757
No.

691
00:44:08,842 --> 00:44:11,156
Are you crazy?
Why would I believe such crazy story?

692
00:44:11,246 --> 00:44:12,077
Right?

693
00:44:12,802 --> 00:44:14,285
Thank goodness...

694
00:44:14,741 --> 00:44:17,021
You didn't yell at your boss because
you believed about the lotto, right?

695
00:44:19,133 --> 00:44:20,100
I told you earlier.

696
00:44:20,185 --> 00:44:21,496
I'm not someone who wouldn't
say something I should say...

697
00:44:21,581 --> 00:44:23,669
...or not say something I should
say because of money.

698
00:44:24,948 --> 00:44:27,247
I know that you're not like that.

699
00:44:29,496 --> 00:44:30,343
Then, excuse me.

700
00:44:36,133 --> 00:44:39,747
When I looked through the documents, I
realized that I shouldn't just let him go.

701
00:44:39,832 --> 00:44:40,626
Hey!

702
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:43,273
That's why I'm going to look into
all the previous cases involving him.

703
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:44,501
Hey. You!

704
00:44:46,973 --> 00:44:48,407
I must've been crazy.

705
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,682
He's going to buy a second car.

706
00:44:52,162 --> 00:44:53,698
He wants full option too.

707
00:44:54,797 --> 00:44:56,401
Honey. Calm down.

708
00:44:56,486 --> 00:44:58,705
Calm down. It's not a big deal.

709
00:44:59,923 --> 00:45:03,516
Honey. We should upgrade our son,
Kisang's phone while we're at it.

710
00:45:03,601 --> 00:45:06,863
Not a used one, but a new one. Yes.

711
00:45:08,033 --> 00:45:09,366
I'll call you again.

712
00:45:10,334 --> 00:45:11,445
#I'm hanging up.

713
00:45:14,434 --> 00:45:18,315
Sir. I thought about it carefully.

714
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:23,433
If you want to buy a second car,
I think it should be an SUV.

715
00:45:23,518 --> 00:45:26,156
So the model I want to recommend is...

716
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:27,470
What do you think?

717
00:45:28,734 --> 00:45:30,901
I'll consider it for now.
I'll consider it.

718
00:45:31,783 --> 00:45:32,562
You're right.

719
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:37,834
I thought it might be too soon
to talk about a second car.

720
00:45:37,934 --> 00:45:39,868
Then when would you
like to buy the main car?

721
00:45:41,434 --> 00:45:43,594
I'm sure I'll buy it someday.

722
00:45:44,334 --> 00:45:45,373
Yes. Someday...

723
00:45:46,878 --> 00:45:48,345
Oh no.

724
00:45:51,667 --> 00:45:53,301
We should go back quickly.
The traffic will be heavy soon.

725
00:45:57,667 --> 00:45:58,416
I knew it.

726
00:45:58,501 --> 00:46:02,369
I knew it when he started to call me
"Heemin" even though I'm his senior.

727
00:46:02,542 --> 00:46:05,864
He was talking back to Chief Park
as if he's ready to leave this field.

728
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,333
Hey. That's why...

729
00:46:10,396 --> 00:46:13,119
I know because I had Park
Junmo's case last year.

730
00:46:13,204 --> 00:46:15,667
You can't solve the case
just because you want to.

731
00:46:15,767 --> 00:46:16,967
Oh my goodness.

732
00:46:18,334 --> 00:46:19,417
What are you doing?

733
00:46:19,502 --> 00:46:21,111
What are you doing down there?

734
00:46:22,601 --> 00:46:24,815
I'm planning to leave this field.

735
00:46:31,325 --> 00:46:32,623
Did you hear everything?

736
00:46:33,501 --> 00:46:34,469
Let's talk informally.

737
00:46:34,567 --> 00:46:36,060
You and I are the only ones here.

738
00:46:37,489 --> 00:46:38,315
I understand.

739
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,326
I mean. Okay.

740
00:46:43,806 --> 00:46:46,282
Did you not indict Park Junmo
last year, too?

741
00:46:46,367 --> 00:46:47,088
Well...

742
00:46:48,267 --> 00:46:49,168
What happened was...

743
00:46:49,267 --> 00:46:51,800
I'm not trying to pick on you.
I'm asking you because I'm curious.

744
00:46:52,467 --> 00:46:55,079
You're right. I didn't indict him.

745
00:46:55,293 --> 00:46:57,169
No, I did.

746
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,734
If you had indicted him, it wouldn't
have happened again this time.

747
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:01,701
Don't you regret it?

748
00:47:02,067 --> 00:47:02,853
I don't.

749
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:05,356
I'm not going to indict him
even if I can do it again.

750
00:47:05,868 --> 00:47:06,435
Why not?

751
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:07,925
You know that saying?

752
00:47:08,667 --> 00:47:10,761
I will become a caring prosecutor
who defend justice...

753
00:47:11,267 --> 00:47:14,398
...and human rights and care for
the weak and marginalized.

754
00:47:14,868 --> 00:47:16,048
That's the prosecutor's oath.

755
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:18,748
But there are times that
defending justice...

756
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:22,172
...and caring for the weak
are in conflict of each other.

757
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,894
Just like Park Junmo's case.

758
00:47:28,565 --> 00:47:30,347
When you indict the husband...

759
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:33,261
...who earns the living for his family
in domestic violence cases...

760
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:36,220
...the rest of the family will
not have the means to live.

761
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:41,602
We all know that Park Junmo's wife isn't
pressing charges because she forgave him.

762
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:46,330
But the reason we're ignoring that
is because we're giving her the choice.

763
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:49,767
Whether to stay within the thorny fence...

764
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:53,837
...or to go out to
the middle of thorny bush.

765
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,365
I don't think that we have
the right to tell her...

766
00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:59,915
...to do this or that when we're
living in the flower bed.

767
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,113
To indict him and put him in prison
without having that right...

768
00:48:04,667 --> 00:48:05,590
...is not...

769
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:07,934
...justice.

770
00:48:09,767 --> 00:48:10,680
We're just being brave foolishly.

771
00:48:22,601 --> 00:48:24,249
Someone who can't distinguish
between the two...

772
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:26,236
...two doesn't have
the right to be a prosecutor.

773
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:38,767
"Prosecutor Jung Jaechan"

774
00:48:38,983 --> 00:48:41,653
"Seoul Hangang District
Public Prosecutor's Office"

775
00:48:55,167 --> 00:48:56,952
Why are you just laughing?
Why aren't you telling me?

776
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:59,253
What's higher than ninth level?

777
00:48:59,338 --> 00:49:02,995
It means that you have
to pass the bar exam.

778
00:49:03,947 --> 00:49:05,342
That's nothing. I'll give it a try.

779
00:49:05,661 --> 00:49:07,924
What can I become if I pass the bar exam?

780
00:49:08,009 --> 00:49:11,882
There are many things.

781
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:13,267
Well...

782
00:49:13,352 --> 00:49:14,481
Welcome.

783
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,636
What is it, Father?

784
00:49:24,721 --> 00:49:26,625
What do you want me to be?

785
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:35,328
Jaechan. Would you bring me
my cell phone from home?

786
00:49:35,413 --> 00:49:36,858
I forgot it.

787
00:49:36,943 --> 00:49:37,804
Okay.

788
00:49:38,953 --> 00:49:39,986
Jaechan.

789
00:49:43,565 --> 00:49:44,822
What about becoming a prosecutor?

790
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:46,316
A prosecutor?

791
00:49:46,735 --> 00:49:51,155
Yes.
I would love it if you be a prosecutor.

792
00:49:52,267 --> 00:49:54,801
I'll try it.

793
00:49:55,221 --> 00:49:56,122
I got it.

794
00:49:56,467 --> 00:49:57,227
All the best!

795
00:51:33,262 --> 00:51:34,140
Father!

796
00:51:37,367 --> 00:51:38,443
Father!

797
00:51:43,086 --> 00:51:44,231
No.

798
00:51:44,637 --> 00:51:45,969
Father!

799
00:51:56,767 --> 00:51:57,981
That's when I knew...

800
00:51:58,701 --> 00:52:00,468
...that my father made his decision.

801
00:52:01,502 --> 00:52:06,269
I'm at the funeral of Inspector Jung
Ilsong and bus driver Nam Chuldoo...

802
00:52:06,354 --> 00:52:10,135
...who died while saving the citizens
from the armed runaway soldier.

803
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:15,966
My father sacrificed himself
to save others and...

804
00:52:16,534 --> 00:52:19,436
...the world called him a hero.

805
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:25,509
But because of the choice
he made my mother lost her husband...

806
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:28,078
...and Seungwon and I lost our father.

807
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:32,716
Rather than being proud
of my father's decision...

808
00:52:32,868 --> 00:52:34,084
...I resented him.

809
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:39,189
My father's decision
was heroic for people...

810
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:42,059
...but it was foolish pride to me.

811
00:52:57,367 --> 00:52:58,208
What is it?

812
00:52:58,434 --> 00:53:00,010
Wow. That's amazing.

813
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:02,412
I was wondering if it would happen.

814
00:53:02,813 --> 00:53:03,547
What are you talking about?

815
00:53:04,882 --> 00:53:06,265
Don't you remember me?

816
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,507
I was almost in a car
accident on Valentine's Day...

817
00:53:09,501 --> 00:53:10,587
Are you alright?

818
00:53:11,868 --> 00:53:12,657
Yes.

819
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,159
Ah, the accident...

820
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:18,811
I should've thanked you sooner.

821
00:53:18,896 --> 00:53:19,930
I'm Han Wootak.

822
00:53:20,751 --> 00:53:22,899
Yes. I'm Jung Jaechan.

823
00:53:23,601 --> 00:53:24,502
You're a prosecutor.

824
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:26,364
Yes. I work here.

825
00:53:27,767 --> 00:53:28,799
Were you hurt?

826
00:53:28,884 --> 00:53:30,923
No. I'm fine thanks to you.

827
00:53:31,008 --> 00:53:33,510
I wanted to treat you after that day
and I finally meet you like this.

828
00:53:34,434 --> 00:53:35,846
How about dinner tonight?

829
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,381
Do you have plans?

830
00:53:39,058 --> 00:53:39,918
No. I don't have plans but...

831
00:53:40,003 --> 00:53:41,031
Then let's go.

832
00:53:41,701 --> 00:53:42,953
I'll treat you to barbeque.

833
00:53:43,067 --> 00:53:44,234
Okay.

834
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,326
I was born in the year of dragon.

835
00:53:49,501 --> 00:53:50,761
We're the same age then.

836
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:52,545
Really?

837
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:54,249
Then should we just speak
informally to each other?

838
00:53:54,334 --> 00:53:55,298
I don't want to.

839
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:00,904
"Hongjoo Samgyeopsal"

840
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:04,550
Hey. You don't need to help.
Just go and study.

841
00:54:04,635 --> 00:54:06,125
I'm not helping you.

842
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:07,359
It's because I'm bored.

843
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:09,235
I can stand being bored.

844
00:54:09,334 --> 00:54:11,801
Why do you have so many
things you just can't stand?

845
00:54:11,939 --> 00:54:13,935
Just like someone else,
you're inside and outside...

846
00:54:14,033 --> 00:54:14,788
...are so different from each other.

847
00:54:14,873 --> 00:54:17,268
You act like you're strong,
but you're actually weak.

848
00:54:17,353 --> 00:54:20,202
You seem kind, but you say mean things.

849
00:54:22,234 --> 00:54:24,562
Lady. She plays piano.

850
00:54:24,647 --> 00:54:26,830
You can't let her use hurt her hands.

851
00:54:32,801 --> 00:54:33,435
Lady?

852
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,400
Who are you talking to?

853
00:54:34,485 --> 00:54:35,205
Where is she?

854
00:54:38,133 --> 00:54:39,404
This is such a coincidence.

855
00:54:39,667 --> 00:54:40,693
We see each other like this again.

856
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:41,674
I know, right.

857
00:54:43,077 --> 00:54:45,782
I took her all the way home
in my police car recently.

858
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:48,952
I was craving pork belly, so I was
trying to find a place and we came here.

859
00:54:49,037 --> 00:54:51,288
This is such a coincidence.

860
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:54,091
I regretted not asking you for your name.

861
00:54:55,267 --> 00:54:56,293
What's your name?

862
00:54:57,594 --> 00:54:58,963
I'm Nam Hongjoo.

863
00:54:59,048 --> 00:54:59,890
I'm Han Wootak.

864
00:54:59,975 --> 00:55:00,917
I was born in the year of dragon in 1988.

865
00:55:01,002 --> 00:55:03,048
I was born in
the year of dragon in 1988 also.

866
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,818
Then should we just speak
to each other informally?

867
00:55:04,903 --> 00:55:05,701
Fine.

868
00:55:05,801 --> 00:55:08,772
Yes. People who are same age
should speak to each other informally.

869
00:55:10,074 --> 00:55:12,871
Wait a minute. Now that I think
about it, there are three dragons here.

870
00:55:12,956 --> 00:55:15,033
We're like the three flying dragons.

871
00:55:15,133 --> 00:55:16,847
What?
Three flying dragons?

872
00:55:17,311 --> 00:55:18,900
He's so funny.

873
00:55:20,634 --> 00:55:23,987
By the way, you look so
much better without glasses.

874
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:25,922
Do I really?

875
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,333
Gosh.

876
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:36,533
I found out where Park Junmo's
wife and daughter are at.

877
00:55:38,602 --> 00:55:39,436
Where are they?

878
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:50,514
I clearly told you not to get
involved with Soyun, didn't I?

879
00:55:50,676 --> 00:55:51,602
Why are you here?

880
00:55:51,701 --> 00:55:52,948
And why are you wearing that apron?

881
00:55:54,722 --> 00:55:56,356
That's what I want to ask you.

882
00:55:58,115 --> 00:55:59,607
That brat.

883
00:56:00,045 --> 00:56:02,759
I thought the two of you
are affectionate brothers...

884
00:56:03,592 --> 00:56:04,615
...but you guys are just normal.

885
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,435
Did you know that we're brothers too?

886
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:10,357
This is not coincidence is it?

887
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:12,553
How we met earlier and
coming to this restaurant also...

888
00:56:12,638 --> 00:56:14,334
I'm curious about that also.

889
00:56:14,724 --> 00:56:16,139
Is this a coincidence...

890
00:56:17,797 --> 00:56:19,176
...or is this fate?

891
00:56:19,288 --> 00:56:21,166
Jeez. What do you think you're doing?

892
00:56:21,901 --> 00:56:24,047
I don't sense anything.
I don't feel anything either.

893
00:56:25,601 --> 00:56:26,583
Is this not fate?

894
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:30,270
Where are you going?

895
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:31,655
I'm going to the bathroom.

896
00:56:35,557 --> 00:56:37,194
Is it going to happen just like my dream?

897
00:56:37,868 --> 00:56:38,962
If it's like my dream...

898
00:56:39,736 --> 00:56:43,533
My partner and I were going to a pork
belly place and ran into Jung Jaechan.

899
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:47,137
In my dream, we just greeted each
other and went our separate ways.

900
00:56:47,538 --> 00:56:49,472
Then my partner and came here.

901
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:52,709
It's just like my dream.

902
00:56:53,167 --> 00:56:55,011
The customers are wearing
the same clothes...

903
00:56:55,534 --> 00:56:58,215
...and ordered the same thing
as in my dream.

904
00:56:59,767 --> 00:57:03,153
The only thing I changed
was a trivial thing.

905
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:08,758
I brought that person here
instead of my partner.

906
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:15,510
Stop joking around and tell me the truth.

907
00:57:15,603 --> 00:57:16,814
Is this all a coincidence?

908
00:57:16,899 --> 00:57:19,202
Or did you plan something
by bringing me here?

909
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,634
Answer me without saying this is fate.

910
00:57:21,719 --> 00:57:22,828
Just a moment.

911
00:57:23,185 --> 00:57:25,599
Take two orders of kimchi stew
to table three.

912
00:57:25,834 --> 00:57:27,010
Okay.

913
00:57:29,534 --> 00:57:30,847
If it happens like my dream...

914
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,450
...in five seconds that man will
walk in through the door.

915
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:43,460
Five, four, three, two, one.

916
00:57:45,434 --> 00:57:46,834
Hello.

917
00:57:57,399 --> 00:57:59,109
What are you doing here?

918
00:57:59,634 --> 00:58:01,602
Wow. It was true.

919
00:58:02,334 --> 00:58:04,047
It's the same as my dream.

920
00:58:05,087 --> 00:58:06,983
I didn't come here to see
you today, Nam Hongjoo.

921
00:58:10,434 --> 00:58:13,657
I came see the two of you
as Park Junmo's attorney.

922
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:24,501
With this much I believe that
this isn't a coincidence but fate.

923
00:58:25,802 --> 00:58:27,037
You know him, don't you?

924
00:58:30,534 --> 00:58:31,608
I'm curious.

925
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:34,344
The trivial decision I changed...

926
00:58:35,767 --> 00:58:37,047
...will that one decision stop...

927
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:40,383
...the horrible moment
that will take place...

928
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:43,053
...very soon?

You'll lose your
daughter's talent and future.

934
00:59:31,934 --> 00:59:32,835
I'll go see the prosecutor.

Mom.

936
00:59:33,564 --> 00:59:35,204
I'll sob and beg.

00:59:35,289 --> 00:59:37,373
Please don't beg.

938
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:39,083
I couldn't sleep more than five hours...

939
00:59:39,168 --> 00:59:41,124
...for the past four days
because of Park Junmo's case.

940
00:59:41,209 --> 00:59:42,296
I used to be a prosecutor.

Other lawyers can't even open up
their mouths at the prosecutor's office...

I have someone who
cheers me on like you, Father.
