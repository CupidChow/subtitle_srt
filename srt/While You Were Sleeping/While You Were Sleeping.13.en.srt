1
00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:00,634
"While You Were Sleeping"

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,200
"Episode 13"

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,234
That moment was like a gift.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,167
To the point of being thankful...

5
00:00:18,267 --> 00:00:20,701
...for all the choices I made that
brought me to this moment.

6
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:26,768
All the seemingly foolish decisions
were wise ones in the end.

7
00:00:27,567 --> 00:00:32,501
And all the seemingly regretful decisions
were right in the end, too.

8
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:38,534
Everything was exciting and beautiful.

9
00:00:44,534 --> 00:00:47,734
I was relieved about everything.

10
00:00:50,868 --> 00:00:52,302
Except for one thing...

11
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:55,068
I wonder if he's okay...

12
00:00:57,133 --> 00:00:59,067
That day at the reservoir...

13
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:02,901
That policeman who tried to kill himself.

14
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:06,334
I think about him from time to time.

15
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:07,634
I worry about him too.

16
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:10,634
Don't worry. He's doing well.

17
00:01:11,734 --> 00:01:13,335
Really? How do you know?

18
00:01:13,734 --> 00:01:14,734
Where does he live?

19
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:19,801
That man sent us money again.

20
00:01:24,767 --> 00:01:28,934
I don't know where he lives
or what his name is.

21
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:31,901
But I'm certain he's alive.

22
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,467
So, you don't have to worry about him.

23
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:41,701
I'm so glad to hear that.

24
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:43,900
That's great.
It's fine as long as he's alive.

25
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:51,701
Even if life deceives you...

26
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:55,767
...don't be sad or get angry.

27
00:01:56,434 --> 00:01:59,801
"Heart lives in the future,
but the present is sad."

28
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:03,935
"Everything is but a moment
and it will pass."

29
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:08,101
"And what has passed will
be important later on."

30
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,701
"13 years ago"

31
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:10,968
That's great.

32
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,867
Oh my gosh. You surprised me.

33
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:16,235
Sir.

34
00:02:16,968 --> 00:02:18,068
I'm hungry.

35
00:02:18,701 --> 00:02:19,768
I want to eat something.

36
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:22,300
Okay. I'll bring you
something to eat right away.

37
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:29,333
You're not thinking about
doing something, are you?

38
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,934
I'm not going anywhere.

39
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:33,135
I won't do something foolish either.

40
00:02:36,567 --> 00:02:40,401
My life can't end right now.

41
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:46,367
There's someone...

42
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:49,800
...I must meet in the distant future.

43
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:57,434
Will we be able to recognize
him if we see each him again?

44
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,168
We didn't recognize him either.

45
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:03,168
Don't you think he
won't recognize us either?

46
00:03:04,868 --> 00:03:05,901
I know, right?

47
00:03:06,801 --> 00:03:09,368
We might have met him already,
but might not have recognized him.

48
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:12,368
Why?

49
00:03:12,634 --> 00:03:13,667
Do you want to see him again?

50
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:15,868
Yes. What about you?

51
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:18,202
Me too.

52
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:22,235
But do you think he wants to meet us too?

53
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:24,167
I'm not sure...

54
00:03:41,634 --> 00:03:43,602
When we met him again much later...

55
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:48,035
...he told us that he wanted
to meet us more often...

56
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,300
...and more desperately than us.

57
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:58,268
He spent many years in order to meet us...

58
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:02,501
...but we didn't recognize
him for a long time.

59
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:29,834
And trivial cases that were
scattered like small waves...

60
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,400
...began to slowly come together
and approach us...

61
00:04:38,434 --> 00:04:40,101
And it turned into a huge wave...

62
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:50,302
And it started to guide us toward him.

63
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:09,266
"We're coming to
see you right now"

64
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:16,901
Aren't you going to hold
a funeral for your father?

65
00:05:17,968 --> 00:05:19,502
No one would come anyway.

66
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:23,501
What are you wearing?

67
00:05:26,601 --> 00:05:29,235
I don't have any black clothes,
so I just borrowed my older brother's.

68
00:05:29,534 --> 00:05:31,829
My older brother's
limbs are uselessly long.

69
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:33,567
I know.

70
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,100
He does have uselessly long limbs.

71
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:38,968
Have you seen my older brother before?

72
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:41,401
I went to one of his trial before.

73
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:42,435
Really?

74
00:05:43,434 --> 00:05:44,135
Yes.

75
00:05:45,334 --> 00:05:47,135
He was saying something about
the justice of the courtroom...

76
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,134
...and destroyed his opposing attorney.

77
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:52,667
It felt so great.
I was grateful to him too.

78
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:56,601
You were grateful?
What were you grateful for?

79
00:06:00,267 --> 00:06:04,300
His opposing attorney was
the one who did this to my father.

80
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:07,202
Who was it?

81
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:11,356
Prosecutor Lee Yoobum.

82
00:06:12,634 --> 00:06:13,335
No.

83
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:16,035
Now he's Attorney Lee Yoobum.

84
00:06:35,701 --> 00:06:37,968
Do you think you're going to get
more money if you insert it again?

85
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:40,108
-You're here.
-Attorney Lee.

86
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,268
Today is clearly payday,
so what's wrong with my balance?

87
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:47,202
Salary comes in slowly,
but expenses go out much faster.

88
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:48,235
I know.

89
00:06:48,334 --> 00:06:50,268
Both of you should work for my law firm.

90
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:55,001
I'll make sure that you're paid on time.

91
00:06:55,267 --> 00:06:56,001
Really?

92
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,968
I'll negotiate the pay so that
you get what you want also.

93
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:01,100
I'll guarantee your retirement age and
let you get off work on time every day.

94
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,368
I love it. I totally want to.

95
00:07:04,434 --> 00:07:05,534
What do you think, Mr. Choi?

96
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:10,767
I already told you last
time that I'm not interested.

97
00:07:11,634 --> 00:07:14,235
I'm interested. I'm totally interested.

98
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,834
There's a condition for you.

99
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:18,734
You have to convince Mr. Choi
and work for us together.

100
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:22,533
I'll be waiting for you, Mr. Choi.

101
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:29,001
What kind of scout condition is that?

102
00:07:29,086 --> 00:07:30,416
Am I a plus one, to you, Mr. Choi?

103
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:32,434
Am I a consolation prize?
One plus one?

104
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:33,502
Hyangmi.

105
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:37,940
You have to keep what Attorney Lee said
earlier a secret from Prosecutor Jung.

106
00:07:38,033 --> 00:07:39,333
Don't tell anyone.

107
00:07:39,434 --> 00:07:43,240
I'm so disappointed.
Do you think I have a big mouth?

108
00:07:43,534 --> 00:07:45,135
Don't you know me at all, Mr. Choi?

109
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,600
Yoobum is scouting Mr. Choi?

110
00:07:51,767 --> 00:07:52,301
Yes.

111
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:54,500
He said he'll negotiate
whatever salary we want.

112
00:07:54,601 --> 00:07:56,835
He was trying to entice us.
It was no joke.

113
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:59,701
Mr. Choi works for
the sense of mission.

114
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:00,934
He wouldn't be tempted
by things like that.

115
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:03,200
Of course he would.

116
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,533
He said he'll guarantee retirement age.

117
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:06,602
He'll give us south facing office.

118
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:08,302
He'll give us the law firm credit card.

119
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,234
A person with the right mind
would resign right away.

120
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,767
But Mr. Choi would like to work
with me more than Yoobum...

121
00:08:14,868 --> 00:08:17,535
No, he doesn't.
You're frustrating and slow.

122
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:19,435
You always dig into cases.

123
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:22,358
You make him work late
and go out on the field.

124
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:25,101
I feel like I could cry
thinking about Mr. Choi.

125
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,357
So, what do you want me to do?
Why are you telling me that?

126
00:08:28,434 --> 00:08:30,349
Be nice to him while he's here.

127
00:08:30,434 --> 00:08:33,035
You should flatter him
and act cute to him.

128
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,467
You should give him some gifts too.

129
00:08:34,534 --> 00:08:35,768
Forget it.

130
00:08:35,868 --> 00:08:37,968
If he's only going to stay
if I have to force him to stay...

131
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:39,801
...I don't want him.

132
00:08:40,601 --> 00:08:41,302
I'm leaving.

133
00:08:43,868 --> 00:08:44,836
It's not working.

134
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,634
It's an empty box...

135
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,367
Thank you.

136
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:08,034
I heard about everything from Hyangmi.

137
00:09:08,434 --> 00:09:10,302
Yoobum scouted you, didn't he?

138
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,934
Hyangmi, you couldn't keep it a secret...

139
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,656
Why are you telling him that right away?

140
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:18,167
If he's offering you better conditions,
I think that you should work for him.

141
00:09:21,434 --> 00:09:22,402
Just a moment.

142
00:09:25,634 --> 00:09:27,502
That's okay.
I'll tie my shoelaces.

143
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,468
-I'll...
-Please stay still.

144
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,968
I have no intention
of forcing you to stay.

145
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:37,367
And I can't lie and tell you
that I'm going to do better.

146
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:44,168
You're the one who is making the decision.

147
00:09:44,901 --> 00:09:47,568
I won't resent you even if you leave.

148
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:52,001
Peace.

149
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:05,435
Don't worry about me. Don't feel guilty.

150
00:10:05,601 --> 00:10:06,935
Take your time and make your decision.

151
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,601
"With my mentor"

152
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:23,402
"Prosecutor Jung Jaechan"

153
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:26,315
Let's quickly come up with
ideas for the three-day experience.

154
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:31,867
I want something fresh, not like "fishing
in the ocean" or "visiting winery"...

155
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,334
What do you think about three-day
experience of being pregnant?

156
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,834
Actually, this suit is made
to look like one is 8 months pregnant.

157
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,300
I can wear this for three days and
will be changing my shoes...

158
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,634
...and take the subway and experience
the life of a pregnant woman.

159
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:49,001
I should consider what the society
should consider for pregnant women.

160
00:10:49,067 --> 00:10:50,534
Okay. We'll keep that for now.

161
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:51,335
What else?

162
00:10:51,434 --> 00:10:53,768
What do you think about three-day
experience at the Prosecution Office?

163
00:10:53,868 --> 00:10:57,302
We don't have many opportunities
to see the life of prosecutors.

164
00:10:58,267 --> 00:10:59,901
That's a good idea, but it won't work.

165
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,501
We'll never be allowed to do it.

166
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:03,535
They'll say things
like secret investigation...

167
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:06,701
...and the victim's rights and
not allow us to film them.

168
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:07,934
I think they'll allow us.

169
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,416
The Han River District Prosecutor
is media friendly.

170
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:12,435
I met him recently...

171
00:11:12,534 --> 00:11:15,549
...and explained the purpose of it
and he was quite positive about it.

172
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:17,535
You should've told me about that.

173
00:11:17,601 --> 00:11:18,935
Let's keep this too.

174
00:11:19,434 --> 00:11:21,901
But Mr. Bong, don't you think
it would be more meaningful...

175
00:11:21,968 --> 00:11:24,915
...if a man experiences being
pregnant than a woman?

176
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,801
That's right.

177
00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:27,934
It would be more meaningful for
men to wear it...

178
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:29,200
...since they don't know
what it feels like.

179
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,734
Well, okay. Alright, then.

180
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:33,234
Nam Hongjoo will do
the Prosecutor's Office experience...

181
00:11:33,334 --> 00:11:35,501
...and Bong Doohyun will
do the pregnancy experiences.

182
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:36,734
-It's been decided.
-Yes.

183
00:11:36,834 --> 00:11:37,635
What?

184
00:11:38,501 --> 00:11:39,435
Why do I have to do it?

185
00:11:39,534 --> 00:11:41,083
There are so many guys who can do it.

186
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,934
You said it yourself just now.

187
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:44,386
You said a man has to do
it to have more meaning.

188
00:11:44,467 --> 00:11:47,201
Who knows most about this shoot?
You do it.

189
00:11:48,234 --> 00:11:49,401
Ah, Captain!

190
00:11:54,901 --> 00:11:56,339
You look wonderful, Mr. Bong.

191
00:11:56,601 --> 00:11:58,535
Mr. Bong. You are my role model.

192
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:00,668
That's too bad.

193
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,467
I guess I'm going to lose out on
the reporter award because of you again.

194
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:05,901
What do I do?

195
00:12:05,968 --> 00:12:08,469
I think it would be so difficult to
do the Prosecutor Office experience.

196
00:12:09,067 --> 00:12:10,901
You brat! The Prosecutor's Office is...

197
00:12:11,467 --> 00:12:13,588
Being pregnant is 100 times harder.

198
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:18,349
Our Bong Doohyun really knows
difficulties of a pregnant woman.

199
00:12:18,434 --> 00:12:20,149
I'm going to look forward to your report.

200
00:12:20,234 --> 00:12:21,367
Please give him a hand.

201
00:12:21,434 --> 00:12:22,834
All the best!

202
00:12:23,601 --> 00:12:26,601
God bless you.

203
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:28,601
They must be crazy together.

204
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:40,434
Mr. Choi.

205
00:12:40,534 --> 00:12:42,834
Can you please not work for Yoobum?

206
00:12:42,901 --> 00:12:48,135
"Can't you please not work for Yoobum?"

207
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,301
It looks complicated
since its double negative.

208
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:54,400
Please don't go.

209
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:56,001
"Please don't go to Yoobum"

210
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,801
Do I look cheeky?

211
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,663
Don't go...

212
00:13:01,067 --> 00:13:03,568
Don't go... Please...

213
00:13:05,234 --> 00:13:05,935
Jaechan.

214
00:13:06,434 --> 00:13:07,268
What is it?

215
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,700
Mr. Choi. Don't go to Yoobum.

216
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:17,200
Oh no... I accidentally sent it
because of you.

217
00:13:17,334 --> 00:13:18,701
What's wrong!

218
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:21,333
I texted him in a casual way.
What do I do?

219
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:23,235
What did he say?

220
00:13:25,467 --> 00:13:27,034
I'm not leaving.

221
00:13:27,701 --> 00:13:29,101
He's not going to leave.

222
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,400
He said he's not going to leave.

223
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,200
I love you, Mr. Choi.

224
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:42,567
What is it? What's wrong?

225
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,601
What does Daegoo see in
you to have given this to you?

226
00:13:53,868 --> 00:13:54,769
What is this?

227
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,300
I have a friend called Myung Daegoo.

228
00:13:58,734 --> 00:14:00,501
He wanted you to take a look at this.

229
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:02,067
Myung Daegoo?

230
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:03,901
This seems like a will.

231
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,667
Yes.

232
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:07,601
You know that IV serial killer
who killed himself in prison recently?

233
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:08,800
It's that guy's will.

234
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:11,133
How do you have this?

235
00:14:11,234 --> 00:14:13,001
He's Daegoo's father.

236
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:15,834
Daegoo wanted you to read it.

237
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:17,268
Me? Why?

238
00:14:17,501 --> 00:14:19,816
He thinks that his father died unjustly.

239
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,502
He wants to you find him justice.

240
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:24,115
Hey. What prisoner would feel
he's been treated fairly?

241
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,300
All of them would think it's unfair.

242
00:14:25,901 --> 00:14:27,602
You should still read it.

243
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:30,168
I thought it was
suspicious after I read it.

244
00:14:30,701 --> 00:14:32,101
And what's more suspicious...

245
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,001
...is that the prosecutor for
the case was Yoobum.

246
00:14:40,934 --> 00:14:42,635
Yoobum was awarded
the Prosecutor's Presidential Award...

247
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:44,402
...for this case.

248
00:14:52,334 --> 00:14:53,434
"My son, I hope you will
understand the choice I made"

249
00:14:53,534 --> 00:14:55,335
"Sincerely, Myung Yiseok."

250
00:14:56,334 --> 00:14:57,467
I received
the Prosecutor's President Award...

251
00:14:57,567 --> 00:15:01,567
...for the Hanbat
and IV serial murder case.

252
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,634
I just put my spoon on the table
that Mr. Choi set up...

253
00:15:05,701 --> 00:15:06,868
...and I even received an award for it.

254
00:15:06,968 --> 00:15:08,235
Not at all.

255
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:36,968
Should we get him now?

256
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:38,235
Later.

257
00:15:38,467 --> 00:15:40,567
Let's get him when he makes
contact with the stolen goods.

258
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:23,501
"Please give me back my cell phone.
I'll compensate you for it."

259
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:29,367
"I'll pay you 5 million won and
will not report you no matter what."

260
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:35,567
"I'll pay you 10 million won. I'll see you
tomorrow at 1 PM at Chungil underpass."

261
00:16:38,634 --> 00:16:39,701
10 million won.

262
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,101
What's in here that he's
offering 10 million won?

263
00:17:04,868 --> 00:17:05,802
That's right.

264
00:17:12,634 --> 00:17:13,468
Jaechan.

265
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,333
That policeman might dream about us?

266
00:17:43,801 --> 00:17:44,502
Yes.

267
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:47,634
I talked to Wootak about
how this dream started before.

268
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:49,368
But if that rule applies...

269
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:51,034
...that policeman should dream about us.

270
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,534
Rule? What rule?

271
00:17:52,634 --> 00:17:54,901
The person who saved me
from the crucial moment of dying.

272
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,587
We dream about that person.

273
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,660
I usually dream about Jaechan.

274
00:17:58,734 --> 00:18:00,668
Jaechan often dreams about Hongjoo.

275
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,967
Is that true?

276
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:04,334
I thought it was impossible too.

277
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:06,268
Because I had no idea
that you were Chestnut.

278
00:18:06,434 --> 00:18:08,135
But it made sense when
I realized that you're Chestnut.

279
00:18:08,234 --> 00:18:10,901
You saved me at
the reservoir 13 years ago.

280
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,801
I saved Wootak from the car accident.

281
00:18:12,868 --> 00:18:14,268
I got it.

282
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:15,701
That does make sense.

283
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:18,534
But why do we have those dreams?

284
00:18:18,634 --> 00:18:20,901
I had this feeling when
I was saved from almost dying.

285
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:23,234
I really was saved from almost dying.

286
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,600
I really want to repay
the person who saved me.

287
00:18:26,934 --> 00:18:29,401
The dreams started
because of that thought.

288
00:18:31,734 --> 00:18:34,301
The dream that allows us to see
the future of the one who saved us.

289
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:39,635
What do you think?
Don't you think it makes sense?

290
00:18:43,934 --> 00:18:44,835
Yes, it does.

291
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,901
Then since we saved that
policeman from the reservoir...

292
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:56,934
...he should be able to see our future
in his dreams if that rule applies.

293
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,868
"Bodies on the mattress.
Jung Jaechan and Nam Hongjoo died."

294
00:18:58,934 --> 00:18:59,802
That's right.

295
00:18:59,901 --> 00:19:01,668
Then he should know what
the two of you look like also.

296
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:02,834
He should know where you live too.

297
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:03,701
Well.

298
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:06,401
Maybe.

299
00:19:06,501 --> 00:19:07,235
No way.

300
00:19:07,834 --> 00:19:09,482
No matter how much I think about it,
it doesn't make any sense.

301
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:11,849
If that rule applies,
he should've come to see us by now.

302
00:19:11,934 --> 00:19:13,067
Do you think he'd want to see you?

303
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:15,035
It's not like he's connected
to you in a pleasant way...

304
00:19:15,267 --> 00:19:17,300
It will just hurt your feelings
if you see each other.

305
00:19:17,434 --> 00:19:18,268
Do you think so?

306
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:28,535
Yes.

307
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,034
What is it?

308
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:34,200
No. It's nothing.

309
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:35,701
That's right.

310
00:19:35,834 --> 00:19:38,601
I'm going to the Prosecutor's Office
to cover a story for three days.

311
00:19:38,701 --> 00:19:40,402
Why? Us?

312
00:19:40,534 --> 00:19:41,634
For three days?

313
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:44,001
Ah, that must be it.
The reporter's three-day experience.

314
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,001
That's a lot of fun.

315
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,334
Then you're going to see
how Prosecutor Jung does his work?

316
00:19:51,801 --> 00:19:52,769
You!

317
00:19:53,467 --> 00:19:54,767
It's because of you!

318
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:56,301
My gosh.

319
00:19:56,367 --> 00:19:57,459
Are you a secret agent?

320
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:00,200
Are you okay?

321
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,201
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

322
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:03,367
Is he a gopher of our office or something?

323
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:04,992
I completely forgot.

324
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:07,534
That's why no one is welcoming him back.

325
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,567
I think I'll be sticking by you
like gum for three whole days.

326
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:13,429
Me?

327
00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:16,068
Your boss recommended
the most talented...

328
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:18,200
...and handsome prosecutor in his office.

329
00:20:18,334 --> 00:20:20,115
If he said the prosecutor
is talented and handsome...

330
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,233
...it must be Jaechan.

331
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:27,901
Will it really be me?

332
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,201
It's nice to meet you.
I'm prosecutor Shin Heemin.

333
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:32,734
We met before, right?

334
00:20:32,801 --> 00:20:35,135
I'm Nam Hongjoo from SBC.
Thank you for doing this.

335
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:39,335
Miss Shin. I'd like for you
to cooperate with Reporter Nam...

336
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,549
...so that she can capture
the sincere image of a prosecutor.

337
00:20:41,634 --> 00:20:43,301
Yes. Please don't worry.

338
00:20:44,334 --> 00:20:45,401
Please follow me.

339
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,301
Work hard.

340
00:20:51,634 --> 00:20:52,602
My gosh.

341
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:57,001
My goodness.

342
00:20:58,434 --> 00:21:01,901
She's close to Jaechan.
You should've let Jaechan do it.

343
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,945
Why did you choose Miss Shin?

344
00:21:03,033 --> 00:21:04,200
I know, right.

345
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,967
You must be all talk when
it comes to caring for Mr. Jung.

346
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,167
Mr. Jung, you must be disappointed.

347
00:21:11,367 --> 00:21:12,201
No. I'm fine.

348
00:21:12,267 --> 00:21:14,968
My goodness. You have no idea
what you're talking about.

349
00:21:15,367 --> 00:21:17,968
I didn't let him do it
because I care about him.

350
00:21:18,501 --> 00:21:20,068
Things are going well for them
right now...

351
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:22,135
...but just think what will happen
if she watches him for three days.

352
00:21:22,334 --> 00:21:24,901
She'll be disenchanted
and be disappointed in him.

353
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:28,200
Why would she be disenchanted?
What's wrong with Jaechan?

354
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,001
Who has the most
uncleared cases in our office?

355
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,015
Mr. Jung.

356
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,034
Who makes the most
spelling errors on case logs?

357
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:34,977
Mr. Jung.

358
00:21:35,067 --> 00:21:38,215
Other people submit reports
of simple theft in a week...

359
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,333
...but who holds onto it for a month?

360
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:42,967
It's Mr. Jung.

361
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:45,282
Then, will she be disenchanted or not?

362
00:21:45,367 --> 00:21:46,667
She'll be disenchanted.

363
00:21:47,601 --> 00:21:49,868
Are you thankful to me or not?

364
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:51,535
Thank you.

365
00:21:52,801 --> 00:21:55,702
Mr. Jung, let's try harder.

366
00:21:57,033 --> 00:21:57,800
Yes.

367
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:05,567
"Prosecutor Shin Heemin"

368
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:49,182
You fraudulently sold
balloon flower powder...

369
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,801
...to stage four cancer patients
as an all-cure medicine, didn't you?

370
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,100
What? Balloon flower?

371
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,268
I don't speak Korean that well.

372
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:02,168
Is there anybody
who speaks English around here?

373
00:23:04,434 --> 00:23:08,201
I'm a very nice person.

374
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:09,501
I'm nice.

375
00:23:09,634 --> 00:23:13,268
How dare you call yourself a good person?

376
00:23:14,334 --> 00:23:17,467
When all you've done
is take advantage of other people.

377
00:23:17,934 --> 00:23:20,201
I know you speak Korean
better than your English.

378
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,734
So, stop trying...

379
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:24,402
...and speak Korean.

380
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:29,767
Miss. Prosecutor.

381
00:23:30,467 --> 00:23:31,368
I...

382
00:23:31,968 --> 00:23:35,635
I sold it out of the goodness of my heart.

383
00:23:35,734 --> 00:23:37,734
Goodness of your heart can't be the
reason for you breaking the law.

384
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:40,401
I really didn't know
that would be a crime.

385
00:23:40,467 --> 00:23:44,201
If I knew that,
I'll gladly receive the punishment.

386
00:23:44,267 --> 00:23:48,068
If you gladly receive the punishment,
it wouldn't be a punishment.

387
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:51,668
I want you to suffer
through your punishment.

388
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:56,468
Amazing.

389
00:23:56,968 --> 00:24:00,268
You should be glad that
Miss Shin is a woman.

390
00:24:00,534 --> 00:24:02,768
If she was a man,
she would've fallen for her.

391
00:24:03,534 --> 00:24:04,634
You're right.

392
00:24:05,868 --> 00:24:07,535
You brat. Cheer up.

393
00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:09,635
I'll let you borrow my
red whenever you need it.

394
00:24:09,701 --> 00:24:10,368
Really?

395
00:24:10,434 --> 00:24:11,168
Yes.

396
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:13,568
Thank you, Sir.

397
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:14,800
You really are the only
one who is nice to me.

398
00:24:14,901 --> 00:24:17,835
If you're thankful to me,
I want you to take my night shift for me.

399
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,950
I will do that.

400
00:24:21,033 --> 00:24:22,233
Are you meeting someone tonight?

401
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,367
Yes.

402
00:24:23,434 --> 00:24:24,235
Who is it?

403
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:29,435
Who is it?

404
00:24:38,834 --> 00:24:41,934
I can go on a date today.

405
00:24:55,634 --> 00:24:58,034
Your timing is great.
Please come in and eat.

406
00:24:58,133 --> 00:24:58,834
Yes.

407
00:25:06,868 --> 00:25:08,469
Thank you.

408
00:25:08,534 --> 00:25:09,235
Yes?

409
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:10,348
What do you mean?

410
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,368
Thank you for staying with
me even though I'm lacking.

411
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:13,967
What is he talking about?

412
00:25:14,734 --> 00:25:15,734
Mr. Choi.

413
00:25:16,234 --> 00:25:18,616
I'm not leaving.
I'm not going to leave.

414
00:25:18,701 --> 00:25:21,935
I'm going to stay by your side
until the day I retire.

415
00:25:22,033 --> 00:25:23,367
So, please stop it.

416
00:25:23,467 --> 00:25:26,734
If you keep doing this,
I'm going to get grossed out.

417
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:28,234
That's not it.

418
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:31,101
Do you know someone
by the name of Myung Yiseok?

419
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,301
Myung Yiseok?

420
00:25:32,534 --> 00:25:33,883
I know who that is too.

421
00:25:33,968 --> 00:25:37,936
He's the famous IV serial killer.
He committed suicide recently.

422
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:39,367
I heard that Yoobum
was the prosecutor...

423
00:25:39,434 --> 00:25:41,001
...in charge of the case back then.

424
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,767
Did you investigate the case with him?

425
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:44,967
Yes, I did. But why do you ask?

426
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,901
I saw his will and petition.

427
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,034
I found some suspicious
parts when I read them.

428
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:52,300
There wasn't anything
suspicious about that case.

429
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,602
You get that feeling when
you hear the side of the culprits.

430
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:58,135
You think it's unfair
and feel bad for them.

431
00:25:58,501 --> 00:26:01,634
If you fall for that,
it will only cause big trouble.

432
00:26:02,501 --> 00:26:03,268
I see.

433
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,101
Punctuality is the most important
thing when making a deal.

434
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:27,434
What is this? Did I just get swindled?

435
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,433
Did you bring the cell phone?

436
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,001
What about the money?

437
00:26:53,901 --> 00:26:57,268
What's in there that you're paying
10 million won as compensation?

438
00:26:59,434 --> 00:27:00,135
What is that?

439
00:27:00,467 --> 00:27:01,506
Someone is following you?

440
00:27:04,634 --> 00:27:05,401
Stop!

441
00:27:07,634 --> 00:27:08,734
Damn!

442
00:27:14,434 --> 00:27:15,935
There's a gukbap place near here.

443
00:27:16,033 --> 00:27:18,667
It was on the food show on TV.
Should we try it?

444
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:24,435
It's green light. It's ready.

445
00:27:28,067 --> 00:27:28,968
Sir.

446
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:29,700
Yes?

447
00:27:30,033 --> 00:27:31,267
Do you perhaps...

448
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,134
That guy over there...

449
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:34,468
Isn't that Detective Do?

450
00:27:34,567 --> 00:27:35,749
Yes. That's right.

451
00:27:35,834 --> 00:27:36,802
What's happening?

452
00:27:43,067 --> 00:27:44,100
Hey. You jerk!

453
00:27:45,434 --> 00:27:47,649
Hey. Detective Do. What's going on?

454
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:50,867
Gray clothes... He's the cell phone thief.

455
00:27:55,601 --> 00:27:57,035
Gray. Gray.

456
00:28:00,934 --> 00:28:01,835
Gray.

457
00:28:12,534 --> 00:28:14,502
Wootak. The one with the checkered pants.

458
00:28:31,834 --> 00:28:33,735
I'm Lieutenant Han Wootak
from the Third Police station.

459
00:28:33,834 --> 00:28:34,834
Please stop.

460
00:28:49,033 --> 00:28:50,166
Let go of me.

461
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,834
I'm the victim.

462
00:28:51,934 --> 00:28:53,501
Why would a victim run away?

463
00:28:53,601 --> 00:28:54,835
I ran away because you were chasing me.

464
00:28:54,934 --> 00:28:56,435
Let's talk at the police station.

465
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:57,868
Let go of me!

466
00:29:02,567 --> 00:29:06,301
There's no need to record
the overnight shift, is there?

467
00:29:06,367 --> 00:29:08,335
You have tomorrow and the day
after tomorrow to record...

468
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,101
I want to get off work too.

469
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,001
But my captain
wants to record everything...

470
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,667
...for 24 hours
at the prosecutor's office.

471
00:29:13,767 --> 00:29:15,735
What can I do?
I have to do what he tells me to do.

472
00:29:18,334 --> 00:29:19,568
-Ms. Son.
-Yes.

473
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:21,101
Who is on the nightshift tonight?

474
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,367
It was Attorney Lee,
but he switched it with Mr. Jung.

475
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:27,367
Why did he have to switch...

476
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:30,567
...with Jaechan?

477
00:29:32,234 --> 00:29:34,267
Can you work the nightshift tonight?

478
00:29:34,367 --> 00:29:36,434
I have a prior engagement.

479
00:29:36,701 --> 00:29:38,569
Then, what about Miss Shin?

480
00:29:38,634 --> 00:29:40,934
Miss Shin has plans too.

481
00:29:41,601 --> 00:29:45,768
Just entrust it to him.
Mr. Jung is trying hard.

482
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:47,769
I know that he's trying hard.

483
00:29:48,234 --> 00:29:50,735
He just tries day and night...

484
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:52,501
Excuse me?

485
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:54,035
They're going to record
me working the nightshift?

486
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,133
No... Wait...

487
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,248
Okay... I understand.

488
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:00,234
This is a big problem.

489
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:01,868
Who is coming?

490
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:04,067
We finished the investigation for today.

491
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:07,034
They're coming here to
record us working the nightshift.

492
00:30:09,734 --> 00:30:13,435
Hyangmi. Please hide these
documents in Attorney Lee's office.

493
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:14,435
Why?

494
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,783
You can see too many uncleared cases.
It makes me look incompetent.

495
00:30:17,868 --> 00:30:20,549
Just do what you normally do.
What you normally do...

496
00:30:20,634 --> 00:30:22,934
If I do that, I'll be humiliated.
And I'd humiliation to this office.

497
00:30:23,033 --> 00:30:24,367
You do know that.

498
00:30:25,133 --> 00:30:27,400
I haven't washed this even once.
What do I do?

499
00:30:30,267 --> 00:30:32,701
The smell wouldn't get recorded,
right Mr. Choi?

500
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,420
Thank you for showing us
the everyday life at the office.

501
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:39,835
Prosecutor Jung.

502
00:30:43,868 --> 00:30:45,135
I think it will be on TV.

503
00:30:52,534 --> 00:30:54,435
Oh Lord...

504
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,200
Why were you meeting
Park Daeyoung?

505
00:31:00,367 --> 00:31:02,301
I told you already.

506
00:31:02,701 --> 00:31:05,834
The person who lost the
cell phone begged me to find it...

507
00:31:05,934 --> 00:31:07,835
...so I went in his place.

508
00:31:07,934 --> 00:31:10,101
If you think about it, I'm the victim.

509
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,434
Then what about the 10 million won?

510
00:31:11,767 --> 00:31:14,767
I guess the cell phone was
worth 10 million won.

511
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:18,068
You know some phones
have precious memories.

512
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Why did you throw it away
in Han River if it was that precious?

513
00:31:23,868 --> 00:31:24,974
It's not even yours.

514
00:31:25,267 --> 00:31:28,734
I didn't throw it away.
It slipped out of my hands.

515
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:31,768
It clearly seems like there's something
in the cell phone. Don't you think so?

516
00:31:31,868 --> 00:31:35,435
Yes. It's unbelievably suspicious.

517
00:31:35,734 --> 00:31:37,068
What do you think is in there?

518
00:31:37,434 --> 00:31:39,302
We can't find it since he
threw it away in Han River.

519
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:41,767
Gosh. It's so frustrating
that we can't find it.

520
00:31:52,601 --> 00:31:53,601
Park Daeyoung.

521
00:31:54,133 --> 00:31:56,101
You should just have the interview
with the prosecutor via video call.

522
00:31:56,601 --> 00:31:57,402
No.

523
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,167
I don't want to do it via video call.
I'd like to do the interview personally.

524
00:32:02,133 --> 00:32:04,200
I want to meet him no matter what.

525
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:18,101
Sir, aren't you going home?

526
00:32:20,334 --> 00:32:23,302
Don't worry about me.
Just work comfortably as if I'm not here.

527
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,700
Record comfortably as if I'm not here.

528
00:32:25,801 --> 00:32:27,535
-Yes, Sir.
-I'll be right outside.

529
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,300
What is the usual duty of
a prosecutor working the nightshift?

530
00:32:35,634 --> 00:32:38,201
Dealing with the arrest warrant
applications sent by the police...

531
00:32:38,267 --> 00:32:40,534
...in the evening and the suspect.

532
00:32:43,234 --> 00:32:44,234
Excuse me.

533
00:32:45,767 --> 00:32:48,201
Yes. This is Prosecutor Jung Jaechan
from Han River Prosecutor's Office.

534
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:49,467
Yes. Right now?

535
00:32:56,868 --> 00:32:57,702
My gosh.

536
00:32:58,834 --> 00:33:00,234
Oh Lord...

537
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:04,434
Is someone coming?

538
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:08,201
Yes. Please come up. Yes

539
00:33:15,133 --> 00:33:16,800
What is your name, Sir?

540
00:33:17,133 --> 00:33:18,867
I hope it's a mild punishment.

541
00:33:26,434 --> 00:33:28,101
He's suspected of habitual
larceny of cell phones.

542
00:33:28,167 --> 00:33:30,267
The police requested
for the arrest warrant.

543
00:33:30,534 --> 00:33:33,068
He's also suspected of fleeing
the police and destroying the evidence.

544
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,567
Who is that?

545
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,115
Suspect interview is done via
video call or phone calls usually.

546
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,934
But he requested for
a personal interview...

547
00:33:43,033 --> 00:33:43,816
...so they're coming right now.

548
00:33:43,901 --> 00:33:45,335
You're going to decide whether...

549
00:33:45,434 --> 00:33:47,968
...to issue an arrest warrant after
you interview him here, right?

550
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:48,968
That's right.

551
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:49,901
Prosecutor Jung.

552
00:33:50,434 --> 00:33:51,101
Yes.

553
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,400
You can sit here.

554
00:33:59,334 --> 00:34:01,101
You wanted to see me?

555
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:02,967
Yes.

556
00:34:06,234 --> 00:34:08,668
You have the same name as the Chief.

557
00:34:09,834 --> 00:34:11,301
Park Daeyoung.

558
00:34:11,934 --> 00:34:14,601
That's right. The one who shamed my name.

559
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,500
You might not believe it...

560
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,867
...but I was also
a government worker like you.

561
00:34:24,868 --> 00:34:26,669
My younger brother did something bad...

562
00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:30,268
...and while I was trying to fix it,
I lost all my money...

563
00:34:30,434 --> 00:34:31,768
...and my wife left me too.

564
00:34:34,133 --> 00:34:37,034
And the only daughter
I had injured her back...

565
00:34:39,801 --> 00:34:41,335
...when she was nine due to an accident.

566
00:34:43,367 --> 00:34:45,500
She can't even drink water without me.

567
00:34:46,934 --> 00:34:49,101
Then is your daughter alone at home?

568
00:34:49,234 --> 00:34:52,015
He's falling for it.
He's getting deceived by that.

569
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,601
There isn't any job in Korea
that you can do...

570
00:34:56,267 --> 00:34:57,868
...while having a daughter like that.

571
00:35:00,067 --> 00:35:01,534
That's why I stole.

572
00:35:03,033 --> 00:35:05,300
I know that I did terrible things.

573
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,100
I'll be sincere with
the investigation and punishment.

574
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,734
So, please...

575
00:35:12,501 --> 00:35:13,402
Please...

576
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:16,901
Please let me avoid the arrest,
Prosecutor.

577
00:35:17,901 --> 00:35:19,133
My Jookyung...

578
00:35:21,901 --> 00:35:24,368
...might die if I'm not with her.

579
00:35:24,934 --> 00:35:27,134
Jookyung is probably waiting for me...

580
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,934
...to bring her sweet rice cake
while folding paper cranes.

581
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,048
If she folds 10 thousand paper cranes...

582
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:39,700
She believes that she'll be able to walk
if she folds 10 thousand paper cranes.

583
00:35:40,067 --> 00:35:40,901
Am I right?

584
00:35:41,367 --> 00:35:46,068
He hasn't changed his
repertoire for over 10 years.

585
00:35:46,467 --> 00:35:47,968
This is all lies, so don't be deceived.

586
00:35:48,067 --> 00:35:49,301
Request for the arrest warrant.

587
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:53,301
Excuse me, Sir. Do you know this person?

588
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:56,467
I know him very well.
This jerk 10 years ago...

589
00:35:56,567 --> 00:35:58,334
Sir. The camera...

590
00:35:58,801 --> 00:36:00,602
Miss Nam, you should edit that...

591
00:36:04,033 --> 00:36:07,082
This gentleman committed
the same theft 10 years ago...

592
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:08,901
...so I issued the arrest warrant.

593
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,200
You should just request
for the arrest warrant.

594
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Is your daughter really alone at home?

595
00:36:18,868 --> 00:36:19,602
Yes.

596
00:36:21,567 --> 00:36:22,734
She's alone at home.

597
00:36:23,601 --> 00:36:24,435
Prosecutor Jung.

598
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,901
What's wrong with you?
You're acting like an amateur.

599
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,901
Can't you tell that he's
lying just by looking at him?

600
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,734
His daughter was nine
years old 10 years ago too.

601
00:36:37,901 --> 00:36:39,535
How does his daughter not get old?

602
00:36:39,634 --> 00:36:40,634
Does she have eternal
youth and immortality?

603
00:36:40,734 --> 00:36:42,201
I'm not saying that
I'm just going to let him go.

604
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,700
I'm just saying that I'm
going to check his story.

605
00:36:45,801 --> 00:36:48,968
Why are you turning this
five minute work into two hours?

606
00:36:49,033 --> 00:36:50,300
What you're doing right now...

607
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:52,534
...isn't any different than
what a quack would do.

608
00:36:53,033 --> 00:36:56,100
There are car accident patients
in the Emergency Room...

609
00:36:56,167 --> 00:37:00,234
...but you're taking hours putting on a
band aid on a patient with skinned knee.

610
00:37:00,767 --> 00:37:04,334
You get fooled by suspects' excuses
and waste your time daily.

611
00:37:04,434 --> 00:37:05,901
That's why there isn't
an end to the uncleared cases.

612
00:37:05,968 --> 00:37:08,068
Stop making excuses and
request for the arrest warrant.

613
00:37:13,033 --> 00:37:15,066
For God's sake...

614
00:37:20,467 --> 00:37:21,634
Are you okay?

615
00:37:25,968 --> 00:37:26,802
I'm okay.

616
00:37:38,734 --> 00:37:42,134
Prosecutor Jung doesn't
get scolded like this every day.

617
00:37:42,234 --> 00:37:43,735
How should I put this...

618
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,634
This is a rare occurrence,
so do not get disappointed.

619
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,068
Mr. Choi.

620
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:51,234
Yes.

621
00:37:52,067 --> 00:37:55,701
Is getting deceived by someone
something to be scolded for?

622
00:37:59,033 --> 00:38:02,600
Believing in someone
isn't such a bad thing.

623
00:38:03,467 --> 00:38:06,834
I'm hungry because I ran earlier.

624
00:38:06,968 --> 00:38:08,602
Should we order chicken?

625
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:10,601
Mr. Oh.

626
00:38:12,868 --> 00:38:14,001
You know, right?

627
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,167
What do you mean?

628
00:38:16,267 --> 00:38:17,034
That...

629
00:38:18,767 --> 00:38:21,534
...I can't differentiate colors.

630
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:23,634
Yes, I know.

631
00:38:27,267 --> 00:38:30,630
Why aren't you saying anything?
Isn't it a reason for termination?

632
00:38:30,701 --> 00:38:31,935
Did you deceive them to get the job?

633
00:38:32,133 --> 00:38:34,400
No. It was an exam error.

634
00:38:34,501 --> 00:38:35,634
Then it's fine.

635
00:38:35,701 --> 00:38:37,734
Since you got the job, it's done.

636
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:40,368
I just have to keep my mouth shut.

637
00:38:40,467 --> 00:38:41,401
But...

638
00:38:43,033 --> 00:38:45,367
Who caught the fleeing suspect?

639
00:38:45,467 --> 00:38:46,767
Was it me or you?

640
00:38:47,567 --> 00:38:50,234
You might not believe it,
but rather than your eyes...

641
00:38:50,534 --> 00:38:53,035
...this is the reason for getting fired.

642
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,367
How can I be a policeman
when I'm this slow?

643
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,834
This won't do.

644
00:38:58,167 --> 00:39:00,334
I'm going to pass on the chicken today.

645
00:39:00,434 --> 00:39:01,135
Let's go inside.

646
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:36,567
-Grandma.
-Yes.

647
00:39:36,634 --> 00:39:38,101
I'll have 2,000 won worth of hotteok.

648
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,135
Yes. Okay.

649
00:39:58,534 --> 00:39:59,534
Is anyone home?

650
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,667
Kid, are you home?

651
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:09,301
Who are you?

652
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:10,736
Hello.

653
00:40:11,067 --> 00:40:12,568
Do you know the person who lives here?

654
00:40:12,634 --> 00:40:14,868
The gangster. Of course I do.

655
00:40:14,934 --> 00:40:16,725
He always gets kimchi from my house.

656
00:40:16,801 --> 00:40:18,468
Then do you know his daughter too?

657
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,467
His daughter?

658
00:40:21,067 --> 00:40:22,849
I think you have the wrong house.

659
00:40:22,934 --> 00:40:24,768
The man lives alone here.

660
00:40:42,434 --> 00:40:43,302
My gosh.

661
00:40:43,534 --> 00:40:46,035
It seems like it was true. That's strange.

662
00:40:46,334 --> 00:40:49,235
Why did he lie?

663
00:40:49,434 --> 00:40:52,968
Gosh.
I'm going to get scolded by Chief Park.

664
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:02,135
How did you know I was here?

665
00:41:03,167 --> 00:41:04,167
You dreamt about me, didn't you?

666
00:41:04,267 --> 00:41:06,534
No. I don't need to dream.

667
00:41:06,901 --> 00:41:08,835
I can see what you're thinking.

668
00:41:09,601 --> 00:41:11,235
I thought you'd be here.

669
00:41:11,934 --> 00:41:13,934
Do you want some? It's so sweet.

670
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,701
I don't want any.
I don't have any appetite.

671
00:41:18,534 --> 00:41:19,768
She said he doesn't
have a daughter, right?

672
00:41:20,067 --> 00:41:21,768
She said the man lied, right?

673
00:41:22,634 --> 00:41:23,435
Yes.

674
00:41:25,801 --> 00:41:27,535
I looked like a loser today, right?

675
00:41:28,133 --> 00:41:31,200
I got swayed by the lies of a suspect.
I got scolded by my boss.

676
00:41:33,334 --> 00:41:35,268
Please edit what you recorded today.

677
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,167
It's going to humiliate the office.

678
00:41:39,834 --> 00:41:42,301
I asked the grandma at the hotteok place.

679
00:41:44,634 --> 00:41:48,968
That man had a daughter 10 years ago.

680
00:41:52,834 --> 00:41:55,368
A nine year old daughter who
hurt her back in the car accident.

681
00:41:57,834 --> 00:42:00,234
He couldn't take care of his daughter
while working as a mailman.

682
00:42:00,334 --> 00:42:02,768
So he quit his job and
started stealing cell phones.

683
00:42:03,234 --> 00:42:04,668
Then he got arrested.

684
00:42:05,934 --> 00:42:08,334
The daughter was rescued
after being home alone.

685
00:42:08,501 --> 00:42:11,534
But she died while he was in prison.

686
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,634
And he's been living alone after that.

687
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:19,922
If he met a prosecutor like you
10 years ago instead of your chief...

688
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,701
...his daughter might be alive.

689
00:42:26,634 --> 00:42:29,401
And don't worry about this.

690
00:42:30,501 --> 00:42:33,268
I'm going to edit all the footage
with you in it and watch it alone.

691
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,734
If it gets aired...

692
00:42:34,834 --> 00:42:36,967
...all the women in the world will
fall for you and cling onto you.

693
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:38,801
I can't let that happen.

694
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,300
Wow. It's so sweet.

695
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:51,602
Let me have one.

696
00:42:54,501 --> 00:42:55,202
Here.

697
00:42:59,734 --> 00:43:01,335
-You're wearing the ring.
-What?

698
00:43:02,501 --> 00:43:03,568
Did you just notice it?

699
00:43:04,701 --> 00:43:06,635
You're really not that sharp.

700
00:43:09,634 --> 00:43:10,535
Thanks.

701
00:43:53,501 --> 00:43:57,835
Even if it is 2,500 won beer,
if you get arrested twice, it's over.

702
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:59,635
If you don't want to get arrested,
you have to be prepared.

703
00:44:01,334 --> 00:44:02,668
Of course. Of course.

704
00:44:02,767 --> 00:44:03,800
Park Daeyoung.

705
00:44:12,133 --> 00:44:12,967
Prosecutor.

706
00:44:13,267 --> 00:44:14,768
What will happen to me now?

707
00:44:15,067 --> 00:44:17,434
Will I be able to go and
see my daughter now?

708
00:44:17,534 --> 00:44:20,068
No. I've already requested
for the arrest warrant.

709
00:44:20,167 --> 00:44:22,267
You'll be questioned before
you're taken into custody.

710
00:44:25,067 --> 00:44:26,200
It's over.

711
00:44:26,968 --> 00:44:28,168
I was wondering...

712
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:30,033
...but I guess it happened.

713
00:44:34,133 --> 00:44:36,467
I went to your house last night.

714
00:44:39,667 --> 00:44:40,734
You went to my house?

715
00:44:41,801 --> 00:44:43,040
Your daughter wasn't there.

716
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,767
Is that why you requested
for the arrest warrant?

717
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,400
Because you were angry that I lied?

718
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,101
I heard what happened to
your daughter 10 years ago.

719
00:44:52,934 --> 00:44:54,182
We should've taken care of
your daughter...

720
00:44:54,267 --> 00:44:56,868
...when you were arrested
for the first time, but we didn't.

721
00:44:57,534 --> 00:45:00,701
I know that it doesn't mean anything
for me to apologize now, but...

722
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,200
...please forgive us.

723
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:12,567
Look here, Prosecutor.

724
00:45:23,734 --> 00:45:25,734
I lied about my daughter in order to
avoid being arrested...

725
00:45:26,434 --> 00:45:28,201
...for a total of six times.

726
00:45:29,234 --> 00:45:32,634
But you're the only prosecutor
who went to my house.

727
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,601
I have to reward you with something.

728
00:45:58,701 --> 00:45:59,734
What is this?

729
00:46:00,033 --> 00:46:01,233
I don't know what it is.

730
00:46:01,667 --> 00:46:03,834
But there's something tremendous inside.

731
00:46:04,968 --> 00:46:05,869
What is it?

732
00:46:07,601 --> 00:46:09,168
I don't know what it is either.

733
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:11,335
That's something you
have to figure out now.

734
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,468
This was in the 10 million won cell phone?

735
00:46:26,567 --> 00:46:27,168
Yes.

736
00:46:27,267 --> 00:46:30,135
The owner of the cell phone gave him
10 million won to get it back.

737
00:46:30,267 --> 00:46:33,367
I'm certain that there's information
that's worth more than that inside it.

738
00:46:33,467 --> 00:46:35,416
You got deceived,
but you're getting deceived again.

739
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:38,035
He gets deceived every day.
Every day is April Fool's Day for him.

740
00:46:38,434 --> 00:46:40,013
You never know.

741
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,500
If there's really something inside,
I can investigate it as my case, right?

742
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,522
Do you think you can investigate
it right away just because you can?

743
00:46:46,601 --> 00:46:48,290
The process is so complicated.

744
00:46:48,367 --> 00:46:51,293
Don't try to make something
from nothing...

745
00:46:51,367 --> 00:46:53,695
...and just finish up
cases that you can finish.

746
00:46:53,767 --> 00:46:54,735
What is it?

747
00:46:54,801 --> 00:46:57,001
They're just pictures of dogs and food.

748
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,801
What information is in here?

749
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,734
Do you think its corporate espionage?

750
00:47:00,801 --> 00:47:01,970
Like a corporate spy...

751
00:47:02,067 --> 00:47:04,035
Hey. You can't record this.

752
00:47:04,133 --> 00:47:06,233
You're not even investigating. Let me see.

753
00:47:06,334 --> 00:47:07,835
No. You can't record this.

754
00:47:07,934 --> 00:47:10,501
Record Hyangmi. Hyangmi is pretty today.

755
00:47:10,601 --> 00:47:12,883
Didn't you come here to
interview Prosecutor Shin Heemin?

756
00:47:12,968 --> 00:47:14,202
Why are you here?

757
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:15,868
Zoom in on her.

758
00:47:16,901 --> 00:47:17,802
Zoom in.

759
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:19,034
Don't record me please.

760
00:47:19,133 --> 00:47:20,034
Hyangmi.

761
00:47:27,667 --> 00:47:28,434
Huh?

762
00:47:31,334 --> 00:47:32,268
What is it, Mr. Choi?

763
00:47:34,834 --> 00:47:36,168
They're pictures of patients.

764
00:47:37,434 --> 00:47:38,868
Is the owner of the cell phone a doctor?

765
00:47:39,267 --> 00:47:40,634
What is it? Is there someone you know?

766
00:47:42,767 --> 00:47:44,134
They're victims.

767
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,934
Victims? Victims from where?

768
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,468
From the IV serial killer case...

769
00:47:55,234 --> 00:47:55,968
What?

770
00:47:56,934 --> 00:47:57,635
Excuse me?

771
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,400
Don't worry.

772
00:48:12,467 --> 00:48:14,734
How will they find a cell
phone that fell in Han River?

773
00:48:16,033 --> 00:48:19,433
Don't worry about the police.
I'll deny knowing you.

774
00:48:20,968 --> 00:48:22,202
That's okay.

775
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,767
Why are the pictures
of those victims in here?

776
00:48:24,852 --> 00:48:26,535
Is that Myung Yiseok's
cell phone perhaps?

777
00:48:26,601 --> 00:48:29,235
No way. Myung Yiseok has been
in prison for over a year.

778
00:48:30,734 --> 00:48:33,468
How many pictures
of the patients are there?

779
00:48:36,367 --> 00:48:37,367
There are 19 patients.

780
00:48:37,467 --> 00:48:39,534
Were there 19 victims
in the IV killer case?

781
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,967
No. There were 11 victims.

782
00:48:46,634 --> 00:48:48,968
Then who are the rest of the eight people?

783
00:48:50,033 --> 00:48:53,166
I'm getting scared.
The rest of the eight are alive, right?

784
00:48:54,234 --> 00:48:55,202
What is this?

785
00:48:55,901 --> 00:48:58,034
Does it mean that
Myung Yiseok has an accomplice?

786
00:48:58,701 --> 00:49:01,535
If not, is the real culprit out there?

787
00:49:02,167 --> 00:49:04,601
I think we have to meet
the owner of the cell phone first.

788
00:49:10,767 --> 00:49:13,401
Don't worry. How will they find it?

789
00:49:15,033 --> 00:49:16,967
I'm telling you that
they have no reason to do it.

790
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:18,834
I didn't do anything wrong so why...

791
00:49:20,801 --> 00:49:21,435
What is this?

792
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,367
You were here already.

793
00:49:28,167 --> 00:49:28,834
What?

794
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,048
Why did you look inside the stolen phone?

795
00:49:31,133 --> 00:49:34,367
If you have time to do useless things,
finish up uncleared cases.

796
00:49:34,467 --> 00:49:35,901
It's not useless things.

797
00:49:35,968 --> 00:49:37,993
He offered 10 million won
in order to find that phone.

798
00:49:38,067 --> 00:49:40,768
And there were pictures of the victims
from the serial murder case.

799
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,200
The pictures were taken by
one person before they died.

800
00:49:43,267 --> 00:49:45,467
He might be the accomplice
or the real culprit.

801
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:48,982
That cell phone was given
to you by that thief, wasn't it?

802
00:49:49,067 --> 00:49:51,301
That jerk lies all the time...

803
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,800
-10 years ago...
-His daughter,

804
00:49:53,868 --> 00:49:55,202
really died 10 years ago.

805
00:49:55,801 --> 00:49:56,801
I confirmed it.

806
00:49:59,868 --> 00:50:01,035
He said his daughter was sick...

807
00:50:01,133 --> 00:50:03,767
...but a prosecutor said it was
a lie and didn't confirm it.

808
00:50:04,667 --> 00:50:06,934
No matter how many times he begged,
he didn't release him.

809
00:50:07,234 --> 00:50:08,367
That's why it happened that way.

810
00:50:11,868 --> 00:50:13,868
I don't want to become
a prosecutor like that.

811
00:50:21,234 --> 00:50:22,735
It could've been fabricated.

812
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,801
The prosecutor and the forensic
team could be in it together...

813
00:50:24,901 --> 00:50:25,968
...and say that Yoo Sookyung's
blood was found.

814
00:50:26,033 --> 00:50:27,500
If they fabricate a few documents...

815
00:50:27,901 --> 00:50:29,635
...it would be easy for them
to declare his innocence.

816
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,134
Is it possible to
fabricate things like that?

817
00:50:32,701 --> 00:50:34,435
A prosecutor can do it,
if he wants to. Why not?

818
00:50:45,868 --> 00:50:46,836
Mr. Choi.

819
00:50:47,868 --> 00:50:49,802
What are you doing here
without calling me first?

820
00:50:53,267 --> 00:50:54,701
Myung Yiseok's case...

821
00:50:55,868 --> 00:50:57,702
Did you fabricate the evidence?

822
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,001
Excuse me?

823
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,701
I asked if you fabricated the evidence.

824
00:51:08,601 --> 00:51:10,068
Please answer me.

825
00:51:16,834 --> 00:51:18,668
You were with me at the time.

826
00:51:33,567 --> 00:51:34,401
Mr. Bong.

827
00:51:38,167 --> 00:51:38,901
What?

828
00:51:39,234 --> 00:51:41,468
You called me so say something.
What is it?

829
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:44,734
It really looks good on you.

830
00:51:45,901 --> 00:51:48,535
Mr. Bong. You're close to Detective Goh
from Han River Police Station, right?

831
00:51:48,601 --> 00:51:49,701
Yes. Why?

832
00:51:50,901 --> 00:51:51,901
You know that person...

833
00:51:51,968 --> 00:51:54,836
...who was taken in with
the cell phone thief some time ago?

834
00:51:54,901 --> 00:51:56,769
The person who was taken
in mistaken for a fence...

835
00:51:56,834 --> 00:51:58,468
Honey. I'll do better.

836
00:51:59,634 --> 00:52:01,268
Can I find out his address?

837
00:52:01,334 --> 00:52:03,467
That wouldn't be that hard.

838
00:52:04,634 --> 00:52:05,667
Honey, I love you.

839
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,767
I want to confirm something.

840
00:52:12,834 --> 00:52:13,635
Confirm something?

841
00:52:13,934 --> 00:52:14,835
What is it?

842
00:52:15,801 --> 00:52:18,468
I want to confirm that he wasn't deceived.

843
00:52:24,133 --> 00:52:25,300
Where are you going?

844
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,800
Our office is going out for a meal today.

845
00:52:26,901 --> 00:52:29,483
I can't go today.
I have something to investigate.

846
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,767
What are you investigating that
you have to do it after work hours?

847
00:52:31,901 --> 00:52:34,402
The chief didn't give me
the permission to investigate it.

848
00:52:34,634 --> 00:52:36,301
So I have to do it after work.

849
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,101
I'm going out to dig.

850
00:52:56,934 --> 00:52:57,735
Is it here?

851
00:53:02,234 --> 00:53:03,835
It's a container.

852
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,133
Jaechan.

853
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,382
Hongjoo. What are you doing here?

854
00:53:35,467 --> 00:53:37,268
I came here to find
the owner of the cell phone.

855
00:53:37,334 --> 00:53:38,135
You too?

856
00:53:38,567 --> 00:53:41,301
Yes, but I think that will be difficult.

857
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:42,468
Why?

858
00:53:42,968 --> 00:53:45,702
The one who knows that
person is already dead.

859
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:59,234
It's locked.

860
00:54:18,767 --> 00:54:19,767
What is it?

861
00:54:19,834 --> 00:54:20,702
Gasoline.

862
00:54:59,033 --> 00:55:00,901
Did you experience anything like that?

863
00:55:01,133 --> 00:55:04,333
Like almost dying and being saved...

864
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:07,934
I did.

865
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:09,834
Really?

866
00:55:10,267 --> 00:55:11,068
When?

867
00:55:12,067 --> 00:55:14,134
It's when I was pretty young.

868
00:55:14,234 --> 00:55:15,801
I fell in the water once.

869
00:55:22,901 --> 00:55:25,934
I don't blame you anymore.

870
00:55:26,801 --> 00:55:30,135
I'm glad that you're alive.

871
00:55:45,434 --> 00:55:48,135
Because of that feeling,
I was so grateful to you.

872
00:55:48,334 --> 00:55:50,235
I almost died.

873
00:55:50,667 --> 00:55:53,734
I want to repay the person
who saved me no matter what.

874
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:57,667
Those dreams started
because of that thought.

875
00:55:58,834 --> 00:56:01,934
The dream to see the future
of the one who saved me.

876
00:57:05,234 --> 00:57:06,334
Are you okay?

877
00:57:07,734 --> 00:57:10,568
Prosecutor Jung. Reporter Nam...

878
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,234
Are you okay?

879
00:57:13,634 --> 00:57:15,468
Do you recognize me?

880
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:17,635
Mr. Choi.

881
00:57:22,601 --> 00:57:25,634
I'm glad. I'm so glad.

882
00:57:31,767 --> 00:57:32,900
What a relief.

883
00:57:34,834 --> 00:57:36,468
I'm so glad that you're both alive.

884
00:58:18,667 --> 00:58:19,716
We'll ask him.

885
00:58:19,801 --> 00:58:21,268
Why can't you answer me!

886
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,034
I fabricated my report card.

887
00:58:23,634 --> 00:58:26,535
Yoobum said he can get
more tutoring fee if I do that.

888
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,500
So we split the tutoring fee.

889
00:58:28,601 --> 00:58:31,235
You brat. Why did you lie
about something like that?

890
00:58:31,634 --> 00:58:34,834
Your father was so proud of
you for raising up your grades.

891
00:58:41,968 --> 00:58:44,669
"Choi Damdong"

892
00:59:12,534 --> 00:59:19,468
"While You Were Sleeping"
