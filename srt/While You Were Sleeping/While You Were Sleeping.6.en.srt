He's not picking up.

7
00:00:37,534 --> 00:00:39,101
He must've sensed that we're after him.

8
00:00:39,211 --> 00:00:41,607
Track all his calls
and credit card records.

9
00:00:41,692 --> 00:00:43,502
Put him on the suspect
list if that doesn't work.

10
00:00:43,601 --> 00:00:46,870
What do you mean, suspect list?
What wrong has my brother done?

11
00:00:49,707 --> 00:00:52,368
Attorney Lee, you have
a guest waiting for you.

12
00:00:53,624 --> 00:00:54,323
Who?

13
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:55,944
I'm not expecting any guests.

14
00:00:56,029 --> 00:00:57,416
A new guest who came
in for the first time.

15
00:00:57,501 --> 00:00:58,768
He came to see you.

16
00:00:59,703 --> 00:01:00,504
I see.

17
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:06,567
I'm sorry, can you give me a moment?

18
00:01:09,864 --> 00:01:10,929
Is this pro Bono?

19
00:01:11,014 --> 00:01:11,617
No.

20
00:01:11,702 --> 00:01:13,326
Or have I already fallen behind?

21
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:15,065
Just because I lost in
Park Junmo's case?

22
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:15,948
I don't think so.

23
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:17,704
Then, why do I get such a client?

24
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:20,218
You should talk to him first.

25
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:22,049
There must be a reason why he's here.

26
00:01:25,581 --> 00:01:26,248
Okay.

27
00:01:30,372 --> 00:01:32,434
Hello, I'm attorney Lee Yoobum.

28
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,606
What's your name?

29
00:01:34,246 --> 00:01:36,331
I'm Kang Daehee.

30
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:40,168
They sent me here when I requested a
lawyer who also was a prosecutor before.

31
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:42,775
Yes, that's correct.

32
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,770
Have a seat.

33
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:49,075
I don't accept just any cases
because I meet with them.

34
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,861
I'll listen to your case and
decide if I can work on it or not...

35
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:53,826
Pardon...

36
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:02,706
I'll give you as much money you want.

37
00:02:06,701 --> 00:02:09,168
I don't place my bets
after looking at the pot.

38
00:02:10,191 --> 00:02:11,491
I look at my chances
before I place my bets.

39
00:02:15,514 --> 00:02:16,578
Talk to me.

40
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:19,373
How can I help you?

41
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,306
It's so unfair.

42
00:02:23,534 --> 00:02:26,844
I got into a big car
accidentally recently by mistake.

43
00:02:27,067 --> 00:02:28,846
And I lost by younger
brother in that accident...

44
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,504
The police accused me of
faking it all for his insurance...

45
00:02:32,888 --> 00:02:34,876
...and even issued a warrant
to arrest me...

46
00:02:34,961 --> 00:02:37,767
Did the warranty state that
you killed him on purpose?

47
00:02:37,852 --> 00:02:38,985
No...

48
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,849
I haven't seen the warrant yet.

49
00:02:40,934 --> 00:02:42,581
I left right before the police arrived.

50
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:46,168
Then, you ran away when you don't
even know what the warrant says?

51
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:51,070
No, it's not that...

52
00:02:51,155 --> 00:02:52,489
Well...

53
00:02:53,834 --> 00:02:57,431
If I was still a persecutor,
it means you made a big mistake...

54
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:01,762
But don't worry.

55
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:05,950
I'm an attorney now
and to keep the ethics...

56
00:03:06,303 --> 00:03:10,149
...I can't say a word about
what you just said.

57
00:03:13,012 --> 00:03:15,618
If you want to live,
you have to lie to a prosecutor...

58
00:03:15,804 --> 00:03:18,115
...but to me you have to tell
me honestly what you want.

59
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:22,344
What you are doing to me now is
like shoveling sand against the tide.

60
00:03:26,626 --> 00:03:27,893
I mean...

61
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:34,486
...you have to be honest with me so
that I can fix whatever is going on.

62
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:35,415
Isn't that right?

63
00:03:39,801 --> 00:03:41,238
Did you kill your brother?

64
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,414
Yes.

65
00:04:05,437 --> 00:04:08,397
Um... what I want from you...

66
00:04:08,854 --> 00:04:09,916
...is to make me innocent...

67
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,067
...during the trial.

68
00:04:35,821 --> 00:04:37,830
The criminal who killed his brother
going after his insurance money...

69
00:04:37,915 --> 00:04:39,028
When are you up?

70
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:40,595
It's coming up.

71
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:42,980
Reporter Nam Hongjoo reports.

72
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:48,984
Seoul Han River District Prosecutor's
Office sentenced life imprisonment...

73
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:54,151
...to Mr. Kang, 37 years old,
for murder and fraud in the final trial.

74
00:04:54,786 --> 00:04:59,956
Mr. Kang has intentionally killed
his younger brother and sister...

75
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:04,005
...for accidental death benefits that
were put since June 2015...

76
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,090
...and was imprisoned and
prosecuted for the murders.

77
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,510
This is Nam Hongjoo
from SBC news.

78
00:05:10,734 --> 00:05:12,396
Seoul Han River District
Prosecutor's Office didn't do it.

79
00:05:12,481 --> 00:05:14,701
It was Prosecutor Jung who prosecuted him.

80
00:05:16,341 --> 00:05:18,323
So, is it unfair?

81
00:05:18,408 --> 00:05:19,441
Well, no...

82
00:05:19,526 --> 00:05:22,188
Not that it's unfair,
but you just left out a word.

83
00:05:23,745 --> 00:05:24,479
Really?

84
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:27,695
I was going to comfort you
if you thought it was unfair...

85
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:31,203
Now that I think about it,
I think it's a bit unfair...

86
00:05:34,047 --> 00:05:35,147
Tell me.

87
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,475
What's so unfair?

88
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:44,577
What's so unfair?

89
00:05:47,354 --> 00:05:49,121
What's so unfair?

90
00:05:55,486 --> 00:05:56,454
What the heck!

91
00:05:56,543 --> 00:05:57,091
What the...

92
00:05:57,176 --> 00:05:59,775
Why are you on my bed?

93
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,927
I came in to wake you up and
you're the one who pulled me.

94
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:04,179
You were saying that it was
unfair and pulled my arm...

95
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:05,872
You should've turned on the lights.

96
00:06:06,354 --> 00:06:07,982
You're such an easy man.

97
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,129
Gross.

98
00:06:09,856 --> 00:06:10,980
What am I saying?

99
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,134
Right?

100
00:06:12,234 --> 00:06:13,803
You don't even know what you're saying.

101
00:06:13,888 --> 00:06:17,455
That's because you're the one
who's wrong and you're ashamed.

102
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,649
Be quiet.

103
00:06:18,734 --> 00:06:20,217
Cereal for breakfast?

104
00:06:20,398 --> 00:06:21,481
Or should I make ramyeon?

105
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,011
I wonder why you want to
suddenly make breakfast for me...

106
00:06:26,096 --> 00:06:28,040
I don't know if I may owe you again.

107
00:06:29,186 --> 00:06:34,087
If something bad happens,
please protect my daughter.

108
00:06:35,941 --> 00:06:36,516
Never mind.

109
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:38,638
I'm going to have breakfast
next door from now on.

110
00:06:38,723 --> 00:06:39,557
From now on?

111
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,147
Every day?

112
00:06:41,232 --> 00:06:43,559
The lady next door wants
to make breakfast for us.

113
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,619
Her breakfast is so good.

114
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:53,146
You talk as if you've had it before.

115
00:06:54,106 --> 00:06:55,040
Of course I did.

116
00:06:55,936 --> 00:06:56,883
Without me?
When?

117
00:06:56,968 --> 00:06:58,447
Yea, last time without you.

118
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:02,123
I don't like you for many
different reasons today.

119
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:04,798
Stop.

120
00:07:05,554 --> 00:07:06,849
Wolverine.

121
00:07:06,934 --> 00:07:08,735
Seriously, stop.

122
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:10,468
I don't like it...

123
00:07:41,547 --> 00:07:42,647
Mom.

124
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:46,051
Where's the razor?

125
00:07:46,434 --> 00:07:49,935
Mom, why do I have so much leg hair?

126
00:07:52,784 --> 00:07:56,752
It grows so much within a day.

127
00:07:56,837 --> 00:07:59,999
The growing speed of
my hair is like the speed of light.

128
00:08:00,084 --> 00:08:01,173
And my armpit hair...

129
00:08:13,516 --> 00:08:14,414
Okay...

130
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:16,249
Hongjoo, say hi.

131
00:08:16,334 --> 00:08:20,401
We're going to have
breakfast together from now on.

132
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:21,330
And the armpits...

133
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:23,600
I mean, the razor is next to the shampoo.

134
00:08:23,685 --> 00:08:24,652
So, you can look for it there.

135
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,504
Okay.

136
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:32,460
Welcome.

137
00:08:45,596 --> 00:08:47,432
Hongjoo, you're quite moisturized.

138
00:08:49,914 --> 00:08:52,148
My eyebrows are gone,
half gone, like Mona Lisa.

139
00:08:56,612 --> 00:08:59,513
Half of these should've
been on my eyebrows.

140
00:09:01,705 --> 00:09:04,039
Wow, enjoy.

141
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:08,836
Hongjoo has such a neat and
tidy personality...

142
00:09:08,921 --> 00:09:12,333
...that she won't
allow one strand of hair on her leg.

143
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:13,252
I see.

144
00:09:16,268 --> 00:09:17,582
You have breakfast like this every day?

145
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:19,887
Jaechan, this is just a regular course.

146
00:09:19,972 --> 00:09:22,239
Last time, she made five-spice
sliced steamed pork.

147
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:24,884
The shabu shabu you made
last time was seriously the best.

148
00:09:24,969 --> 00:09:25,915
Nice.

149
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,167
Then, I'll make it again next time.

150
00:09:30,888 --> 00:09:32,534
Welcome.

151
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:39,549
Mom. You should've told me
we were having guests over.

152
00:09:39,634 --> 00:09:40,602
I did.

153
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:43,601
You must've not heard me
since you had the music so loud.

154
00:09:44,243 --> 00:09:45,777
It's okay.

155
00:09:45,862 --> 00:09:49,463
Everyone's like that at home, right?

156
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:51,894
No, not to that extent.

157
00:09:52,714 --> 00:09:53,915
Stop lying.

158
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,701
My brother doesn't look
like a human being at home.

159
00:09:59,234 --> 00:10:02,403
I know how your
brother looks like at home.

160
00:10:02,488 --> 00:10:04,038
-You saw him?
-How do you know?

161
00:10:05,373 --> 00:10:09,074
I've seen your house
in my dream many times.

162
00:10:09,806 --> 00:10:13,509
You go to work without washing
your hair for many days, right?

163
00:10:14,244 --> 00:10:15,311
That's right.

164
00:10:15,505 --> 00:10:17,849
I'm scared something
will come out from his hair.

165
00:10:17,934 --> 00:10:19,682
You take your clothes off everywhere...

166
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:21,867
...and never put
them in the washing machine, right?

167
00:10:21,968 --> 00:10:24,815
Why do you use the bathroom
with the door open?

168
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,179
That's right.

169
00:10:26,264 --> 00:10:28,089
What's worst is that after he's done...

170
00:10:28,174 --> 00:10:29,529
-He doesn't even flush.
-He doesn't even flush.

171
00:10:30,055 --> 00:10:32,331
Wow, seriously amazing...

172
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,549
How do you know
everything through your dream?

173
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,491
I've been having a lot of
dreams of your brother lately.

174
00:10:35,576 --> 00:10:38,576
I don't mean to but end up
looking inside your house a lot.

175
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:50,443
Who's going to clean this up!

176
00:10:53,711 --> 00:10:55,711
A prosecutor is beating me up.

177
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:12,008
It's a scene nobody should miss,
so stop being so coy.

178
00:11:12,135 --> 00:11:14,315
I haven't said a word about other things
to keep your dignity...

179
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,533
...but should I say some more?

180
00:11:15,915 --> 00:11:17,010
Hey, Nam Hongjoo.

181
00:11:17,095 --> 00:11:17,896
What!

182
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,559
I admit.

183
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:22,076
Let's stop.

184
00:11:22,702 --> 00:11:23,503
Let's eat.

185
00:11:23,736 --> 00:11:24,637
Eat.

186
00:11:35,994 --> 00:11:39,474
I've already seen everything,
so just behave as you were.

187
00:11:40,302 --> 00:11:42,301
Don't pretend to be neat...

188
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,954
Your brother will talk trash about you.

189
00:11:49,302 --> 00:11:50,450
Are you upset?

190
00:11:54,536 --> 00:11:56,003
What are you doing? That's your bus.

191
00:11:56,098 --> 00:11:56,903
Aren't you getting on?

192
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,317
No, I'm not.

193
00:11:59,402 --> 00:12:00,402
Why not?

194
00:12:02,302 --> 00:12:04,569
I have to drop you off at your work first.

195
00:12:08,332 --> 00:12:12,170
Cling onto me, ask me to take
you around and protect you.

196
00:12:12,475 --> 00:12:13,575
I'll try to do it.

197
00:12:14,447 --> 00:12:18,271
Well... if it makes you relieved,
I'll give it a try.

198
00:12:24,594 --> 00:12:25,627
That was real.

199
00:12:26,611 --> 00:12:27,621
It's for real.

200
00:12:29,035 --> 00:12:30,394
I told you it's for real.

201
00:12:53,847 --> 00:12:55,016
It's here, let's go.

202
00:13:03,202 --> 00:13:04,836
What are you doing?
You're going to be late.

203
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:52,803
"City of the Blinds"

204
00:13:57,926 --> 00:14:00,188
Two boxes of business cards?

205
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:04,556
All the people in the prosecutor's
offices were changed while you were gone.

206
00:14:04,641 --> 00:14:07,949
Two boxes may not be enough
if you're going to visit them one by one.

207
00:14:08,034 --> 00:14:08,729
Okay.

208
00:14:10,698 --> 00:14:12,998
It's starting for real now.

209
00:14:13,097 --> 00:14:15,497
I'm going to watch what
kind of items you bring in.

210
00:14:15,582 --> 00:14:17,939
Police, prosecutor, firemen, and patrols.

211
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,673
What they are investigating
and what's their top list.

212
00:14:20,758 --> 00:14:22,698
You must be aware
of every little detail, okay?

213
00:14:22,783 --> 00:14:23,858
Even the patrols?

214
00:14:24,491 --> 00:14:25,293
You don't want to?

215
00:14:26,206 --> 00:14:27,772
No, I love it.

216
00:14:28,298 --> 00:14:31,220
I feel like I've gone back to
being a freshman and feel young.

217
00:14:32,397 --> 00:14:34,165
Shall I report to you every
two hours like I'm a freshman?

218
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,465
Sounds good.

219
00:14:36,598 --> 00:14:38,113
Wow, I give up.

220
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:39,311
This mouth of mine...

221
00:14:42,003 --> 00:14:43,023
Welcome.

222
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:45,184
Hello, we're here again.

223
00:14:49,498 --> 00:14:50,686
Hongjoo isn't here.

224
00:14:50,771 --> 00:14:52,307
It's fine, we didn't come for Hongjoo.

225
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,598
We came for pork belly.

226
00:14:53,683 --> 00:14:58,050
I haven't had breakfast, so I should
eat some pork to keep me going.

227
00:14:59,154 --> 00:15:02,283
And we don't need any cash receipts.

228
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:06,658
A tough man won't ask
for a bill or a coupon stamp...

229
00:15:06,743 --> 00:15:08,565
We don't ask for such things.

230
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,553
We're done with those.

231
00:15:09,638 --> 00:15:12,498
What's wrong with
asking for cash receipts?

232
00:15:12,598 --> 00:15:16,745
It's a fair trade that
a police officer should be aware of.

233
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:24,023
Hey, what should we do?

234
00:15:24,108 --> 00:15:25,232
Did I make another mistake?

235
00:15:25,317 --> 00:15:27,760
Please...

236
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,242
Han Wootak.

237
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,211
I mean, Lieutenant Han,
nice to see you here.

238
00:15:46,296 --> 00:15:47,407
What are you doing here?

239
00:15:47,492 --> 00:15:48,994
You two know each other?

240
00:15:49,145 --> 00:15:50,575
You got hired?

241
00:15:50,665 --> 00:15:52,913
No, I got my old job back.

242
00:15:53,426 --> 00:15:57,038
I can't be pretty all my life,
I have to work.

243
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,603
SBC reporter?

244
00:15:59,456 --> 00:16:00,551
You were a reporter?

245
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:03,027
Wow, I'm sorry I didn't know.

246
00:16:03,126 --> 00:16:04,360
How do they know each other?

247
00:16:04,445 --> 00:16:07,355
I don't think they do...

248
00:16:07,851 --> 00:16:08,652
What?

249
00:16:10,162 --> 00:16:13,045
Do they know each other very well?

250
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:21,464
Hey, don't you have anything
on the top list in your office?

251
00:16:21,762 --> 00:16:24,581
I have to report to my senior,
but I have nothing to report.

252
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,055
Oh my...

253
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,594
I need something to report.

254
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:33,501
Yes, it's Nam Hongjoo.

255
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,358
I'm here at the third patrol.

256
00:16:36,827 --> 00:16:37,949
Something to report?

257
00:16:39,226 --> 00:16:40,768
We have a case of a street cat
that was murdered.

258
00:16:40,853 --> 00:16:43,327
Yes, a street cat was killed.

259
00:16:44,151 --> 00:16:46,821
-It's a serial murder case.
-Yes, it's a serial murder case.

260
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:49,271
The number of cats
that's been killed so far...

261
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,394
Around 100...

262
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:52,582
100?

263
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:55,693
Over 100 cats.

264
00:16:56,193 --> 00:16:57,053
Yes, sir.

265
00:16:58,326 --> 00:17:01,051
Okay, sir.

266
00:17:05,193 --> 00:17:05,860
I'm here, sir.

267
00:17:05,945 --> 00:17:07,160
Welcome.

268
00:17:09,827 --> 00:17:10,927
Hello.

269
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,014
I don't see Prosecutor Shin.

270
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,360
She went to monitor
the death benefit fraud case.

271
00:17:15,445 --> 00:17:16,413
Death benefit fraud case?

272
00:17:16,498 --> 00:17:18,760
Yes, it's relevant to you as well.

273
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:19,842
With me?

274
00:17:19,927 --> 00:17:22,583
Yes, I was here during
your duty last time.

275
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,705
There was a car accident then,
so I went to examine it.

276
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,599
Yes, I know.

277
00:17:26,693 --> 00:17:29,527
But, it wasn't a simple car accident.

278
00:17:30,127 --> 00:17:31,427
Shall I conduct an autopsy?

279
00:17:31,527 --> 00:17:34,061
No, no autopsy.

280
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:38,427
The brother was against autopsy,
so I had no other choice...

281
00:17:38,527 --> 00:17:41,428
...but to give an order to pass
the deceased one to his family.

282
00:17:41,513 --> 00:17:43,815
But after I investigated it,...

283
00:17:44,093 --> 00:17:47,373
...the guy put 2.7 billion won
on the deceased's insurance.

284
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,800
I had the creeps after hearing that.

285
00:17:50,231 --> 00:17:51,821
He cried so hard for the dead.

286
00:17:51,906 --> 00:17:54,522
But he killed them and
pretended to cry like that.

287
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:57,853
He probably gave it all on
his acting for the 2.7 billion.

288
00:17:57,938 --> 00:18:01,007
Still, how could he
kill a person for money?

289
00:18:01,092 --> 00:18:02,471
His brother at that.

290
00:18:04,326 --> 00:18:08,927
Mr. Kang has registered his
younger brother and sister under...

291
00:18:09,012 --> 00:18:12,994
...a big death benefit insurance
and faked a car accident...

292
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,888
Is the accused's last name, Kang?

293
00:18:15,005 --> 00:18:17,254
Yes, how do you know that?

294
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:18,588
That's right, it's Kang Daehee.

295
00:18:19,026 --> 00:18:21,744
Is the case where he killed both
his younger brother and sister?

296
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:24,860
No, just his brother. His sister is alive.

297
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,282
His sister is alive?

298
00:18:26,367 --> 00:18:26,948
Yes.

299
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,060
But how do you know
that he has a younger sister?

300
00:18:33,593 --> 00:18:34,481
You saw his file?

301
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,927
No, I may have been
confused with another case.

302
00:18:38,593 --> 00:18:41,194
Do you think there's a chance for
him to be innocent for this case?

303
00:18:41,293 --> 00:18:42,884
No way.

304
00:18:42,969 --> 00:18:45,461
He already confessed that he
killed him while we were investing.

305
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,396
Not a denial but a confession.

306
00:18:46,481 --> 00:18:49,217
So, why did you conduct
another direct investigation then?

307
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:52,894
His attorney is Lee Yoobum.

308
00:19:01,697 --> 00:19:03,464
Hi, Prosecutor Shin. Hi, Pilsoon.

309
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,960
Hi.

310
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:10,375
You must've prepared a lot for the trial.

311
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,171
Of course I did.

312
00:19:12,256 --> 00:19:15,523
You should politely say
no at this moment.

313
00:19:15,608 --> 00:19:18,362
It's only polite to prepare a lot
when I have to go against you.

314
00:19:19,396 --> 00:19:20,830
Today's trial is a bit unique.

315
00:19:20,915 --> 00:19:21,902
Pick one.

316
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:26,489
Yes, a female jury and all
the panels are women as well.

317
00:19:26,686 --> 00:19:29,608
It's the first time for me to see
two women juries to be in a trial.

318
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:33,842
It doesn't feel quite right.

319
00:19:34,593 --> 00:19:36,048
But it should all be fair, right?

320
00:19:37,724 --> 00:19:39,778
What doesn't feel so right?

321
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:40,831
Pardon?

322
00:19:42,663 --> 00:19:47,280
What's wrong with female juries?

323
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,256
By any chance...

324
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,059
...are you the Assistant Chief Jury,
Kim Jooyoung?

325
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:55,660
It's nice to meet you.

326
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:59,979
No, it's not that it doesn't feel
quite right but it's rather unique.

327
00:20:00,064 --> 00:20:01,932
I'm used to seeing male juries...

328
00:20:02,017 --> 00:20:02,951
Exactly.

329
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:07,948
When all jury were men,
you didn't say anything about fairness.

330
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:12,233
So, why mention about
fairness when they're all women?

331
00:20:13,162 --> 00:20:19,526
Aren't male jury more likely
to be unfair than female jury?

332
00:20:21,523 --> 00:20:23,822
I don't really understand what you said.

333
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:28,469
That's true.

334
00:20:28,846 --> 00:20:32,118
If all the jury were men...

335
00:20:32,203 --> 00:20:34,706
...being fair should not
only apply to women...

336
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,058
I'm sorry.

337
00:20:36,143 --> 00:20:38,270
It seems like she
already doesn't like you.

338
00:20:38,355 --> 00:20:42,029
Yes. I may lose to Prosecutor Shin today.

339
00:20:42,114 --> 00:20:45,082
That has nothing to do with
what just happened.

340
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:48,614
"Trial in progress"

341
00:20:52,402 --> 00:20:55,631
You said you place bets after
seeing the chances, right?

342
00:20:56,101 --> 00:20:56,902
Yes.

343
00:20:57,011 --> 00:20:58,556
What are the odds?

344
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,381
99 to 1?

345
00:21:03,217 --> 00:21:04,160
We're one?

346
00:21:04,245 --> 00:21:05,746
All rise.

347
00:21:21,941 --> 00:21:22,886
Straighten your shoulders.

348
00:21:23,396 --> 00:21:24,811
We're the 99.

349
00:21:26,627 --> 00:21:28,655
The chance of being
guilty is 99 percent, of course.

350
00:21:28,972 --> 00:21:31,172
I deducted 1 percent since
Yoobum is the attorney.

351
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:33,858
In fact, it's 100 percent guilty.

352
00:21:33,943 --> 00:21:35,811
Do you really think there's no
chance for him to be innocent?

353
00:21:35,896 --> 00:21:38,330
What's wrong with you?

354
00:21:38,623 --> 00:21:40,090
Is there something you know?

355
00:21:40,612 --> 00:21:43,446
We just have to be careful
with every single thing...

356
00:21:43,531 --> 00:21:46,165
You're not being careful,
but you're stepping all over my heart...

357
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,550
...so you can walk over me.

358
00:21:48,793 --> 00:21:52,088
Hey. I'm in big trouble if he's innocent.

359
00:21:52,173 --> 00:21:56,005
I feel uneasy especially since I haven't
even dissected the deceased's body.

360
00:22:01,476 --> 00:22:03,088
Stop sighing...

361
00:22:04,413 --> 00:22:05,446
We can do it.

362
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:06,539
We can do it.

363
00:22:06,624 --> 00:22:09,824
Prosecutor, please state
your point to the charge.

364
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:10,576
Sure.

365
00:22:11,802 --> 00:22:13,212
The accused Kang Daehee,

366
00:22:13,357 --> 00:22:17,824
registered his siblings as insurant
since June 2015 and set himself,

367
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:21,071
as the beneficiary for over 31
life insurances and has been paying over,

368
00:22:21,156 --> 00:22:24,505
...4 million per month for insurances.

369
00:22:25,847 --> 00:22:28,837
His income source had gone wrong
when his stocks investments...

370
00:22:28,922 --> 00:22:34,114
...went wrong and to get the death
benefits from the insurances...

371
00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:37,933
...he decided to falsify a car accident in
which his brother ended up being killed.

372
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:46,600
On March 28 at 9 PM...

373
00:22:46,685 --> 00:22:51,175
...the accused was on his way
to send his brother home ...

374
00:22:51,326 --> 00:22:55,121
...and killed his brother by intentionally
driving into the entrance of the tunnel.

375
00:22:56,612 --> 00:23:02,635
Also, the accused has reported false
information on the fake car accident...

376
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,294
...to seven insurance companies
and claimed total of 2.7 billion.

377
00:23:08,035 --> 00:23:12,035
The accused, based on Criminal Law
Article 250, is charged with murder.

378
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,287
Criminal Law Article 337-1 adds...

379
00:23:14,372 --> 00:23:17,340
...fraud to his crimes and shall
be prosecuted based on these.

380
00:23:20,428 --> 00:23:23,962
Attorney Lee, do you admit to the charges?

381
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:33,391
No, I plead not guilty
to the entire charges.

382
00:23:35,774 --> 00:23:36,734
The accused...

383
00:23:39,224 --> 00:23:40,319
...claims innocence to all charges.

384
00:23:57,733 --> 00:23:59,708
Kang Daehee is claiming
innocence to all his charges?

385
00:23:59,793 --> 00:24:04,708
Yes, I was worried that he'd
beg for mercy but I'm glad.

386
00:24:04,793 --> 00:24:06,265
It's easier to prosecute now.

387
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,311
Yoobum is being
reckless this time.

388
00:24:08,396 --> 00:24:10,030
It's a confession case,
so why bother flipping it around?

389
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,194
Well...

390
00:24:11,323 --> 00:24:13,880
Don't you think Attorney Lee
made him confess for a reason?

391
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:17,213
They tend to investigate less
when a confession is made.

392
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:20,050
Prosecutor Jung, what's wrong with you?

393
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,106
You said something
like this last time as well.

394
00:24:23,191 --> 00:24:24,037
Well...

395
00:24:24,393 --> 00:24:26,231
It sounds quite reasonable this time.

396
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:28,061
Confession could've been a strategy.

397
00:24:28,146 --> 00:24:31,303
They investigate less and
can prove better in the trial.

398
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:33,200
You think that way, too?

399
00:24:33,285 --> 00:24:35,387
Put your heart down.

400
00:24:35,687 --> 00:24:36,588
Chief Park.

401
00:24:37,946 --> 00:24:39,397
Why are you praying alone?

402
00:24:41,031 --> 00:24:44,479
Let's all pray separately from now on.

403
00:24:45,238 --> 00:24:50,135
Prosecutor Shin, don't ignore his advice.

404
00:24:51,486 --> 00:24:52,926
Yes, sir.

405
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:55,426
Prosecutor Jung.

406
00:24:56,072 --> 00:25:00,084
Thank you for your advice.

407
00:25:00,424 --> 00:25:02,191
I thought those advice can only be made...

408
00:25:02,276 --> 00:25:04,443
...by those who have
over 20 years of experience.

409
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,464
But it's only been few months for you.

410
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:09,216
So, how could you possibly
give such experienced advice?

411
00:25:11,674 --> 00:25:13,074
I really want to learn.

412
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,570
That was a compliment, right?

413
00:25:25,226 --> 00:25:28,299
What compliment?
She said that to make me look bad.

414
00:25:28,384 --> 00:25:30,551
Why do you twist her words around?

415
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,404
Maybe she really wants to learn.

416
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,282
She meant that I crossed
the line and should stop.

417
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,774
How do you not understand?

418
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:38,578
What's your score in literature?

419
00:25:39,435 --> 00:25:41,906
Why are you getting mad at me?
My goodness.

420
00:25:42,524 --> 00:25:44,577
I dream a lot about
your brother these days.

421
00:25:44,703 --> 00:25:47,512
So I get to see a lot of things
that are happening in your house.

422
00:25:50,762 --> 00:25:54,581
Yes, I shouldn't get mad at you.

423
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:55,631
What's wrong with you suddenly?

424
00:25:56,074 --> 00:25:56,942
Is someone here?

425
00:25:57,027 --> 00:26:00,035
Lift up your feet.
I need to vacuum there.

426
00:26:03,403 --> 00:26:04,526
What's with your hair?

427
00:26:04,611 --> 00:26:06,945
Your hair's messy at home.

428
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,135
You put on BB cream as well?

429
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,390
I didn't.

430
00:26:09,491 --> 00:26:10,804
No.

431
00:26:10,889 --> 00:26:12,875
You did.

432
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,327
Why would you put BB cream at home?

433
00:26:15,637 --> 00:26:17,471
Is it because Hongjoo's dream?

434
00:26:17,556 --> 00:26:20,390
Be quiet, you little punk.

435
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,214
I'm right.

436
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,727
That's why you're cleaning and...

437
00:26:25,827 --> 00:26:27,261
...wearing clothes that you
usually don't wear at home.

438
00:26:27,346 --> 00:26:29,446
You're really putting on quite the show.

439
00:26:29,531 --> 00:26:30,752
This little punk.

440
00:26:30,837 --> 00:26:34,171
I've already seen everything,
so just behave as you usually do.

441
00:26:34,263 --> 00:26:38,861
Don't pretend to be neat and have
your brother talk trash about you.

442
00:26:40,742 --> 00:26:42,278
She dreamed about this already...

443
00:26:42,363 --> 00:26:44,453
She's like a human surveillance camera.

444
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:48,173
This is crazy.

445
00:26:50,621 --> 00:26:52,095
I'm seriously getting dizzy.

446
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,512
Okay.

447
00:26:54,597 --> 00:26:56,697
What's happening to the Sangbu-dong
street cat serial killing?

448
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,316
Any update?

449
00:26:58,415 --> 00:27:01,962
After investigating, it was only
one to two cats few months ago.

450
00:27:02,047 --> 00:27:03,863
But now it's gotten much more.

451
00:27:03,948 --> 00:27:07,025
And now there's over
100 cats that's been killed.

452
00:27:08,074 --> 00:27:09,008
Who's the perpetrator?

453
00:27:09,107 --> 00:27:12,689
None of the cats have external
bruises but all died of poison.

454
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:15,074
Police thinks there's one suspect.

455
00:27:15,174 --> 00:27:17,269
Keep reporting on that
until the suspect is caught.

456
00:27:17,354 --> 00:27:19,390
Do I have to follow such a case?

457
00:27:19,475 --> 00:27:22,009
It's something like the TV show
Animal Farm should show.

458
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:22,641
Really?

459
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,767
I think there's
possibility of a story here.

460
00:27:24,942 --> 00:27:27,655
It's like a pre-warning before
the serial killing and...

461
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,342
...one of the typical signs
is animal abuse.

462
00:27:30,508 --> 00:27:33,182
It's like a rehearsal before
the actual serial killing on people.

463
00:27:33,414 --> 00:27:35,761
He's someone who killed over 100 cats.

464
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:38,637
Am I the only one who's curious
who the suspect is and...

465
00:27:38,722 --> 00:27:40,855
...what kind of traits he has?

466
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,475
That's right, I'm also curious.

467
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,316
He has a point.

468
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,444
What's wrong with everyone?

469
00:27:47,529 --> 00:27:50,433
I also want to cover humans and not cats.

470
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:05,775
Jaechan...

471
00:28:07,031 --> 00:28:09,917
If you've seen this
moment in your dream...

472
00:28:31,974 --> 00:28:33,211
Why is...

473
00:28:34,408 --> 00:28:35,329
...Kang Daehee...

474
00:28:45,007 --> 00:28:48,282
A guy named Kang Daehee
attacked me in your dream?

475
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,080
What case are you're covering these days?

476
00:28:51,224 --> 00:28:54,509
Anything dangerous or something
that may lead to grudges?

477
00:28:54,806 --> 00:28:56,635
Anything relevant to
death benefit insurances?

478
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:58,541
Not at all.

479
00:28:58,942 --> 00:29:02,324
Not human, but I'm covering street cats.

480
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:03,675
Street cats?

481
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,882
Yes, someone killed the cats with
potassium and they told me to cover that.

482
00:29:08,274 --> 00:29:09,559
That's a relief.

483
00:29:09,837 --> 00:29:10,975
That's not a relief.

484
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:14,022
They treat me like a complete freshman
because I just got back to work.

485
00:29:14,107 --> 00:29:16,388
It's still better than
something dangerous.

486
00:29:17,134 --> 00:29:18,474
What's with your reaction?

487
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,772
Aren't you worried that I had
a dream of you dying as a reporter?

488
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,580
This could be the dream.

489
00:29:22,796 --> 00:29:24,466
At least it's not this dream.

490
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:27,775
Was that place...

491
00:29:29,274 --> 00:29:30,775
...in the mountain?

492
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:31,697
No.

493
00:29:32,908 --> 00:29:35,308
By any chance,
did you see a green umbrella?

494
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:36,643
No.

495
00:29:38,074 --> 00:29:39,453
See?
It's not that.

496
00:29:39,697 --> 00:29:40,977
It's okay as long as it's not that dream.

497
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:46,942
And I let go of my worries and fears...

498
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:49,875
...when I crossed the road
holding your hand.

499
00:29:50,075 --> 00:29:51,456
Otherwise, I can't be a reporter.

500
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:55,109
You've changed.

501
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:56,402
Thanks to you.

502
00:30:02,015 --> 00:30:03,598
Kang Daehee is in trial right...

503
00:30:03,683 --> 00:30:06,006
...and a smart prosecutor named
Shin Heemin is in charge of it.

504
00:30:06,091 --> 00:30:07,535
So, he won't be free.

505
00:30:07,842 --> 00:30:09,215
No need to worry.

506
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:12,922
However, you have to
promise me one thing.

507
00:30:14,088 --> 00:30:15,090
Promise?

508
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:19,942
So annoying...

509
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:23,370
I hear it's bad news when records
are spilled before the trial...

510
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:26,431
It could've been worse.

511
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:28,742
This is all because of Prosecutor Jung.

512
00:30:28,836 --> 00:30:30,571
Him and his big mouth...

513
00:30:33,677 --> 00:30:36,968
Jeez. I'm sorry for my big mouth.

514
00:30:38,475 --> 00:30:39,076
What?

515
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:41,409
You want to see the record and criticize?

516
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,774
I know you'll do well today,
but please do your best.

517
00:30:45,859 --> 00:30:47,875
Are you teasing me or what?

518
00:30:47,974 --> 00:30:49,256
How ridiculous.

519
00:30:49,341 --> 00:30:51,908
I'm sincerely cheering you on.

520
00:30:59,246 --> 00:31:03,747
You have to make sure
that Kang Daehee is acquitted as guilty.

521
00:31:12,074 --> 00:31:13,146
Okay.

522
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:23,608
Gosh. Are you okay?

523
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:24,942
You did that on purpose, right?

524
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:25,909
No, I didn't do it on purpose.

525
00:31:26,007 --> 00:31:27,341
I'll help.

526
00:31:27,408 --> 00:31:28,276
Go.

527
00:31:30,174 --> 00:31:31,008
Are you okay?

528
00:31:31,108 --> 00:31:32,251
No, I'm not.

529
00:31:58,908 --> 00:32:01,561
Prosecutor Lee, what are you doing here?

530
00:32:02,277 --> 00:32:03,421
I had some free time...

531
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:06,353
You came because you were nervous
about him not being charged, right?

532
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,194
What do you mean?
I believe in Prosecutor Shin.

533
00:32:16,508 --> 00:32:19,211
On the day his brother died,
accused Kang Daehee...

534
00:32:19,296 --> 00:32:22,120
...has searched the following
things on his phone.

535
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,386
We can tell his motives...

536
00:32:24,471 --> 00:32:27,669
...on why he killed and his paths
when we link all his search words.

537
00:32:27,754 --> 00:32:31,344
He has intentionally gone to Domun Tunnel
for the accident to kill his brother...

538
00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:33,690
...and has looked for any
witnesses at the crime scene after that.

539
00:32:33,775 --> 00:32:36,707
And he was scared that
his motive will be revealed...

540
00:32:36,792 --> 00:32:39,508
...if the body goes under autopsy,
so he researched on how to avoid it.

541
00:32:40,074 --> 00:32:43,074
He hurried with cremating
the dead body and has searched...

542
00:32:43,174 --> 00:32:47,020
...for how to claim insurance for
the deceased during the funeral.

543
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:48,631
And finally...

544
00:32:50,208 --> 00:32:55,065
...he has claimed 2.7 billion in the price
of his dead brother.

545
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,410
What a trash.

546
00:33:01,026 --> 00:33:04,641
It becomes a crime scenario
if you assume that he killed him...

547
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:07,708
...and link all these key words.

548
00:33:07,942 --> 00:33:10,643
However, if he didn't kill him
and we look again at these search words...

549
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:12,931
...it will paint a different story.

550
00:33:15,521 --> 00:33:16,889
The accused didn't want to ruin...

551
00:33:16,974 --> 00:33:20,775
...the dead body and wanted to pay
respect to his beloved brother.

552
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:24,090
That's why he searched
how not to go through autopsy...

553
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:25,908
Due to financial reasons...

554
00:33:26,007 --> 00:33:29,007
...he couldn't hold the funeral for long,
so he had to shorten the funeral...

555
00:33:29,272 --> 00:33:31,464
...as it costs less and searched
for how to cremate the body.

556
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:33,166
Although he was sad
due to his brother's passing...

557
00:33:33,283 --> 00:33:35,613
...he was having a hard time
trying to survive without money...

558
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:37,775
...and came to think of
the insurance money.

559
00:33:37,879 --> 00:33:39,442
He thought of the insurance...

560
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,839
...as the last gift from his brother.

561
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,581
Thus, the reason why he searched
for all these keywords.

562
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:47,042
This also makes sense, right?

563
00:33:47,575 --> 00:33:49,030
That makes no sense.

564
00:33:53,145 --> 00:33:56,941
His difficult financial status has won
over his sadness of losing his brother.

565
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:00,032
So, how could he pay 4 million monthly
for the insurance?

566
00:34:00,949 --> 00:34:05,276
The accused has often paid
penalties for not wearing seat belts.

567
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:07,011
But on the day of the accident...

568
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:09,142
...he was the only one who
wore his seat belt...

569
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:10,831
...and his brother wasn't wearing it.

570
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:12,265
Could this have been a coincidence?

571
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,675
After paying many penalties for it,
he has worn it that day.

572
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:21,025
Then, how do you explain how he still
paid penalties even after the accident?

573
00:34:21,241 --> 00:34:22,927
That's right.

574
00:34:24,575 --> 00:34:25,430
I'm sorry.

575
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:34,941
Sleepy?

576
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:39,611
Yes, I'm going to get some sleep.

577
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,914
I had a lot of work today,
so I'm a bit tired.

578
00:34:44,074 --> 00:34:45,350
Yes, get some sleep.

579
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:47,952
I'll wake you up when we get there.

580
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:50,480
As you can see...

581
00:34:50,575 --> 00:34:54,936
...the dashcam in the car was moved
to face the sky instead of forward.

582
00:34:55,021 --> 00:34:58,278
What was it that he didn't want to record?

583
00:34:58,363 --> 00:35:01,332
If he didn't want to record it,
he should've removed it.

584
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:08,406
As you can hear form the recording,
the brothers were in a good relationship.

585
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,511
There's one thing that's strange.

586
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:18,683
Why didn't you want an autopsy?

587
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:20,084
There's no special reason...

588
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:23,154
...to skip out on the autopsy
if it was a car accident.

589
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:25,657
There is...

590
00:35:26,908 --> 00:35:27,926
...a reason.

591
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:29,727
What is it?

592
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:32,964
He didn't die from the accident.

593
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,791
You were the first to arrive at
the scene of the accident, right?

594
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,853
Can you describe how
it was during the rescue?

595
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,809
The driver's seat was okay.

596
00:35:49,894 --> 00:35:52,325
But the passenger's seat
was completely destroyed...

597
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:53,823
...because it ran into
the entrance of the tunnel.

598
00:35:53,908 --> 00:35:56,894
So I couldn't really tell the condition.

599
00:35:57,148 --> 00:36:01,074
The driver, the accused who's sitting
over there. Was he conscious?

600
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,142
Yes.

601
00:36:02,227 --> 00:36:04,960
Did he ask to save his brother
who was at the passenger's seat?

602
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,030
No.

603
00:36:08,308 --> 00:36:09,375
That's all.

604
00:36:12,808 --> 00:36:17,509
I have read the medical record
and it said he didn't bleed much.

605
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,527
The accident was big
enough to completely destroy...

606
00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:22,742
...the passenger's seat and
yet he didn't bleed...

607
00:36:23,513 --> 00:36:24,842
Doesn't that sound odd?

608
00:36:26,174 --> 00:36:29,741
The accident is big and
yet he didn't bleed much.

609
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:34,040
What do you think it means to
have big scars but not much blood?

610
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:39,612
That's possible when the scar
is made after the death.

611
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:42,509
Your honor.

612
00:36:42,608 --> 00:36:45,585
The attorney is asking questions
based on hypothetical statements.

613
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:50,641
I'm only making a point that the victim
did not die from the car accident.

614
00:36:50,726 --> 00:36:53,543
The victim didn't die
from the car accident?

615
00:36:53,641 --> 00:36:54,790
The claim by the prosecutor...

616
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:58,883
...that the victim died in a car
accident sounds more like...

617
00:36:59,942 --> 00:37:01,619
...a hypothetical statement
than the truth.

618
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:08,426
Then, please provide
evidence to your claim.

619
00:37:10,374 --> 00:37:14,774
The victim's body temperature
right after the accident was 35C.

620
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,542
Isn't this too low to be considered
as a temperature right after death?

621
00:37:17,641 --> 00:37:18,318
Yes.

622
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:21,667
It usually drops 1 degree per hour
after death...

623
00:37:21,752 --> 00:37:23,984
This means that the differences
were more than 1.5 Celsius.

624
00:37:24,069 --> 00:37:26,778
Which means that it has been more
than one hour since his death, right?

625
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:27,942
Yes.

626
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:30,437
It was recorded that
his oxygen level was 0.

627
00:37:30,771 --> 00:37:33,771
Is it a normal reading right after death?

628
00:37:33,856 --> 00:37:35,590
No, not usually.

629
00:37:35,675 --> 00:37:37,950
It should take more than
an hour to reach zero.

630
00:37:38,067 --> 00:37:39,736
All the records here prove that...

631
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:44,929
... the victim died
before the car accident.

632
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,408
This is not a hypothetical statement.

633
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:03,109
"According to Attorney Lee, the victim
didn't die from the accident."

634
00:38:03,194 --> 00:38:04,895
"He died before the accident."

635
00:38:05,524 --> 00:38:07,156
Attorney Lee is claiming that...

636
00:38:07,241 --> 00:38:10,083
...the victim didn't die
from the accident.

637
00:38:10,168 --> 00:38:11,502
That he died before the accident.

638
00:38:11,587 --> 00:38:12,638
Really?

639
00:38:12,894 --> 00:38:17,189
Yes, didn't you go to examine as well?

640
00:38:17,274 --> 00:38:17,775
Yes.

641
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,839
You said it was a simple car accident.

642
00:38:19,924 --> 00:38:24,569
It was a simple car accident,
but the victim didn't bleed much.

643
00:38:25,208 --> 00:38:27,687
He's holding on to that.

644
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:31,006
Whether he died from
the accident or not...

645
00:38:31,091 --> 00:38:33,892
...the victim was killed for
the benefit insurances, right?

646
00:38:33,977 --> 00:38:37,415
No, if that's the case,
everything changes.

647
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:39,775
My gosh.

648
00:38:40,078 --> 00:38:41,807
Look, the prosecutor...

649
00:38:41,892 --> 00:38:44,199
...already prosecuted him for killing
in the car accident, right?

650
00:38:44,284 --> 00:38:46,666
If this was not a car accident
that killed the victim...

651
00:38:46,751 --> 00:38:49,289
...no matter how the victim died,
this trial will state an acquittal.

652
00:38:49,374 --> 00:38:53,523
Let's just say that the victim
died of something else.

653
00:38:53,608 --> 00:38:55,289
The victim was in the car...

654
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:58,485
...before and after the accident and
it was only them in the car.

655
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,718
Then, there's only one person
that is likely to have killed him.

656
00:39:00,803 --> 00:39:02,685
So how could that plead innocence?

657
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:05,169
He could've died of a heart attack.

658
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:13,269
On the day of the incident, the victim
had a tough day delivering mails.

659
00:39:13,418 --> 00:39:16,836
And while sleeping in the car, the
victim could've died of a heart attack.

660
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:19,139
And after his death,
the car accident probably happened.

661
00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:21,638
-It doesn't make sense.
-Not completely.

662
00:39:21,723 --> 00:39:25,905
I personally would like to know how
the victim died in this case as well.

663
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:28,833
It really is a pity.

664
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:31,002
If only we went through an autopsy...

665
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:33,237
...either of us will have
a solid evidence by now.

666
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:36,304
However, neither of us
have a solid evidence...

667
00:39:36,403 --> 00:39:41,027
...so any indirect evidences
should not have any contradiction.

668
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,520
However, the victim's body temperature...

669
00:39:42,605 --> 00:39:44,904
...oxygen saturation level, and
statement from the emergency personnel...

670
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:48,819
...all contradict to what
the prosecutor said.

671
00:39:51,423 --> 00:39:52,614
Of course, the incident...

672
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:56,457
...may give a thought that
accused killed his brother.

673
00:39:56,557 --> 00:39:59,199
However, even if there is
a 99 percent of confidence he’s guilty...

674
00:39:59,423 --> 00:40:03,364
...and there is even 1 percent chance of
a victim's death by heart attack...

675
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:06,986
...the accused
needs to be deemed innocent.

676
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:27,900
If it wasn't the car accident,
then how did you kill him?

677
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,594
Potassium cyanide.

678
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:34,557
At first, the street cats
were making so much noise...

679
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:37,001
...so I fed it to the cats to kill them.

680
00:40:38,056 --> 00:40:39,890
And the results were immediate.

681
00:40:40,223 --> 00:40:41,105
100 percent success rate.

682
00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:43,324
Why would you do that to your brother?

683
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:47,757
The car accident is not a guarantee.

684
00:40:47,989 --> 00:40:50,314
I'll be in trouble if he
regains consciousness...

685
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:52,357
That's why I used
potassium cyanide poison.

686
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:54,719
I'll feel better
if it's completely guaranteed.

687
00:40:55,423 --> 00:40:56,654
The police don't know this?

688
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:58,375
Yes.

689
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:00,458
Of course not.

690
00:41:00,757 --> 00:41:02,727
I cremated the body before autopsy.

691
00:41:13,123 --> 00:41:15,160
It's obvious that Kang Daehee
killed his brother.

692
00:41:15,245 --> 00:41:17,077
But do we have to
accept that he's innocent?

693
00:41:17,162 --> 00:41:19,248
We prosecuted him wrong,
so what can we do?

694
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:21,847
If it's not the car accident,
then what is it?

695
00:41:22,053 --> 00:41:24,486
I know it doesn't matter now.

696
00:41:25,476 --> 00:41:27,154
But why didn't you do an autopsy?

697
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:30,346
This is all because you didn't do that.

698
00:41:30,851 --> 00:41:31,926
That's because...

699
00:41:34,463 --> 00:41:37,447
All the doctors and police
said it was a car accident.

700
00:41:37,532 --> 00:41:39,454
The deceased's family
was crying in sadness.

701
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:40,829
So how could we ask to dissect...

702
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:44,144
...the naked corpse when it was
a difficult thing to ask the family?

703
00:41:44,229 --> 00:41:45,940
Everybody will find it hard
to make that request.

704
00:41:47,863 --> 00:41:50,442
Can't we issue another warrant
on the day of his release?

705
00:41:50,663 --> 00:41:52,732
He'll commit a bigger crime
if he's released like this.

706
00:41:52,848 --> 00:41:56,331
What can we issue a warrant for
when we don't know how he died?

707
00:41:56,429 --> 00:41:57,981
-Sir.
-Sir.

708
00:41:58,066 --> 00:42:00,910
I don't want to release
the suspect either.

709
00:42:00,995 --> 00:42:02,230
That doesn't mean we can...

710
00:42:02,315 --> 00:42:05,055
...ignore all the laws and issue
a warrant on nothing and arrest him.

711
00:42:05,407 --> 00:42:06,696
This is bad.

712
00:42:07,296 --> 00:42:09,763
The suspect will be innocent if we
don't know how the victim died.

713
00:42:13,722 --> 00:42:16,767
Han River District Court,
Criminal Investigation Department 2...

714
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,898
...will now announce the verdict.

715
00:42:20,029 --> 00:42:24,909
2016, case number 2029,
to this murder case...

716
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:28,963
...the accused Kang Daehee...

717
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:32,532
... is  claiming that he didn't falsify
the car accident killing.

718
00:42:32,617 --> 00:42:36,863
But is claiming that the victim
was dead before the accident...

719
00:42:36,962 --> 00:42:39,357
...and he's denying on the charge
of murdering the victim.

720
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:44,302
According to the evidence that
the prosecutor has submitted...

721
00:42:44,387 --> 00:42:49,831
...the accused has put a huge amount
of insurances under the victim.

722
00:42:50,403 --> 00:42:52,803
Despite his difficult financial status...

723
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:56,155
...he has put in a tremendous
amount for insurance every month...

724
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,975
...and has maintained this
unreasonable amount of insurances.

725
00:42:58,108 --> 00:42:59,131
He has also claimed...

726
00:42:59,216 --> 00:43:02,033
...the death benefits during
his own brother's funeral...

727
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:06,397
...and facts subject to judgment
do exist in indirect presumptions.

728
00:43:08,496 --> 00:43:10,221
However, in this case...

729
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:14,058
...we are unsure if the victim
was killed in the car accident...

730
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:18,444
...and we are also uncertain if
the motive of the accused is clear.

731
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:21,663
We still have many questions remaining
on this case.

732
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:25,136
With the above indirect presumptions...

733
00:43:25,531 --> 00:43:28,706
...the charge does not have
enough evidence.

734
00:43:28,965 --> 00:43:32,576
There is no direct
evidence to prove the case.

735
00:43:35,831 --> 00:43:37,815
The charge to this case only applies to...

736
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,652
...when the crime has no other evidence.

737
00:43:42,498 --> 00:43:46,074
By the later part of
Criminal Law Article 325...

738
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:49,564
...I hereby pronounce the accused
as innocent from those charges.

739
00:44:04,865 --> 00:44:06,110
That dirty jerk.

740
00:44:08,613 --> 00:44:11,148
I had to shake hands with such jerk...

741
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,064
You've gotten old, Lee Yoobum.

742
00:44:33,164 --> 00:44:34,032
Yoobum.

743
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:37,898
What is it?

744
00:44:38,068 --> 00:44:38,958
You followed me?

745
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:40,497
Kang Daehee is innocent of all charges.

746
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:43,216
The case is done so please tell me.

747
00:44:43,301 --> 00:44:45,264
How did he die if the car
accident didn't kill him?

748
00:44:45,664 --> 00:44:46,508
You know, right?

749
00:44:56,838 --> 00:44:57,723
Please.

750
00:44:58,431 --> 00:44:59,998
Tell me how he killed him.

751
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:02,727
I have to know that so that
I can issue a new warrant.

752
00:45:02,812 --> 00:45:03,988
Why are you asking me that?

753
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:07,186
You have to find the answers.
Why are you asking me?

754
00:45:07,564 --> 00:45:08,398
Yoobum.

755
00:45:08,861 --> 00:45:10,074
It's over.

756
00:45:10,227 --> 00:45:11,661
You're begging me...

757
00:45:11,798 --> 00:45:14,132
...to give you the answer
when you've already gotten it wrong.

758
00:45:15,604 --> 00:45:16,801
Kang Daehee, that jerk...

759
00:45:16,886 --> 00:45:19,504
...put so much insurances
under his sister's name.

760
00:45:19,589 --> 00:45:21,989
He would even kill her
if we let her go right now.

761
00:45:22,074 --> 00:45:24,516
It's your fault if he goes out
like that and kills more people.

762
00:45:25,376 --> 00:45:26,235
My fault?

763
00:45:27,931 --> 00:45:28,967
Why is that my fault?

764
00:45:29,898 --> 00:45:32,060
Even if he does kill more people,
that can't be my fault.

765
00:45:32,831 --> 00:45:35,792
It's the prosecutor's fault who
couldn't give enough evidence!

766
00:45:36,965 --> 00:45:38,945
So who told you guys to presume
it before you have the proof?

767
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:41,538
You should've had
the evidence to find him guilty!

768
00:45:44,595 --> 00:45:48,962
I have done my part as an attorney
and if something were to happen...

769
00:45:49,047 --> 00:45:52,915
...that's not my fault, but yours.

770
00:45:55,416 --> 00:45:56,890
So, you guys handle it.

771
00:46:27,737 --> 00:46:30,832
Why is he so obsessed
with Prosecutor Shin's case?

772
00:46:30,898 --> 00:46:33,098
I shouldn't be saying this now.

773
00:46:33,498 --> 00:46:37,099
But does Prosecutor Jung
like Prosecutor Shin?

774
00:46:39,635 --> 00:46:42,302
It's something you really
shouldn't be saying now.

775
00:47:03,997 --> 00:47:05,089
"Little Pup"

776
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:09,226
"Youngduk Crab"

777
00:47:10,197 --> 00:47:11,910
Oh my, Prosecutor Jung, what's up?

778
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,494
You usually don't call.

779
00:47:13,579 --> 00:47:14,539
Where are you right now?

780
00:47:14,624 --> 00:47:18,902
I'm at the third Patrol Station
investigating street cats.

781
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,638
Everything's okay, right?

782
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:24,014
I wish it wasn't so that I have
something to report at least.

783
00:47:24,099 --> 00:47:26,577
If something happens,
you have to call me right away, okay?

784
00:47:26,662 --> 00:47:28,646
Okay.

785
00:47:31,616 --> 00:47:34,031
Sorry, I kept you for long.

786
00:47:35,965 --> 00:47:37,499
No, let's go.

787
00:47:37,584 --> 00:47:38,622
I'll take you home.

788
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,976
I'm sorry but it's been
really quiet these days.

789
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:45,389
So there's not much to tell you.

790
00:47:45,474 --> 00:47:46,627
Have you asked around?

791
00:47:46,712 --> 00:47:48,398
Yea, according to kids...

792
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:51,434
...they saw some guy giving
chicken to the cats...

793
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:54,205
...but we couldn't conclude
that to a specific person.

794
00:47:56,531 --> 00:47:57,499
Chicken?

795
00:48:03,012 --> 00:48:05,450
I've also seen a man
feeding chicken to cats before.

796
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:07,613
Really? Do you know the guy?

797
00:48:07,698 --> 00:48:08,432
Yes.

798
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:13,039
Why in the world would
Kang Daehee attack Hongjoo?

799
00:48:13,124 --> 00:48:14,727
They have nothing in common...

800
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,432
All these records here prove...

801
00:48:18,517 --> 00:48:23,400
...that the victim had died
before the car accident.

802
00:48:24,297 --> 00:48:27,764
Someone killed the cats with potassium
and they wanted me to cover that.

803
00:48:29,089 --> 00:48:30,009
No way...

804
00:48:31,164 --> 00:48:32,724
-Mr. Choi.
-Yes.

805
00:48:33,731 --> 00:48:36,699
I wasn't texting.
I was reading some spam texts.

806
00:48:36,798 --> 00:48:38,888
For Kang Daehee's case,
when you examined the victim's body...

807
00:48:38,973 --> 00:48:41,132
...was there a chance
that he was poisoned?

808
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:45,003
I don't know. It never crossed my mind...

809
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:53,198
What? You're scaring me.

810
00:48:53,323 --> 00:48:55,723
Something crossed my mind
now that you mention poison.

811
00:48:55,997 --> 00:48:56,933
The color of the blood.

812
00:48:57,034 --> 00:48:57,798
The color of the blood?

813
00:48:57,902 --> 00:49:00,571
Yes, usually the color
of the blood is blueish red.

814
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:04,108
But the victim's blood was
pinkish and closer to orange.

815
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:08,520
What does that mean?

816
00:49:08,605 --> 00:49:12,454
That's the symptom for those
who are infected with that...

817
00:49:12,664 --> 00:49:14,632
That thing...

818
00:49:14,717 --> 00:49:17,199
The one used to
kill people in the past...

819
00:49:17,297 --> 00:49:20,178
-Potassium cyanide?
-That's right, yes, potassium cyanide.

820
00:49:20,311 --> 00:49:23,160
If they die from eating that,
the blood is pinkish!

821
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:31,401
Prosecutor Jung, where are you going?

822
00:49:31,698 --> 00:49:32,666
Prosecutor Jung.

823
00:50:03,434 --> 00:50:06,503
Chohee, you were here.

824
00:50:06,938 --> 00:50:08,338
You must've been worried for me.

825
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:13,259
Chohee.

826
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:14,812
I was on your side.

827
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:17,314
It didn't matter
what the prosecutor said...

828
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:22,252
You know that I said you would
never do such a thing.

829
00:50:24,297 --> 00:50:25,134
Right?

830
00:50:25,698 --> 00:50:26,695
Of course, I do.

831
00:50:28,356 --> 00:50:30,727
I came out safely thanks to you.

832
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:39,036
I went to your trial.

833
00:50:43,664 --> 00:50:44,611
Why?

834
00:50:44,696 --> 00:50:46,076
I told you not to come.

835
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:53,584
The voice from your dash cam...

836
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:58,255
That wasn't his voice.

837
00:51:00,191 --> 00:51:01,925
Both voices were yours.

838
00:51:16,397 --> 00:51:17,174
Sleepy?

839
00:51:18,997 --> 00:51:22,312
Yes, I'm going to get some sleep...

840
00:51:22,731 --> 00:51:25,215
I worked a lot today, so I'm a bit tired.

841
00:51:26,484 --> 00:51:27,718
Okay, get some sleep.

842
00:51:27,997 --> 00:51:29,553
I'll wake you up when we're there.

843
00:51:35,698 --> 00:51:40,464
Daehee, did you really kill him?

844
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:58,465
Is this the place?

845
00:51:58,798 --> 00:51:59,465
Yes.

846
00:51:59,631 --> 00:52:03,479
I saw the owner from this place giving
pieces of chicken to the cats every day.

847
00:52:03,564 --> 00:52:04,221
Really?

848
00:52:10,498 --> 00:52:11,399
You stay here.

849
00:52:11,498 --> 00:52:13,165
Call the police if something happens.

850
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:14,064
What?

851
00:52:18,028 --> 00:52:19,236
Anyone here?

852
00:52:20,865 --> 00:52:22,606
Sir, what's going on?

853
00:52:25,297 --> 00:52:26,877
Excuse me... Are you okay?

854
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,416
Sir.

855
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:13,223
Wootak.

856
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,107
Run.

857
00:53:33,139 --> 00:53:34,127
Hurry.

858
00:54:38,342 --> 00:54:39,592
Do you have a phone?

859
00:54:39,677 --> 00:54:41,109
No, it's at the store.

860
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:42,528
What should we do?

861
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:59,129
Hello, you can speak.

862
00:54:59,498 --> 00:55:00,797
Where are you?

863
00:55:21,385 --> 00:55:23,553
I told you to just go.
This is driving me crazy.

864
00:55:57,464 --> 00:56:00,457
Promise me something.

865
00:56:01,064 --> 00:56:02,125
Promise?

866
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,861
If something dangerous
were to happen to you...

867
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:08,298
...I can see it in my dream prior to it.

868
00:56:11,997 --> 00:56:13,069
Jaechan...

869
00:56:13,904 --> 00:56:17,207
If you happen to see
this moment in your dream...

870
00:56:17,908 --> 00:56:19,342
Tell me so I can go find you...

871
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,478
...if you ever get stuck
in a dangerous moment.

872
00:56:22,279 --> 00:56:23,113
Please...

873
00:56:24,615 --> 00:56:26,132
Don't forget and come.

874
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:30,631
Tell me the time and the place,
so I know it in my dream.

875
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:32,065
Promise me that.

876
00:56:34,064 --> 00:56:37,194
The rooftop of Soojo Building
at Sanggu-dong.

877
00:56:39,231 --> 00:56:40,865
Today is April 11...

878
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:43,466
...10:12 PM.

879
00:57:20,898 --> 00:57:22,872
Jung Jaechan!

880
00:58:13,857 --> 00:58:14,924
Mr. Kang Daehee!

881
00:58:21,369 --> 00:58:24,234
You are under arrest for poisoning
your brother to death.

882
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:30,573
You are under arrest for falsifying
a car accident to cover it up....

883
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,742
...and claimed false insurances.

884
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:08,712
"While You Were Sleeping"

885
00:59:10,956 --> 00:59:11,979
Don't count on it.

886
00:59:12,064 --> 00:59:13,829
My today could become your tomorrow.

887
00:59:13,914 --> 00:59:16,146
Do you think it's your fault
that Wootak got injured?

888
00:59:16,231 --> 00:59:17,398
If it wasn't for me...

889
00:59:17,498 --> 00:59:18,659
...you wouldn't be
blaming yourself, right?

890
00:59:18,744 --> 00:59:21,573
Crying and blaming myself briefly.

891
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:24,399
The daughter of archery gold medalist
Lee Sookyung, Go Hakyung...

892
00:59:24,484 --> 00:59:27,065
...will be on the public wanted list.

893
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:29,274
Why are you here?

894
00:59:29,574 --> 00:59:30,422
Help me.

895
00:59:30,507 --> 00:59:34,341
I feel like I'm on the same team as
Prosecutor Jung this time around.

896
00:59:35,578 --> 00:59:37,847
-Do you feel like you owe me a debt?
-Yes.

897
00:59:37,932 --> 00:59:39,259
Can I be considered an exception?

898
00:59:39,344 --> 00:59:42,835
Can't you stop thinking of repaying me
and be fine with everything?

899
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,898
Let's just say you repaid
all your debt with this.

900
00:59:44,983 --> 00:59:45,717
What?

901
00:59:56,965 --> 01:00:06,599
"While You Were Sleeping"
