Why bother?

17
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,990
It’s a chaotic time.

18
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,430
Given your martial arts and status,

19
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,800
we can join hands

20
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,870
and dominate the world.

21
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,940
You don’t have to be on the run anymore.

If you refuse,

I, Yuwen Hao, will kill you.

Forget it.

25
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,740
Take this.

26
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,160
I’m cold.

27
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:39,840
I’m so cold.

28
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,580
Cold.

29
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,090
So cold.

30
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,530
So cold.

31
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,090
So cold.

32
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,640
Cold.

33
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,270
So cold.

34
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,050
Cold.

35
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,320
So cold.

36
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,580
Xiaoliu, you wake up!

37
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,460
Sister, Xiaoliu wakes up!

38
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,720
Cold.

39
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,330
Xiaoliu, you had another nightmare?

40
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,280
Cold.

41
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,200
She said she’s cold.

42
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,930
Cold.

43
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,370
Warm yourself up, Xiaoliu.

44
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,330
So cold.

45
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,560
You won’t feel cold

46
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,920
when you get recovered.

47
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,670
This medicine works well.

48
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,850
I begged for it

49
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:28,780
from Butler Zhu.

50
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,890
How dare you!

51
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,550
Look at the time.

52
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,340
It’s already at noon,

53
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,550
yet you’re slacking off here.

54
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,730
You wanna die?

55
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,210
I’m so sorry.

56
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,580
We’re getting to work now.

57
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,280
Where is that humble maid?

58
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,780
She is my sister, Xiaoliu.

59
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,200
She hasn’t recovered.

60
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,450
Isn’t it the medicinal stove

61
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,500
of Butler Zhu?

62
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,460
How come it’s

63
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,280
in a maid’s hand?

64
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,710
You dared to

65
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,300
steal Butler Zhu’s medicinal stove!

66
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,430
I didn’t steal it.

67
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,590
It’s given by Butler Zhu to my sister!

68
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,040
Xiaoba! Stop talking!

69
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,120
You dare to talk back!

70
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,650
Xiaoba!

71
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,650
How dare you! You humble maid!

72
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,320
Sister!

73
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:23,750
You dare to

74
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,340
defend this witch!

75
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,150
I’m gonna hit you!

76
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,980
Let’s see how you’ll seduce men!

77
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,460
My leg hurts!

78
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,610
Ms. Song. Are you alright?

79
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,970
Did you hit yourself?

80
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,470
My leg is swollen!

81
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,810
The pain out of nowhere

82
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,910
is very dangerous.

83
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,450
You’d better go for a physician.

84
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,920
Or else, you’ll feel pain all over your body.

85
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,650
Right. Your sickness can’t be delayed.

86
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,310
Should I call the physician here

87
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,460
- for you?
- Stop it.

88
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,320
Listen up. Let’s wait and see.

89
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,920
I will

90
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,060
get you all killed before I die.

91
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,640
It hurts so much.

92
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,310
Ouch!

93
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,930
Xiaoliu.

94
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,490
Do not offend them

95
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,840
like this again.

96
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,580
Many people practice martial arts here.

97
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:01,940
Your trick

98
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,660
can be caught easily.

99
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,760
You’ll get yourself killed.

100
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,330
Do you know how scary it is here?

101
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,910
There are

102
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,470
up to a hundred reasons to kill maids.

103
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,280
It’s said the lord of the Third Branch

104
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,140
in Pleasure Pavilion

105
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,110
killed over 20 maids last month.

106
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,370
The girls of the Du family

107
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,350
who came along with us

108
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,830
have all died.

109
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,340
I’m really afraid

110
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,490
it’d happen on us someday.

111
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,030
You...

112
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,460
Pleasure Pavilion?

113
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,300
Just bear with it.

114
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,520
Linxi went to beg Young Master Yue.

115
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:40,980
Xiaoqi will be back

116
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,370
from the pasture very soon.

117
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,210
Before she comes back,

118
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:45,880
don’t do

119
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,280
anything stupid.

120
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:48,970
Understand?

121
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,890
Will Xiaoqi come back?

122
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,140
That’s great.

123
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,310
Although it’s dangerous,

124
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,580
at least our siblings can

125
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,460
be together.

126
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,860
It’s great that our siblings

127
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,140
can be finally reunited.

128
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,810
From then on,

129
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,920
we’ll take care of each other

130
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,120
and never part.

131
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,500
- Good shot!
- Bravo!

132
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,690
Well done!

133
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,850
Why are you laughing?

134
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,900
Isn’t it normal for me to miss?

135
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,800
I’ve never got it in. Right?

136
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,020
However, if it’s he

137
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,670
who misses it, that’ll...

138
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,110
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

139
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,910
It’s nothing to be proud of.

140
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,540
Why don’t you compete with Yan Xun?

141
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,220
I’m not a match

142
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,490
to Prince Yan, of course.

143
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,030
The archery of people from Yanbei

144
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,460
is even better than taht of imperial guards.

145
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,710
Am I right, Prince Yan?

146
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,530
Pretentious and arrogant.

147
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,360
Yuwen Huai.

148
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,410
Who are you speaking ill of again?

149
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,430
I... I...

150
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,360
Greetings, Your Highness.

151
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,930
Yan Xun.

152
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,270
Why did you guys stake my wine

153
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,960
on the human hunting ground?

154
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,150
Sister.

155
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,130
I’m sitting here.

156
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,270
Can’t you see me?

157
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,140
I don’t want to see you.

158
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:02,980
I see you every day

159
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,800
in the palace.

160
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,910
That’s annoying.

161
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,490
Moreover,

162
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,910
you aren’t as handsome as Yan Xun, are you?

163
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,590
Well...

164
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,530
Not really.

165
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,850
- You hear that?
- Chun.

166
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:16,920
Have you brought

167
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,450
that good wine here?

168
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,420
This wine is really good.

169
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,960
Come and smell it.

170
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,770
- Smell it.
- Smell it.

171
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,240
Smell it.

172
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,330
Is it good?

173
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,630
How special could this wine be?

174
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,490
There is tons of good wine in my mansion

175
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:39,820
which is enough to build

176
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,180
a lake of wine.

177
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,690
Ten lakes of wine

178
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,280
won’t get close to one cup of this.

179
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,620
This is Jade Wine.

180
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,900
It was made by Marquis Dingbei

181
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,860
for Madam Bai Sheng personally.

182
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,590
This wine was brewed by my father indeed.

183
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,970
The raw materials were precious.

184
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,960
The Hetian Jade Cauldron brewing the wine

185
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,760
was destroyed in a war.

186
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,430
This jar is the one and only.

187
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,750
Exactly.

188
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,530
It’s the one and only in the world.

189
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,170
I’ve only heard Marquis Dingbei

190
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,590
was highly decorated.

191
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,550
I’ve never heard that

192
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,870
the wine he made was renowned in the world.

193
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,270
I’ll make a jar of wine someday

194
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,820
which will also be unique.

195
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,970
Because I will never

196
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,960
make a second jar.

197
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,030
Yuwen Huai.

198
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,130
Who do you think you are

199
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,910
to compare yourself with Marquis Dingbei?

200
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,240
He’s my father’s sworn brother.

201
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,310
You’re from a low-ranked family,

202
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,110
neither good at pen nor sword.

203
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,130
Except for this arrow throwing game,

204
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,490
what else are you good at?

205
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,320
I...

206
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,890
Chun.

207
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,730
Princess.

208
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,130
Since the wine is so good,

209
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,080
could you

210
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,310
share it with me

211
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,810
when you enjoy it?

212
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,420
And me.

213
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,030
Such good wine

214
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,130
shouldn’t be spoiled.

215
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:49,920
How could I allow

216
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,570
a gang of hooligans to drink it?

217
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,160
Don’t talk nonsense. That’s too much.

218
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,060
Brother.

219
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,240
Why are you fooling around

220
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,040
with these guys?

221
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,990
You call yourselves the Five Aces of Chang’an.

222
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,490
Except for Yan Xun,

223
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,100
all of you are full of tricks.

224
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,840
You fool around with them.

225
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,780
It’s just like...

226
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,850
Like a pig

227
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,730
in a herd of horses.

228
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,520
You! You call me a pig!

229
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,060
Then you’re a pig’s sister!

230
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,140
I’m gonna fix you!

231
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:25,580
Your Highness.

232
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,340
Stop there!

233
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,940
Yan Xun!

234
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,710
- Help me!
- Stop it.

235
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,280
Help me!

236
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,080
Come here!

237
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,250
Alright. Your Highness. Your Highness.

238
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:33,970
Your Highness.

239
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:34,810
Pig! Pig!

240
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,130
Princess Chun is innocent

241
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,940
and childlike as always.

242
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,410
We’ve been used to it.

243
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,800
You are used to it.

244
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,050
She makes fun of

245
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:42,510
everybody,

246
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,810
other than you.

247
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,340
You’re used to it, of course.

248
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,010
Oh, right.

249
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,800
It’ll be

250
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,610
Yan Xun’s birthday

251
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,860
in a few days.

252
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,410
Since Yuwen Yue won the wine,

253
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,070
it’ll be opened on Yan Xun’s

254
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:53,610
birthday party.

255
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,930
It makes perfect sense.

256
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,240
They are good buddies.

257
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,010
And I will host the birthday party.

258
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,440
Yuwen Yue said

259
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,600
he’d host it for me.

260
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,610
Yuwen Yue?

261
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,160
He is as cold as ice.

262
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,780
What good ideas can he give you?

263
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,720
Yeah. I’d like to see

264
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,860
what ideas he’ll come up with.

265
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,700
Right?

266
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,400
Jing Xiaoliu

267
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,530
will work with you today.

268
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,520
Ms. Song.

269
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,100
Ms. Song.

270
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,910
My sister hasn’t recovered.

271
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,860
Could you allow her to rest more days?

272
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,670
How dare you order around in Yuwen’s Mansion?

273
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,800
Go to work as long as you can crawl.

274
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,560
Butler Zhu.

275
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,410
Young Master Yue will celebrate

276
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,230
Prince Yan Xun’s birthday in the backyard.

277
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,860
By then, the royals and nobles

278
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,560
will all attend it.

279
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,080
If there's any mistake

280
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,960
or inconsideration,

281
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,150
you’ll die.

282
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:15,930
Aye.

283
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,080
You, go outside with me

284
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,120
and move flowers.

285
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,090
Zhixiang, my beauty.

286
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,950
Your sister

287
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,640
is alive.

288
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,700
I didn’t give her a hard time.

289
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,670
Thank you so much.

290
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,000
No thanks,

291
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,200
but how will you repay me?

292
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:46,770
Sister.

293
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,610
Where is the orchid?

294
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,480
I don’t know.

295
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,290
Didn’t Ms. Song tell you?

296
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,240
No.

297
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,950
Over there.

298
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,310
Lead me there.

299
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,250
It’s over there.

300
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,460
How did you get the arrowhead?

301
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,420
What will you do?

302
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,170
If Zhu Shun lays a finger on you,

303
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,870
I won’t let him off.

304
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,690
You...

305
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,810
Zhu Shun is the butler

306
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:22,820
of Yuwen’s Mansion.

307
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,380
He’s backed by Yuwen Huai.

308
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,440
He’s too powerful.

309
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,820
He won’t let you go

310
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,210
even if you hurt any hair of him.

311
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:35,730
Not just you, as well as me,

312
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,130
Linxi, Xiaoqi, Xiaoba,

313
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,530
we will all get killed.

314
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,970
The poison Yingtao used on you

315
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,530
is called Corpse Powder,

316
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,730
which is from the Western Regions.

317
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,150
The Third Branch did send men there lately.

318
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,560
Looks like Yuwen Huai intends

319
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,650
to kill us.

320
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,920
They’ve been coveting

321
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,740
the Eye of Intel of our House

322
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,780
so as to

323
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,900
exclude the outsiders

324
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,490
and harm the loyal.

325
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,680
Exactly. The Eye of Intel

326
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,230
can be used to gather intelligence of all parties.

327
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,300
It’s too powerful.

328
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,100
If it falls into wrong hands,

329
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,450
that’ll be a disaster.

330
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,330
Due to my illness,

331
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,000
as the First Branch,

332
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,750
we’ve never been valued by His Majesty.

333
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,570
The Third Branch, Hongshan House,

334
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,700
is deeply trusted by His Majesty

335
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,150
in advantage of their population.

336
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,370
We can only meditate aggrievedly.

337
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,400
You must be careful in the future.

338
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,530
Yes, grandfather.

339
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,000
If we can’t be valued by His Majesty,

340
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,930
the Eye of Intel

341
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,650
is as useless as

342
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,290
an unsheathed sword.

343
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,880
Yue. From now on,

344
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,080
the rejuvenation of the Eye of Intel

345
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,510
is on you.

346
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,150
Yes.

347
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,480
I will never fail you,

348
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,870
grandfather.

349
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,500
- Fill up.
- Fill up.

350
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,370
Fill up for me.

351
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,570
Come on. Drink this.

352
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,690
Cheers.

353
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:04,410
Come on.

354
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:04,900
Cheers.

355
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,630
Cheers.

356
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:06,840
Cheers.

357
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,890
Fill up. Fill up.

358
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,670
A toast to you.

359
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,260
Princess Chun is here!

360
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,820
Girls, Princess Chun is here!

361
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,000
Princess Chun?

362
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,620
Wish we could go

363
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,350
and see her.

364
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,820
Yeah. Exactly.

365
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,220
I wish we could see her.

366
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,070
Me, too.

367
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,110
So do I.

368
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,020
You.

369
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:31,480
Be the horse pier

370
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,660
at the front door.

371
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,770
Who do you mean?

372
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,010
I mean you!

373
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,310
What are you waiting for? Hurry up!

374
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:43,910
Xiaoliu.

375
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,750
Don’t run around.

376
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,370
In Yuwen’s Mansion,

377
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,020
there are three classes of slaves.

378
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,680
You’re a low-level slave with an Iron Bell.

379
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,100
Keep your head down

380
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,300
in masters’ parties.

381
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,550
You’ll be flogged ten times

382
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,460
even if you breathe heavily.

383
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,870
Keep my words in mind.

384
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,390
Yes, sister.

385
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,690
Here comes the Princess!

386
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,450
Greetings, Your Highness.

387
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,330
Greetings, Your Highness.

388
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,800
Hey, come here and be the pier!

389
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,370
You! Come here!

390
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,540
Yan Xun.

391
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,610
May you long live.

392
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,980
Thank you, Your Highness.

393
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,070
Yan Xun.

394
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:48,980
Guess

395
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,140
what gift will I give you

396
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,330
today?

397
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,780
Bring it over.

398
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,640
What a wonderful imperial mountain!

399
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,130
Thanks for your gift, Your Highness.

400
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,620
I’m so honored.

401
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,400
I’m glad you like it.

402
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,540
Take it away.

403
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,360
We may sit.

404
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,420
- Be seated.
- Sit.

405
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:12,760
Please.

406
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,770
Please.

407
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:14,310
Sure.

408
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:14,790
Please.

409
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,580
- Come.
- Please.

410
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,460
Fill up.

411
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,840
Please.

412
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,820
A toast to you.

413
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,930
Thanks.

414
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,330
Here. Please.

415
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,250
Sure.

416
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:30,650
Come. Fill up.

417
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,750
Yuwen Huai.

418
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,020
Where are you going?

419
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,150
Your Highness. The wine is too strong.

420
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,190
I’ll go get some fresh air.

421
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,390
Yuwen Huai?

422
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,170
Yingtao is worthless.

423
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,550
It’s no pity even if she dies.

424
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,000
This is Guanghan Poison.

425
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,290
Put it in wine.

426
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,570
It’s colorless and tasteless.

427
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,960
It is the Princess’s wine,

428
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,500
and we’re in Yuwen Yue’s backyard.

429
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,230
I’ll back you up. Don’t be afraid.

430
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,010
Aye.

431
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,420
Who are they gonna poison?

432
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,090
Here comes Young Master Yue from Qingshan House!

433
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,110
Young Master Yue is here.

434
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,960
Cold Ice. What took you so long?

435
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,900
We’ve been playing for long.

436
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,630
You’re always late.

437
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,770
How should we punish you?

438
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:48,820
What do you guys think?

439
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,150
- Yes.
- Yes.

440
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,180
- Punish him!
- Punish him to drink!

441
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,400
Pour wine. Here.

442
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,630
- Come on.
- Cheers.

443
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,950
- Please.
- Please.

444
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,320
Butler Zhu.

445
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,530
Zhixiang.

446
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,390
Young Master Yue

447
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,380
hardly attends a party.

448
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,090
You must serve him well.

449
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,020
Got it?

450
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,390
Aye.

451
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:20,620
Go ahead.

452
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,600
Mr. Cold.

453
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,270
Look at yourself.

454
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,920
You are always late.

455
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,730
But it’s Yan Xun’s birthday today.

456
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,120
Also, it’s in your mansion.

457
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,790
How come you’re late again?

458
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,070
Yes. That’s right.

459
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,180
Well.

460
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,820
Shouldn’t we punish him for wine?

461
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,380
- Yes, punish him!
- He must be punished!

462
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:43,970
Drink.

463
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,050
A beauty

464
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,470
is serving you today.

465
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,540
You must drink the wine.

466
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,560
- Drink!
- Drink up!

467
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,060
Drink!

468
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,350
- Drink!
- Come on!

469
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,050
Just drink it.

470
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,110
Asking me to drink?

471
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,120
Interesting.

472
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,650
Drink.

473
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240
- Drink!
- Come on!

474
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,890
- Drink!
- Come on!

475
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,720
How come he puts it down?

476
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:15,030
I won’t drink it.

477
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,720
Cold Ice.

478
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,360
This is Jade Wine.

479
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,160
There is

480
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,660
only one jar of it in the world.

481
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,380
Today is

482
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,620
Yan Xun’s birthday.

483
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,500
That’s why I share it

484
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,570
with you guys.

485
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,660
You must drink it!

486
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,390
- Yes, drink it!
- Your Highness.

487
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,870
I’m not feeling well today.

488
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,270
Sorry.

489
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,550
Are you gonna disobey Her Highness?

490
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,400
How about we play as Shi Chong did?

491
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,880
If a beauty toasts a guest and the guest refuses,

492
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,690
the beauty shall be killed.

493
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,000
Yes, kill the beauty.

494
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,210
Yes, kill the beauty.

495
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,560
Young Master. Please drink the wine.

496
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,750
Young Master. Please drink the wine.

497
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,980
I remember

498
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,630
Shi Chong asked a beauty

499
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,830
to toast the noble Wang Dun,

500
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,310
yet he refused to drink.

501
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:30,290
As a result, the beauty was beheaded,

502
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,530
and Wang Dun was accused of cruelty.

503
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,770
That’s cool.

504
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,220
Yue.

505
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:37,860
You want me

506
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,040
kill this maid,

507
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,290
right?

508
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,430
Young Master. Please drink the wine.

509
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,480
They plot against each other,

510
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,890
yet my sister will die for them.

511
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,580
These animals!

512
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,770
Drink or I’ll kill her.

513
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,620
- Yes, kill her!
- Kill her!

514
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,680
Young Master Yue!

515
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:05,540
- Kill her!
- Drink!

516
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,700
If it goes on,

517
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,030
my sister will die!

518
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,670
Wild Kitten?

519
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,490
It’s unnecessary.

520
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,030
Catch her.

521
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,040
Catch her!

522
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,730
Aye.

523
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,540
You again.

524
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,220
I beg you, Young Masters.

525
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,310
Please don’t stake my sister’s life

526
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,270
on your wine.

527
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,420
What a bold maid.

528
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,600
Prince Yu and Princess are here.

529
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,080
How dare you do this?

530
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,570
Zhu Shun.

531
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,160
Slain her.

532
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:05,500
Aye.

533
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,290
Wait.

534
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,930
Today is my birthday.

535
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,860
No killing or fighting.

536
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,090
That makes sense.

537
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:15,810
You can’t kill people on a party.

538
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,410
But I have to keep the rules of our mansion.

539
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,700
How about this?

540
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,580
Let’s play a game

541
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,810
to see if she should die.

542
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,570
Today we’ll listen to Yan Xun,

543
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,100
no matter what he says.

544
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,330
This is my belt pedant, with dragon

545
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,760
on one side and characters on the other.

546
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,700
I’ll flip it in the air.

547
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,240
You guess

548
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,760
which side will face up when it lands.

549
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,790
If you guess right,

550
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,240
it means Heaven wants you alive.

551
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,370
Good idea! It’s interesting!

552
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,350
Let’s do this!

553
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,640
It’s up to your luck.

554
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:00,580
Turn around.

555
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,780
Dragon.

556
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:32,740
Are you sure?

557
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,730
I’m sure.

558
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,500
Amazing!

559
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,750
Looks like it wasn’t a fluke

560
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,450
that she survived

561
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,460
on the human hunting ground.

562
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,570
Yuwen Huai. Pardon her.

563
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,820
Death penalty is pardoned,
but not other punishments.

564
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,190
Since Heaven

565
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,410
doesn’t want my sister to die,

566
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:05,880
she deserves to live.

567
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,620
Young Masters, please let go of my sister.

568
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,010
A girl with affection and faith.

569
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,610
But you will get punished.

570
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,610
I’m willing to be punished for my sister.

571
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,460
Xiaoliu.

572
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:04,480
Thank you, Young Master Yue!

573
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,990
Thanks for saving my sister!

574
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,430
You stirred up trouble,

575
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,170
yet you couldn’t get out of it.

576
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,110
That’s silly.

577
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,930
How dare you!

578
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,870
It’s you, Young Master Yue.

579
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,270
I released her.

580
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,250
Tell Yuwen Huai.

581
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,250
Come to me if there's anything.

582
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,330
Aye. Aye.

583
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:52,720
Ms. Song.

584
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,230
This witch offended Young Master Huai.

585
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,120
He’ll think

586
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,260
I’m slacking off

587
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,110
if I don’t kill her.

588
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:04,510
That said, she’s got

589
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:06,510
a beautiful face.

590
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,700
It’s a shame to kill her.

591
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,070
Let her rest for two days

592
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,320
and then send her to Pleasure Pavilion

593
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,750
to enjoy the life there.

594
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,410
Xiaoliu offended Young Master Huai

595
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,850
to save me.

596
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,630
Pleasure Pavilion...

597
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:28,120
She cannot

598
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,390
be sent to Pleasure Pavilion!

599
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,710
Linxi.

600
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,290
We must do something.

601
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,860
Be quiet. Don’t get anyone hear you. Got it?

602
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,650
Be careful!

603
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:53,930
Butler Zhu.

604
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:57,740
I overheard Yueqi

605
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,180
sent men to look into the trades between

606
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,840
Young Master Huai and western businessmen.

607
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,820
Young Master Huai knew

608
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,380
they’d do this.

609
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,420
That’s why he asked us

610
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,890
to be proactive.

611
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,140
We can’t deal with the younger one,

612
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,940
but we can start with the old guy.

613
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,270
Aye.

614
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,290
That old man

615
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,120
likes playing counting rod.

616
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,070
This set of counting rod

617
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:31,140
can get him into hell.

618
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:36,550
Don’t touch it!

619
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,980
There’s poison in this box.

620
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,570
Don’t worry.

621
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,190
I have this.

622
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,760
Thank you, Butler Zhu.

623
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:02,460
You’re a pawn

624
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,060
set by Young Master Huai

625
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,320
into Qingshan House.

626
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,180
He doesn’t hope you die

627
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,770
so soon.

628
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,050
The Jing siblings

629
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:16,450
are being anxious about Jing Xiaoliu.

630
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:18,770
You can get

631
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,370
a scapegoat for yourself.

632
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,100
Linxi.

633
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,470
What are you doing there?

634
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,540
Jinzhu.

635
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,540
You are sitting here. What’s on your mind?

636
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:39,990
Nothing.

637
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,150
It’s the two masters

638
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,620
that your sister

639
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,150
has offended.

640
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,160
However, I serve Young Master Yue...

641
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,130
Jinzhu.

642
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:50,960
Stay out of

643
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,800
our trouble.

644
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,450
You’ll be implicated.

645
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:54,860
I insist on hearing it.

646
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,780
Tell me. What happened?

647
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:04,780
= Yuwen Yue’s Mansion =

648
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,090
Chu Qiao.

649
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,860
Chu Qiao.

650
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,090
Chu Qiao! Chu Qiao!

651
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,120
Mother!

652
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:28,740
Chu Qiao! Be brave and live on!

653
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,280
Mother!

654
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,930
Chu Qiao.

655
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:43,940
Chu...

656
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,910
Linxi.

657
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,810
Linxi.

658
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:01,670
You wake up.

659
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,560
Did I get you in trouble?

660
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,890
No, don’t worry.

661
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,410
Yuwen Huai did apply poison.

662
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:16,410
I overheard that it was Guanghan Poison,

663
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,930
which is fatal

664
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:19,010
to those who get a cold.

665
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,680
But it’s harmless

666
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,760
to healthy people.

667
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,320
How did you know this?

668
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,390
I have no idea

669
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,920
how I knew this as well.

670
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,070
Linxi.

671
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,930
Do I have another name?

672
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,600
In my dream,

673
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,340
someone always calls me Chu Qiao.

674
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,670
Sometimes, some people

675
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,110
are going after me.

676
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:48,030
But it feels so real.

677
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,980
Do you remember

678
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:51,300
how I came to

679
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,590
our family?

680
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,340
I just remember

681
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,240
father told me

682
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,230
you were born by a concubine.

683
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,260
Xiaoliu.

684
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,370
Don’t think too much.

685
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:02,580
Dreams are all fake.

686
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,630
Young Master Yue trusts me a lot.

687
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:05,970
I’ll avenge you

688
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,230
sooner or later.

689
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,290
It’s just that

690
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,010
you’ve offended Young Master Huai.

691
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,280
He is petty and ruthless.

692
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,890
Zhu Shun is his man.

693
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:16,150
They’re birds of a feather.

694
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:19,210
I have to come up with a countermeasure.

695
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,230
Linxi. I don’t remember

696
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,170
many things,

697
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,890
but you guys are my only family

698
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,050
in this world.

699
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,210
Fortunately, father, mother,

700
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,770
and siblings took care of me.

701
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,030
I really appreciate it.

702
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,080
Just rest and look after yourself.

703
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:38,150
Leave other things to me.

704
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,490
I’m getting you some water.

705
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,310
Thank you, Jinzhu.

706
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,320
When you serve the old man

707
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,730
playing counting rod,

708
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:04,980
can you change them

709
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,160
into the jade rod

710
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,630
I got from the Southern Xinjiang?

711
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,900
Take it as a gift from me.

712
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:13,650
If the old man is happy,

713
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,270
Young Master Yue will be happy as well.

714
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:17,430
Perhaps

715
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:23,120
he can promote me to be his sleep-serving maid.

716
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,060
You got the license

717
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,400
for my sister to leave the mansion.

718
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,820
I’ll repay you by this.

719
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:39,950
Linxi has got

720
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,080
the license for leaving here.

721
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,420
You can leave tonight.

722
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,400
Have you packed up clothes

723
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,320
and food?

724
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,930
She’s reluctant to leave.

725
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:53,720
Here. These are my new shoes.

726
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:54,650
Take them.

727
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,460
I won’t leave.

728
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,050
Xiaoliu.

729
00:38:58,850 --> 00:38:59,570
Think about

730
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,130
the consequence if you stay here.

731
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,360
You offended Young Master Huai.

732
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,080
Obviously, they’re

733
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,230
trying to kill you.

734
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,290
If they send you to Pleasure Pavilion,

735
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:07,670
Linxi and I

736
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,390
will fail our father.

737
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:10,760
Don’t worry, Xiaoliu.

738
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,940
Linxi will keep us safe.

739
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:13,900
If you stay,

740
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,420
we’ll be implicated instead.

741
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:19,370
Xiaoliu. Take them.

742
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,930
Take them.

743
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:23,950
Looks like I have to leave.

744
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,640
I can’t get my family in trouble again.

745
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,770
Just take them, sister.

746
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,970
This is a slingshot. I’m leaving.

747
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,870
Use it to protect yourself

748
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,150
when you’re in danger.

749
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,680
You guys must stay alive

750
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,270
and wait for me.

751
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,720
I’ll figure a way out to pick you up.

752
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,420
By the way,

753
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,040
remember to lay low outside.

754
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,110
Got it?

755
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,100
Yes.

756
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:51,950
I’ll endure it

757
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,240
no matter how hard it is.

758
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,130
Xiaoliu.

759
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,020
Elderly Master. I’m Linxi.

760
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:16,780
Here I am.

761
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,650
Come in.

762
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,270
Aye.

763
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,450
Elderly Master. This is a set of new counting rod.

764
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:36,660
We may have a look.

765
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,400
Linxi, you...

766
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:11,660
Who is it?

767
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,320
Check it out.

768
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:13,940
Aye.

769
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,060
Who is there?

770
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,460
I’ve seen you.

771
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:23,430
Get out!

772
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:26,370
Get out,

773
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:28,110
and I may spare your life.

774
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,210
Or, I’ll kill you with no mercy.

775
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,040
What is the matter?

776
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,650
Nothing. Just an illusion.

777
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,290
Young Master.

778
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:00,210
Master got poisoned

779
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:02,040
by the fierce Qianhun Poison from Western Regions.

780
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,710
You made it?

781
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,150
With the scapegoat.

782
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:33,270
The attendant Linxi?

783
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,620
Get on. Go to meet Young Master.

784
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,350
Something must have happened to Linxi.

785
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,280
I can’t just walk away.

786
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,870
I gotta go back.

787
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:07,880
- Fire!
- Fire!

788
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,370
You poisoned my grandfather!

789
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,020
I’ll kill you with my hands!
