= Episode 58 =

16
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,800
This time, I came here

17
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,150
for personal business.

18
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,230
Don’t worry.

19
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,580
I’m done eating.

20
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,020
See you.

21
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,020
Yuwen Yue,

22
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,630
we’ll soon meet again on the battlefield.

23
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,530
That’s our fate.

24
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,050
When that happens,

25
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,130
don’t be soft on me.

26
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:40,270
I...

27
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:40,990
Xing’er,

28
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,020
be honest,

29
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,210
if we’re against each other

30
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,230
on the battlefield,

31
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,070
will you chop my head off?

32
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,830
I won’t kill you,

33
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,200
but I’ll do my best

34
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,680
to beat you.

35
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,930
Really?

36
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,530
I can’t do the same.

37
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,850
The world we live in

38
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,850
is like a jungle.

39
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,700
Don’t be affected

40
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,570
by emotions.

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,360
No feelings, no pain.

42
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,690
Otherwise,

43
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,940
hearts will be broken.

44
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,410
Excruciating pain can’t be avoided.

45
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,950
No feelings, no pain?

46
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,050
I’m afraid that’s too late for me.

47
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,570
Has Yuwen Yue come back?

48
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,530
Not yet.

49
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,480
The risk is too high.

50
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:09,900
We must send reinforcements

51
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,930
to back them up.

52
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,310
Also,

53
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,030
is your information true

54
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,960
that Yuan Che is coming with troops?

55
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,490
It is.

56
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,100
He’s been discussing peace talks

57
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,430
with Yuwen Yue.

58
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,630
That makes his arrival suspicious.

59
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,310
Yuwen Yue went to Xiuli Mountain

60
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,220
and met with Achu?

61
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,590
Correct.

62
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,240
Messages just arrived

63
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,310
from our scouts there.

64
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,420
It’s true.

65
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,490
He was there.

66
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,940
Report!

67
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,180
Your Highness,

68
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,440
Prince Yuan Che of Wei

69
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,140
is heading towards

70
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,510
Meilin Pass with his army.

71
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,640
What are they up to?

72
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,350
Your Highness, I’m not sure

73
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,590
if I should say this.

74
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,350
Get to the point!

75
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,020
Miss Chu is

76
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,000
prejudiced against me

77
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,240
and she’s holding

78
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,880
a grudge against you too.

79
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,580
You’d better take precautions.

80
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,600
She wouldn’t harm me.

81
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,940
What about Yuwen Yue?

82
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,230
Would he also do nothing?

83
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,920
What are you implying?

84
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,640
Your Highness,

85
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,160
why don’t we take this chance

86
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,830
to get rid of Yuwen Yue for good?

87
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,810
Now that he’s here,

88
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,070
don’t let him leave.

89
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,340
Lately, we’ve lost

90
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,010
tons of men at Meilin Pass because of him.

91
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,680
And now, he’s poking around

92
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,770
in our hinterland.

93
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,500
Clearly, he has an agenda.

94
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,610
Under his leadership,

95
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,060
his fort is full of troops and supplies.

96
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,630
His force

97
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,790
is well-equipped.

98
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,410
Now, Wei’s prince

99
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,610
is coming to assist him.

100
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,480
We must do something

101
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,380
or Yanbei will be in danger.

102
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,530
Your Highness, I understand

103
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,700
you two go way back,

104
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,580
but there’s no friendship

105
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,340
in war.

106
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,200
Every misstep,

107
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,350
every bit of hesitation

108
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,830
will cost

109
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,460
tens of thousands

110
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,940
of our men’s lives.

111
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,510
I hope

112
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,730
you can put our mission first.

113
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,300
Pass my order.

114
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,000
Gather the crack troops

115
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,800
to kill Yuwen Yue.

116
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:25,860
Aye.

117
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,580
Stop.

118
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:03,800
Brother,

119
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,760
why are you here with the army?

120
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,820
I received Yuwen Yue’s letter

121
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,040
saying Yan Xun refused to make peace

122
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,730
and he was going to

123
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,780
launch attacks again.

124
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,470
Is that so?

125
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,950
He wrote that to me.

126
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,880
It can’t be wrong.

127
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,350
Brother, we don’t know

128
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,450
if what he said is true.

129
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,830
If you strike now,

130
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,310
civilians will suffer

131
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,980
and peace will never be restored.

132
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,380
We can’t keep procrastinating.

133
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,780
I’m going in.

134
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,750
Don’t, brother!

135
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,690
Step aside!

136
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,100
Move!

137
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,700
No!

138
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,030
Move!

139
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,280
Your Highness!

140
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,020
Let’s go!

141
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,180
Stop, all of you!

142
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,470
I’m Duke Yanbei conferred by His Majesty

143
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,960
and Prince Yuan Song of Wei.

144
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,860
Who gave you the right

145
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,190
to attack my fief?

146
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,130
My target is

147
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,590
that rebel Yan Xun.

148
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,370
He controls Yanbei

149
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,690
and refuses to make peace with us.

150
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,650
He must be eliminated

151
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,460
to rebuild our prestige.

152
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,660
Brother,

153
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,090
Yan Xun revolts against us for a reason.

154
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,120
I suggest we be humble

155
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,370
and clear his family’s name

156
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,680
before holding the talk.

157
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,930
If that doesn’t get him around the table,

158
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,070
you can still

159
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:41,690
resort to force then.

160
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,420
Yuan Song,

161
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,840
why are you taking

162
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,680
that traitor’s side?

163
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,050
Has the wind in Yanbei

164
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,300
damaged your brain?

165
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,140
Do you still remember

166
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,690
you’re a Yuan?

167
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,400
That bastard almost

168
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,030
took Chang’an.

169
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,100
He killed thousands

170
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,460
of our people.

171
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,440
Our brother Yuan Qi

172
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,420
was killed in Hongchuan.

173
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,970
Have you forgotten all that?

174
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,370
Of course not!

175
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,230
What about

176
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,250
the deceased

177
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,240
on the Jiuyou Platform?

178
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,970
What about

179
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,320
those innocent people of Yanbei

180
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,290
killed in the battle?

181
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,660
You’re grieving

182
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,880
for the death of your family.

183
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,310
So are the bereaved

184
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,860
and Yan Xun!

185
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:25,560
Ridiculous!

186
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,050
Don’t equate that rat

187
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,090
with a noble prince!

188
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,810
Whoever we are, we only have one life.

189
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,470
Brother,

190
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,870
I didn’t understand

191
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,560
until I lost my arm

192
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,810
how painful

193
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,050
and how desperate

194
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,810
the disabled were.

195
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,510
Do you know

196
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,140
how many arms and legs

197
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,130
and even lives a war costs?

198
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,020
Brother,

199
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,860
I’m begging you.

200
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:08,780
Please withdraw your force.

201
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,610
Don’t stand in my way,

202
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,690
or they’ll

203
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,570
ride over you.

204
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,400
Go ahead.

205
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,080
If that can stop you

206
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,290
from raiding Yanbei

207
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,990
and protect those in Hongchuan

208
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:27,950
from the war,

209
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,970
I’m at your disposal.

210
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,700
Hadn’t Father

211
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,240
suspected Marquis Dingbei

212
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,700
and slaughtered his entire clan,

213
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,670
things wouldn’t have gotten to this stage.

214
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,560
It’s Father’s fault.

215
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,660
Why are you

216
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,070
turning a blind eye to it?

217
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,500
I will not allow you

218
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,580
to make more mistakes

219
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,530
and inflict more suffering
on the innocent.

220
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,190
If you insist on moving forward,

221
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,440
get over

222
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,310
my dead body first!

223
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,510
Young Master, watch out for ambush.

224
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,070
Yuwen Yue is the target.

225
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,570
Follow me.

226
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,120
They’re gone.

227
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,070
Yes.

228
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,980
We let them out on purpose.

229
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,000
Yuwen Yue is at home

230
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,070
with this place.

231
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:28,740
Their people are few

232
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,850
and they move fast.

233
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,360
We lost them in the woods.

234
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,080
His Highness is going after them.

235
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,250
Go back

236
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,350
and head to Xiuli Mountain with our troops

237
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,310
to arrest Chu Qiao
and take her back to Hongchuan

238
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,730
in the name of conniving with enemies.

239
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,080
General,

240
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,590
once His Highness finds out about this,

241
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,310
he won’t be easy on you.

242
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,160
I’m not afraid of death.

243
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,630
But once the Wei Army arrives,

244
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,860
Yuwen Yue will kill His Highness.

245
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,450
Forget about peace talks.

246
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,050
They’re nothing but lies.

247
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,370
To achieve big,

248
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,410
one can’t be sentimental.

249
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,910
As long as Chu Qiao is around,

250
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,960
His Highness won’t strike Wei.

251
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,300
We have to let him know

252
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,560
she’s in love with someone else.

253
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,040
And tell Zhou An

254
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,180
it’s time

255
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,350
to proceed with his mission.

256
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,670
He can rest in peace.

257
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,180
Yanbei won’t forget him.

258
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,730
Let’s see

259
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,060
after knowing that,

260
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,340
whether Yuwen Yue will leave Yanbei

261
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,700
or not.

262
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:25,900
Young Master,

263
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,090
we caught him snooping around.

264
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,100
He demands to see you

265
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,360
for emergency.

266
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,190
General Yuwen,

267
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,310
I’m Miss Chu’s man,

268
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,810
Zhou An, commander of the Xiuli Army.

269
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,370
Miss Chu asked me

270
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,760
to report something important to you.

271
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,460
Isn’t He Xiao

272
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,040
the commander?

273
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,630
He was killed in the battle,

274
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,280
so I took over his place.

275
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,610
Miss Chu said

276
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,490
your whereabouts are no longer secret.

277
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,700
Whatever you’re here for,

278
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,860
you must leave immediately.

279
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,260
Xiuli Mountain has been surrounded

280
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,860
by the Back Eagle Army.

281
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,390
You can’t get out.

282
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,410
She’s arranged for an exit

283
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,520
at Yao Mountain.

284
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:02,910
You can leave through it

285
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,110
if you trust her.

286
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,520
His Highness’s force

287
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,710
is coming.

288
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,590
Leave now

289
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,930
before it’s too late.

290
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,570
What happened to her?

291
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,490
And

292
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,530
how did Commander He die?

293
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,120
I’m only here

294
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,400
to deliver that message.

295
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,390
I can’t tell you anything else.

296
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,570
You said all that

297
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:25,850
without anything concrete.

298
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,630
How are we supposed to trust you?

299
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,960
Be honest. Don’t you dare lie!

300
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,910
His Highness knew you had come here

301
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,670
and met with

302
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,590
Miss Chu.

303
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,340
He ordered her to kill you

304
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,040
but she refused to

305
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,970
and she had others stop Cheng Yuan’s men

306
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:41,790
from assassinating you.

307
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,750
They even engaged in a fight.

308
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,350
General, leave now,

309
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,920
or members of the Xiuli Army

310
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,220
would die in vain

311
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,760
and so would

312
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,240
Commander He.

313
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,430
Where is she now?

314
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,080
She was battling the Black Eagle Army

315
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,920
when I left.

316
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,640
I’m not sure where she is now.

317
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,040
I’ve said what I should

318
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,270
and shouldn’t say.

319
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,130
I disobeyed Miss Chu’s order

320
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,330
and shouldn’t serve her anymore.

321
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,820
General, go!

322
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,090
If you’re blessed

323
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,200
to get out safe and sound,

324
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,660
please

325
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,980
stay away from her

326
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,540
or take her away.

327
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,740
Don’t put her

328
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,630
into such a dilemma again.

329
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,260
Young Master,

330
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,390
don’t trust him.

331
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,960
What did the intelligence say

332
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,490
yesterday?

333
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,180
The Black Eagle Army branched out
into three columns

334
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,730
to the hinterland

335
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,630
in the direction of Xiuli Mountain.

336
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,070
All prefectures and counties

337
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,250
along the way

338
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,650
set up roadblocks.

339
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,250
The militia was constantly

340
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,230
on the move.

341
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,660
But all that doesn’t mean anything.

342
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,430
It’s likely

343
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,790
to be a trap

344
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,450
Yan Xun set for us.

345
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,150
If it was Yan Xun,

346
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,710
since he could’ve tracked us down,

347
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,370
Yan Xun could’ve come at us

348
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,420
with his force.

349
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,330
Why go through so much trouble?

350
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,910
Perhaps

351
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,480
someone is trying to

352
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,560
get rid of you

353
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:28,960
in Yan Xun’s name.

354
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,090
That makes sense.

355
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,580
Zhao Kuang’s men

356
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,710
at Meilin Pass

357
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:33,960
always hold a grudge

358
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,850
against you.

359
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,090
Maybe they followed us

360
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:36,890
all the way to Yanbei

361
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,940
and tipped Yan Xun off.

362
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,550
It could also be Yan Xun’s general

363
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,340
Cheng Yuan,

364
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,270
or someone

365
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,510
from Chang’an.

366
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,060
Yes, Young Master.

367
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,570
This whole thing is fishy.

368
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,090
I agree.

369
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:56,010
But what if it’s true?

370
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,210
It’s most certainly not.

371
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:58,940
I bet

372
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,390
someone is waiting for us

373
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,470
to rise to the bait.

374
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,240
And if you’re wrong?

375
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,880
I started this.

376
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,770
I must see her to be sure.

377
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,480
Young Master.

378
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,890
Miss Chu, a message came from Hongchuan.

379
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,100
We’re accused of conniving with enemies

380
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,360
and disclosing military secrets.

381
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,130
They’re going to arrest you

382
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,610
and take you back to Hongchuan
for questioning.

383
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,050
Is that Yan Xun’s order?

384
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,770
Only a verbal command.

385
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,150
Who’s the messenger?

386
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,060
He claimed to be a Black Eagle

387
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,960
but I know him.

388
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,240
He’s Cheng Yuan’s man.

389
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:36,930
Tie him up.

390
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,570
Take 20 men

391
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,250
to go to Hongchuan with me.

392
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,550
Aye.

393
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,630
Prince Yu.

394
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,580
Your Highness, don’t worry too much.

395
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,520
You’ve done your best.

396
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,550
Anything about Yuwen Yue?

397
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,740
And my brother?

398
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,660
Our source of information is limited

399
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,530
but what we do know is

400
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,830
Prince Xiang’s force

401
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,160
has camped 25 kilometers

402
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,910
away from

403
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,080
Meilin Pass.

404
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,120
My guess is

405
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,920
if Young Master Yue isn’t back,

406
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,700
Prince Xiang will level Yanbei.

407
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,560
I’m so useless.

408
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,450
The war must stop.

409
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,030
Barbarians are invading us from the north.

410
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,820
Liang is also coveting our land.

411
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,220
Wei is falling apart.

412
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,820
The world has returned

413
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,890
to the chaotic state.

414
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,550
Everyone is suffering.

415
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,930
It’s all my fault.

416
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,870
Your Highness.

417
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,200
Trust me,

418
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,440
Young Master Yue will be back.

419
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,010
He knows what to do.

420
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,680
He’s our only hope.

421
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,640
What’s up, Miss Chu?

422
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,710
It doesn’t feel right.

423
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:28,760
What’s wrong?

424
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,310
Yan Xun is crazy.

425
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,790
I’m not his target.

426
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,250
Yuwen Yue is.

427
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,600
What to do now?

428
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,430
We split up.

429
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,430
You and the Xiuli Army

430
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,720
head to Meilin Pass.

431
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,230
I’ll meet you there.

432
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,070
Sure.

433
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,070
Everyone, follow me!

434
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,250
Yan Xun,

435
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,390
do you know what you are doing?

436
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,930
You tell me.

437
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,520
Where’s Yuwen Yue?

438
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,910
I’ve shot him to death.

439
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,490
Why did you kill him?

440
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,500
A Wei general

441
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,270
sneaked into

442
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,480
our hinterland.

443
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,620
Why couldn’t I

444
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,710
kill him?

445
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,810
Achu, do you honestly

446
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,950
care more about him

447
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,600
than me and Yanbei combined?

448
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,310
You could kill him.

449
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,670
You could kill him fair and square

450
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,130
on the battlefield.

451
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,590
But how could you use me

452
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,110
and his feelings for me?

453
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,400
We had a deal.

454
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,950
That we’d show no mercy
on each other in war.

455
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,880
Achu,

456
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,830
as the ruler of Yanbei,

457
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,430
there are things I have to do.

458
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,420
Don’t you understand

459
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,280
all that I’ve done is for you?

460
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:39,020
You slaughtered my soldiers and army.

461
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,570
You deprived me of our ambition.

462
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,090
You exiled me,

463
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,620
suspected me, used me,

464
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,030
doubted me and spied on me.

465
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:56,400
All that is for my sake?

466
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,100
I’m trying to protect you.

467
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,330
That’s your so-called protection?

468
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,440
Achu,

469
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,340
I only have one question.

470
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,130
Have you

471
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,460
ever loved me?

472
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,190
I’m not sure what I have for you

473
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,340
is love or not.

474
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,150
All I know is

475
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:33,630
I care so much about you.

476
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,660
I can’t allow others to hurt you.

477
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,750
Your dream is my dream.

478
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,840
Your hometown

479
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,460
is my hometown.

480
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:48,160
Your status, safety

481
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,870
gains and losses

482
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:51,980
mean the most to me

483
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,850
over the years.

484
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,470
My biggest dream

485
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:00,270
is to go back to Yanbei

486
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:00,960
with you

487
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,630
and watch you return home intact

488
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,380
as you’ve ever wanted.

489
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,710
I’ve lost my family

490
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:14,150
and memory.

491
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,140
All these years,

492
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,560
you mean the world to me.

493
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,060
You’re the hope of my life.

494
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,200
But now, I start to question

495
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,850
if all that I’ve done

496
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:30,240
is worth it.

497
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,570
Do I know the real you?

498
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,710
Yan Xun,

499
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:42,150
since you arrived in Yanbei,

500
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,780
your suspicion has started to grow.

501
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,790
You suspect Zhong Yu.

502
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,800
You suspect Mr. Wu.

503
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,970
You suspect me.

504
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,990
You suspect everyone who might pose

505
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,340
a threat to your rule.

506
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,960
You’ve become a slave

507
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,870
to power.

508
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,910
Your hatred and grudge

509
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,040
are only tools to serve

510
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,180
your selfish desires.

511
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:12,480
Yan Xun,

512
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,770
I don’t blame you for killing Yuwen Yue

513
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,720
but the way you killed him

514
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,790
is despicable.

515
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,880
You shouldn’t have abused

516
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,220
my loyalty.

517
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,280
You shouldn’t have taken advantage of

518
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,160
our relationship.

519
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,420
Now, as you wish,

520
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,860
I’m going to find Yuwen Yue.

521
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,660
Here’s my last warning.

522
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,540
If he’s killed in Yanbei,

523
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,370
I’ll never forgive you.

524
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,350
Move!

525
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,300
No!

526
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,610
Fine!

527
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,090
Too bad, you’re late!

528
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,360
Save Young Master.

529
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,420
He’s at the Icy Lake...

530
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,240
Go, Miss Chu.

531
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,430
I’ll cover you.

532
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,620
Take care.

533
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,660
Run!

534
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,280
Run!

535
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:03,770
Yuwen Yue!

536
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:07,830
Yuwen Yue!

537
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:18,800
- Yuwen Yue.
- Xing’er.

538
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,530
I’m here.

539
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,440
Leave.

540
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,130
Go.

541
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:34,670
No.

542
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,740
I’m not going anywhere.

543
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,690
I won’t leave.

544
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:44,410
Xing’er, be good.

545
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,140
I’m sorry.

546
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,710
I won’t leave you ever again.

547
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:07,890
Hang in there.

548
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,930
Stay with me.

549
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:15,910
Hang in there!

550
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:27,010
Hang in there!

551
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,390
Get up.

552
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:48,610
Get up, Yuwen Yue!

553
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,890
Get up, Yuwen Yue!

554
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,950
Get up!

555
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,480
Get up, Yuwen Yue!

556
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,930
Get up!

557
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:21,660
Go... Go now.

558
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,490
Leave!

559
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:28,170
No!

560
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:33,130
No! No!

561
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,800
No!

562
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:38,800
No!

563
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,220
Wake up, Yuwen Yue.

564
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:05,100
Achu, you said I had changed.

565
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:08,430
Truth is, I’m always the same.

566
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,810
It’s just you never know

567
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,040
what I truly want.

568
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,850
Now,

569
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,200
I’ve shown you

570
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,730
my belief and ambition

571
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:26,460
in this way.

572
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,760
Your Highness, the ice is too fragile

573
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,020
to hold more weight.

574
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,090
Wait for me.

575
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,840
No!

576
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,190
Yuwen Yue!

577
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,710
Yuwen Yue!

578
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,110
Live on.

579
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:32,150
Don’t give up.

580
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,980
Stay with me.

581
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,770
Don’t leave me alone.

582
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:39,670
Don’t give up.

583
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:48,450
