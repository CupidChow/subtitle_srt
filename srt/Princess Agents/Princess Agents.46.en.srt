Do you know

17
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,620
why I named you Xing’er?

18
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,180
Because when I saw you

19
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,150
for the first time,

20
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,670
your eyes

21
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,230
were brighter than stars.

22
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,150
I have already told you

23
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,150
my name is not Xing’er.

24
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,500
It’s Chu Qiao.

25
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,170
But to me,

26
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,630
you are Xing’er.

27
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,750
It’s Chu Qiao.

28
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,560
Say whatever you want,

29
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,660
but I will call you Xing’er.

30
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,580
My name is Chu Qiao.

31
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,360
Hello, sweetheart,

32
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:48,590
come here.

33
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,390
Come.

34
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,660
Where are your parents?

35
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,800
How old are you?

36
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,790
I’m almost nine.

37
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,910
My name is Xingxing.

38
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,270
Who gave you that name?

39
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,800
What are you doing?

40
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,970
He’s annoying.

41
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:12,940
Just ignore him.

42
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,260
Look, isn’t his face

43
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,130
as long as donkeys’?

44
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,570
He is better-looking than donkeys.

45
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,750
Are you going to eat it?

46
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,810
You can have it.

47
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,770
You are so kind.

48
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,270
Mo.

49
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,010
Who is he?

50
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,310
He is my younger brother.

51
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,770
You are lying.

52
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,690
I’m not.

53
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,920
He’s wearing silk,

54
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,440
while you’re

55
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,660
covered with coarse linen.

56
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,940
Obviously,
you two are of different classes.

57
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,730
What do you mean?

58
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,180
Those of different classes

59
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,710
can’t be siblings?

60
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,080
Sweetie,

61
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,790
tell me

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,160
who he is.

63
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,510
His name is Mo,

64
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,640
Lord Ouyang’s son.

65
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,860
He always brings me

66
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,200
snacks and desserts.

67
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,620
The night before last,

68
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,730
he snuck

69
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,340
into the yard

70
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,000
and told me

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,040
his whole family had been killed,

72
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,470
and he had no place to go.

73
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,790
So I... I...

74
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,310
I hid him

75
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,710
in the back of my family’s carriage.

76
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,950
You hid him there?

77
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,920
Didn’t your family see him?

78
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,620
My father found him earlier.

79
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,210
He said many bad guys

80
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,960
are looking for Mo.

81
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,700
If we kept him, Master and my whole family

82
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,330
would be in trouble.

83
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,230
So he drove Mo away.

84
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,890
Mo is my friend.

85
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,590
I have to help him.

86
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,610
So I decided to leave with him.

87
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,490
We snuck out without being noticed.

88
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,510
When we smelt

89
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,410
the food you were eating,

90
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,540
we both felt hungry.

91
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,310
What is the name of your master?

92
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,050
Lord Liu, Liu Xi.

93
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:54,890
How long have you been out?

94
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,440
We left

95
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,210
when they were cooking.

96
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,270
Xingxing.

97
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,930
It’s getting dark.

98
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,140
If you don’t go home,

99
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,450
your parents will worry about you.

100
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,770
Xingxing.

101
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,850
- Miss, can you please
- Xingxing.

102
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,650
hide Mo in your carriage?

103
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,030
Xingxing.

104
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:12,620
Fine.

105
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,800
I promise

106
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,990
I will take care of him for you.

107
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,070
Go home now,

108
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,670
or your parents will be worried.

109
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,090
Just keep it.

110
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,190
In case she regrets it

111
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,220
and abandons you tomorrow,

112
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,480
you can come to me.
Eat it when you’re hungry.

113
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,590
Xingxing, if you need help,

114
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,660
just let me know.

115
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,630
She is such a loyal friend.

116
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,400
I have seen

117
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,470
some silly girl who is more loyal
than her.

118
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,810
Who is silly?

119
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,210
That is called loyalty.

120
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,280
She’d help everyone in need

121
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,320
and provoke others.

122
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,940
She is too ignorant to fear nothing.

123
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,130
Isn’t that silly?

124
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,720
Again that is called loyalty.

125
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,650
Alright.

126
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,430
You are a loyal friend

127
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,350
and you’re willing to help her.

128
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,780
Yanbei is so far away.

129
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,860
Does she know how to get there?

130
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,990
Stop twisting my words.

131
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,410
Miss, can I have it?

132
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,230
Here you are.

133
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,130
Don’t you already have one?

134
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,280
I have to keep it.

135
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,480
Xingxing told me

136
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,960
to eat it if you abandon me.

137
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,770
Don’t listen to him. Just take it.

138
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,990
Is there meat to eat with it?

139
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,400
No.

140
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,360
And abalone soup?

141
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,290
No.

142
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,630
Cubilose soup?

143
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,130
A roasted pigeon will do, too.

144
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,330
We have none.

145
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,850
You are so poor.

146
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,830
Mo,

147
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,510
just eat this for now.

148
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,550
Tomorrow, he’ll

149
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,920
go hunting,

150
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,380
and then you can have meat, alright?

151
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,300
Miss, this bun tastes good.

152
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,710
It must be made by you.

153
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:43,620
Sleep now.

154
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,770
Aren’t you sleepy?

155
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,180
What are you thinking?

156
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,120
My father said

157
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,650
he and mother were busy at night.

158
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,540
So it’s been a while

159
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,490
since I slept with them.

160
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,560
And I will never

161
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,600
see them again.

162
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,130
Would you

163
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,490
let me go

164
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,500
because you two are busy too?

165
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:11,870
Mo,

166
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,990
forget about those bad things.

167
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,940
Just go to bed.

168
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,780
Who are you?

169
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,580
How dare you harm innocent people?

170
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,240
They weren’t innocent.

171
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,360
They failed to keep their promise.

172
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,060
Who gave you the order?

173
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,610
You two

174
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,750
better stay out of this.

175
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,950
Don’t act against Lord Liu Xi.

176
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,230
Liu Xi?

177
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,610
He is an ally of Yanbei.

178
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,720
You do have

179
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,790
eyes and ears everywhere.

180
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,040
Do you want me to

181
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,640
help you kill the traitor?

182
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,120
That’s our own business.

183
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,000
We can take care of it ourselves.

184
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,480
You stay out of it.

185
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,160
Take care of Mo.

186
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,060
Mo.

187
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,530
Do you want to help her?

188
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,760
Yuwen Yue, I told you to stay out of it.

189
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,780
Why are you following me?

190
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,180
I brought Mo here

191
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,870
to see what you’re going to do.

192
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,350
I can keep that for you.

193
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,990
Those are the ones

194
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,270
who killed my entire family.

195
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,870
I recognize their clothes.

196
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,820
Sir, are we going to die as well?

197
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,880
Mo, don’t be afraid.

198
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,770
I’m here.

199
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,060
So is he.

200
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,470
If you are in danger,

201
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,840
just hold onto him.

202
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,950
She is right.

203
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,140
We are not going to die.

204
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,240
Your Highness.

205
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,400
What’s that noise?

206
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,570
We have tracked down

207
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,490
Ouyang’s son.

208
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,460
The thing is

209
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,630
there are two people trying to save him.

210
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,830
They have been following us.

211
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,270
I think

212
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,720
they are Ouyang Qian’s people,

213
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,790
coming here for revenge.

214
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,890
Now, they’re outside

215
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,140
struggling.

216
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,310
They are bold.

217
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,890
Liu Xi, get out!

218
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,540
That sounds like Miss Chu.

219
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:34,860
I’ll take care of it.

220
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:35,650
Wait a second.

221
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,680
Wear a mask.

222
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,880
We are going to meet sooner or later.

223
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,050
Is that really necessary?

224
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,650
Liu Xi, you rat!

225
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,770
Come out now!

226
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,260
I’ll kill you!

227
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,430
Let them go.

228
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,540
My master asks you to leave.

229
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,860
You have one hour.

230
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,320
Get out!

231
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,830
Do you really

232
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,840
want to die here?

233
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:31,950
Go!

234
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,640
Someday,

235
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,870
if I catch you,

236
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,810
I’ll be lenient with you, too.

237
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,630
Let’s go.

238
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,100
Achu.

239
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,630
Finally, here you are

240
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,160
standing in front of me safe and sound.

241
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,300
But I couldn’t see you.

242
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,400
Heaven has never

243
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,820
had any mercy on me.

244
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,330
Are you all right, Mo?

245
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,680
Are you sad?

246
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,770
I know how you feel.

247
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:43,970
Xingxing. Xingxing.

248
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,680
Xingxing.

249
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,580
Mo, do you hate those people?

250
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,930
I will grow up as fast as I can

251
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:53,070
and be as skilled as him.

252
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,310
Then I will kill all the bad people
in the world.

253
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,510
You need to practice really hard then.

254
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,770
Even if you can’t kill the enemy,

255
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,890
at least you can protect yourself.

256
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,440
What’s on your mind?

257
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:37,720
Nothing.

258
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,270
Fine.

259
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,950
I will go hunting

260
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,220
and find something to eat.

261
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,510
Yuwen Yue.

262
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,080
Be careful out there.

263
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,780
They might be still searching for us.

264
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,270
They won’t come after us

265
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,910
after letting us go.

266
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,320
Take care of Mo.

267
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,090
Don’t run around.

268
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,210
What?

269
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,190
I said

270
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,190
don’t run around.

271
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,760
Miss.

272
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,790
Mo.

273
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,060
Mo,

274
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,750
you should

275
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,600
go with him.

276
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,300
You should listen to him

277
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,520
and be a good boy.

278
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,190
He will teach you knowledge

279
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,270
and martial art.

280
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,140
He will take good care of you.

281
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,160
Are you leaving now?

282
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,490
I have to because

283
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,790
I know someone

284
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:47,080
who is as unfortunate as you.

285
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,390
His entire family was also killed.

286
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,560
He’s suffered more than you.

287
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,360
Over the years, he’s endured so much,

288
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,610
being bullied and insulted.

289
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,430
All he could do is to wait.

290
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,360
Swallow the pain

291
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,270
and wait for the day to revenge.

292
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,760
I’ll take revenge for Xingxing

293
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,860
as well.

294
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,060
So,

295
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,760
no matter what you will do in the future,

296
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,520
I will always forgive you

297
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,530
because…

298
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,040
because I know

299
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,420
what you went through

300
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,180
and why you end up like this.

301
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,870
But, Mo,

302
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,570
before you do anything wrong,

303
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,300
I’ll do my best to stop you.

304
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,160
I won’t do anything wrong.

305
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,810
I will always listen to you.

306
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,790
Good boy.

307
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,060
I hope you will always remember

308
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,350
what I said today.

309
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,280
Go to sleep.

310
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,330
Sir, a purple sign appeared

311
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,740
in the direction of Kongsang Mountain
last night.

312
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,880
You may leave.

313
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,730
Aye.

314
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,660
A purple sign.

315
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,300
That meant Young Master

316
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,290
was in an emergency situation.

317
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,690
Why did he call for help then?

318
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,030
General,

319
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,690
we have discovered crack troops

320
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:17,580
near the Kongsang Mountain
close to Xianyang.

321
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,570
It seemed that a caravan was killed.

322
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,570
Interesting.

323
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,350
Members of Xianyang Chamber

324
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,550
assumed Yan Xun

325
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,120
would reward them.

326
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:29,970
Turns out,

327
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,770
they lost their lives because of him.

328
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,710
Set out now.

329
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,130
This time,

330
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,860
I will kill Yan Xun and his followers

331
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:41,770
once and for all.

332
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:42,840
Aye.

333
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,680
I’ll gather Yue Guards immediately

334
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,500
to join your troops.

335
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,580
There is no need.

336
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,040
You can focus on

337
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,170
finding your master.

338
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,010
Let me deal with

339
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,700
that bastard Yan Xun.

340
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,500
Young Master Wei,

341
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,290
so long.

342
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,090
You may leave.

343
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,820
Sir.

344
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,410
Mo, where is she?

345
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,420
Don’t know.

346
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,780
Where did she go?

347
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,550
Goodbye. Don’t try to find me.

348
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,570
You once said I could leave as my wish.

349
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,180
I need to see him

350
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,370
to stop him from sinking even lower.

351
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,050
Please take care of Mo.

352
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,530
Yuwen Yue, thank you.

353
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,580
Sir, where are you going?

354
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,500
Right. Where am I going?

355
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,870
To follow her?

356
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,330
Who am I to her?

357
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,080
Yuwen Yue,

358
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,000
you are so stupid.

359
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,970
A hopeless fool.

360
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,180
Your Highness,

361
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,180
intel shows Wei Shuye is heading
towards us

362
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,030
with his force.

363
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,620
Your Highness.

364
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,960
Split into two groups and retreat.

365
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,480
You go first.

366
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,120
You can’t take this risk.

367
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,260
I can’t let you wait anymore.

368
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,950
I still have some unfinished business.

369
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,570
Your Highness, even if you stay,

370
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,430
you can’t go to Miss Chu directly.

371
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,210
She’s kind by nature

372
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,360
and upright.

373
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,880
So many things have happened.

374
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,250
It takes time to explain them all.

375
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,030
Your Highness, if you trust me,

376
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,320
then let me stay.

377
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,850
I swear I will bring Miss Chu

378
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,010
back to Yanbei safe and sound.

379
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:32,730
Your Highness,

380
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,810
please let Feng Mian stay.

381
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,190
Let’s go.

382
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,720
Xingxing,

383
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,690
I’m sorry.

384
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,200
I’m unable to avenge your murder.

385
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,480
I failed you.

386
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:31,190
I can’t do it.

387
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,370
Although I didn’t catch Yan Xun,

388
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:06,330
I’m lucky enough

389
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,710
to find you.

390
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,050
Really?

391
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,920
What can you do?

392
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,400
Seriously,

393
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,810
can you

394
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:17,830
kill us all?

395
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,380
I may not be able

396
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,690
to kill you,

397
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,910
but at least, I can choose

398
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,120
how to kill myself.

399
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,360
Catch her!

400
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,120
Aye.

401
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,130
Shoot!

402
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,590
Shoot them!

403
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,120
Qiaoqiao!

404
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,670
Please do not die!

405
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:15,560
Qiaoqiao!

406
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:17,940
Qiaoqiao!

407
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,390
You can’t die!

408
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:56,490
Master.

409
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,710
You ranked first in the test that year.

410
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,470
But you failed

411
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,790
your first mission.

412
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,480
How dare you come back!

413
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,950
You know the rules, don’t you?

414
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,110
I dare not forget.

415
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,500
Once the mission is failed,

416
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,250
we must kill ourselves with poison.

417
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,380
That’s the rule.

418
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,020
This time,

419
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,670
my two partners

420
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:31,710
have died.

421
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,910
Although I am wounded,

422
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,950
I managed to escape.

423
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,630
No one stalked me

424
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,590
on my way back.

425
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,330
Why should I trust you?

426
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,820
I am telling the truth.

427
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,120
What’s wrong?

428
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,970
I almost forgot.

429
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,670
It is the end of the season again.

430
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,650
All the trainees in the Death Camp

431
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,460
have taken the pill I made.

432
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:12,030
The antidote will be given
at the end of every season.

433
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,600
If you don’t take it in time,

434
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,850
you’ll die

435
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,180
within one hour.

436
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:19,740
I...

437
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,970
Master, I...

438
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,550
I do not want to die.

439
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:30,260
You should have died when you failed.

440
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:34,000
But I...

441
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:37,550
I didn’t get caught.

442
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,230
The mission didn’t say

443
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:44,360
I must kill myself if I managed to escape.

444
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,950
And I...

445
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,390
I come to report back to you.

446
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,050
What’s there to report?

447
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,430
That... That woman…

448
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,520
That woman…

449
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,180
What about her?

450
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,380
Is she dead?

451
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:08,940
Not yet.

452
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,520
But...

453
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,590
She will die soon.

454
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,240
I...

455
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,750
I poisoned her.

456
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,710
How was she poisoned?

457
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:34,330
I dissolved the pill

458
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:36,530
in water,

459
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,470
and soaked my needle in it.

460
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,710
That’s a smart move.

461
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:47,100
You learned that yourself.

462
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,730
But why that pill

463
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,640
instead of other poison
that could kill her instantly?

464
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,420
I... I assumed

465
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,630
she might be useful to you.

466
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,890
How so?

467
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,500
You...

468
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,490
You said it when you gave us the mission

469
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,840
that we could trim the sails.

470
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,520
So many people are loyal to me.

471
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:29,910
But the loyal and smart ones

472
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,390
are rare.

473
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,890
Master,

474
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,440
please give me another chance.

475
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,150
Give me a reason.

476
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,730
Why should I save you?

477
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,230
I will be the Nirvana

478
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,270
next time.

479
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,520
I won’t fail again.

480
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,900
You always lose.

481
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:53,630
No.

482
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,830
Not again.

483
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,350
Go ahead.

484
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,600
The big test is coming.

485
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,760
Young Master, another letter from Princess

486
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,270
asking how things are going.

487
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,790
Write her back

488
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:20,090
saying the target is dead.

489
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,590
Inform everyone

490
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,270
to get ready after breakfast.

491
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,190
We are going back to Chang’an.

492
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,150
Aye.

493
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:35,750
= Feng Mian’s Mansion =
Stop!

494
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,550
Yuwen Yue.

495
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,510
Where is Xing’er?

496
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:07,170
That woman again.

497
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,810
Yuwen Yue,

498
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:12,140
you two are on opposite sides.

499
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,510
Stop making yourself a fool

500
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:16,690
for her!

501
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,090
I am asking you where she is.

502
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:19,950
Dead!

503
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,810
Fell from the cliff and died!

504
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:23,030
No remains left.

505
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,660
What now?

506
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,310
Are you going to revenge for her?

507
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:32,230
Yuwen Yue,

508
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,100
you’ve completely lost your mind!

509
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,540
Open your eyes and look.

510
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,420
This mansion

511
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,950
belongs to Mr. Feng,

512
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:41,630
a household name in Xianyang.

513
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,510
Back then,

514
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,060
he was Yan Xun’s guard,

515
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,840
Feng Mian.

516
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,240
In less than three years

517
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,850
since he arrived,

518
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,870
he’s become

519
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,150
the richest and most powerful figure
in the city.

520
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,920
The Xianyang Chamber he owns

521
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,060
has committed all manners of crime

522
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,470
for money

523
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:03,780
to support Yanbei.

524
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,950
As for Yan Xun?

525
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,800
He has done all kinds of evil

526
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,320
and planned for years

527
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,830
to rebel.

528
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,260
That woman

529
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,710
is aware of all that.

530
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,500
Innocent people in Chang’an

531
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,670
were slaughtered.

532
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,880
Prince Yu lost his arm.

533
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,580
And Princess...

534
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:24,860
Everything that happened

535
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:27,190
is related to her.

536
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,260
She is forever a sinner to Wei.

537
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,200
Do you understand?

538
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,230
Yuwen Yue,

539
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,370
you still want to save her?

540
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,850
Do you really know what you are doing?

541
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:44,940
Enough!

542
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,510
I’m going back to Chang’an.

543
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,380
If you want to stay,

544
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,440
be my guest.

545
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:55,780
But listen,

546
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,830
if you are still obsessed with her,

547
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,090
I’ll have no mercy on you.

548
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,520
Pack up and get the horse ready.

549
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,180
Let’s go!

550
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,490
Aye.

551
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:18,380
Young Master, it’s been confirmed.

552
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,040
The escort agency

553
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,970
that followed you and Xing’er

554
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,310
was hired by

555
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:22,950
Liu Xi.

556
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,920
But he was killed

557
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,920
before setting off.

558
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,650
Cheng Yuan, Yan Xun

559
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,030
and his guard Ajing

560
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,430
were seen in Xianyang.

561
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,090
You’re probably right.

562
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,670
The one pretended to be Liu Xi

563
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,050
in the camp that day

564
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:36,990
couldn’t be anyone else

565
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,520
but His Excellency Yan Xun.

566
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:40,180
He left

567
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,650
after that day

568
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,800
and should have

569
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,460
reached Yanbei by now.

570
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,220
Have you located that cliff

571
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,390
Wei Shuye mentioned?

572
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,310
Yes.

573
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,850
Our men went down to check.

574
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:55,090
No body was found.

575
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,540
If Young Master Wei

576
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,480
told the truth,

577
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,030
Xing’er is

578
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,180
likely to be alive.

579
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,000
Young Master,

580
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,110
there is something I have to say.

581
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,950
I know you like Xing’er.

582
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,020
But things have changed.

583
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,910
She has made her choice.

584
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,910
You are the general of Wei

585
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,520
while she is a Yanbei rebel.

586
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:16,670
You two aren’t meant

587
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,570
to be together.

588
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,060
Young Master,

589
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,050
think about

590
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:21,890
your future.

591
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,960
Yan Xun has left.

592
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,370
If I didn’t help her,

593
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,870
what else could she do?

594
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:35,910
Aye.

595
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:45,910
Young Master.

596
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,540
A letter on the arrow.

597
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:30,970
Qiaoqiao, you’re awake.

598
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:36,260
Xiao Ce?

599
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,500
I surprised you, didn’t I?

600
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:41,650
I’m telling you,

601
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,230
only I could

602
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,510
save you

603
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,880
from the mire

604
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,440
at such a critical moment.

605
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,310
How do you feel? Are you touched?

606
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,310
Will you marry me?

607
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,300
Do you need water?

608
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,020
Go get her water.

609
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,830
Where am I?

610
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,840
Qiaoqiao, you must be hungry.

611
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,930
I’ll ask them

612
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:08,990
to cook for you.

613
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,380
What would you like to eat?

614
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,370
You look so pale.

615
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:14,290
Nutritious food is good for your body.

616
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,680
Xiao Ce…

617
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,310
Don’t worry.

618
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,800
You’re here with me

619
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,650
and you are safe now.

620
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,440
Danger could be a blessing in disguise.

621
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,440
Relax. You still have me.

622
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,820
Your Highness, Yuwen Yue is here.

623
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,510
He’s fast.

624
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,290
I’ll be right back.

625
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,700
You arrived

626
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,230
right after I sent you the letter.

627
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:15,630
Where is Xing’er?

628
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,170
Xing’er?

629
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:19,970
I mean Qiaoqiao.

630
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,450
That sounds better.

631
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,940
Thank you for caring for her.

632
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,810
Who are you thanking me?

633
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:31,570
Who are you to her?

634
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,250
Her former master?

635
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,930
Or the general of Wei?

636
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,250
Follow me.

637
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,030
Xing’er.

638
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,330
How did you find me?

639
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,810
Is that so hard?

640
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,710
Where’s Wei Shuye?

641
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,450
They...

642
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,800
They...

643
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:47,200
Why is she like this?

644
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,350
She was poisoned.

645
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,630
Don’t you know it?

646
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,030
Of course I do.

647
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:52,890
But I never imagined

648
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:54,890
she would be so weak.

649
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,350
That poison has acted up more than once.

650
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:02,730
We encountered

651
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:03,980
some mysterious killers

652
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,010
outside Wupeng.

653
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,770
One of them shot her

654
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:07,520
with a poisoned needle.

655
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,790
That poison is strong

656
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:10,800
and hard to be removed.

657
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,350
I’ve never seen it before.

658
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,460
Were there three killers?

659
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:16,280
Yes.

660
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:18,850
That’s what I thought.

661
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:21,840
Do you know who they are?

662
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,650
Have you heard of the Death Camp?

663
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,390
Met them a few times.

664
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,370
It’s a mysterious

665
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:32,950
assassins’ guild.

666
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,470
I’ve heard that only three people

667
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:36,720
can survive the Nirvana Kill

668
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,510
each time

669
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:38,570
and become Death Campers.

670
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,990
They are extremely skilled at poisoning.

671
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,500
Few can make the antidote.

672
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:43,250
A few years ago,

673
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:45,040
one of my officials was poisoned.

674
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:46,910
The symptoms were just like Qiaoqiao’s.

675
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,640
Once it acts up,

676
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,460
the patient will suffer
severe abdominal pain

677
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,750
or even go into a coma.

678
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,390
Death is inevitable.

679
00:43:57,790 --> 00:43:59,270
Given her current condition,

680
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,680
there isn’t much time left.
