Death Camp is a mysterious

17
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,030
assassins’ guild.

18
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,760
I’ve heard that only three people

19
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,710
can survive the Nirvana Kill each time

20
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,920
and become Death Campers.

21
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,580
They are extremely skilled at poisoning.

22
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,830
Few can make the antidote.

23
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,620
A few years ago,

24
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,300
one of my officials was poisoned.

25
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,190
The symptoms were just like Qiaoqiao’s.

26
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,100
Once it acts up,

27
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,780
the patient will suffer
severe abdominal pain

28
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,150
or even go into a coma.

29
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,870
Death is inevitable.

30
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,470
Given her current condition,

31
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,950
there isn’t much time left.

32
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,910
Where is the Death Camp?

33
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,030
Don’t know.

34
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,120
Who is the leader?

35
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,550
Don’t know that, either.

36
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,240
Then what do you know?

37
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,800
I think there is one person

38
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,890
that might have contacts with the Camp.

39
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,600
The head controlling the water transport

40
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,250
in Xianyang,

41
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,260
Zhan Ziyu.

42
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,060
He always gets things done

43
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,470
no matter what it is.

44
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,070
I see.

45
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,720
Xing’er will stay with you for now.

46
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,700
I’ll come back to pick her up

47
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,610
once my business is done.

48
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,740
Remember, behave yourself.

49
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,010
Don’t put us

50
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,040
in an awkward situation.

51
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,670
What am I in your eyes?

52
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,600
I know exactly

53
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,690
what kind of person you are.

54
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,870
That’s why I said that.

55
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,070
You went to great lengths to save Xing’er.

56
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,670
Then you led me here

57
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,170
so that I’d target

58
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,830
the Death Camp for you.

59
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,160
I don’t care

60
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,820
what you intend to do.

61
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,710
I’ll take care of all these things.

62
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,640
And you should just

63
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,730
mind your own business.

64
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,050
Good day.

65
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,340
What a show!

66
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:34,480
Young Master,

67
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,390
can we trust the Crown Prince of Liang?

68
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,350
We’ll find out.

69
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,890
I want everything

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,060
about Zhan Ziyu

71
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,790
and Death Camp.

72
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,710
Dig deep

73
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,620
until you find them.

74
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:50,710
Aye.

75
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,220
Aye.

76
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,340
This man is Xu Liang.

77
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,510
That must be his alias.

78
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,030
He lives in Guici County, Yulin.

79
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,370
That man is a skilled martial artist.

80
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,340
We lost three men

81
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,410
when we tried to catch him.

82
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:10,720
Once those people...

83
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,360
pass the test of nirvana,

84
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,400
they’ll officially

85
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,370
become Death assassins.

86
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,270
The best of the best

87
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,910
can break free from

88
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,600
the control of the Camp.

89
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,510
They can choose where to live.

90
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,680
As for the tasks,

91
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,960
apart from the Execution Order

92
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,080
from their leader,

93
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,160
it’s up to them

94
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,870
to take the task or not.

95
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,390
If they do, they’ll receive a bounty.

96
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,880
If not, no one will force them to.

97
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,470
Anyway,
their freedom is mostly guaranteed.

98
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,940
The contact between

99
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,630
them and their handlers

100
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,200
is usually one-way.

101
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,950
They have no other connections

102
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,230
other than giving and taking tasks.

103
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,300
And those assassins barely

104
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,690
know each other.

105
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,860
Few can

106
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,750
see their leader.

107
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,150
They basically live on

108
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,840
the bounty

109
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,480
of the tasks.

110
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,130
Guici County, Yulin...

111
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,550
That’s quite a remote place.

112
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,460
Why there

113
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,690
if he lives on the bounty?

114
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,420
Mr. Yueqi,

115
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,650
that is

116
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,900
a good question.

117
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,900
Most Death Campers

118
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,710
drift from place to place.

119
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,890
Many live

120
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,010
in big cities

121
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,390
to cover up their identities.

122
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,290
A few of them

123
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,530
stay at secluded places.

124
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,550
Apart from their preferences,

125
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,160
the biggest reason is

126
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,070
that place is where their home

127
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,390
used to be.

128
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,480
What about his family members?

129
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,830
Have you tracked them down?

130
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,460
No.

131
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,110
They’re all dead.

132
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,200
He is the youngest son

133
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,390
in his family.

134
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,130
He was abducted and trafficked

135
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,460
at the age of eleven.

136
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,510
Then he ended up in the Death Camp.

137
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,030
Unfortunately,

138
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:43,900
when he passed the test of nirvana,

139
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,430
and stood out from the crowd,

140
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,880
his entire family

141
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,070
was killed in a fire.

142
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,980
Did the Death Camp kill them?

143
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,480
Probably.

144
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,110
He is suspicious, too.

145
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,270
But he hasn’t

146
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,630
found enough proof

147
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,040
over the years.

148
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,260
Have you then?

149
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:00,870
No.

150
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,820
But I made one.

151
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,670
Please have a look.

152
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,630
Good. This is enough to fool others.

153
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,310
Thank you, Young Master.

154
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,960
Speak.

155
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,190
All these years,

156
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,800
how many times have you lied to me?

157
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,650
First, you said east of the Yellow River,

158
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,200
and then north of the Yangtze River.

159
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,390
I put my life on the line

160
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,760
but that successor of Luo He

161
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,350
was nowhere to be found.

162
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,740
She moves from place to place.

163
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,160
I saw her once

164
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,770
but that doesn’t mean

165
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,790
I know where she is now.

166
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,790
You were so eager to find her

167
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,400
that you came to me for clues.

168
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,240
How can you blame me?

169
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,870
Are you saying

170
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,930
it is my fault?

171
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,000
Don’t forget

172
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,950
I let you live

173
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,900
simply because

174
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,020
you’re useful to me.

175
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,570
If what you just said is true,

176
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,990
then you are useless.

177
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,250
Why should I keep you?

178
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,980
So?

179
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,630
Are you going to kill me?

180
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,760
I’m not,

181
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,340
but you are to meet your doom.

182
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,870
Who is Luo He?

183
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,500
The head of Underworld Spies

184
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,080
who is an eyesore

185
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,180
to the Eye of Intel.

186
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,490
She’s powerful enough to

187
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,610
battle Wei.

188
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,240
You know better than anyone

189
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,270
that the one who killed

190
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,790
Luo He

191
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,440
is you,

192
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,420
Xia Chong.

193
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,230
All these years, you’ve

194
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,710
tortured me in all kinds of ways.

195
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,350
You think

196
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,870
I’ll be intimidated by Luo He’s death?

197
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,560
Very well.

198
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,190
If that won’t work,

199
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,790
what about

200
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,910
the Death Camp?

201
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,070
Master, I have something to report.

202
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,120
Master, please take a look.

203
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,840
Three people are dead,
two men and a woman.

204
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,100
They are all young.

205
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,710
It’s the third time this month.

206
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,610
Check it out.

207
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,040
The fish were caught just now.

208
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,080
Very fresh.

209
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,120
- He is the liaison to the Death Camp.
- Have a nice day.

210
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,040
He was the one who connected me.

211
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,070
I need the antidote.

212
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,450
You’ll have it.

213
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,250
He is gone. Find him!

214
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:47,740
Go!

215
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,680
You guys, search this place.

216
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,950
The rest of you follow me.

217
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:56,820
Aye.

218
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,660
Where is that man?

219
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,590
I didn’t see any man.

220
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:04,760
Sorry,

221
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,870
we’d like to check inside.

222
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,310
What do you want?

223
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,520
I am a widow.

224
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,120
Step aside.

225
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,860
What are you doing?

226
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,810
Be quiet.

227
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,040
Three conditions.

228
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,350
First,

229
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,150
I can give you the antidote.

230
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,500
Second,

231
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,950
I can help you find

232
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,020
your long lost family

233
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,560
if you want.

234
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,030
Third,

235
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,580
you can

236
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,740
marry that widow

237
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,340
and start over together

238
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,540
at a place

239
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,850
where nobody knows you.

240
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,920
You’ll be out of
the Death Camp’s control.

241
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,270
Believe it or not,

242
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,980
but you only have two choices.

243
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,650
Follow my plan

244
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,060
and fight for yourself.

245
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,540
Or I will kill you.

246
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,950
I know people like you

247
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,480
aren’t afraid of death.

248
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,840
As a court official,

249
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,820
I never

250
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,150
abuse others.

251
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,260
But you and that woman

252
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,040
killed her husband together.

253
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,850
If that gets out,

254
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,160
her life

255
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,360
won’t be easy.

256
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,860
It had nothing to do with her.

257
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,980
I did it.

258
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,840
Her husband was a bastard.

259
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,370
I don’t have time for this.

260
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,250
I have listed the conditions.

261
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,890
Think carefully.

262
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,520
What’s your game this time?

263
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,300
Take you to your favorite place,

264
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,130
the Death Camp.

265
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,970
Your associates came to see you just now.

266
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,850
I don’t understand
what you are talking about.

267
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,400
You don’t?

268
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,050
Without me,

269
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,580
those diabolic fellows

270
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,750
would’ve taken you

271
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,250
out of Jiankang.

272
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,720
I heard your Camp would treat those

273
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
who managed to live

274
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,650
in enemies’ hands

275
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,100
cruelly enough

276
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,790
that they’d regret being born.

277
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,490
Also, they’d rather

278
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:38,640
suffer in hell instead of
going into the afterlife.

279
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,450
How did they know that I am here?

280
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,410
You want to die?

281
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,940
Not that easy.

282
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,010
Please don’t send me back, Princess.

283
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,940
Tell me,

284
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,870
who is Luo He’s daughter?

285
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,900
Where can I find her?

286
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,060
I really don’t know.

287
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,110
You won’t regret it

288
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,390
until it’s too late, will you?

289
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:10,750
I am telling you,

290
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,480
I have lost

291
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,460
my patience.

292
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,910
I will give you to them.

293
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,310
Although I don’t know,

294
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,880
the Death Camp

295
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,660
has the answer.

296
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,440
I am not that stupid.

297
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,300
Princess, at this point,

298
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,750
I will not lie to you.

299
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,000
But my level is low,

300
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,350
and my information is limited.

301
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,940
I really don’t know the answers
to your questions.

302
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,780
What do you know then?

303
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,930
There is a test of nirvana
in the Death Camp

304
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,500
every three years.

305
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,840
One hundred and eight trainees

306
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,120
will battle each other.

307
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,840
Only the last three standing

308
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,820
will pass the test,

309
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,120
and go into the afterlife.

310
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,180
Back then,
Leader assigned half of the Camp

311
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,490
to kill Luo He.

312
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,340
When she got caught,

313
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,280
I was asked to finish her.

314
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,030
But I gave up

315
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,400
at the last minute.

316
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,460
I didn’t know why,

317
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,630
but I sensed the love and warmth

318
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,960
that I had never had

319
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,250
in her eyes.

320
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,980
Luo He said

321
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:06,600
I reminded her

322
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,780
of her daughter.

323
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,510
Before taking her last breath,

324
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,970
she gave me ten percent of

325
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,320
the Ice Trick

326
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:13,860
enough to protect myself.

327
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,420
And she hoped that

328
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,600
I could pretend to be her daughter

329
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,060
to keep her out of the trap.

330
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,480
I said yes.

331
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,560
I am not a

332
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,400
qualified assassin.

333
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,040
You betrayed your master.

334
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,650
Did it occur to you
that you would be killed?

335
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,850
I knew that I was only

336
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,160
a tool for murder.

337
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,390
I would die sooner or later.

338
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,500
Why not be a nice person for once
before I die?

339
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,040
I guess

340
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,100
he wants me dead

341
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,270
to frame

342
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,480
Luo He’s daughter.

343
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,410
If I tell them

344
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,000
you killed your mother, Luo He,

345
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,990
do you think they will believe it?

346
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,790
Leader must’ve known Luo He.

347
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,430
You aren’t that useless.

348
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,660
Princess, if you want to find

349
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,730
Luo He’s daughter,

350
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,530
and control those Underworld Spies,

351
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,640
and use them

352
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,880
against Wei,

353
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,960
then you should

354
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,970
go to the head of the Death Camp.

355
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,970
Once you

356
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,350
find that person,

357
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,990
you will know everything.

358
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,660
Death Camp is heavily guarded.

359
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,530
And their leader

360
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,110
is mysterious.

361
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,810
If I can find him easily,

362
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,840
why do I waste time

363
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,360
on you?

364
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,170
If you

365
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,990
can’t find Leader,

366
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,910
then you’d better

367
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,620
go to the Death Camp yourself.

368
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,320
There is a secret log,

369
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,590
which records the key information

370
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,020
of all our actions

371
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,170
throughout the years.

372
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,420
Your Highness,

373
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,160
as long as you get hold of that,

374
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,580
you will find all the answers

375
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,380
to your questions

376
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,450
in the Death Camp.

377
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,610
Where is that place?

378
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,320
Kongsang Mountain.

379
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,300
I’ll work with you against Leader,

380
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,630
but you have to fulfill your promise.

381
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,970
Are you sure?

382
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,590
Yes.

383
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,480
I will make an excuse

384
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,800
to lure Leader out.

385
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,910
You can follow him secretly

386
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,700
and seize the opportunity to capture him.

387
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,240
Young Master,

388
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,230
they’re going to meet

389
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,760
right ahead.

390
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,300
But we haven’t spotted

391
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,200
the head of the Death Camp.

392
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,430
Young Master,

393
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,550
this must be

394
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,770
the one.

395
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,190
Master.

396
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,280
Follow him.

397
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,320
- Aye.
- Aye.

398
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,000
Listen,

399
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,340
the first round will last five days.

400
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,580
Food and water are limited.

401
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,540
And you need to fight for them.

402
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:12,780
Once the time is up,

403
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,500
they will be replenished.

404
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,660
There are many treasure boxes in the cave.

405
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:17,940
You may find

406
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,740
water

407
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,590
or food in them.

408
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,110
Meng Feng.

409
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,940
You ranked first last time.

410
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,670
This steamed bun is a prize for you.

411
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,920
Hong Yangbo.

412
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,610
You did well, too.

413
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,140
This dagger is for you.

414
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,340
Keep up the good work.

415
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,180
The competition begins.

416
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,790
Sorry, you are too late.

417
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,100
The provisions for the first round

418
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,320
have been taken.

419
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,910
They’ll figure out something.

420
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,580
Your people of the
Cangmang Mountain Branch

421
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,270
are quite confident.

422
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,370
Confidence is one of the basics.

423
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:52,670
Fine.

424
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,400
Hand in

425
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,620
all your weapons.

426
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,170
Food and water

427
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,050
will be replenished in five days.

428
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,510
Besides,

429
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,000
you all came a long way.

430
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:06,510
You must be exhausted

431
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,270
from the journey.

432
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,620
Do you need to take a rest

433
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,370
before joining the competition?

434
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,810
Split up

435
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,730
to get to the sanctum.

436
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,960
Find the secret log as soon as possible.

437
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,230
Aye.

438
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,530
It’s weird.

439
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,750
Why did they throw the steamed bun away?

440
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,020
Who are they?

441
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,140
Why are they holding the same long sword?

442
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,540
= Badge =

443
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,900
A badge?

444
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,830
Silk thread.

445
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,090
They are not Death Campers.

446
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,130
Leader.

447
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,970
Leader.

448
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,020
= Badge =

449
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,610
Secret Service of Liang.

450
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,260
Who are you?

451
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,260
A badge.

452
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,610
Young Master.

453
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:30,840
Aye.

454
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,870
Two of you guard the entrance.

455
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,900
The rest of you follow me.

456
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:47,720
Aye.

457
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,720
Young Master. Over there.

458
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,610
He disappeared right here.

459
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,970
He must be in the sanctum.

460
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,550
Be careful.

461
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,150
Young Master. This is a trap.

462
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,790
Take this.

463
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,270
Without a weapon, you won’t be able
to survive.

464
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:57,030
Why did you save me

465
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,550
and give me this?

466
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,480
These two

467
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,990
aren’t our members.

468
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:03,660
There are spies

469
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,070
among us.

470
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:06,690
If we want to live,

471
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,180
we must stop killing our own people.

472
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,920
We should cooperate.

473
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:14,570
Let’s go.

474
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,570
I’d like to join you, too.

475
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,130
Come on.

476
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,900
How can we distinguish our members

477
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,890
from spies of Liang?

478
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,600
Those not battling one-on-one,

479
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,750
aren’t our people.

480
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,280
Besides, there are green threads

481
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,440
on their right wrists.

482
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,790
They all have badges

483
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:46,020
and they all use long swords.

484
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,210
Let’s go.

485
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,220
I am your leader.

486
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,810
The nirvana today is getting better
and better

487
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,390
because there are spies among you.

488
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,310
Only by killing them,

489
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,810
can you achieve nirvana.

490
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,470
Are we exposed already?

491
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,080
There isn’t enough time.

492
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,530
You guys go in groups as well.

493
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,660
I want to end this nirvana

494
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,360
in the shortest time possible.

495
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:16,810
- Aye.
- Aye.

496
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:17,980
Wait a second.

497
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,010
Don’t kill all of them.

498
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,570
We need someone to lead the way.

499
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,090
- Aye.
- Aye.

500
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,930
We need more people.

501
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,320
Let’s split up.

502
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:34,210
Go.

503
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,760
They are spies. Kill them.

504
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:05,060
Hold on.

505
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,690
Keep them for now.

506
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,610
You may go.

507
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,160
Young Master, all the other trainees

508
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,520
will come after us.

509
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,640
Everyone. Be careful.

510
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,760
Stay together.

511
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,480
Find the sanctum as soon as possible.

512
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,270
- Aye.
- Aye.

513
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,340
I remember you. We have met before.

514
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,430
Shut up. Just kill me.

515
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,060
If you can do me a favor,

516
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,500
I’ll spare you.

517
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,890
I won’t help you.

518
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,110
Don’t waste your time.

519
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,430
You were here before,

520
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,360
which means you survived the test

521
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,450
of nirvana once.

522
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:18,840
So you must know

523
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,550
where your leader is.

524
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,730
Tell me.

525
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,300
I’m here for the antidote.

526
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,370
Why should I help you?

527
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,670
If you want to remove your poison,

528
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,070
just do what I say.

529
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,350
You have two choices.

530
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,000
Get killed,

531
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,280
or take me to see

532
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,060
your leader.

533
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,890
The secret log is in the sanctum

534
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,970
in the heart of the Camp.

535
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:09,470
We have been

536
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,840
circling around this place.

537
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,790
This map from Xia Chong

538
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:13,540
is fake.

539
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:15,950
We can deal with her when we get back.

540
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:21,880
Stop!

541
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,550
It’s a trap.

542
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,250
Thanks.

543
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,240
No need.

544
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,420
You are quite familiar

545
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:36,960
with this place.

546
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,190
The test comes every three years.

547
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,290
I’ve done it twice

548
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,580
and I am still alive.

549
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,090
Of course I am familiar with this place.

550
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,350
Let’s go. Be careful.

551
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,480
What happened?

552
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,070
- Where are they?
- Princess.

553
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,790
They are all dead.

554
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,500
We underestimated them.

555
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,660
What should we do now?

556
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,200
Find someone alive

557
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,030
to lead us to the sanctum.

558
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,240
How far is it?

559
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,290
Almost there.

560
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:26,010
That exit ahead

561
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:26,870
leads to the sanctum.

562
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,760
Thanks.

563
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,140
You finally smiled.

564
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,350
Lead me to the sanctum.

565
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,160
I don’t know where that is.

566
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,630
Shut up.

567
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:05,560
Fine. Fine.

568
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,660
I will lead the way.

569
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:15,680
Here it is.

570
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,970
Where is the antidote?

571
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:30,680
Too late.

572
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,590
He is poisoned

573
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,500
and dead now.

574
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,940
Where can we find the antidote?

575
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:38,970
Right here.

576
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:53,480
We can figure out something.

577
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,230
I killed

578
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,440
your leader.

579
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,310
Surrender now.

580
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,830
I will remove your poison.

581
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,350
This test is over.

582
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,400
Inform everyone to stop

583
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,430
and gather in the center of the sanctum.

584
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:18,720
Aye.

585
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,360
Aye.

586
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,160
Aye.

587
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,110
What’s your name?

588
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,390
Meng Feng.

589
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,020
You should learn when to stop.

590
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,260
Don’t push yourself too hard.

591
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,180
You are humans, not animals.

592
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,410
Wrong.

593
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,360
Young Master…

594
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,540
He isn’t the one.

595
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,870
This one

596
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,370
is the antidote to the pill.

597
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:20,890
Young Master, what’s wrong?

598
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,320
This is the only one.

599
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,410
The rest are not.

600
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,120
We have found the antidote

601
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,330
to Xing’er’s poison.

602
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,690
The ones outside are also poisoned.

603
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,380
Young Master,

604
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,760
they are assassins.

605
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,350
They are also

606
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,670
humans,

607
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,350
the unfortunate ones.

608
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,700
No one is born

609
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:46,440
to be a killer.

610
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,670
Rhizoma Smilacis Glabrae.

611
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,950
Radix Glycyrrhizae

612
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,590
and Houttuynia cordata.

613
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,040
These three

614
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,510
are commonly used herbs.

615
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:03,540
Can they remove the poison?

616
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,930
There is one more ingredient.

617
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:25,300
Young Master, he is poisoned

618
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,140
and dying.

619
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,640
Let him take this.

620
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,950
I got it.

621
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,540
The last herb to make the antidote

622
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,000
is the Indian Rose.

623
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,680
Indian Rose?

624
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,400
It’s highly toxic.

625
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,090
Five-gram is a lethal dose.

626
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,150
That’s right.

627
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,190
There is also Rhizoma Smilacis Glabrae.

628
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:58,900
What about it?

629
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,730
With more of that,

630
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:01,900
it can neutralize the Indian Rose,

631
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,670
making it less toxic.

632
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:04,630
Yueqi.

633
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,100
Have them make the antidote immediately.

634
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:07,890
Aye.

635
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:26,830
In this box,

636
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,640
there is the antidote to the poison

637
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,850
in your system.

638
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:31,500
After taking it,

639
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:32,950
you may go.

640
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,010
What?

641
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,010
You don’t trust me?

642
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:38,990
You are our new leader now.

643
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,350
Rise.

644
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,450
Listen,

645
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,050
I am not your

646
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:46,480
new leader

647
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,470
and I never will be.

648
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,480
They why did you

649
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,440
save us?

650
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,450
I didn’t save you

651
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,150
to gain your allegiance.

652
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,580
Listen carefully.

653
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,500
I killed your leader.

654
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,200
And I can

655
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,630
take your lives easily.

656
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:06,100
After you leave here,

657
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,950
if anyone

658
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,020
uses the skills learned there

659
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:12,120
to harm the innocent

660
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:13,660
and commit crimes,

661
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,850
I will make you suffer more

662
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:17,780
than being poisoned

663
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,500
by that pill.

664
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,030
Keep that in mind.

665
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:22,920
You may go now.

666
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:25,470
If we had a choice,

667
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:26,580
we wouldn’t be a tool

668
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,510
for killing.

669
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,730
Thank you for saving our lives.

670
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,380
- Thank you for saving our lives.
- Thank you for saving our lives.

671
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:34,690
Go.

672
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:37,590
From now on, you’re free.

673
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:53,400
Why aren’t you leaving?

674
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,180
We have nowhere else to go.

675
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:58,280
All of us are homeless.

676
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,120
We have been taught

677
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,590
to kill since childhood.

678
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,300
We can’t do anything

679
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,330
other than killing.

680
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,710
We don’t know how to

681
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,380
support ourselves out there.

682
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:09,850
What do you want?

683
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:12,100
Can we follow you?

684
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,570
Follow me?

685
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,770
We can kill your enemies.

686
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,740
I don’t have any.

687
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:21,890
No way.

688
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,250
Someone hired us to

689
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,880
kill your woman.

690
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,550
That must be your enemy.

691
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:29,340
In this case,

692
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,900
you’ll need to get rid of that person.

693
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,500
Someone is targeting my woman?

694
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:42,760
You should know,

695
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,480
I won’t

696
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,120
make your life any easier.

697
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,890
We have made the decision.

698
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,260
Are you reluctant to leave?

699
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,030
Thank Young Master.
