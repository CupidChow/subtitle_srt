Yes.

Our people

21
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,600
heard this from your brother.

22
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,240
They never made it to the Oriole Courtyard

23
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,490
and were killed.

Looks like

25
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,530
there is no need to alert Princess.

26

She has nothing to worry about.

Yuwen Yue isn’t
as cold-hearted as he seems.

He betrayed Yan Xun.

But actually, he cares a lot about him.

Good. At lease, someone can do

Didn’t we test the water

from the well yesterday?

From now on, all meals

After the mice eat the food,

46
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,100
don’t start eating immediately.

Some poison takes effect
more quickly than others.

48

Some are slow in taking effect.

49
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,430
We need to wait for at least two days.

50

If the mice are fine,

51

we can eat the food then.

It’s scorching.

54
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,370
The food will go bad in two days.

55
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,240
Bad food is still better than poison.

to Yanbei and find Mr. Wu.

The four of you are quite smart.

67
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,270
You can make a living out of this.

68

We don’t want that.

invited you over.

We are all from Yanbei.

When Yanbei was in danger,

79
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,690
all our family members were killed.

80
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,870
We are homeless.

after what His Excellency went through,

90
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,580
he’ll get back on his feet.

All our enemies

we are glad

97
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,040
to take that risk.

98
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,810
Besides,

who knows what will happen?

100

Maybe once we kill the Emperor of Wei,

101
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,820
His Excellency will reward

to learn.

107

We won’t be a burden on you.

108
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,170
I am not sure if I am helping you

109
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,360
or putting you in danger.

110
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,170
Is that a yes?

111
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,060
Since our lives are on the line,

112
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,600
we must hone our skills.

113

If you want to stay,

114
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,780
you must obey my orders.

115

Otherwise, you’ll die in vain.

116

everything we said.

122
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,530
From now on,

123
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,300

I don’t know. Sleep first.

that went to test Chu Qiao came back.

He said Yan Xun’s maid

142
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,370
is skilled and merciless.

143
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,410
But her skills

144
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,300
are of Yuwen’s style

145
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,540
instead of that of the underworld.

146
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,950
Her skills are from the Yuwen family?

147
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,830
Shall we test her again?

148
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,450
No need.

149
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,760
Your Excellency Yan Xun.

There’s another one.

She is resting inside now.

Chang’an

160
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,340
is becoming less and less safe.

161
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,230
I’ll ask the government

162
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,950
to get to the bottom of it.

163

Don’t worry.

164
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,290
No need.

165
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,410
I killed them all.

166
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,180
You’re highly skilled.

167
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,890
Of course you aren’t afraid of them.

We’re old friends.

171
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,810
What are you doing here?

172
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,050
My guards said

173
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,020
you hid weapons in this yard.

174
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,430
I came here to have a check.

00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,030
Check?

176
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,490
What? Is there a problem?

177
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,970
When we came here,

178
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,160
we were already checked.

179
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,670
Can’t we

180
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,220
check you again?

181
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,280
I’m not sure if the previous check

182
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,290
is thorough enough.

183
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,010
So I’m doing it myself.

184
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:35,810
Search!

185
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,020
Wait!

186
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,950
That’s loud.

187
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,390
Did you raise your voice to me?

188
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:44,870
You really think

189
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,550
you’re still that hoity-toity Yan Xun?

190
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,730
Let me make it clear.

191
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,760
His Majesty spared you.

192
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,280
But I won’t tolerate violators
of the rules.

193
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,020
Your Excellency.

194
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,460
Let them search.

195
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,450
We are on the chopping block.

196
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:06,960
We can’t battle them.

197
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,810
Your maid

198
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,330
seems like a clever girl.

199
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,620
Your Excellency, be smart

200
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,170
and suffer less.

201
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:20,630
Search!

202
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:31,750
That way!

203
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,330
Aye.

204
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:33,840
This way!

205
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,660
Aye.

206
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,700
Move!

207
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,190
What happened to this maid?

208
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,240
You’ll know

209
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,130
if you’re

210
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,290
disfigured.

211
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,790
Young Master, nothing suspicious.

212
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,700
If not,

213
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,830
please show yourselves out.

214
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,790
Wait, we haven’t checked the wound yet.

215
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:50,890
Young Master Wei,

216
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,150
isn’t that necessary?

217
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:56,320
That is up to me.

218
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,440
His Excellency’s maid

219
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,850
isn’t for anyone to see.

220
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,540
His Excellency?

221
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,290
Marquis Dingbei

222
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,380
has been beheaded.

223
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,440
What kind of Excellency is he?

224
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,430
Wei Shuyou,

225
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,970
you’ve way over the line!

226
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,700
So what?

227
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,470
You are down and out.

228
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,220
What can you do to me?

229
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,610
Well, let’s take good care of

230
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,480
His Excellency’s maid.

231
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,400
Let your maid

232
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,390
take off the bandage on her face.

233
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,150
Hurry up!

234
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:51,610
Haven’t you heard
Young Master Yuwen’s order?

235
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,060
Stop!

236
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,220
Princess.

237
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:04,720
Wei Shuyou.

238
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,690
You’re putting on airs.

239
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,090
Am I at the Oriole Courtyard?

240
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,300
Or did I come to the wrong place

241
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,380
and end up in your family’s backyard?

242
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,460
Princess.

243
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,120
Young Master Wei is acting by the book.

244
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,700
By the book?

245
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,600
What book?

246
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,340
And whose book?

247
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,540
My father sent you here

248
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,670
to protect Yan Xun

249
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,400
and guard

250
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,240
the Oriole Courtyard.

251
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,350
Meaning you two

252
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,110
are the servants

253
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,750
and Yan Xun

254
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,440
is the master here.

255
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,140
Servants are searching master’s place?

256
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,270
Who do you think you are?

257
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,340
Listen carefully,

258
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,260
from now on, the master here

259
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,800
is Yan Xun.

260
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,590
Whoever you work for,

261
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,380
and whatever you’re up to,

262
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:00,960
put them all behind

263
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,170
as long as you’re here.

264
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,660
If I find out

265
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,090
you say one thing

266
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,270
and do another,

267
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,190
or even

268
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,900
play tricks,

269
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,430
I am telling you

270
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,780
your masters can’t

271
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,070
protect you.

272
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,400
Get out if you’re clear.

273
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,410
Aye.

274
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,680
Yan Xun, are you all right?

275
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,340
I’m fine. Thank you, Your Highness.

276
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,020
Let’s go inside.

277
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,450
Your Highness should be received properly,

278
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,740
but this place

279
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,620
is a mess.

280
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,330
Go away!

281
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,100
- I am not here for you.
- Your Highness.

282
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,130
Go away!

283
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,600
This place

284
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,960
is too filthy for you to stay.

285
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,130
Are you deaf?

286
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,130
I said, go away.

287
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,520
With all due respect, His Excellency Yan’s family

288
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,060
has been executed.

289
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,940
Please don’t be on his side.

290
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,500
Not on his side?

291
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:05,970
Then you want me to

292
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,260
side with you?

293
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,620
Don’t think I don’t know

294
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,130
your little tricks.

295
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:12,720
Your gloating look

296
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,260
disgusts me.

297
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,560
Yan Xun might be

298
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,460
my father’s least favorite for now,

299
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,630
but he is still much better than you.

300
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,340
Save your flattery.

301
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,540
You are annoying!

302
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,050
Caiwei.

303
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,520
Aye.

304
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,450
Show those

305
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,530
unwelcomed guests out.

306
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:33,050
Young Master Yuwen, please.

307
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,530
Miss Achu,

308
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,370
sorry about that.

309
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,120
Right now, this place

310
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,370
is being watched day and night.

311
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,740
Wei Shuyou and Yuwen Huai

312
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,300
will take every chance to harm His Excellency.

313
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,200
If they know you are alive,

314
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,620
you’ll be in danger

315
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,530
and His Excellency will have a weak spot.

316
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,010
We must stay alert at all times.

317
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,070
Yan Xun.

318
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,090
Will you remain silent

319
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,380
if I

320
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,720
don’t talk to you?

321
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,930
What do you want me to say?

322
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,030
Anything you like.

323
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:01,000
Tell stories or jokes

324
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,300
or things

325
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,440
about our childhood.

326
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:05,920
Anything fun

327
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,820
will do.

328
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,760
My parents are dead.

329
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,960
So are my sister and brothers.

330
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,210
Our entire clan is eradicated.

331
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,020
I cannot bury their bodies,

332
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,180
or mourn their deaths.

333
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,090
I cannot even show

334
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,440
too much sorrow.

335
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,890
And meanwhile,

336
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,310
I have to

337
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,730
entertain Your Highness

338
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,330
and tell you stories?

339
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,180
I am sorry, Yan Xun.

340
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,050
I didn’t mean that.

341
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,260
I just want to

342
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,590
cheer you up.

343
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,180
Chun.

344
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,510
We cannot go back to the past.

345
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,490
That Yan Xun is dead.

346
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,730
The man in front of you now

347
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,920
may die any minute.

348
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,130
We grew up together.

349
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,650
I always regard you as my little sister.

350
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:23,830
So now,

351
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,790
when I still have my conscience,

352
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,540
when I still care about

353
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,950
what we had,

354
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,680
stay away from me

355
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,730
as far as possible.

356
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,540
Do not ruin yourself.

357
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,700
I was choked.

358
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,690
Yan Xun,

359
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,560
what are you talking about?

360
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,250
I don’t understand.

361
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,440
Yes, you do.

362
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,350
I am sorry, Yan Xun.

363
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,100
I know my father

364
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,760
killed your whole family.

365
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,500
Although they all said

366
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,660
your father was a traitor,

367
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,990
but I know my father

368
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,650
is to blame.

369
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,410
Every time I see you,

370
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,870
you break my heart.

371
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,370
And now I feel like

372
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,460
I don’t know you anymore.

373
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,240
I am really sorry.

374
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,140
I feel guilty.

375
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,350
But…

376
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,680
But, think about it.

377
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,650
You’ve lost your family,

378
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,190
your father.

379
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,040
All you have left is me.

380
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,400
I will protect you.

381
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,370
I will never ever

382
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,150
leave you alone.

383
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,570
I won’t let bad guys like Yuwen Huai

384
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:10,570
hurt you.

385
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,860
Alight?

386
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,980
Enough of that.

387
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:17,850
Caiwei.

388
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,630
Bring me the desserts

389
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,460
I prepared for Yan Xun.

390
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:22,510
Aye.

391
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:24,830
Yan Xun,

392
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,260
I brought you

393
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,550
your favorite desserts.

394
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,950
See?

395
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,170
Look. These are

396
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,920
five-nut pies.

397
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,470
This one, this is a wisteria cake.

398
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,950
And your favorite candied fruits.

399
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,070
Have a look.

400
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,950
Which one do you want to eat first?

401
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,950
How about the wisteria cake?

402
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,610
Have a taste.

403
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,540
Open your mouth.

404
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,830
Take a bite.

405
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,100
Come on.

406
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,250
Do you like it? Is it good?

407
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,610
Have some more.

408
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,140
What about another one?

409
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,740
You’ve tasted this.

410
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,320
So how about candied fruit?

411
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,900
Just have a bit more.

412
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,150
Princess brought you these?

413
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,650
Throw them away.

414
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,500
Why?

415
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,490
She wouldn’t

416
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,380
poison you.

417
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:49,810
Yan Xun?

418
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,800
Yan Xun, are you alright?

419
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,610
What’s wrong, Yan Xun?

420
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,780
Yan Xun!

421
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,440
Yan Xun!

422
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,230
Your Excellency!

423
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,500
What’s wrong with him?

424
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,030
Princess poisoned him?

425
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,080
How could she?

426
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,340
She is not smart enough.

427
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,070
Someone must’ve

428
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,080
poisoned her food.

429
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,790
The poison is from three-legged turtles.

430
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,700
It will attack

431
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,800
the digestive system.

432
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,470
Is there a cure?

433
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,400
We have to battle poison with poison.

434
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,520
We need a certain medicine,

435
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,380
Chansu.

436
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,200
It’s made of the liquid

437
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,230
on toads’ skin.

438
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,830
But it is rarely found

439
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,940
in common pharmacies.

440
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,040
Use the needle

441
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,870
to suppress the poison first.

442
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:44,760
I’ll go get it.

443
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,450
Your Excellency.

444
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,580
= Oriole Courtyard =

445
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:55,900
= Tongde Pharmacy =

446
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,940
Sorry to interrupt, sir.

447
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,240
Do you have Chansu?

448
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,560
No.

449
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:38,030
Excuse me, do you have Chansu?

450
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,220
Chansu?

451
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,390
That is the most valuable treasure
in our shop.

452
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,140
It’s quite expensive.

453
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,940
Do you have enough money?

454
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:48,330
Yes.

455
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,330
How much do you have? I’ll take all of it.

456
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,300
All of it?

457
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,320
Listen to yourself!

458
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:01,030
Ten taels of gold for five grams.

459
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,780
Can you afford it?

460
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,530
Ten taels of gold for five grams.

461
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,460
Sir, it is a lifesaver.

462
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,280
Isn’t the price too high?

463
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,090
High?

464
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,760
Do you know we need a hundred toads

465
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,810
to make five grams of Chansu?

466
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,960
And it brings the patient back to life.

467
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,870
Only our shop

468
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,130
has it.

469
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,820
Its rarity makes it pricy.

470
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,950
I can tell you work for

471
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:30,800
a wealthy family.

472
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,700
Go tell your master

473
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,790
to exchange money for life.

474
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,660
Don’t be stingy.

475
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,590
If he’s dead,

476
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,450
all that money

477
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,820
will be useless.

478
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,280
What about you?

479
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,410
You want money or life?

480
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,700
Life.

481
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,660
Is this enough?

482
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,560
Yes, yes, yes!

483
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,450
Give me

484
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:50,960
all your stock.

485
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,820
Cut the crap!

486
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,910
Yes!

487
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,500
Who are you to break in?

488
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,890
It’s you.

489
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:12,770
You cheeky troublemaker!

490
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,960
Why did you sneak out

491
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,660
in the middle of the night?

492
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,520
You dummy up?

493
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,650
We’ll see.

494
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:21,430
Beat her!

495
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,540
Talk now!

496
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,140
Speak!

497
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:44,840
Now!

498
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,550
Yan Xun!

499
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,110
You’re awake!

500
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,490
Achu.

501
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:04,710
What happened to you?

502
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,330
Nothing.

503
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,640
Lie down, don’t move.

504
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,040
What happened?

505
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,140
I went out to buy medicine
for you earlier.

506
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,330
The guards caught me

507
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,400
and beat me. It’s nothing.

508
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,180
They beat you?

509
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,640
And you just let them?

510
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:32,780
Right now,

511
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,780
I’m your maid.

512
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,100
Wei Shuyou just came after us.

513
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,480
We can’t stir up more trouble.

514
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,520
Don’t worry about me.

515
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,020
After you recover,

516
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,770
we’ll teach them a lesson.

517
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,590
We can go back

518
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,620
and beat them up later.

519
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:02,850
I’m fine.

520
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:08,760
Here.

521
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:19,860

= Oriole Courtyard =

555
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,780
Food today tastes good.

556
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,940
It’ll soon get cooler.

557
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,090
Food

558
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,540
will stay fresh longer.

559
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,050
There are ropes in the kitchen.

560
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,320
I will make a basket later.

561
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,200
Once the dishes are checked,

562
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,050
I’ll use the basket

563
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,320
to store them in the well

564
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,720
where the temperature is lower.

565
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,990
Food can stay fresh for at least two days.

566
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:15,680
Sounds good.

567
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,940
This must stop.

568
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:23,000
We can’t be in defense forever.

569
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,680
Our energy is limited.

570
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,950
Besides, more than one group of people

571
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,530
are trying to kill me.

572
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,240
If this continues,

573
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,470
we’ll die sooner or later.

574
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:37,140
What do you want, Your Excellency?

575
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,790
The point is what does His Majesty want?

576
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,070
He certainly wants me dead.

577
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,490
But he has found out

578
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,020
that if I die,

579
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,330
he’ll be caught in the dilemma

580
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:49,340
where all sides

581
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,460
will be targeting at Yanbei.

582
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,190
That vast land

583
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,830
will be split up among them.

584
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:58,690
That’s why he keeps me alive
for the time being.

585
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,280
So,

586
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:03,710
if His Majesty knows that

587
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,080
they all want to kill you,

588
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,560
what will he do?

589
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,160
He will

590
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,900
rack his brain to protect His Excellency

591
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,710
as hard as he tried to kill him.

592
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,690
Let’s find a way to deliver the message.

593
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:23,860
Here’s your liquor.

594
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:43,480
Hey, are you still depressed

595
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,930
about Princess’s reproach?

596
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,980
I dare not judge Her Highness.

597
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,830
Her temper

598
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:55,000
is always like that.

599
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:58,670
Young Master.

600
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,410
Shuye, you practiced archery again.

601
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:03,820
I just realize

602
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,350
“a slow sparrow
should make an early start”

603
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,580
is a false statement.

604
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,980
No matter how hard I practice,

605
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,540
I’m no match for you.

606
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,070
Shuyou,

607
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,630
why are you taking drugs again?

608
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,490
I’ve warned you repeatedly.

609
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:29,030
Don’t touch it again.

610
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,550
If you keep using it,

611
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,020
it’ll weaken you

612
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,180
and thus ruin your future.

613
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,450
Not to mention

614
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:36,510
if Uncle finds out...

615
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,970
Your uncle is my father.

616
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,270
I am his only heir.

617
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,310
Unlike you,

618
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,780
I don’t need to bust my chops

619
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,310
to prove myself in front of him.

620
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:48,900
You...

621
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:52,010
Shuye, mind your own business.

622
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:55,350
Go read and practice more.

623
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,330
Here.

624
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,340
Shuyou,

625
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:16,140
do you know why His Majesty

626
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,860
prohibits noble families
from contacting Yan Xun?

627
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,570
My father said

628
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,400
it’s about balance or stuff...

629
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,620
Stop people from gossiping.

630
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:37,140
But His Majesty has his own difficulties.

631
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,220
Difficulties?

632
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,780
Yes.

633
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,940
He can’t give direct orders

634
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,840
to kill Yan Xun.

635
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,560
We should

636
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,810
exclude difficulties for him.

637
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,780
As long as we get rid of Yan Xun

638
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,270
once and for all,

639
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,770
His Majesty will surely be pleased.

640
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,260
You have a point.

641
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,340
Shuyou,

642
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,530
you are the heir

643
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,670
because of your mother’s noble origin.

644
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,140
But I’m...

645
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,530
a concubine’s son.

646
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,530
Your people, money

647
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,780
and other resources

648
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,440
are way more

649
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,130
than Wei Shuye’s.

650
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,510
But are you one of

651
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,470
the Five Aces of Chang’an?

652
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,420
Who are you?

653
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,450
Nobody knows you.

654
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:39,510
Young Master Huai, I’m needed elsewhere.

655
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:40,740
Please excuse me.

656
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:44,130
Young Master Wei.

657
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,440
Young Master,
taking the life with a borrowed knife

658
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,160
is brilliant!

659
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,010
It seems that His Majesty
has made up his mind

660
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,800
to keep Yan Xun,

661
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:12,830
and use him to control Yanbei.

662
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,640
And I

663
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,350
have planted Wei Shuyou

664
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,170
in the Oriole Courtyard,

665
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,340
where he has chances to finish Yan Xun.

666
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,960
Even if he fails,

667
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,140
his family will be to blame.

668
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,530
Brilliant!

669
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,410
Tail Wei Shuyou

670
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:34,750
and give him a hand

671
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,100
if necessary.

672
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:37,690
Aye.

673
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:56,300
Let’s go.

674
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:13,930
Young Master,

675
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:15,380
news came from Hongshan House.

676
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,180
Zhu Siliu and his men

677
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,310
are heading to the Oriole Courtyard.

678
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:19,220
Let’s go.

will someone come tonight?

682

I want them to come

683

so that

684
