Your people provoked us at the Pass

17
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,790
and led me here.

18
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,870
This place is steep.

19
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,600
It seems that someone led us

20
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,650
here on purpose

21
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,420
to take your life.

22
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,420
Was it Cheng Yuan?

23
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,670
Did Yan Xun turn a blind eye to it?

24
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,890
Hatred in Yan Xun’s heart

25
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,890
is harder to melt

26
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,430
than the ice on this lake.

27
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,310
Yuwen Yue.

28
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,890
At first,

29
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,390
I simply wanted to get out

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,280
and live my own life.

31
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,490
Later, I met Yan Xun

32
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,180
and heard from him about Yanbei.

33
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,490
I felt my heart

34
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,900
starting to beat again.

35
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,550
I realized

36
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,090
I was born for a reason.

37
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,670
Maybe

38
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,650
that was my fate.

39
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,010
Unfortunately,

40
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,660
my dream was shattered

41
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,240
because I overestimated myself.

42
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,890
I thought I was capable enough

43
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,030
to make a difference

44
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,670
and protect others.

45
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,010
Eventually,

46
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,250
I realized

47
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,660
there wasn’t much I could do

48
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,810
on my own.

49
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,390
My friends and relatives

50
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,640
left me one by one.

51
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,440
I failed to protect them,

52
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,410
and many others…

53
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,200
Died because of me.

54
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,080
I’m not a good leader.

55
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,750
Xiuli Army didn’t have any belief

56
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,840
but they believed in me.

57
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,280
But I was the one

58
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,700
who put them into wars and danger

59
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,250
over and over,

60
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,740
causing them to shed blood and die.

61
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,880
The peaceful life

62
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,070
I promised them

63
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,640
never comes true.

64
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,290
I saved their lives once.

65
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,480
I should not be so selfish

66
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,010
to let them fight for me.

67
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,760
If...

68
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,810
I mean if...

69
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,800
If I had obeyed Yan Xun’s order

70
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,780
and expelled Xiuli Army from Yanbei,

71
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,160
then many of them

72
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,680
would not have died.

73
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,020
They would have still been alive.

74
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,940
Do you regret it?

75
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,840
I’ve been through a lot.

76
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,040
There’s never an easy path.

77
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,230
I have done so much

78
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,860
and come this far.

79
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,750
I’ve made mistakes, too.

80
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,610
But

81
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,870
I have never had regrets

82
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,680
because I always follow my heart.

83
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,100
I just...

84
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,460
I just feel tired.

85
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,390
If you are tired,

86
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,650
then stop

87
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,890
and take a break.

88
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,990
That way, you’ll be able

89
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,840
to move forward.

90
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,380
Roma wasn’t built

91
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,720
in a day.

92
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,790
Even without Cheng Yuan,

93
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,240
there’d be someone else.

94
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,290
What do you picture

95
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,510
Yanbei is like?

96
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,420
That everyone is loyal and brave?

97
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,820
That everyone is looking forward

98
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,490
to your return?

99
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,710
Where there are people,

100
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,900
there are disputes.

101
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,650
The one who can achieve big

102
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,910
has to go through plots and conspiracies,

103
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,810
life and death.

104
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,020
Since you have chosen this path,

105
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,030
you must finish it

106
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,340
at all costs.

107
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,200
Why are you telling me this?

108
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,530
Didn’t you try to stop me

109
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:57,320
from going back to Yanbei?

110
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,160
Instead of keeping you with me,

111
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,050
I hope

112
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,810
you can live

113
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:10,390
as your own will

114
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,110
and live happily.

other than you.

118

I’m in so much debt to you

119
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,450
that I can never pay you back.

120

If you want to cry,

121
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,180
just let it out.

Achu.

152
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,520
Are you still mad at me

153
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,560
for not stepping out

154
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,000
to help you protect Xiuli Army?

155
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,370
You should know

156
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,970
His Highness had already
made his mind to kill them.

157
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,810
I wouldn’t be able to change his mind

158
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,630
but would only get people
I want to protect

159
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,460
into trouble.

160
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,270
So I had to stay out of it.

161
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,830
Now, I’m leaving for Lancheng.

162
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,670
Then I will escort Mr. Wu to leave Yanbei.

163
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,140
Mr. Wu?

164
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,940
Is that Mr. Wu

165
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,160
Wu Daoya?

166
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,390
Yes.

167
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,520
Cheng Yuan’s men went to Lancheng
to collect grains.

168
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,340
That city was hit by the flood.

169
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,710
Mr. Wu and

170
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:08,220
the locals

171
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,410
stood up to him

172
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,670
and he got imprisoned by His Highness.

173
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,680
Mr. Wu is the soul of Yanbei.

174
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,940
If he died,

175
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,470
all the others who were always loyal

176
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,040
would be bitterly disappointed

177
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,790
in His Highness.

178
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,790
So, I couldn’t help you.

179
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,420
Achu.

180
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,650
I am sorry.

181
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,600
You had your own reasons.

182
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,030
I understand that.

183
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,840
His Highness was an

184
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,080
innocent man.

185
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,000
But what happened on the Jiuyou Platform

186
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,010
has changed him

187
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,270
tremendously.

188
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,760
Things would never go

189
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,400
as we wished.

190
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,550
My concern is

191
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,350
if this continues,

192
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,980
we’ll be even further

193
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,020
from our original aspiration.

194
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,590
People change.

195
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,630
Achu, you know what?

196
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,850
I realize

197
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:20,970
the soldiers I see

198
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,150
patrolling in the streets

199
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,890
are not those

200
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:27,700
I know anymore.

201
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,410
It occurred to me

202
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,750
that those I knew

203
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,500
had either died in battles,

204
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,910
or left Yanbei.

205
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,680
Maybe

206
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,190
it’s time for me

207
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,080
to leave as well.

208
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,710
I understand how you feel.

209
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,860
I was in the same position as you were.

210
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,090
I witnessed

211
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,730
his hatred and pain.

212
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,280
I witnessed

213
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,140
his suffering.

214
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,040
We, as bystanders, could never

215
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,720
understand those feelings.

216
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,290
Everyone has the right

217
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,960
to choose how to live their lives.

218
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,390
It’s his choice.

219
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,030
I disagree with it,

220
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,030
but

221
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,590
I respect it.

222
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,110
Our decisions are not

223
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,240
always right,

224
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,350
but they aren’t always wrong either.

225
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,060
But there are principles

226
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,830
that we need to follow.

227
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,470
We can’t be partners,

228
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,440
but

229
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,790
we won’t be enemies either.

230
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,110
In this

231
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,530
chaotic time,

232
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,200
except for freedom

233
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,380
and love,

234
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,230
I’ll only risk my life

235
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,210
to keep

236
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,370
my faith.

237
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,310
And that

238
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,930
has already become

239
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:05,810
part of the plateau of Yanbei.

240
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,920
Zhong Yu.

241
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,170
Maybe we should go together.

242
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,900
I know you won’t.

243
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:30,360
Achu. His Highness can

244
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,870
rule the world

245
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,480
and conquer

246
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,000
every piece of land.

247
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,620
As long as he wants,

248
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,120
he can do whatever it takes

249
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,300
to destroy everything

250
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,000
that stands in his way.

251
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,890
But you’re different.

252
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,470
He can’t do anything about you.

253
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,400
Achu.

254
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,890
Don’t give up on him.

255
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,080
Only you can save him now.

256
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,330
Think about those days.

257
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,660
Think about how he struggled

258
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,110
to come this far.

259
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,310
Think about his suffering.

260
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,760
Don’t let hatred

261
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,850
blind him.

262
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,460
Don’t let bastards

263
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,470
like Cheng Yuan

264
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,250
succeed.

265
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,120
Before you leave,

266
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,950
could you do me a favor?

267
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,890
I’d like to meet with Mr. Wu.

268
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,600
Mr. Wu.

269
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:45,140
Chu Qiao. We’ve finally met.

270
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,380
It is quite difficult

271
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,160
to find you.

272
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,790
As the most trusted counselor

273
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,830
to Marquis Dingbei,

274
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,100
when he was killed,

275
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,640
you weren’t around.

276
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,090
When Yanbei was slaughtered,

277
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,050
you weren’t around, either.

278
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,170
When Ms. Bai Sheng killed herself

279
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,360
on the Jiuyou Platform,

280
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,050
when Yan Xun was nearly killed

281
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,870
during those three years in Chang’an,

282
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,830
and when he set Chang’an on fire,

283
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,320
when the war was on,

284
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,610
when Hongchuan was in danger,

285
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,750
you were never around.

286
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,070
I almost doubted

287
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,400
if you were still loyal to Yanbei

288
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,870
and whether I should

289
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:26,930
still meet with you.

290
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,390
This meeting

291
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,420
has nothing to do with Yanbei.

292
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,660
I think you knew that already.

293
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,160
I heard you lost your memory.

294
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,600
How are you now?

295
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,740
My memory hasn’t fully recovered.

296
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,030
I can vaguely remember some of it.

297
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,400
I happen to remember them quite well.

298
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,980
Since we have time today,
why don’t we catch up?

299
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,290
I only remember

300
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,030
bits and pieces

301
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,080
about my childhood.

302
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,370
Speed is the key to victory.

303
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,900
If you are fast enough,

304
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,690
you don’t need complicated skills.

305
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,260
One strike is enough to defeat your enemy.

306
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,310
- I can only remember
- Mother.

307
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,430
my mother wasn’t always around.

308
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,900
She was often away for months.

309
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,240
I could only practice martial art myself.

310
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,810
I didn’t know what she left to do.

311
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,350
She never told me, either.

312
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,060
One day, before she left,

313
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,870
she told me she wasn’t sure
when she’d be back.

314
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,740
Then she took me

315
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,910
to a secret place

316
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,350
and taught me the Ice Trick.

317
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,950
Then she told me to go to a family

318
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,360
of Jing.

319
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,510
I went there

320
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,940
and was renamed Jing Xiaoliu.

321
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,240
The Jings treated me as their own child.

322
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,770
I got along well with my siblings.

323
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,570
My skills also improved

324
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,820
with time.

325
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,100
But I couldn’t

326
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,540
forget about my mother.

327
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,000
She didn’t come back.

328
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,440
Only the bad news came.

329
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,270
I had to rescue her

330
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,700
because she was the only family I had

331
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,830
in this world.

332
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,510
I broke into the prison.

333
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,010
Mother.

334
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,160
I ran to my mother.

335
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,520
When I held her,

336
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,620
I saw a strange face

337
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,660
smirking at me.

338
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,140
That stranger and I

339
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,070
looked alike.

340
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,990
Mother is gone.

341
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,390
I rushed out

342
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,840
and attacked

343
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,920
by a huge crowd.

344
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,890
At that critical moment,

345
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,100
the woman who pretended to be my mother

346
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,200
came out of nowhere.

347
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,360
She pretended to be me and fought with

348
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,270
those in black

349
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,030
to buy me time to escape.

350
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,740
On my way out,

351
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,910
I heard someone in black

352
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,190
branded me as the one
who killed my mother.

353
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:02,870
If I say

354
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,480
you killed your mother, Luo He…

355
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,970
I never know why

356
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,630
that woman saved me.

357
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,170
It has haunted me

358
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,130
all these years.

359
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,840
The woman pretending to be you

360
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,320
is the killer from the Death Camp,
Xia Chong.

361
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,490
My memory is incomplete.

362
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,920
Who am I?

363
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,800
Your mother, Luo He,

364
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,580
was the owner of the Storm Token

365
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,050
and the leader of Underworld Spies.

366
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,830
You are her daughter, Chu Qiao.

367
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,660
Who killed my mother?

368
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,550
Yuwen Hao from Wei.

369
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,040
Yinxin from the Secret Service of Liang.

370
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,160
The real killer

371
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,490
is a traitor who was close to Luo He.

372
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,520
Why did they

373
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,120
kill my mother?

374
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,540
To protect the good

375
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,290
and get rid of the evil.

376
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,640
Your mother tried to free
slaves and end wars.

377
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,280
In the eyes of those rich lords,

378
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,960
she was evil.

379
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,000
She had been their enemy

380
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,700
for years.

381
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,220
The owner of the Storm Token

382
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,800
could command Underworld Spies.

383
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,570
She posed a threat to them.

384
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,090
What is the Storm Token?

385
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,060
Your mother had already

386
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,120
given it to you

387
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,300
without telling you.

388
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:26,220
Once you mastered the Ice Trick,

389
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,080
an equinox flower would appear on your shoulder.

390
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,110
That is the Storm Token.

391
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,370
Your mother wrote to me in secret

392
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,000
that she had transferred
most of her energy

393
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,860
to you.

394
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,490
Therefore,

395
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,260
you are the new owner of the Storm Token.

396
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,690
I don’t have any flower

397
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,980
on my shoulder.

398
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,940
Nor do I practice the Ice Trick, either.

399
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,480
I am not some almighty

400
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,490
Storm Token holder.

401
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:56,330
Maybe your loss of memory

402
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,880
has blocked your energy.

403
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,990
Maybe only the extremely cold weather

404
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,440
could stimulate you

405
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,950
to perform that skill.

406
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,270
Zuo Baocang helped me recover

407
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,790
some of my memory by hypnosis.

408
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,630
Unfortunately, it was interrupted.

409
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,930
What else do you know

410
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:17,540
about my background,

411
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,860
Mr. Wu?

412
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,590
I know what happened

413
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,780
after you got out of the prison.

414
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,600
I sent Zhongyi,

415
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,340
the Snake Maid and the Untraceable

416
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,870
to rescue Luo He.

417
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,860
But they arrived too late.

418
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,690
The Snake Maid fought her way out

419
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,990
and saved you.

420
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,800
At that time, you were badly wounded.

421
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,910
They escorted you to escape.

422
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,040
However,

423
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,430
Yuwen Hao and his men were after you.

424
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,060
Yuwen Hao was a valiant general.

425
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,210
His family, the Yuwen Household,

426
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,670
had full control over the Eye of Intel,

427
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,940
Underworld Spies’ mortal enemy

428
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,100
for generations.

429
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,000
He was cruel

430
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,340
and wanted to catch you alive.

431
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,000
The Snake Maid was extremely loyal

432
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,790
because your mother, Luo He,

433
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,850
saved her life.

434
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:53,980
She sacrificed her life

435
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,350
in order to save you.

436
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,160
She fought with Yuwen Hao

437
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,580
with her last breath

438
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,030
and almost died.

439
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,740
Go!

440
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,410
In the end, the Untraceable

441
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:30,640
stalled Yuwen Hao with his life.

442
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,730
The Snake Maid and you managed to escape.

443
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,290
Unfortunately, the spy from Liang,

444
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,440
Yinxin, ambushed you.

445
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,670
The Snake Maid fainted.

446
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,660
You knocked Yinxin out in rage

447
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,610
and fought with Yuwen Hao.

448
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,860
In the end, you killed him

449
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,120
with the Ice Trick

450
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,340
but fell into the Yellow River.

451
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,290
The Snake Maid managed

452
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,430
to find me.

453
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,660
When we learnt
that you fell into the river,

454
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,100
we sent people searching for you

455
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,310
along the bank for ten days

456
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,070
but to no avail.

457
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,520
Turns out

458
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,750
you were taken by traffickers.

459
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,190
Since then, your fate has changed.

460
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,280
Who would know

461
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,230
you would end up being a slave
in the Yuwen Household

462
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,390
serving Yuwen Yue,

463
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,150
your archenemy?

464
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,300
Who would know

465
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,840
after all these years,

466
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,920
you killed three generations

467
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,190
of the third branch of the Yuwen Household

468
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,510
to take your revenge?

469
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,640
Then you followed Yan Xun

470
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,960
back to Yanbei

471
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,960
where your mother

472
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,000
guarded with her life.

473
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,550
Maybe it was

474
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,700
all predestined.

475
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,420
Now, the truth is out.

476
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,510
I know

477
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,390
you, Yuwen Yue and Yan Xun

478
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,550
have a complicated relationship.

479
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,020
You need to choose

480
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,330
between them.

481
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,660
I want you to help Yanbei

482
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,110
to restore peace.

483
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,220
Will you?

484
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,930
I no longer

485
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,060
belong here.

486
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:28,640
You should come with me.

487
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,500
As Luo He’s daughter,

488
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,430
you should continue
her unfinished mission.

489
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,740
I am sorry, but I don’t remember

490
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,130
much about what happened in the past.

491
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,900
Thank you for your honesty.

492
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,750
I can’t leave with you.

493
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,280
I cannot

494
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,270
allow Yan Xun

495
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,350
to drown in hatred.

496
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,990
I will do my best

497
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,770
to help him ashore.

498
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:34,860
Princess.

499
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:36,520
I have been looking for you for two months

500
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,730
and finally found you.

501
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,030
Princess.

502
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,960
How did you find me?

503
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,770
My instinct told me

504
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,590
that Your Highness would take
this direction,

505
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,350
so I searched for you along the way.

506
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,550
Meilin Pass is five kilometers away.

507
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,980
That’s where Yuwen Yue is.

508
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,180
Even you have noticed that.

509
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,630
I have been with you for years.

510
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,060
I can read

511
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,270
Your Highness’s mind a little bit.

512
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,210
In the past few months,

513
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,070
I allowed myself to drift

514
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,270
and wander

515
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,100
because

516
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,890
I found out Yue is actually Yuwen Yue.

517
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:00,690
I kept writing letters

518
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,760
to my archenemy

519
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,510
who I had treated as a close friend.

520
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,900
Heaven played

521
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,040
such a cruel joke on me.

522
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,370
I know I can’t let him live.

523
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,440
But I don’t have the heart

524
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,310
to kill him.

525
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,460
What should I do?

526
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,000
I really don’t know.

527
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,340
Princess.

528
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,910
I understand your feeling, Princess.

529
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,040
I’ve kept this to myself for long.

530
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,840
Do you want to hear it?

531
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,630
Say it.

532
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,330
In my eyes,

533
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,660
noble as you are as a princess,

534
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,200
you’re never

535
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,420
a delicate little girl.

536
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,600
You’re ambitious,

537
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,710
thorough

538
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,420
and decisive.

539
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,710
You’re as good

540
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,370
as any man if not better.

541
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,060
Princess,

542
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,970
how could you

543
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:21,800
stop by

544
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,770
that Yuwen Yue?

545
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,680
I know what you mean.

546
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,090
It’s easier said

547
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,100
than done.

548
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,150
Princess.

549
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,650
Chaos is rising.

550
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,490
Chang’an was besieged.

551
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,330
Hongchuan was almost lost.

552
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,130
Rebels are taking this chance

553
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:53,980
to stir up trouble everywhere.

554
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:56,340
All that

555
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,660
concerns the future of Liang.

556
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,010
Princess, you are

557
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,030
the future ruler of Liang.

558
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,640
You cannot

559
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,920
give up your state for anything.

560
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,190
Whether it’s Liang or Wei,

561
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,970
at this stage,

562
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,460
I simply

563
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,190
want to stay away from the mess.

564
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,700
Why can’t I?

565
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,310
I know

566
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:29,660
how painful you are.

567
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:36,200
You’re caught
between the love of your life

568
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,310
and the state that raised you.

569
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,210
Does Yuwen Yue know any of this?

570
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:47,850
Think about it.

571
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,910
If you two switched places,

572
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,830
and put him

573
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,520
in this dilemma,

574
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,410
what choice would he make?

575
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,180
Would he betray his state

576
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,350
for you?

577
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,540
To Your Highness.

578
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,190
How is everything?

579
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:18,640
Thank you for saving Yuan Chun’s life.

580
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,500
Prince Yu really appreciates it

581
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,530
after knowing it.

582
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:24,800
The border is in peace now.

583
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,380
Yan Xun is still holding a grudge

584
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,800
and coveting our land,

585
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,550
but our troops at Meilin are well-trained.

586
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,090
They are solid in defense,

587
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:36,440
enough to battle Yanbei’s cavalrymen

588
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,640
before making peace with them.

589
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,430
So you can be at ease, Your Highness.

590
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,950
Sincerely, Yuwen Yue.

591
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,370
Guards.

592
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,210
Yes, Young Master.

593
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,470
Send this letter

594
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,440
directly to Prince Xiang.

595
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,150
Aye.

596
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:58,150
Waiter, where’s our food?

597
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,020
Coming right up!

598
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,270
Fill the cup.

599
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,160
Let’s drink.

600
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,460
Please enjoy.

601
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,830
Here comes your dish.

602
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:16,700
Please enjoy.

603
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,720
Here comes your dish.

604
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:19,990
Let’s eat.

605
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:21,330
Enjoy your dish.

606
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,030
Put it here.

607
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:22,870
All is here.

608
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:27,290
Please enjoy.

609
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,400
Coming.

610
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:37,970
Come in.

611
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:45,850
Princess.

612
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:50,120
The messenger has been silenced.

613
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,380
= To Your Highness =

614
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,810
Peace negotiation is only an excuse.

615
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,030
Hate can’t be erased easily.

616
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,080
It won’t be

617
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,620
that easy to make peace.

618
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,360
This matter is of great significance.

619
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,130
Yuan Che may not believe it

620
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:32,550
with just a letter.

621
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,540
The more pressing the situation is,

622
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,810
the less the time for him to think.

623
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,860
And I’ve had eyes

624
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,800
on the Death Camp for so long.

625
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,320
It’s easy to tap into

626
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,510
their communication channel.

627
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,840
Not to mention I am familiar with

628
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,100
every word, every move

629
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,170
and every plan

630
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,000
of Yuwen Yue’s.

631
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,470
They won’t be able to tell

632
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,430
the difference between us.

633
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:48,700
The rest is up to you.

634
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,290
Aye.

635
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,860
In the turbulent days,
shelter is hard to be found.

636
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,040
I want to be a rock

637
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,080
however the river flows.

638
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,280
I’ll always stand still,

639
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,030
wherever leaves fall.

640
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,500
Who are you?

641
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:28,530
In such chaos,

642
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,710
I no longer remember who I am.

643
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:34,280
You, Young Master Yue,

644
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,840
are the only one to wake me up.

645
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,140
So I invited you over.

646
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,510
You read my letter.

647
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,680
Are you…?

648
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,200
Yes.

649
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,990
Yue, it’s me Xiaoyu.

650
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:08,930
I never expected

651
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:11,520
that the one writing to me

652
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,820
was you,

653
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,780
my archenemy.

654
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:21,900
Spies of Liang and the Eye of Intel

655
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,610
are born enemies

656
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,590
as if they were meant to

657
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:29,220
fight against each other.

658
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,550
I never asked to take charge of the spies.

659
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,620
You and I are the chosen ones.

660
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:39,500
Nothing outweighs national interests.

661
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,540
I’m glad

662
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,200
to have been given

663
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,610
the wooden bird.

664
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,110
Many things

665
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,310
I couldn’t tell others

666
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:54,110
could be shared with you.

667
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,660
I found another me,

668
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,240
the real me.

669
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,970
Likewise.

670
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,630
I could share my feelings

671
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:08,870
and suffering

672
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,750
with Xiaoyu.

673
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,190
Because I am

674
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:15,860
your most loyal friend
who can keep your secrets.

675
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:17,570
You are.

676
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:21,140
What a pity…

677
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,800
What a pity…

678
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:31,990
I will ruin the wooden bird

679
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,620
and bury Xiaoyu in my memory.
