Yan Xun.

18
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,900
You cannot die.

19
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,740
Even if you are humbled to the dust,

20
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,460
you must stand up.

21
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,120
Only if you survive,

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,150

can your wish be fulfilled.

On if you survive,

26
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,500
can you take back what belongs to you.

27
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,190
This world is never fair.

28
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,280
In this world,

29
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,940
you can’t rely on others.

30
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,230
All you have

31
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,100
is yourself.

32
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,380
I cannot die.

33
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,960
No, you can’t.

34
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,440
I swear to the sky in Yanbei

35
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,210
that I will take back

36
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,080
what I lost.

37
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,700
I will shower Chang’an with blood.

38
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,630
You must

39
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,480
go back to Yanbei alive.

40
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,500
Xianwan, tonight at ten,

41
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,050
take care of all prison guards

42
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,380
to prevent them from alerting others

43
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,980
to hinder our operation.

44
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:35,970
Remember,

45
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,440
be as quiet as possible.

46
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,500
Finish the job

47
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,500
in half an hour.

48
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,180
Aye.

49
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,740
Yujiang, lead the second team

50
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,040
and wait outside the Cavalry Camp

51
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,230
to coordinate with us.

52
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,880
Your job is to cut off

53
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,630
the communication

54
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,780
among the Calvary Camp,
the state office of Chang’an

55
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,460
and the Imperial Prison

56
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,070
when we start our move.

57
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,730
Hold the soldiers off for one hour.

58
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,210
Aye.

59
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,520
Sixuan, Sidie

60
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,390
Fengmian and I

61
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,780
will break into the prison.

62
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,700
No matter what method

63
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,140
we use,

64
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,740
we must get in and out

65
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,890
with His Excellency Yan

66
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,860
in fifteen minutes

67
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,360
even at the cost

68
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,080
of our own lives.

69
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,000
He may be too injured

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,040
to move.

71
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,130
We have to escort him to Weipin Pavilion

72
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,300
on Zhuque Avenue

73
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,210
before the sun rises.

74
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,320
People there will work with us.

75
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,970
Once His Excellency arrives,

76
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,590
we will split into three groups

77
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,120
heading to the east, west

78
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,720
and north gates to get out
of the city by force.

79
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,260
I have made arrangements

80
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,360
at the gates.

81
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,820
Once our people arrive,

82
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,280
they will take over the gates.

83
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,760
We only need

84
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,430
fifteen minutes.

85
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,030
Once we’re out,

86
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,260
burn the gates immediately.

87
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,320
In the meantime, Yujiang, Xianwan,

88
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,240
you two set all posts in the city on fire

89
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,610
to create chaos
and distract their attention

90
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,150
to buy us

91
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,690
more time to escape.

92
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:47,820
Aye.

93
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,750
Everyone, we are on a tight schedule.

94
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,470
We don’t have time

95
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,920
to draft a more thorough plan.

96
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,550
During the last operation,

97
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,100
we suffered huge losses.

98
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,570
We may be shorthanded.

99
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,490
But we’ve lost Marquis and his family.

100
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,050
His only son left is in danger.

101
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,110
It’s do-or-die.

102
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,140
I expect your full cooperation.

103
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,170
Whatever it takes,

104
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,670
we cannot lose the last one

105
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,850
to carry on Marquis’s bloodline.

106
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,470
Aye. Consider it done.

107
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,420
Initiate the plan now.

108
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,750
It’s not the time.

109
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,010
Yujiang hasn’t started yet.

110
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,080
It doesn’t matter anymore.

111
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,420
If His Excellency gets hurt,

112
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,350
all our effort will be

113
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,580
in vain.

114
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,000
Here comes the devil.

115
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:46,790
Move!

116
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,790
Young Master, this…

117
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,420
This…

118
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,410
Open the door.

119
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,470
Your Excellency Yan, you’re a lucky man.

120
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,400
Even in prison,

121
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,980
there’s a beauty around you

122
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,900
and you still got visitors.

123
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:13,870
What are you doing here?

124
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,660
I am checking up on you.

125
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,990
We are friends.

126
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,250
Now you are in trouble,

127
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,010
I should pay you a visit.

128
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,350
What’s that look?

129
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,220
Do you hate me?

130
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,200
Why?

131
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,790
I only killed

132
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,320
your pregnant sister.

133
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,680
Compared with Yuwen Huai
who killed your father,

134
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,300
Wei Guang who planned the massacre,

135
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,870
and Yuwen Yue who shot you,

136
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,240
I’m merciful.

137
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,330
What’s the matter?

138
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,620
You still don’t know?

139
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,510
You really thought His Majesty

140
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,430
killed your father for no reason?

141
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,630
He had ordered Yuwen Yue to collect

142
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,080
information about your family

143
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,870
through the Eye of Intel a long time ago.

144
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,470
You probably don’t know

145
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,680
that your best friend

146
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,770
was aware of that long ago,

147
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:57,750
but chose not to tell you.

148
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,020
They are the ones

149
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,010
who are sending you to hell.

150
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,840
You’re lying!

151
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,880
That day,
you were already out of the city,

152
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,080
but got shot in the end, right?

153
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,380
It was him.

154
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,830
He deliberately spread the words

155
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,150
across the entire city.

156
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,830
Even His Majesty

157
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,350
spoke highly of him.

158
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,810
All our lives belong to His Majesty.

159
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,380
Yan Xun,
there was nothing personal between us.

160
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,510
But your family was too unfortunate.

161
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,030
Blame yourself

162
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,120
for getting on my nerves.

163
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,690
I have experienced more

164
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,850
than you could imagine

165
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,070
but I don’t accept failure.

166
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,710
I won’t kill you today.

167
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,120
You like this girl,

168
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,290
right?

169
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,600
I will cut off

170
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,850
all her fingers.

171
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,010
Let’s see if you still like her then.

172
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,730
I dare you!

173
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,100
Go!

174
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,160
Achu!

175
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,260
Stop!

176
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,150
Don’t move.

177
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,700
Behave yourself.

178
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,110
Let go of her!

179
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,160
Bitch!

180
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,010
Do you remember what you owe me?

181
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,640
Zhao Xifeng,

182
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,560
I will kill you!

183
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,280
Excuse me?

184
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,880
Right now, even a stray dog

185
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,640
is better than you.

186
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,480
Your life is at my fingertips.

187
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,750
You want to kill me?

188
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,050
Do it to me!

189
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,810
You’re a piece of trash.

190
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,940
Someone

191
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,250
will kill you for me.

192
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,620
All I need is a few fingers.

193
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,180
Take mine instead.

194
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,370
Take mine!

195
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,810
Look at you two lovebirds.

196
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,800
We’re friends.

197
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,930
If you want to play the hero,

198
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,180
I’ll certainly allow it.

199
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,450
Cut them off yourself.

200
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:32,960
Yan Xun.

201
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,570
No, Yan Xun!

202
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,350
Do it now!

203
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,840
Let go of her.

204
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,280
Give them back.

205
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,670
Yan Xun.

206
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,450
Don’t do it!

207
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,010
Yan Xun!

208
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,770
Yan Xun!

209
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:57,990
Have you forgotten

210
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,150
what I told you?

211
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,370
Don’t do it. No!

212
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,860
Do it.

213
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,560
No.

214
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,740
I am not worth it.

215
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,000
Don’t do it!

216
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,620
Don’t!

217
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,420
Yan Xun!

218
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,140
You are definitely worth it.

219
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,070
You mean

220
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,020
the world to me.

221
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,080
Yan Xun!

222
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,660
Yan Xun!

223
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,020
Let go of me!

224
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:51,610
Yan Xun.

225
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,140
Zhao Xifeng.

226
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,330
Are you satisfied now?

227
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,030
Not yet.

228
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,720
I want your hand,

229
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,020
but you only cut off one finger.

230
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,160
Are you kidding me?

231
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,260
I will kill you!

232
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,210
Achu!

233
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,940
= Imperial Prison =

234
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,400
Zhong Yu, Cavalrymen

235
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,220
will arrive in no time.

236
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,940
We’d better leave now.

237
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,770
If we all die,

238
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,230
no one will be able to help His Excellency.

239
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,100
Retreat!

240
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,530
Retreat. Retreat.

241
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:39,500
= Imperial Prison =

242
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,220
My lady, the troops are on their way.

243
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,120
Let’s go.

244
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,920
Commandant Zhao.

245
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,370
Some are trying to break in.

246
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,010
We can’t defeat them.

247
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,460
You should leave through the back door.

248
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:56,960
Let’s go.

249
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:36,890
Achu.

250
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,280
Don’t cry.

251
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,800
I’m fine.

252
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,230
Without that finger,

253
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,550
how could you hold your sword?

254
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,330
How could you…

255
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,430
How could you shoot again?

256
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,020
See,

257
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,940
I only cut off my left pinky.

258
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,370
It won’t stop me
from using my sword, shooting.

259
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,800
or drawing a bow.

260
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,220
There, there.

261
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,430
It’s just a finger.

262
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,140
I’d rather die

263
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,090
than watch them hurting you.

264
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,030
Yan Xun.

265
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,580
= Imperial Prison =

266
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,110
We captured the one

267
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,110
who murdered Mr. Luo

268
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,440
but the murderer already died.

269
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,890
There were two groups of people

270
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:09,640
fighting outside just now.

271
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,950
I didn’t even know the reason.

272
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:11,730
Are the prisoners all right?

273
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:12,580
They were fine

274
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,010
until Young Master Zhao Xifeng came.

275
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,460
He wanted to cut off that woman’s hand.

276
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:16,810
Then what happened?

277
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:18,930
His Excellency stopped him.

278
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,100
He cut off

279
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,270
his own finger instead.

280
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:25,580
Young Master Yue.

281
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,090
Young Master Yue.

282
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,740
How are you?

283
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,810
Still breathing.

284
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:03,970
Yan Xun…

285
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,220
Say no more.

286
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,120
I have one question for you.

287
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,590
When I tried to flee the city,

288
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,800
someone shot me at the last minute.

289
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,870
Was it your Ice Arrow?

290
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,010
Yes.

291
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,630
His Majesty ordered you

292
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,640
to gather evidence

293
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,920
of my father’s rebellion.

294
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,480
Was it true?

295
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:41,810
Yes.

296
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,130
When Zhao Dongting escorted my mother
back to Yanbei,

297
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,310
he made a detour to Jiangbei Camp

298
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,020
and brought 50 thousand soldiers with him.

299
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,150
You knew that, too?

300
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,110
Yes.

301
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,230
You knew His Majesty

302
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,210
intended to kill my father long ago?

303
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:18,800
Yan Xun,

304
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,960
I kept giving you hints.

305
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,180
That day

306
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,990
on the Jiuyou Platform
before the execution,

307
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,310
did you think about those so-called hints?

308
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,160
We have been friends for ten years!

309
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,860
All my family members’ lives

310
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,510
were on the line.

311
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,100
All you could do was dropping hints?

312
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,800
Did you steal the letter from

313
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,390
Marquis Dingbei to Yan Xun

314
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,600
and give it to His Majesty?

315
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,550
How did you know?

316
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,060
Yuwen Yue.

317
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:18,600
I don’t have

318
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,440
a friend like you.

319
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,070
Just go.

320
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,910
If someone comes to see them again,

321
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,540
report to Young Master immediately.

322
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,860
Provide them

323
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,150
with all the necessary medicine and food.

324
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,270
If anything

325
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,650
happens to His Excellency Yan again,

326
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,580
you will be the one

327
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,220
to blame.

328
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,420
Yes, sir.

329
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,260
I understand, sir.

330
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,570
They fought for one hour

331
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,820
with casualties on both sides.

332
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,120
After Cavalrymen arrived,

333
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,330
some of them escaped.

334
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,380
The state office took over the corpses.

335
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,990
They were all new faces.

336
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,110
Based on their weapons

337
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,270
and skills,

338
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,010
they were more likely from the underworld.

339
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,500
We are still investigating

340
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,350
the cause of the fight

341
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,020
in front of the Imperial Prison.

342
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,830
Is that necessary?

343
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,960
That Prison is heavily guarded.

344
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,320
How could civilians

345
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,670
be anywhere near it?

346
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,630
Song.

347
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,570
You really don’t know

348
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,910
or you are just playing dumb?

349
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,750
I wouldn’t dare.

350
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,070
You are kindhearted.

351
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,040
I don’t blame you.

352
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,900
There is one thing you need
to understand though.

353
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,440
You should make friends

354
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,160
with the right people.

355
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,200
Yan Xun’s family members

356
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,800
are convicted as rebels.

357
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,900
Making friends with the enemy

358
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,000
will eventually harm yourself
and those around you.

359
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,250
I am so sorry.

360
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,000
All that doesn’t matter right now.

361
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,810
What matters is

362
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,350
Yan Shicheng’s accomplices

363
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,320
are still fighting against us.

364
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,690
Places we have conquered

365
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,350
need to be governed.

366
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,410
Song, can you do that for me?

367
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,660
Father.

368
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,620
You are assigning me
to govern those places?

369
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,250
I…

370
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,270
Never mind.

371
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,270
You are too soft-hearted

372
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,000
with no understanding of the military.

373
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,400
Also,

374
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,520
you lack political practice.

375
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,850
If only Che were here,

376
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,460
he’d be the best choice.

377
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,000
How about

378
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,240
calling him back?

379
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,760
Father, Luo Yongchen is dead.

380
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,870
Should we find someone to take his place?

381
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,170
That can wait.

382
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,220
Father,

383
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,240
I’ll take my leave then.

384
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,010
Father hasn’t appointed anyone

385
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,200
to replace Mr. Luo.

386
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:13,740
Maybe he can’t find the

387
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,560
right person.

388
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,090
Can’t find

389
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,370
the right person?

390
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,440
He wants the Prison

391
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,920
to be leaderless.

392
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,710
He’s sending a message

393
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,550
and telling everyone

394
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,650
he never means

395
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,870
to remit Yan Xun’s death.

396
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,300
Whoever hates him

397
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,490
can take this chance

398
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,030
to do whatever...

399
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:30,840
Chun!

400
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,100
Do not judge father.

401
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,150
But that’s what he’s doing!

402
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:35,790
Chun!

403
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,480
Brother, Yan Xun

404
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,680
has suffered too much.

405
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,720
Why is father

406
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,850
treating him like this?

407
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,610
Every time I close my eyes,

408
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,170
what happened on Jiuyou Platform

409
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,530
flashes back again and again.

410
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,890
It’s killing me,

411
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,910
not to mention Yan Xun.

412
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,230
Can you imagine

413
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:02,840
how desperate he is?

414
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:26,060
= Imperial Prison =

415
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,010
You are awake.

416
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,390
Are you thirsty?

417
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,610
I’ll get you some water.

418
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:15,990
Slowly.

419
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,440
Drink it.

420
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,990
You haven’t had anything the whole day.

421
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,780
You must be hungry.

422
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,470
I’m fine.

423
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,190
Jailer, jailer!

424
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,250
What’s up?

425
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,190
What’s wrong?

426
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,640
His Excellency has woken up?

427
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,520
Do you have any food?

428
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,570
Yes, yes.

429
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,850
Master Yuwen Yue has asked me

430
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,580
to provide you

431
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,250
with enough food.

432
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,080
Wait a minute.

433
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:34,620
Here.

434
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,970
Your Excellency, your food.

435
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:42,970
Here you are.

436
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,560
Feel free to tell me whatever you need.

437
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,240
Thank you.

438
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,880
You are welcome. I’m leaving.

439
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,290
Here, drink it.

440
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,030
Achu.

441
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,210
Have you eaten?

442
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:18,750
I’m not hungry.

443
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,030
Eat something

444
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,320
or you’ll get sick.

445
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,400
Is it good?

446
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,130
Yes.

447
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,750
Achu,

448
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,190
I meant to take you back to Yanbei

449
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,500
to give you a good life,

450
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,240
but unexpectedly,

451
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,040
I had you

452
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,710
caged with me.

453
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,710
I’m sorry.

454
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:20,970
I’ll never

455
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,310
promise you anything again.

456
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,930
I’ll get you out

457
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,880
if I have the chance.

458
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,540
Yan Xun,

459
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,320
when you were the prince,

460
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,380
I never looked up at you.

461
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,660
Now that you are in trouble,

462
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,070
I wouldn’t look down on you, either.

463
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,710
I want to be your friend

464
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,800
not because of your identity

465
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,750
but because of who you are.

466
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,040
And,

467
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,750
I don’t think being here

468
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,560
is too bad.

469
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,870
See? We have food
and a roof over our heads.

470
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,230
We are still alive.

471
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,260
I believe

472
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,760
you’ll get back on your feet someday.

473
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,350
I’ll have to rely on you

474
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,400
to live a well-off life.

475
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:31,190
What should I do

476
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,640
once we arrive at Yanbei?

477
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,570
To teach martial arts?

478
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,130
I can throw punches.

479
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:41,620
Wait,

480
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,290
I don’t want to fight anymore.

481
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,470
And you told me

482
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,560
Yanbei is peaceful.

483
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,850
People there can choose their lives.

484
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,410
Didn’t you say

485
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,010
we could hunt horses in Xiuli Mountain?

486
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,490
We can breed horses.

487
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,140
I’ll be on the horseback

488
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,820
followed by thousands of cavalrymen.

489
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,800
How cool will that be!

490
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,900
If anyone lays a finger on me,

491
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,520
you can have your men beat him.

492
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,780
I can finally be a bully

493
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,020
instead of being bullied.

494
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,620
= Imperial Prison =

495
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,370
Fool, fool!

496
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,810
Fool, fool!

497
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,030
Xing’er, Xing’er!

498
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,790
Xing’er, Xing’er!

499
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,980
= Imperial Prison =

500
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:23,150
Someone is protecting Yan Xun in secret?

501
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,140
Yes.

502
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,460
Do you know who that is?

503
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,850
Not yet.

504
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,780
I’ve sent men to check it.

505
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,100
As requested, Ministry of Personnel

506
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:37,930
has assembled all officials’ files,

507
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:40,520
including their assessments, evaluations

508
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,270
and their backgrounds and resumes

509
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,510
over the past three years

510
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,860
for Your Majesty to review.

511
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,900
Is there a candidate

512
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,380
for Yanbei?

513
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,140
Zhao Gui’s son,

514
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,470
General Zhao Dongting,

515
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:59,230
has potentials.

516
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,130
He’s a killer, but not a governor.

517
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,900
Wei Guang’s nephew, Wei Shuye,

518
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,830
is loyal and diligent.

519
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,800
He is outstanding

520
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,140
among his peers.

521
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:16,540
Too weak-minded to shoulder the weight.

522
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,070
Prince Jing’s heir Jing Han

523
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,420
is wise and capable.

524
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,090
Aren’t there any talents

525
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,210
other than those

526
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,060
from noble families

527
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,070
in our state?

528
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,420
Li Xian, Governor of Jizhou,

529
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,470
rose from a commoner and he’s insightful.

530
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,810
It’s just that he is a bit old.

531
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,290
He has turned 56.

532
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,030
The old are more prudent

533
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,750
than the young.

534
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,560
The age is not

535
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,930
a problem.

536
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:06,180
= Li Xian =

537
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:09,000
Assistant Chief of Guards, Jiang Wei,

538
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,930
who used to serve

539
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,370
under General of Chariots, Yang Mingqi,

540
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,650
is quite battlewise,

541
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:17,020
cautious and erudite.

542
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,780
He is a rare scholarly general.

543
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,150
But he’s of humble birth

544
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,740
as he was Yang Mingqi’s servant.

545
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,850
If he really is capable,

546
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,840
his birth will not be a problem.

547
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,710
Yes, Your Majesty.

548
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,090
Governor of Zhuzhou

549
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,860
started as a scholar,

550
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:41,260
but he’s well-versed
in military strategies.

551
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,160
He has led villagers

552
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,470
to repulse the roving bandits many times.

553
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,080
He is a doer.

554
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,610
The court

555
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,060
is filled with talkers.

556
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,450
Doers are just what we need.

557
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,490
You’re a good judge of talent,
Your Majesty.

558
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,100
Under your leadership,

559
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,340
they can make full use of their talents

560
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,620
to serve the state.

561
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:12,060
= Sun Ye =

562
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,620
= Qingshan House =

563
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,540
Young Master,

564
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,980
all officials’ assessments and evaluations

565
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,550
over the past three years

566
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,500
are here.

567
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,780
Pick out those

568
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,370
from noble families,

569
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,480
prestigious households

570
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:30,860
and the imperial family.

571
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,920
Then rule out those above the fourth rank

572
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,470
who are resourceful,

573
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,320
on the fast track of promotion

574
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,120
and close to noble families.

575
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:39,360
Aye.

576
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:50,960
Leave out people without martial arts.

577
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:57,570
Eliminate people without wives and kids.

578
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,280
Take out people from Yanbei.

579
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,430
Cross out those
without military experience.

580
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:14,120
Among the rest,

581
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,630
give me everyone

582
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,860
from Huaibei.

583
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,390
Young Master,

584
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,730
only three people are left.

585
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,580
= Jiang Wei =

586
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,420
= Li Xian =

587
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:36,330
Send out the information.

588
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:37,350
Aye.

589
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:50,930
Chun,

590
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,170
do you believe what Yuwen Yue said?

591
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,900
I grew up in the Palace.

592
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,210
I tend to

593
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,960
stay away from most of the things,

594
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,910
but I’m not ignorant.

595
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,450
Yuwen Zhuo has been

596
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,220
the head of spies for so long.

597
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,950
He raised

598
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,510
that Cold Ice Yuwen Yue.

599
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,170
He is wise and astute.

600
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,930
In terms of mind-reading

601
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:13,110
and manipulation,

602
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,180
twenty minds of mine cannot beat

603
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,750
his alone.

604
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:18,630
I don’t care what he’ll do

605
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,040
or what he wants to do

606
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,160
as long as

607
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,320
he’ll keep his word

608
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,440
and help Yan Xun out.

609
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,620
Chun,

610
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,820
how can you be sure he’s credible?

611
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:30,120
Then who else can we trust?

612
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,760
Mother? Father?

613
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:33,990
Or anyone else?

614
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,390
Brother,

615
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,470
we have no other choice

616
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,850
but to trust him.

617
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,110
Mr. Cold.

618
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,470
Fine, we’ll leave it to him.

619
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,210
Get his predicted candidates out

620
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,220
for Yanbei.

621
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,820
With such a juicy opportunity

622
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,860
falling right in front of them,

623
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,130
aren’t those ladies in the harem

624
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,890
going to grab it to benefit

625
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:03,470
their own families?

626
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,850
Once they start to fight

627
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,900
for that post,

628
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,190
Yan Xun will have a chance to survive.

629
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:17,020
Princess has agreed to your plan.

630
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:18,490
But how could you

631
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,230
make sure of His Excellency Yan’s safety?

632
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,630
Marquis and his family are eradicated.

633
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,100
Xiuli Army defected.

634
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,010
Yanbei is in chaos.

635
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,700
Leaders of all tribe

636
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,850
are acting on their own.

637
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,080
Local conflicts happen from time to time.

638
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,740
At this time,

639
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,480
an iron hand is needed

640
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,670
in Yanbei

641
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,200
to restore the balance

642
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,320
and guard the border.

643
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,600
Yanbei is the northern gate of Wei,

644
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,850
rich in resources including war-horses,

645
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,830
connecting with the west,

646
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,470
a bustling hub

647
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,180
with strategic importance.

648
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,770
Now that Marquis Dingbei is gone,

649
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,440
whoever dominates Yanbei

650
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,760
is like the king of that area.

651
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:58,880
But that person cannot

652
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,740
come from a noble,

653
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,520
or the imperial family.

654
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,430
Even a decorated prince

655
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:07,550
isn’t trustworthy.

656
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,210
His Majesty went to great lengths

657
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,470
to get rid of Marquis Dingbei.

658
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,880
He certainly doesn’t want

659
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,410
another Yan Shicheng.

660
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:15,730
So

661
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:18,190
this person must be born humble

662
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,690
with no connections or resources,

663
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:22,380
but an all-round talent,

664
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,430
well-versed in military,
strategies and politics

665
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:27,140
and battlewise

666
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:30,000
without a high-ranking post or reputation.

667
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,960
But Young Master,

668
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:34,830
how did you know

669
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:36,280
they are from Huaibei?

670
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,530
Because Eunuch Wang

671
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,920
came from there.

672
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:41,980
Everyone is craving

673
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,510
for that vacancy,

674
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,660
including the three

675
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,960
chosen ones.

676
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,680
They’ll definitely be tempted.

677
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,170
It’s just one step away

678
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,650
from coming out top

679
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,610
with tremendous power.

680
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,090
No one can resist

681
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,710
such temptation.

682
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,330
They didn’t take sides before

683
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:01,840
not necessarily because

684
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,390
they are noble and pure.

685
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,830
Maybe they just lack the chance.

686
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,750
Throughout history,

687
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,650
the court is controlled

688
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:11,710
by the nobility.

689
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,330
Posts in Ministries of War,
Personnel and Revenue

690
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,860
are taken

691
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,330
by those noble families.

692
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,600
Since the founding of Wei,

693
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,240
the situation is getting worse.

694
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,400
Their force

695
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,190
is enough to threaten the throne.

696
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,070
We need His Majesty to know

697
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,400
skipping those families

698
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,150
to get hold of Yanbei

699
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,810
is impossible.

700
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:37,720
The only way

701
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,710
to control that area

702
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,180
is to keep Yan Xun alive.

703
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,300
Only in this way

704
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,090
can Yan Xun stand a chance to survive.

705
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,660
What do you mean, Princess?

706
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,170
Don’t panic.

707
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,220
I asked to see you

708
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:57,950
for no other reason.

709
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,140
I just want to tell you

710
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,570
if I know it,

711
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:06,110
others know it, too.

712
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,150
Li Xian, Jiang Wei and Sun Ye

713
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,580
are all from Huaibei.

714
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,260
Sun Ye comes from your hometown.

715
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,190
Helping them to get promoted

716
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,960
will certainly

717
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,190
benefit you greatly.

718
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,130
But once your connection
with them is exposed,

719
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,170
you will lose

720
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,680
all my father’s trust in you.

721
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,670
Officials have ranks.

722
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,400
The noble have family support.

723
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,950
Generals have their troops.

724
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,580
And you?

725
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,540
Except for my father’s

726
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,190
trust,

727
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,550
what else do you have?

728
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,880
Here’s a piece of advice

729
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,260
for you.

730
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,130
Don’t ruin what you rely on.

731
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,350
Princess, you are saying...

732
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,620
Is Yanbei

733
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,460
that tempting

734
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,810
that you all drooling over

735
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,140
and fighting for it?

736
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,310
You want to steal my throne, too?

737
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,860
Please calm down, please calm down.

738
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:13,990
Your Majesty.

739
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:26,520
Didn’t you say those three people

740
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,730
are of humble birth

741
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,430
with no connections with them?

742
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,170
The Great Wei

743
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,930
is mine.

744
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,630
Not Wei Guang's

745
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,470
or Zhao Gui’s.

746
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,660
Those greedy vultures

747
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,690
are craving for more
than they already have.

748
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:58,000
They are even coveting Yanbei.

749
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,450
They must die, all of them!

750
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,220
They used to be on their own

751
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,150
but maybe not anymore.

752
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:09,840
I heard that recently,

753
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,610
ladies in the harem

754
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:12,950
are quite busy.

755
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,540
They’ve summoned
family members frequently.

756
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:18,200
I didn’t pay attention at first,

757
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,590
but now, it seems

758
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,290
that the news

759
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:23,320
was leaked by them.

760
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,150
They’re good.

761
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,870
They even have eyes and ears

762
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,460
around me.

763
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:40,880
Your Majesty,

764
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,900
how about calling the Seventh Prince back?

765
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:44,870
At this time,

766
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,910
Your Majesty’s own son is more reliable.

767
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:53,170
Are there any other choices?

768
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,080
Well...

769
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,040
There is one.

770
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:59,140
Say it.

771
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,650
Yan Xun.

772
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,630
Yan Xun?

773
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,810
Yes.

774
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:10,930
He’s the only one left in his family.

775
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,800
Xiuli Army betrayed them.

776
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,340
Heiying Army was scattered.

777
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,880
Yanbei’s force no longer poses a threat.

778
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,930
Yan Xun is guilty

779
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,480
and injured.

780
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:21,730
Even if he inherits

781
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:22,990
his father’s title,

782
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,100
he can be confined here,
reflecting on himself

783
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,280
and recuperating.

784
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:29,140
There’s nothing wrong with that.

785
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,460
Besides, his merits

786
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,950
are undeniable.

787
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,410
It can also show

788
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,770
Your Majesty’s benevolence and mercy.

789
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,360
Yan Xun

790
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,260
is just a young lad.

791
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,850
He is nothing

792
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:47,320
without Yan Shicheng.

793
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,180
In this city,

794
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,190
he has no chance

795
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,240
to get out of Your Majesty’s hands.

796
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,020
Then Your Majesty can

797
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,910
take your time

798
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,690
to find better candidates.

799
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,360
You

800
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,540
are a cunning old fox.

801
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,930
Princess.

802
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,830
Thank you for your effort.

803
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,750
Has my father agreed?

804
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,690
You’ve planned everything out, Princess.

805
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:54,590
You should be confident.

806
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,390
I don’t have any plans.

807
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:00,590
You’re flattering me.

808
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,660
I’m just desperate to help.

809
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:04,590
I hope...

810
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:06,270
Hope you can understand that.

811
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:09,150
I’ll take my leave then.

812
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:19,960
