= Episode 33 =

16
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,050
Your Majesty, you’ve had a hard time,

17
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,730
bothering a lot.

18
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,640
You tell me!

19
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,190
All because the Wei family

20
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,590
has made so much trouble.

21
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,640
You mean

22
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,770
Zhao Xifeng killed Wei Shuyou?

23
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:54,980
More than that.

24
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,620
We don’t know whether it is true.

25
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,800
Anyway, powerful families never stop

26
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,210
fighting against each other.

27
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,910
As long as they balance out
each other’s power,

28
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,570
there will be no threat to me.

29
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,270
Don’t worry, Your Majesty.

30
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,840
Our spies are

31
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,200
working harder now.

32
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,550
Whatever they find,

33
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,910
they will report it immediately.

34
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,890
Only you can help me

35
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,420
get over difficulties.

36
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,750
It is

37
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,940
my greatest pleasure.

38
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,390
My Lord.

39
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,770
Please have some tea.

40
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,570
Uncle!

41
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,830
Uncle!

42
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,930
Are you all right, Uncle?

43
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,300
If Shuyou were as calm as you,

44
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,760
he would still be alive.

45
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,790
My Lord.

46
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,890
Shall we send someone to kill Yan Xun?

47
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,110
Not now. It would be too obvious.

48
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,910
We’d better wait.

49
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,800
Even if we want to kill him,

50
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,330
we can’t do it ourselves.

51
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:35,820
Aye.

52
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,390
We can hire

53
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,830
private assassinators,

54
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,770
no matter how much it costs.

55
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,800
Contact them first.

56
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,710
But they must wait,

57
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,120
until the right time.

58
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:52,850
Aye.

59
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,710
Uncle.

60
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,400
My Lord.

61
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,620
Be careful.

62
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,800
I am not

63
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,260
a genius,

64
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,180
but I am not stupid, either.

65
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,680
Why was my son so reckless?

66
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:23,270
It’s our fate, maybe.

67
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,610
Shuye,

68
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:33,070
our family can only depend on you.

69
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:36,980
Uncle.

70
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,610
Zhao Xifeng and Wei Shuyou died.

71
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,220
His Excellency might feel better.

72
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,240
It will also save us much trouble.

73
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,080
It is hard to tell now.

74
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,580
Those rich families are powerful.

75
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,750
They make sacrifices if necessary.

76
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,710
His Excellency is still young

77
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,950
and inexperienced.

78
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,320
When we want to fight them,

79
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,000
we must destroy them once for all.

80
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,930
Otherwise, it would only alarm the enemies

81
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,030
and bring us more trouble.

82
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,570
The Wei family will never

83
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,420
let it go.

84
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,790
They will take revenge.

85
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,710
You need to be extremely careful.

86
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:28,570
Aye.

87
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,510
This is a secret letter

88
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,280
Fengmian wrote to His Excellency Yan Xun.

89
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,700
If the Wei family takes revenge,

90
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,250
and His Excellency is in danger,

91
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,110
you must make sure

92
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,060
he can leave safely

93
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,790
even if all planted spies on Zhuque Avenue

94
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,310
have to fight desperately

95
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,440
until the last one of them dies.

96
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,120
Therefore,

97
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,060
Yu…

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,950
It is worth it.

99
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,380
= Your Excellency =

100
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,210
Fengmian sent a warning to us.

101
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,530
Wei Guang has been

102
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,450
bribing traders in Xianyang.

103
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,030
He wants to destroy Yanbei financially

104
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,720
without a war.

105
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,090
The Wei family is the biggest obstacle

106
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,170
for Yanbei.

107
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,290
We must destroy them.

108
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,870
The eunuch has arrived.

109
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,190
Miss Achu.

110
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,390
What’s the matter, Sir?

111
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,640
His Majesty calls for Miss Achu

112
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,880
to the palace.

113
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,440
His Majesty wants to see me?

114
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,060
Yes.

115
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,430
Fine, I see.

116
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,950
I’m not sure if it is safe to go there.

117
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,520
I need to go

118
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,380
either way.

119
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,740
Don’t worry.

120
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,830
Miss, please follow me.

121
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,240
Miss, please wait here for a moment.

122
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,330
I’ll tell His Majesty you’ve arrived.

123
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:48,820
OK.

124
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,030
You wicked maid!

125
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,300
How dare you bring a sword!

126
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:01,870
Take her down!

127
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,990
Take her down!

128
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,260
Stop!

129
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,110
Yuwen Yue,

130
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,220
she brings a sword to the palace,

131
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,680
having an evil plan.

132
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,370
You mind your own business.

133
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,090
That is my Waning Moon.

134
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,130
I left it at Yan Xun’s place,

135
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,200
and I asked her to bring it to me.

136
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:27,260
Besides, His Majesty asked to see her.

137
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,230
Am I right, Xing’er?

138
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,800
Yes.

139
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,540
Young Master Huai, look carefully.

140
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,020
This is Waning Moon.

141
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,790
Huai, you were just punished
by His Majesty.

142
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,460
Why don’t you behave yourself

143
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,150
in case you make trouble again.

144
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,600
I come to visit Princess Yuan Chun.

145
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,180
It’s none of your business.

146
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,870
Why do you bring a sword
when visiting Princess Yuan Chun?

147
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,040
I’d like to ask

148
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,540
why you bring a sword, too?

149
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,960
I’m the Deputy Commander
of Cavalry Battalion.

150
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,610
What’s wrong with bringing a sword?

151
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,770
You have been demoted for three levels.

152
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,680
I think

153
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,230
you’d better behave yourself.

154
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,620
Let’s go, Xing’er.

155
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,160
Tell me. What do you want?

156
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,950
Give me my sword back.

157
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,610
Give me mine first.

158
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,920
You have grown up.

159
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,530
You sound stronger now.

160
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,440
I think you have someone to rely on.

161
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,380
Who would that person be?

162
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,680
Yan Xun?

163
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,520
Yuwen Yue, I didn’t come to you,

164
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,180
but you found me first.

165
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,330
How dare you!

166
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,180
Do you not remember

167
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,400
who taught you the martial arts?

168
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,460
You really think your dirty little trick

169
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,870
can deceive anyone?

170
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:52,880
I do.

171
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,930
Your emperor

172
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:55,830
was just deceived by

173
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,790
my dirty little trick.

174
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,690
Before you have the certificate,

175
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,310
you are still a maid

176
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,390
at my house.

177
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:08,700
Tell me.

178
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,510
What do you want in exchange

179
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,400
for the slave-releasing certificate?

180
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,350
As long as I don’t give it to you,

181
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,360
you are still my maid.

182
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,130
How about this?

183
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,250
You serve me one more day. OK?

184
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,030
Serve you one more day?

185
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,210
Don’t you fear

186
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,790
I would stab you ten times a day?

187
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,880
If you’re able to do that,

188
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,140
try it.

189
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,750
Really?

190
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,290
Did I ever

191
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,820
joke with you?

192
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,840
Miss Chu.

193
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,790
Please don’t stand on ceremony.

194
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,070
Just call me Chu Qiao.

195
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,840
An important document has just been sent

196
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,870
from the Northwest.

197
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,290
His Majesty has called for a few ministers

198
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,320
for discussion.

199
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,640
I’m afraid he’s too busy to see you today.

200
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,860
You may leave now.

201
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,550
Thank you for your information.

202
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:01,340
= Pine Hall =

203
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,300
Don’t you ask

204
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,660
why His Majesty wanted to see me?

205
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,420
Why should I ask?

206
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,770
You’ll tell me, anyway.

207
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,950
Not before you ask.

208
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,250
Miss Achu.

209
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,410
My dear Achu.

210
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,650
What did His Majesty

211
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,510
want you to do?

212
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,960
To be a general? Or a marshal?

213
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,690
Neither.

214
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,160
Neither?

215
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,100
He had something urgent.

216
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,430
He didn’t see me at all.

217
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,500
Something like what?

218
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,190
I don’t know.

219
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,300
An important document from the Northwest,
as I was told.

220
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:03,960
Right.

221
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,620
If His Majesty wants to hurt me,

222
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,180
he must first

223
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,170
get rid of all my right-hand subordinates.

224
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,920
Sooner

225
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,300
or later.

226
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,620
Don’t you worry?

227
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,270
There’s nothing to worry about.

228
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,100
Isn’t it what we expect

229
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,290
after preparing for such a long time?

230
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,510
By the way,

231
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,450
when will you

232
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:31,930
take out your roast duck?

233
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,500
I’m starving.

234
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,340
You have a sharp sense of smell.

235
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,860
Smells good.

236
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,670
Have a try.

237
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,510
Try how it tastes.

238
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,740
Have some.

239
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:03,820
No, thanks.

240
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,630
Tastes good?

241
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:13,710
Oh,

242
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,030
I need to go out tomorrow.

243
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,580
Where?

244
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:20,620
I met Yuwen Yue

245
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,690
in the palace.

246
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,990
He wants me to be his maid for one day

247
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,850
before he gives me the certificate.

248
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,120
Have you decided yet?

249
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,310
Yes.

250
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,410
I can’t let him

251
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,560
have anything on me.

252
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,160
So, I must get back

253
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,410
my slave-releasing certificate.

254
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,820
We promised

255
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,680
not to deceive each other

256
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,590
or hide anything from each other.

257
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,550
So,

258
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,140
I must tell you the truth.

259
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:52,140
= Qingshan House =

260
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,390
Come in, please.

261
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,740
= Xing’er =

262
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,030
After you left,

263
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,260
Young Master still

264
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,750
had your room cleaned.

265
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,070
Come in.

266
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,580
After being a master around Yan Xun

267
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,550
for several years,

268
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,040
you don’t even remember my rules,

269
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,910
do you?

270
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,040
You did a better job.

271
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,080
What? Lost your tongue?

272
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,350
I’m afraid

273
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,050
I can’t say anything sweet.

274
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,830
Try to say something sweet.

275
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,810
I can’t do it to you.

276
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,110
Is this

277
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,130
how a maid should behave?

278
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,640
There are many kinds of maids.

279
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,130
Some keep flattering

280
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,220
and trying to get a higher position.

281
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,020
Some keep bearing

282
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,350
and only want to survive.

283
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,290
And some hate their master,

284
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,770
and even try to kill him

285
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,280
as early as possible.

286
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,880
Of which kind are you?

287
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,030
I belong to a more dangerous kind.

288
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,110
I can kill you in a minute.

289
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,670
Then why didn’t you

290
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,720
poison the tea?

291
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,460
You saw that.

292
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,050
I drank the tea without even thinking.

293
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,110
Isn’t it an easier way?

294
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,040
Yuwen Yue.

295
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,340
We didn’t meet for only a few years.

296
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,950
What makes you so stupid now?

297
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,080
I am no longer

298
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,970
what I used to be.

299
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,870
You’ve even lost

300
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:28,640
your vigilance?

301
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,840
Since you’re eager to kill me,

302
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,550
why did you agree

303
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,910
to come back to me?

304
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,740
Don’t you fear

305
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,690
I would kill you again?

306
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,330
Or...

307
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,910
You trust me in your heart?

308
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,530
Don’t pretend otherwise.

309
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,000
If you hadn’t threatened me

310
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,700
with the slave-releasing certificate,

311
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:45,980
why would I come

312
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,770
and waste my time?

313
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,250
Xing’er, if I were you,

314
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,300
I wouldn’t annoy my master.

315
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,020
I’m not Xing’er. I’m Chu Qiao.

316
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,850
In my place, you’re Xing’er.

317
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,420
Xing’er. Xing’er. Xing’er.

318
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:08,440
Xing’er.

319
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,840
It hurts! It hurts!

320
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,860
It hurts!

321
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,530
Let’s go.

322
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,270
Let’s get outside

323
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,690
and let me see

324
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,790
if you have better marital arts.

325
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,360
If you die in the fight,

326
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,090
it’s because of your poor ability.

327
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,470
Don’t blame me for murdering.

328
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,470
Sounds arrogant.

329
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,030
Let’s see

330
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,640
if you can kill me.

331
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,100
Enough! Enough! Enough!

332
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,930
Enough!

333
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,610
Time for lunch.

334
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,390
Have it with me.

335
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,360
We didn’t have such a rule.

336
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,710
I make rules.

337
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,960
You only ate refined food,

338
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,030
didn’t you?

339
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,510
Why do you eat

340
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,360
such a simple meal now?

341
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,140
If you had eaten the carrion of horses

342
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,100
for three days,

343
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,700
you would also eat anything.

344
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,100
I didn’t expect that.

345
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,030
I am not particular about food,

346
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,430
but I don’t like it

347
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,540
when someone snatches my meat.

348
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,990
You asked me to sit down for lunch.

349
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,560
Since we eat together,

350
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,050
why does the meat belong to you?

351
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,960
I picked it first.

352
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,010
Didn’t notice.

353
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,920
You even ate the carrion of horses,

354
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,710
didn’t you?

355
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,000
You can also have meat with dirt, I guess.

356
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,210
Young Master Yue, the bed is ready.

357
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,090
You can sleep now.

358
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,420
This is Qianhun Poison,

359
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,380
made of the venom

360
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,610
from toxic Persian spiders.

361
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,940
It is said

362
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,260
to be the king of poison

363
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,950
that kills a thousand people.

364
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,330
People outside the Pass are inexperienced.

365
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,100
They always like to exaggerate.

366
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,990
Killing a thousand people

367
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,390
might be exaggerating.

368
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,690
But it is far enough to kill one person.

369
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,190
What’s your point?

370
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,330
Young Master.

371
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,830
Master is poisoned by Qianhun Poison

372
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,680
from the Western Regions!

373
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,910
Here is the antidote, Young Master!

374
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:44,480
Here it is!

375
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:46,810
There is only one...

376
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,410
Zhan Mou, give me the antidote.

377
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,000
Antidote?

378
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,300
Young Master.

379
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,520
That was the last Resuscitation Elixir.

380
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,810
Young Master, help me!

381
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,070
Help me!

382
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,760
After suffering for several hours,

383
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,670
he will die painfully

384
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,350
when his organs burst down.

385
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,750
Young Master, I’m begging you.

386
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,140
Kill me!

387
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,960
Kill me!

388
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,170
I’m begging you!

389
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,630
Kill me, please!

390
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,580
The Resuscitation Elixir is precious.

391
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,970
I had only one pill.

392
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:44,960
The drug is precious.

393
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,510
What about people’s lives?

394
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,910
Tell me. In your eyes,

395
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:50,760
what do people’s lives mean?

396
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,280
Xing’er.

397
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,440
You shouldn’t only live for the others.

398
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,230
You should free yourself.

399
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,290
Birds of different feather
do not flock together.

400
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,900
Save your breath.

401
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,990
I’ve done what I promised you.

402
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,200
When can I get the certificate?

403
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:31,960
Yueqi.

404
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,760
Get the certificate and a carriage.

405
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,590
Go see her off.

406
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:09,060
= Qingshan House =

407
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,110
This is your slave-releasing certificate.

408
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,550
When you leave,

409
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,190
you’re no longer one of us.

410
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,280
I’m never one of you.

411
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:19,710
That year, Young Master faked your death

412
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,730
with the acupuncture.

413
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,910
He rushed to save you,

414
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,650
but met assassinations on his way.

415
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,960
That’s why he was delayed.

416
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,670
When we got there,

417
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,840
you were already gone.

418
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,580
= Qingshan House =

419
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,530
Why haven’t you slept yet?

420
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,510
The air is fresh after the rain.

421
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,460
I came out for a walk.

422
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,430
Finished?

423
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,830
I’ve got the certificate.

424
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,880
Did he embarrass you?

425
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,250
I’m no longer what I was.

426
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,390
He can’t embarrass me.

427
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,820
Achu, drink some ginger soup before sleep

428
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:50,400
in case you catch cold
after walking in the rain.

429
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,240
Achu.

430
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,660
I’m not strong enough

431
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,710
to protect you yet.

432
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,220
You suffered a lot.

433
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,820
I’m sorry.

434
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,900
I will take you out of this place soon

435
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,260
and you’ll no longer suffer.

436
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,600
I swear to you!

437
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,520
Yan Xun, we don’t need

438
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,950
to apologize to each other.

439
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,500
We have experienced so much together.

440
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,240
And we have something

441
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,510
more important to do.

442
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,090
Don’t worry about me.

443
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,370
Don’t think too much, either.

444
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,220
Go to bed early.

445
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,010
I’d rather kill a woman

446
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,500
when I can’t control her.

447
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,340
That year, Young Master faked your death

448
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,510
with the acupuncture.

449
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,470
He rushed to save you,

450
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,320
but met assassinations on his way.

451
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,500
That’s why he was delayed.

452
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,360
When we got there,

453
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,530
you were already gone.

454
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,400
I don’t think

455
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,710
Wei Guang can keep his temper.

456
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,730
He will take revenge soon.

457
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,860
What goes around comes around.

458
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,560
Wei Guang has been

459
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,960
keeping his temper

460
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,440
when he hasn’t taken revenge yet.

461
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,480
We must get rid of him.

462
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,380
Or there’ll be great trouble.

463
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,370
Things taken out

464
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,140
of the Imperial Mausoleum

465
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,870
must be in the palace now.

466
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,810
Yes.

467
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,480
We’ll see

468
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,190
how His Majesty reacts.

469
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,550
Your Excellency.

470
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,410
Mr. Wu left this to me.

471
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,110
He told you to open it

472
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,190
when you wanted to eliminate Wei Guang.

473
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,630
The fire case of the Imperial Mausoleum
hasn’t been figured out yet.

474
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:41,280
But funeral objects

475
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,050
have become best sellers

476
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,610
in the antique market.

477
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,500
I sent guards to the Imperial Mausoleum

478
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,560
to check what was stolen.

479
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,410
But they found the place waterlogged.

480
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,870
Mr. Wei.

481
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:58,600
You’re the chief supervisor
on its construction.

482
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,090
Could you explain to me

483
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,090
why this is happening?

484
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:06,700
I... I will figure it out carefully!

485
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,140
Are you sure you can?

486
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,840
You took care of the whole process

487
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:17,040
from the site selection

488
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,120
to the supervision of its construction.

489
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,580
Now it is ruined everywhere

490
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,160
when it’s also waterlogged

491
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,410
just like a water palace.

492
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,860
Without the fire,

493
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,910
I wouldn’t have known that.

494
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,540
Do you think

495
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,930
I was born yesterday?

496
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,080
Your Majesty, don’t be angry!

497
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,460
When something goes wrong
with the Imperial Mausoleum,

498
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,470
I should be blamed

499
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,720
as the chief supervisor.

500
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:58,340
I am old with limited energy.

501
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,510
Sometimes there are inadvertent mistakes

502
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,050
and supervisions.

503
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:07,180
But speaking of embezzlement,

504
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,060
I’m innocent.

505
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,760
It has been five years
since the Imperial Mausoleum was built.

506
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:17,670
The Ministry of Rites selected the site,
I supervised,

507
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,160
Master Liu of the Ministry of Works
led the construction,

508
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:25,760
Officer Yuwen Huai guarded the place.

509
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,040
Then somehow thieves forced their way in

510
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,820
and set fire.

511
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,710
I really don’t know

512
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,560
what happened.

513
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,640
Your Majesty,

514
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:40,430
please leave this to me

515
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,610
and I’ll make a thorough investigation!

516
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:43,420
I will

517
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:46,990
give you an explanation.

518
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:47,870
Enough!

519
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:51,830
If you really

520
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:54,550
feel honest,

521
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,750
stay in the palace

522
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,820
and behave yourself.

523
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,590
I will

524
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,630
have the case investigated.

525
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:04,480
Aye.

526
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,070
Greetings, Your Majesty.

527
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,800
Yuwen Yue.

528
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,460
The Imperial Mausoleum was burgled.

529
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,420
I want you to investigate this case.

530
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,030
You can question every official

531
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,020
at any time.

532
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,870
You can also dispatch soldiers

533
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,510
from Cavalry Battalion
and Chang’an Office.

534
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:53,630
You have ten days.

535
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,230
You must find out the truth.

536
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,330
Also,

537
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,750
among the lost items,

538
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:02,250
there is one relic
called ﻿White Jade Tripod.

539
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,010
There is no trace of it,

540
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:06,630
which gives me a headache.

541
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,750
By the priest’s calculation,

542
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,650
this tripod was put

543
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:16,140
on the geomantic line

544
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,360
inside the Imperial Mausoleum

545
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,550
to keep our nation safe and prosperous.

546
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,440
It’s extremely important.

547
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,970
No one else shall have it.

548
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:31,040
I will make a thorough investigation.

549
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:32,670
Don’t worry, Your Majesty.

550
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,860
Did you meet Yan Xun in private

551
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:44,670
after you came back?

552
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,300
Yes, Your Majesty. I met him once.

553
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,980
He is a totally different person

554
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,070
from what he was three years ago.

555
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,750
He looks more moderate.

556
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,850
Yes, but outwardly.

557
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,230
There’s something

558
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:07,210
that can’t be effaced by time.

559
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,790
When you can distinguish your priorities

560
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,820
and stand firm,

561
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:22,530
you will accomplish more

562
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,590
than your grandfather.

563
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,160
Aye.

564
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,590
You freaked me out.

565
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,710
Brother.

566
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,100
What are you doing?

567
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,310
Why are you staring blankly?

568
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,710
Thinking over something, aren’t you?

569
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,710
Will Yan Xun

570
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,670
be in danger?

571
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,550
What danger?

572
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,820
I’ve been dreaming these days

573
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,180
that someone tries to kill him.

574
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,130
You have

575
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:12,550
unnecessary concerns.

576
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,050
They’re not unnecessary concerns!

577
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,670
The three-year period is due.

578
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,290
You know

579
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:20,480
what happened that year.

580
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,570
He has too many enemies.

581
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:25,590
Those guys won’t let him

582
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,310
return to Yanbei safely.

583
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,270
What can we do, then?

584
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,640
Father has ordered Yuwen Yue

585
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,640
to strictly watch over

586
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,330
the Oriole Courtyard.

587
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,750
He can guard there for a while,

588
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,350
but not forever.

589
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,590
It can’t be a long-time plan.

590
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,550
I’m a princess,

591
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,390
but I can do nothing to help him.

592
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,370
Chun.

593
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,570
That is

594
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,470
what worries you?

595
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,060
This is not your fault.

596
00:36:58,610 --> 00:36:59,960
You live in the palace

597
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,390
and you can hardly help much.

598
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,830
But last night,

599
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,930
I thought about it carefully

600
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,610
and I got a wonderful idea.

601
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,080
What is it?

602
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,040
Guess.

603
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,220
I won’t.

604
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:20,420
If you don’t tell me,

605
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,550
I won’t just listen.

606
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,070
Fine. Fine. Fine.

607
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,690
I can’t guess it.

608
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,090
Please tell me, my dear sister.

609
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,300
Brother,

610
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,620
if Yan Xun

611
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,890
becomes my husband,

612
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,320
no one can bully him,

613
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,650
can they?

614
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,470
You didn’t think about that last night.

615
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,630
You thought about that

616
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,160
for half of your life.

617
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,290
I’m...

618
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,760
I’m serious.

619
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,370
Think carefully about that.

620
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,860
This is the last chance.

621
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:08,890
After he marries me,

622
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,540
he’ll be safe.

623
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,720
Then let me tell you carefully.

624
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:15,120
There is little chance that

625
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,900
Yan Xun will marry you.

626
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,060
Father won’t allow it, firstly.

627
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,790
Do you have a better plan?

628
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:23,870
You don’t, do you?

629
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,780
Then you should support me.

630
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,880
Chun!

631
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,470
You mustn’t

632
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,670
tell Father about it!

633
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:32,680
Or he will think

634
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,870
Yan Xun asked you to say that!

635
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,570
He will be in more trouble!

636
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:37,750
Chun!

637
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,920
Greetings, Mother.

638
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,980
Are you bringing me

639
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,220
the Propitious Cloud Painting
of Zhang Sengyao?

640
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,530
Such paintings by painters in palaces

641
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,330
don’t look as lively.

642
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,910
Mother,

643
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,930
I forgot that.

644
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,350
Later I’ll ask Caiwei

645
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,080
to bring it to you.

646
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,680
But today,

647
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,140
I bring you another gift.

648
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:15,440
This is the most popular beauty cream

649
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,120
in Chang’an City.

650
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,490
I hear it’s made from secret ingredients.

651
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:21,390
Mother, have a try.

652
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,200
Put it away.

653
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,030
Aye.

654
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:29,030
I want you,

655
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,170
the most beautiful woman of our nation,

656
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,430
to stay young and beautiful

657
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,830
all your life.

658
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,170
Mother, why are you engrossed

659
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,680
in drawing pictures these days?

660
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,050
Chun, you’re no longer young.

661
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,500
I will be worried

662
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,730
if someone else draws
the Propitious Cloud Painting

663
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,640
for your wedding.

664
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,890
Mother,

665
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,910
you’ve been drawing for a long time.

666
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,070
Take a rest.

667
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,560
Or your eyes will be tired.

668
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,210
Besides,

669
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:03,090
I’m in no hurry to get married.

670
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,480
The other day, Head Eunuch Wang said

671
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,830
the Crown Prince of Liang
would come to Chang’an.

672
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,280
Your father wants to marry you

673
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,780
to him.

674
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,460
What?

675
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,290
You’re the only princess

676
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,390
to get married.

677
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,780
How can I not be worried?

678
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,670
Marry the Crown Prince of Liang?

679
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,250
Mother, I don’t think

680
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,920
you want me to marry
to such a distant place.

681
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,700
I don’t want to leave you, Mother.

682
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:37,580
Distance is not so important.

683
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,040
However, the Crown Prince of Liang

684
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,390
has been known as a notorious playboy.

685
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,530
He seeks carnal pleasures in his palace

686
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,430
even before he gets married.

687
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:50,640
Stubborn as you are,

688
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,830
you can’t tolerate that.

689
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,920
That’s right, Mother.

690
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,490
I don’t want great wealth

691
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,480
or strong power.

692
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:01,870
I just want to be like Princess Mingzhen

693
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:03,220
of the previous dynasty.

694
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,640
She married

695
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,550
a mere official,

696
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,020
but they loved each other

697
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,680
and never left each other.

698
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:17,330
I’m glad to hear it.

699
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,420
The theft in the Imperial Mausoleum

700
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,000
only showed the tip of the iceberg.

701
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,050
It is a fact that

702
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,880
Wei Guang deceived everyone

703
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,720
and extorted the hard-won possession
of our people.

704
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,310
As long as His Majesty wants
to investigate him,

705
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,080
he is bound to die.

706
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:44,590
I’m afraid His Majesty wants to warn him

707
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:45,840
with our help.

708
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,740
We must hit the pain point of him.

709
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:51,130
He can’t get away with it

710
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,270
if we get the key evidence.

711
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,990
His Majesty

712
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:55,920
wants balance,

713
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,000
only when

714
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,130
his own interests are not harmed.

715
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,960
This is a ﻿Spy Token.

716
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,190
It corresponds with a person

717
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,420
whom I placed

718
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,950
around Wei Guang.

719
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:10,690
Use it.

720
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,630
Young Master.

721
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,710
Be cautious.

722
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:40,340
Aye.

723
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,070
My Lord.

724
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,720
According to the survey,

725
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,690
walls of the underground palace
have been seriously damaged.

726
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:56,860
Part of the southern wall has collapsed

727
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,350
and blocked the dike,

728
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:00,080
making the East Tomb and West Tomb

729
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,070
be sinking in water.

730
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:03,630
The fire only burnt some buildings

731
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,250
outside the underground palace.

732
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:08,670
The inside was untouched.

733
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:10,040
However,

734
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,310
water leaking is still obvious.

735
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:14,300
My Lord.

736
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,710
Master Liu Shen with the Ministry of Works

737
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:17,800
has been dismissed.

738
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,400
Several contractors were also

739
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,650
thrown in prison

740
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,250
of Chang’an Office.

741
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,770
Yuwen Yue’s men are guarding them.

742
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,580
Don’t worry, My Lord.

743
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:30,820
They don’t dare to say anything.

744
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,430
I doubt

745
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:36,100
if Yan Xun is behind it.

746
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,800
Go to the black market

747
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,230
and check who sold the funeral objects.

748
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:45,850
As long as you find anything,

749
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:48,470
we can destroy Yan Xun.
