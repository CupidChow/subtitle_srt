16

Go to the black market

17
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,740
and check who sold the funeral objects.

18
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,790
As long as you find anything,

19
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,220
we can destroy Yan Xun.

20
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,960
We must get rid of him with one strike,

21
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,530
or there’ll be trouble.

22
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,040
Compared to his father,

23
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,590
Yan Xun is much smarter.

24
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,010
Last time, we disturbed His Majesty.

25
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,500
We shall not take rash actions
in Chang’an.

26
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,950
But we can do something

27
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,430
in Yanbei and Xianyang.

28
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,870
I see.

29
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,600
Master, you spent a lot of money

30
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,070
buying firms in Xianyang.

31
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,630
This is the account of this month.

32
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,820
Please go through it.

33
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,800
Xianyang Chamber of Commerce

34
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,900
has more power

35
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,240
than we thought.

36
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,610
We must

37
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,510
spend more money

38
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,950
if we want to strike it down.

39
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,760
Master,

40
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,390
will we use the tax

41
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,790
from Yanbei?

42
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:51,740
We can’t!

43
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,870
Moreover,

44
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,130
we must immediately put back

45
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,760
what we used.

46
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,470
If there’s not enough money, use our own.

47
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,080
And take some money out from every firm.

48
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,500
In the very moment,

49
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,020
we mustn’t be caught out

50
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,520
in case there’s unnecessary trouble.

51
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,490
I see.

52
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,330
Leave me.

53
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,380
- Aye.
- Aye.

54
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,890
Shuye, stay.

55
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,610
Let him leave as well.

56
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,890
Uncle, he is deaf.

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,180
He can’t hear anything.

58
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,110
I can’t

59
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,760
say it

60
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,730
to anyone,

61
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,670
but you.

62
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,750
Out.

63
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:06,460
= Qingzi Hall =

64
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,960
Uncle.

65
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,010
Shuye.

66
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,920
How have I treated you these years?

67
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,370
You taught me and enlightened me,

68
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,970
just like my father.

69
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,910
You don’t like many things

70
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,160
our family has done.

71
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,520
But you can’t stand by

72
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,930
when our family is in trouble.

73
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,310
Uncle,

74
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,100
what happened?

75
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,190
Minister Liu was punished

76
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,430
for the Imperial Mausoleum case,
wasn’t he?

77
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,840
All kinds of sins

78
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,830
such as corruption, cliquing,

79
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,490
and even official position selling

80
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,190
will not

81
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,030
destroy our family.

82
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,300
Over centuries,

83
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,160
all powerful families

84
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,840
have skeletons in their cupboards.

85
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,940
His Majesty knows that.

86
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,190
Then,

87
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,930
what do we do?

88
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,700
I have kept something in my mind

89
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,400
for a long time.

90
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,850
A slight error in my thought
resulted in a big mistake.

91
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,020
I extremely regret it.

92
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,180
What?

93
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,070
Uncle,

94
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,680
how could you do this?

95
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,560
I just had a wrong thought.

96
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,190
I thought my plan was perfect.

97
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,580
Nobody would find it out.

98
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,190
I didn’t expect things to be like this.

99
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,270
Uncle, there are

100
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,790
no perfect plans in this world.

101
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,670
Now,

102
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,710
we must take out the tripod

103
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:52,620
from the coffin immediately.

104
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,340
Your grandfather was laid to rest.

105
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,550
How can we take out his coffin

106
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,870
and disturb him?

107
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,950
Our family is in great trouble!

108
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,100
If Grandfather knew,

109
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,480
he wouldn’t ever rest.

110
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,270
There is another solution.

111
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,670
Besides you and me,

112
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,480
only another person knows about it.

113
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,630
If we kill him,

114
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,290
nobody else in this world

115
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,310
will know.

116
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,660
Who?

117
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,960
Liu Shen, Minister of Works.

118
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,610
Your Excellency.

119
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,500
Thank you for your hard work.

120
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,000
Young Master.

121
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,450
Liu Shen?

122
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,260
He was sent back to his hometown,

123
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,400
wasn’t he?

124
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,410
He worked for Wei Guang.

125
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,690
He was also the scapegoat

126
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,760
for the Imperial Mausoleum case.

127
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,740
What is

128
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,520
the important item

129
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,600
you just talked about?

130
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,200
I stood too far away

131
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,120
and they talked in a low voice.

132
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,690
I didn’t hear that clearly.

133
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,390
Anyway, it is something
of great significance.

134
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,820
Forget it.

135
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,110
The key is Liu Shen.

136
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,660
He has something

137
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,030
that can

138
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,110
put Wei Guang to death.

139
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,150
Where is he?

140
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,520
He was involved
in the Imperial Mausoleum case

141
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,750
and was just dismissed yesterday.

142
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,970
I had spies watch over him.

143
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,310
He has been packing up his stuff.

144
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,250
I’m afraid he’s running away.

145
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,030
His family is very powerful
in the southwest.

146
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,920
If he returns home,

147
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,390
we will have no chance to get him.

148
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,400
I’ll go stop him.

149
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,010
Don’t let him run away.

150
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,470
Aye.

151
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,780
Uncle.

152
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,430
Everything is ready.

153
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,060
Be cautious.

154
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,260
Don’t worry, Uncle.

155
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,280
Who are you?

156
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,020
Bandits?

157
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,400
Thieves?

158
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,750
You are minions of Wei Guang!

159
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,830
You know what?

160
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,790
My father is Liu Yi, King of Southwest.

161
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,470
If you dare to hurt me,

162
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,960
you will suffer.

163
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,580
Kill him.

164
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,910
Where do you think you can run?

165
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,570
Who...

166
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,270
Who on earth are you?

167
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,590
Don’t kill me! Don’t kill me!

168
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,220
Don’t kill me! Don’t kill me!

169
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,790
It’s you?

170
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,790
Just leave.

171
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,230
You... You...

172
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:37,980
Behave yourself!

173
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,590
How could you let him go?

174
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,550
What are you doing?

175
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:42,480
You are wounded?

176
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,290
Get off me!

177
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,150
Get off.

178
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:45,970
Don’t struggle.

179
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,220
I know it hurts.

180
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,160
But I need to wrap it up.

181
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,390
Get off me!

182
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,110
No!

183
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,950
Yuwen Yue, since when

184
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,320
were you cheeky?

185
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,930
Since always. Didn’t you know?

186
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,410
When I count to three, let go of me.

187
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,830
Count to a hundred

188
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,120
and I’ll be finished.

189
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,540
He’s right! It’s finished soon.

190
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,960
Let’s just hit the road quickly.

191
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,310
Wish us good luck.

192
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,950
Wish us good luck. Good luck.

193
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,170
Let’s go.

194
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,200
Let’s hurry...

195
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,440
What are you doing?

196
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,620
He’s too annoying.

197
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,190
If you are annoying as well,

198
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,590
I’ll also knock you down like that.

199
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,870
I’ll take him away.

200
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,540
You know,

201
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,320
he should go with me.

202
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,800
Why do you think

203
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,730
he should go with you?

204
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,630
His Majesty sent you?

205
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,680
You stole the wooden Buddha statue

206
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,190
from the Imperial Mausoleum,

207
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,120
didn’t you?

208
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,580
Everything has been

209
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,490
under your control.

210
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,840
What else would you like to ask?

211
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,430
Since you knew everything,

212
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,370
why didn’t you expose us?

213
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,320
Because of you.

214
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,000
Oh, I see.

215
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,920
I guess you also want to take the chance

216
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,020
and get ride off Wei Guang.

217
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:10,990
Am I right?

218
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,610
If it makes you happy

219
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:14,940
to discuss this,

220
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,370
I could chat with you for a while.

221
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,620
When did that happen?

222
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,370
They have already got into the city.

223
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,410
I’m afraid

224
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,840
they have arrived
at the gate of the Palace.

225
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,350
Did you see it clearly?

226
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,850
Was Liu Shen really among them?

227
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,870
Absolutely.

228
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,120
What are you doing, Your Grace?

229
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:08,440
For Minister Wei?

230
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,280
I hear that all his families
will be killed.

231
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,990
There’ll be fun to see at Jiuyou Platform.

232
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,410
Show some respect!

233
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,090
Wenshan.

234
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:19,540
Shut up.

235
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,240
Aye.

236
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,110
Please get up, Your Grace.

237
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,630
His Majesty asked you
to go back to your own palace.

238
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,490
I have served His Majesty

239
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:40,680
for so many years.

240
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,840
And I kind of know

241
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,410
how he thinks.

242
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,250
He still cares for you

243
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,260
and doesn’t want you to get hurt.

244
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,110
But he can’t see you right now.

245
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:54,530
Under such circumstances,
nothing will help.

246
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,020
Yeah, Your Grace.

247
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,350
You should take care of yourself.

248
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,410
The coming days would be long.

249
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,660
Sir,

250
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,490
please give this hairpin to His Majesty.

251
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,320
This was the gift from him

252
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,800
for my first birthday

253
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,150
after I came into the Palace.

254
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,800
Please rest assured, Your Grace.

255
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,670
I will give it to His Majesty.

256
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,620
= Secret Person =

257
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,360
Uncle.

258
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,980
I’m too old

259
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,360
to keep working for His Majesty.

260
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:49,300
This is my own mistake.

261
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,770
None of my families are involved.

262
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,480
Minister Wei.

263
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,090
You want to bear every responsibility

264
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,360
on your own.

265
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,500
Do you think His Majesty would believe it

266
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,540
when you sacrifice yourself
for your family?

267
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,870
Wei Shuye.

268
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,380
Go to see His Majesty with me

269
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,190
to testify against your uncle.

270
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:18,550
But...

271
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,590
Only in this way

272
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,840
can you defend some of your families.

273
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,050
Please accept my bowing.

274
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,290
Don’t bother.

275
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,030
I’m not doing this for you.

276
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,560
Wei Shuye is not

277
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,900
cunning or greedy.

278
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,120
He shouldn’t pay

279
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,860
for what you have done.

280
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,380
Shuye.

281
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,570
Go see His Majesty

282
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:00,920
with General Yuwen,

283
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,010
and point out all the crimes

284
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,950
I have done.

285
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,950
Uncle, you raised me up.

286
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,310
Now, you are in the trouble,

287
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,430
I would like to die with you!

288
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,430
We need male offspring for our family.

289
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,960
This is all we can do now.

290
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,950
Could you be hardhearted enough

291
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,070
to see the whole family exterminated?

292
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,180
Shuye, I’m begging you.

293
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,930
Uncle.

294
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:56,720
By increasing tax in Yanbei secretly,

295
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,090
you alone have embezzled

296
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,270
one million taels of gold.

297
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,760
It’s enough to support people in Yanbei

298
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,830
for half a year.

299
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,080
Just explain it to me.

300
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,610
I deserve to be hacked to death

301
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,940
for what I’ve done.

302
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,850
How dare you

303
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,070
put the White Jade Tripod
of the late emperor

304
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,230
into your ancestral grave!

305
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:36,180
Did you want to take my throne?

306
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,230
I should even kill your whole family!

307
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,510
Your Majesty, I got back
the White Jade Tripod

308
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,830
and the secret account book

309
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,750
because Wei Shuye cooperated

310
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,410
with me.

311
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,620
Please check it out, Your Majesty.

312
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,260
Wei Guang took bribes.

313
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,220
He also meddled in Yanbei

314
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,430
and disturbed our nation.

315
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,360
His rebellion couldn’t be forgiven.

316
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,950
Execute him immediately!

317
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,500
However, Wei Shuye placed righteousness
above family loyalty

318
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,940
and made contributions.

319
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,940
He will take charge of the Wei family.

320
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,760
Half of their lands and soldiers

321
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,710
will be deprived

322
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,020
as a warning to others.

323
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,750
Leave me.

324
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:33,140
Thank you, Your Majesty!

325
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,370
Please forgive me, Your Grace.

326
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,780
You had no choice,

327
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,110
but to take the order of His Majesty.

328
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:14,820
Besides,

329
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,310
my brother deserved that.

330
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,620
You saved Shuye

331
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,410
so that our family was defended.

332
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,750
You don’t need to ask for forgiveness.

333
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,470
You may rise.

334
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,570
Thank you, Your Grace.

335
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,210
Now, my maternal clan is greatly weakened.

336
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,770
Shuye is as pure

337
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,350
and ignorant

338
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,810
as Yuan Song and Yuan Chun.

339
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:03,200
I hope you’ll give advice to him

340
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,300
and take care of him.

341
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,940
I will try my best.

342
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:15,890
The princess has come.

343
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,960
Shuye.

344
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:19,860
Your Highness.

345
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,020
Please get up.

346
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,840
My mother asked me to visit you.

347
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,210
My uncle was so muddled

348
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,750
that he did such a big crime

349
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,960
and ended up like that.

350
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,390
Luckily, you and your mother

351
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,230
haven’t been involved.

352
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,150
It has already happened.

353
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,230
Don’t say that.

354
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,830
Today is the execution day.

355
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,920
I hear you are not allowed to go outside.

356
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,230
Don’t be too sad.

357
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,830
My brother has sent guards

358
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,700
to get everything ready

359
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,800
in the prison.

360
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,710
I don’t think

361
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,390
Uncle will suffer during the execution.

362
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,010
Thank you, Your Highness.

363
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,950
You’re welcome.

364
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,570
Luckily,

365
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,520
my father didn’t

366
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,630
blame you.

367
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,130
He even asked you

368
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:07,520
to take charge of the Wei family.

369
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,630
Learn to be smart

370
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,940
and don’t do anything stupid again.

371
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:13,940
Okay.

372
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,520
It’s already noon, isn’t it?

373
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,380
Wei Guang must have been executed.

374
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,670
He didn’t suffer.

375
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,290
How lucky he was!

376
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:30,750
On such a happy day,

377
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,310
I’d like some alcohol.

378
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,730
There’s some in the kitchen.

379
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,780
I’ll go get some for you.

380
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:46,870
Just kidding.

381
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,870
= Oriole Courtyard =
His Majesty says,

382
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,710
= Imperial Edict =
the nation has civil and martial virtues.

383
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:02,840
Military commanders are ridgepoles
of the nation

384
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,840
and the mainstays of the government.

385
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,590
So, I promote talented persons

386
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,410
based on their ability
instead of background.

387
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:13,080
Chu Qiao, you’re well versed
in culture and martial arts.

388
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,670
You have both talent and virtue.

389
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,480
And you’re loyal to you master and me.

390
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,710
You can be a good example for other ladies.

391
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:23,160
I’m now making you the archery coach

392
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,900
for Cavalry Battalion.

393
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,020
I hope you’ll work hard

394
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,480
and devote yourself to our nation

395
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,620
so that you won’t let me down.

396
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,030
Respect this.

397
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,210
An assignment just in time.

398
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,550
Now, Cavalry Battalion is

399
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,950
under control of Prince Xiang.

400
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,540
And Yuwen Yue.

401
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,570
Cavalry Battalion is a massive force
in Chang’an.

402
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,060
Most of the soldiers are sons
from powerful local families

403
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:57,060
who compete fiercely in different groups.

404
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,820
Usually a noble prince

405
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,010
takes charge.

406
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,370
Prince Xiang is such a noble prince

407
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,810
with military exploits.

408
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,210
He can then control

409
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,350
such unruly commanders and soldiers.

410
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,130
However,

411
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,260
men dominate the army.

412
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,130
When you command the men

413
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,220
as a girl,

414
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,490
it is a tough job.

415
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,190
I am the thorn in His Majesty’s flesh

416
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,270
and he hates me most.

417
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,200
A lot of people will take the chance

418
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,740
to crush me and satisfy him.

419
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:30,600
I really worry about your job.

420
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,140
But we don’t have a choice.

421
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,980
We can’t disobey his order, can we?

422
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,860
Besides, if you hadn’t mentioned that,

423
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,740
I would have forgotten

424
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,600
I was a girl.

425
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,950
Don’t you trust my ability?

426
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,810
Don’t worry. I’ll be fine.

427
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,840
If anything happens,

428
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,080
let me know.

429
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,330
We are no longer what we were

430
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,340
three years ago.

431
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,730
If I can’t even protect you,

432
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,730
my suffering over the past three years

433
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,020
will be pointless.

434
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,130
That’s just the Cavalry Battalion.

435
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:10,970
Let’s go

436
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,610
and see what they can do.

437
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,080
Get out of the way!

438
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,040
Your Highness,

439
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,270
the new archery coach has arrived.

440
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,220
Do you really need to bother me

441
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,520
with such tiny stuff?

442
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,160
Just bring him to the camp.

443
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,090
It’s the archery coach

444
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,090
His Majesty assigned personally.

445
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:02,550
That woman.

446
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,250
Bring her in.

447
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:05,900
Aye.

448
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,870
Your Highness, Ms. Chu has arrived.

449
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,040
I am Chu Qiao.

450
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,420
Greetings, Your Highness.

451
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,700
You may rise.

452
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,210
Aye.

453
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,890
You are Chu Qiao?

454
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,130
I am.

455
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,910
I have heard a lot about you.

456
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,830
At the banquet,

457
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,060
you really impressed me.

458
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,890
You are as strong as a man.

459
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,700
So many people were around

460
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,360
that I didn’t have the chance
to talk to you.

461
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,930
I didn’t expect to

462
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,810
work with you in the same place.

463
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:51,290
You flatter me, Your Highness.

464
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,870
I hear when people in Yanbei rebelled

465
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,660
and His Excellency Yan Xun was punished
with his families,

466
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,980
you stayed with him,

467
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,810
protecting him and taking care of him.

468
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:05,860
We are both homeless.

469
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,850
We just relied on each other.

470
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,700
His Excellency is a noble man.

471
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,760
It’s my honor

472
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,620
when he doesn’t hate my humble identity.

473
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:18,720
What a loyal woman you are!

474
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,910
No wonder Father sent you

475
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,160
to my camp.

476
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,480
We didn’t have a female official

477
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,660
like the Southern Dynasty did.

478
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:32,180
But you’re the first female commander

479
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,240
in an army.

480
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,830
I’m grateful for the great kindness
of His Majesty.

481
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,430
That is

482
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,750
Broken Rainbow?

483
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,020
Yes.

484
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,030
Your Highness.

485
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,100
= Your Highness, assign Chu Qiao
to Xiuli Army =

486
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,440
A troop in my camp happens

487
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,580
to need an archery coach.

488
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,780
Go and work hard.

489
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,410
If you have any problem,

490
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,490
just come to me.

491
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,730
Take her away.

492
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,590
Aye.

493
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:19,560
Thank you, Your Highness.

494
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,730
Somebody!

495
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:33,300
Aye.

496
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,150
Bring me General Yuwen Yue.

497
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,190
Aye.

498
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,350
Xue Zhileng,

499
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,460
you think torturing me

500
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,480
can make me beg for mercy?

501
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,340
Kill me if you dare!

502
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,740
He Xiao, want to die?

503
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,590
I’ll help you!

504
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,770
Commander.

505
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,150
He was so wrathful

506
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,470
that he spoke without thinking.

507
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,930
Please be generous

508
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,360
and let him go.

509
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,250
Commander Xue.

510
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,930
You don’t need
to execute Deputy Commander He.

511
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,060
Please spare him!

512
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,580
What are you doing?

513
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,220
Stand up!

514
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,220
Stand up and attention!

515
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,710
He Xiao shook the morale of the army

516
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:18,400
and intended to rebel.

517
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,970
I shall sentence him to death

518
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,220
for his running away in the battle!

519
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,260
Execute him now!

520
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:25,970
Wait!

521
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,910
Who are you?

522
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,030
How dare you stop me!

523
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,140
I am Chu Qiao,
the archery coach for Cavalry Battalion,

524
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,990
appointed by His Majesty.

525
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,080
Under Prince Xiang’s order,

526
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,360
I come to report for duty.

527
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:56,270
Since so,

528
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,080
why must you interfere with this?

529
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,170
Do you know what crime he committed?

530
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,340
How dare you stop us!

531
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,350
I am sorry.

532
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
When I just came

533
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,930
to you,

534
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,150
I saw soldiers kneel

535
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,140
and beg for you.

536
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:14,170
I just wonder what crime he committed.

537
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,220
He is a general of our nation,

538
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,390
but he always talks about going back home.

539
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,720
Isn’t he

540
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,910
shaking the morale of the army?

541
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,000
Commander Xue.

542
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:26,860
When you want to kill me,

543
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,790
don’t bother to find any excuse!

544
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,210
Just do it!

545
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,460
Commander Xue, you’d better not

546
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,240
jump to conclusion.

547
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,630
Why don’t you

548
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:37,640
report it to the General first?

549
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,990
I am managing my own soldiers.

550
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,080
There is no need to bother the General.

551
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,190
But he isn’t

552
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,410
an ordinary soldier.

553
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,320
He is the Deputy Commander
of Cavalry Battalion

554
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,150
and a general of Xiuli Army.

555
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,200
Xiuli Army is an important force

556
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,010
to guard Chang’an.

557
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,610
I wonder

558
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:56,950
since when they were

559
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:57,820
your own soldiers.

560
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,460
You!

561
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,600
You should report it

562
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,910
to Prince Xiang and General Yuwen first.

563
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,460
Ms. Chu.

564
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,640
You’re standing up for him?

565
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,000
Not really.

566
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,390
I’ve just come to work.

567
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,880
If someone is killed,

568
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,220
it will look rather unlucky.

569
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,270
If you insist on

570
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,620
executing him,

571
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,080
I have to leave

572
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,770
and tell Prince Xiang about it

573
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,660
so that he’ll decide.

574
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,380
Fine.

575
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:33,880
I won’t kill him, for your sake.

576
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,380
Thank you, Commander Xue.

577
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,060
Let’s go!

578
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:53,910
You wanted to see me?

579
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,410
Since when did you

580
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,690
take the duty

581
00:33:58,690 --> 00:33:59,530
on personnel assignment?

582
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,630
I am the Deputy Commander.

583
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,030
It is my duty to do

584
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,650
personnel assignment and work allocation.

585
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,840
Your duty?

586
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,150
You are indeed very responsible.

587
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,310
How could I not know it before?

588
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,980
If you have nothing else to say, I’ll go.

589
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:15,840
Wait.

590
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,090
I’ve got something to ask.

591
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:31,030
Do you really adore her?

592
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,470
I really have something to say. Come back!

593
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,290
Your Highness, are you angry?

594
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,760
Of course not!

595
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:43,240
Why does the Vice Commander Yuwen

596
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,120
like Ms. Chu

597
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,850
so much?

598
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,790
A woman always suffers

599
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,380
in the army.

600
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,900
Bullying and humiliation

601
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,500
happen all the time.

602
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,400
Think of our battalion.

603
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,670
Every soldier comes

604
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,570
from a powerful family.

605
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,180
How will she survive

606
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:01,710
as a mere woman

607
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,910
who just got rid of slavery?

608
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,020
Throughout the battalion,

609
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,840
only Xiuli Army

610
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,460
will be under her control

611
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,460
because they come from Yanbei,

612
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,370
they have been excluded

613
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,800
and they feel guilty for Yan Xun.

614
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,160
When Yuwen Yue puts her

615
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,140
in Xiuli Army,

616
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,460
isn’t he caring for her?

617
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:22,050
You make sense, Your Highness.

618
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,390
I am afraid

619
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,740
his efforts will be wasted

620
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,670
in the end.

621
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,800
Commander,

622
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,360
she was the girl

623
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,390
who stood beside His Excellency Yan Xun

624
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,210
at Jiuyou Platform?

625
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:43,850
Of course.

626
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,520
She has been with His Excellency
at the Oriole Courtyard

627
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,630
for all these years.

628
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,820
She became famous

629
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,930
in the fight against Princess Zhama

630
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:49,770
in the hunting field.

631
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:50,480
His Majesty appointed her

632
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,800
to be an archery

633
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,990
at our battalion.

634
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,480
She is the first female commander

635
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,590
in the history of our nation.

636
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,900
She is well-known across the nation.

637
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,250
Then, she must have the chance

638
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,180
to talk to His Excellency.

639
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,460
If...

640
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,690
If she can explain for us...

641
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,900
Will you get real?

642
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,470
I’m getting real.

643
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,310
She just helped us.

644
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,870
It means she isn’t hostile towards us.

645
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,310
It’s her first day here

646
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,770
and is just assigned to us.

647
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:13,880
I don’t think

648
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,180
she even knows who we are.

649
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:16,790
In no way can we

650
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,740
clear our imputation.

651
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,470
We can’t count on her.

652
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,570
Let’s wait and see.
When she knows who we are,

653
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:23,380
we will live

654
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,120
a harder life.

655
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,170
I haven’t gone back home for three years.

656
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:29,040
I’ve written hundreds of letters to them,

657
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,560
but I never heard a word from them.

658
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,070
I wonder

659
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:34,880
how my parents are doing.

660
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,240
My newly-wed wife

661
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,080
was pregnant

662
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,260
when I left home.

663
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,230
I don’t even know
whether I have a son or a daughter.

664
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,570
Don’t think too much.

665
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,240
Ms. Chu, you come to see me?

666
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,460
He Xiao, are you alright?

667
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,910
I am fine, Ms. Chu.

668
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,990
This is the best ﻿Healing Elixir.
Here you are.

669
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:20,600
Thank you, Ms. Chu.

670
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:23,550
By the way,

671
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,490
how did you know me?

672
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:28,400
In Chang’an, there are not many people

673
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,080
from Yanbei.

674
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,410
I know you, without doubt.

675
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,620
I not only know you, He Xiao.

676
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,080
I also know you, Ge Qi

677
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:37,830
and Wu Danyu.

678
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,720
You belonged to Xiuli Army from Yanbei

679
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,140
and you were subordinates of Liu Ziye.

680
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,620
Take care.

681
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,620
Thank you, Ms. Chu.

682
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,340
Why haven’t you slept yet?

683
00:37:59,140 --> 00:37:59,950
Mr. Chu.

684
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:03,860
I can’t sleep.

685
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,160
Me, neither.

686
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,590
Did I disturb you?

687
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,190
No.

688
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,650
I know a friend

689
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:15,960
who also likes playing Hichiriki.

690
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:19,780
Who?

691
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,070
His Excellency Yan Xun.

692
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,020
Do people from Yanbei

693
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,420
all like playing it?

694
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,040
It is a music instrument in the army.

695
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,000
My father taught me

696
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,250
how to play it.

697
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,880
I guess

698
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,450
Marquis Dingbei taught him.

699
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,810
You come from Yanbei.

700
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,320
It’s been three years

701
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,310
since you came, right?

702
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,030
Two years, eight months,
and twenty-one days, specifically.

703
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:59,730
I am afraid

704
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:02,920
I can’t go back home even if I want.

705
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,310
Ever since that incident,

706
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,670
my elder brother expelled me.

707
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:13,520
My pregnant wife got out of Yanbei

708
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,120
to find me in Chang’an.

709
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,750
On her way, she was kidnapped by a bandit.

710
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,630
Knowing she was my wife,

711
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,230
he just killed her.

712
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,780
Unexpectedly,

713
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,690
he even became a hero

714
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:32,550
because of this.

715
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,250
He then surrendered to the government.

716
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,460
I hear he has become an official now.

717
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,020
Who is he?

718
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,560
He even killed a pregnant woman.

719
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,300
I shall kill him for you

720
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:49,700
whenever I have the chance.

721
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,790
But I am a traitor.

722
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,510
So what?

723
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,420
I am ashamed of myself.

724
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,610
Why didn’t you kill yourself?

725
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,640
Even your brother
cared for family reputation.

726
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,790
Your commander Liu Ziye

727
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,300
killed himself

728
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,240
by colliding to Xiuli Mountain.

729
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:10,550
What did you do, then?

730
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,080
Why did you choose to live?

731
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:17,440
I wanted to die!

732
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,440
But if I died,

733
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,430
what would happen to Xiuli Army?

734
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,850
They’re loyal to me

735
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:27,840
and we take care of each other.

736
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,270
Now we’re known as traitors,

737
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,550
out of no reason.

738
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:32,520
If I died,

739
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,110
who would defend them?

740
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,980
To me,

741
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,550
they are not only subordinates,

742
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,190
but also families.

743
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,700
It’s my duty to bring them back to Yanbei.

744
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:47,460
Even if we can’t go back,

745
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,740
I should at least make them

746
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,530
live a better life.

747
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,560
No matter how hard life could be,

748
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,260
I must carry on.

749
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,400
As a traitor,

750
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,590
aren’t you thinking too much?

751
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,590
Do you believe me?

752
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,060
If you do,

753
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:21,500
does it mean

754
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,720
His Excellency also believes me?

755
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,010
He?

756
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:28,020
He has lived in danger for years

757
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,340
since he lost all his families.

758
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:33,180
He has a target on his back.

759
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,840
The three-year period is almost due.

760
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,710
He doesn’t even know

761
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:38,690
how long he can live.

762
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,690
Does it matter

763
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,060
whether he believes you?

764
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,910
No one shall be blamed
for that incident alone.

765
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,150
Zhao Dongting tricked you to open the gate

766
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,180
with the Emperor’s order.

767
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:54,580
You didn’t have a choice.

768
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:56,820
But after people in Beishuo
were massacred,

769
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,950
Black Eagle Army of Yanbei

770
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,770
had a suicide attack

771
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:01,980
and all of them were killed.

772
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,080
Hongchuan Army of Yanbei

773
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,720
fought a bloody battle

774
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:08,230
until the last one of them died.

775
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,620
What about you?

776
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,950
You neglected your duty at first

777
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,690
so that Yanbei was lost

778
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:16,190
because of your stupidity.

779
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,430
Then you gave up your resistance,

780
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,530
and left Yanbei for Chang’an.

781
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,270
You have been living an ignoble life

782
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:23,070
for so many years.

783
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:25,240
Even if you didn’t mean

784
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,240
to betray Yanbei in old days,

785
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,170
three years have passed.

786
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:31,900
You’ve become real traitors

787
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,570
so far.

788
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,280
I sympathize with your experiences,

789
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,240
but I don’t agree with your choices.

790
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:44,550
Even if you endured hardships
to plan retaliation,

791
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,540
you need a goal.

792
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,960
Otherwise, you would be

793
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,300
living a real ignoble life.

794
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,490
What is your goal?

795
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,650
I can’t see that.

796
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,310
People need hope

797
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:04,130
and persistence.

798
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,270
Or what’s the difference

799
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:07,430
between them and dead guys?

800
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:10,560
We still have a long way to go.

801
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:12,880
You have enough time to think

802
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,060
about what you should do in the future.
