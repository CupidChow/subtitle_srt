16
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,170
Greetings, Father.

17
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,690
Greetings, Your Majesty.

18
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:44,920
You may rise.

19
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,060
Thank you, Your Majesty.

20
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,050
Thank you, Father.

21
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,740
Fighting bravely in the battle,

22
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,180
you defeated the many with the few
to repulse the strong enemy,

23
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,890
and showed our national prowess.

24
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,750
I’m very gratified to hear that.

25
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,260
Father, it’s my honor

26
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,130
to share your cares and burdens.

27
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,530
Good boy.

28
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,750
Yuwen Yue, I heard that

29
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,570
you saved Prince Xiang in the battle

30
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,220
regardless of your own life.

31
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,280
You’re indeed as brave as your father!

32
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,550
You flatter me, Your Majesty.

33
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,800
Prince Xiang is intelligent
and courageous.

34
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,540
He’s also proficient in the art of war.

35
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,890
Without him,

36
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,950
I would have died in the battle.

37
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,360
You don’t have to be modest.

38
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,780
The meritorious deserves rewards.

39
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,530
I now make you Deputy Commander
of Cavalry Battalion,

40
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:45,760
to assist Prince Xiang

41
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,420
and serve the country.

42
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,940
Thank you, Your Majesty.

43
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,080
Your Majesty, Yan Xun has arrived.

44
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,630
Let him in.

45
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,340
Your Majesty, I humbly wish you

46
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,930
all happiness and health.

47
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,830
You may rise.

48
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,720
Thank you, Your Majesty.

49
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,280
It’s been a long time.

50
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,230
How are you doing in the past two years?

51
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,550
Thanks to your blessing,

52
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,680
I’m all right.

53
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,660
At that year,

54
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,290
you were so reckless

55
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,240
that I let you stay in the courtyard
for introspection.

56
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,450
The deadline for three years
is drawing near.

57
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,640
Have you

58
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,400
controlled your temper?

59
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,270
Over the past three years,

60
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,630
I have introspected my fault
day and night,

61
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,770
and recalled your instructions.

62
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,310
Nowadays,

63
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,020
my fickleness has faded away

64
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,710
and I finally understand

65
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,870
your care for me.

66
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,980
I’m glad you understand.

67
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,110
You are not like your father.

68
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,950
You grew up in Chang’an since childhood,

69
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,670
and I have watched you.

70
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,190
At that year,

71
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,890
I punished you

72
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,670
because I wanted you to stay
in the courtyard,

73
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,940
reflect on yourself and study hard.

74
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,620
Now, you are the only one left

75
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,910
of your family.

76
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,200
I forgave you that year

77
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,980
because I had high expectations of you.

78
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,340
Since you have changed your temper,

79
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,160
from today on,

80
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,140
I’ll no longer lock you up.

81
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,650
You will have free access

82
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,490
to Chang’an.

83
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,350
I’m bestowing you the jade pendant

84
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,000
to show my willing.

85
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,350
Your Majesty,
I’ll offer my life in sacrifice

86
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,960
to repay your huge kindness.

87
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,850
All right. You may rise.

88
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,470
Fine. Today,

89
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,720
I’m calling all of you here

90
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,960
because I want to give you

91
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,090
one assignment.

92
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,770
What is it, Father?

93
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,870
Envoys of Rouran are having an audience.

94
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,530
I would like a hunting at the outskirts

95
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,870
to welcome them.

96
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,030
But the hunting field is so vast

97
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,710
that I’m afraid something may go wrong.

98
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,820
Who should I

99
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,670
trust my security with?

100
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,290
Father,

101
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,470
you can entrust Yuwen Yue with it.

102
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,950
He is very scrupulous

103
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,110
and will not let you down.

104
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,470
Yuwen Yue, what do you think?

105
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,960
I will surely not let you down.

106
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,900
That’s good, then.

107
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,900
It’s a deal.

108
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,560
Your Excellency, you’re much thinner
than before.

109
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,200
Your Highness, you’re as elegant
as before.

110
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,490
You had a hard time
fighting wars outside the Pass

111
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,840
in the last few years

112
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,090
while I just stayed in the capital city.

113
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,010
I haven’t got a chance

114
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,550
to show my appreciation in person.

115
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,060
And I also want to thank you

116
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,230
for submitting several memorials

117
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,030
to defend my father and Yanbei.

118
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,990
Misfortune tests the sincerity of friends.

119
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,070
I will remember your kindness

120
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,660
as long as I live.

121
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,340
You’re welcome, Your Excellency.

122
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,500
I didn’t help much.

123
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,160
Since my father

124
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,760
has already pardoned you,

125
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,790
I hope you can cheer yourself up

126
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,190
and work hard in the future.

127
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,080
I will always remember

128
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,410
His Majesty’s mercy and your benevolence.

129
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,040
Sir, please notify His Majesty.

130
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,490
I’ve got something important to tell him!

131
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:54,460
What is it

132
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,310
that makes you anxious?

133
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,370
The Imperial Mausoleum was on a big fire

134
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,440
last night.

135
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,420
General Zhao has arranged soldiers

136
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,440
from Cavalry Battalion
and Vanguard Battalion

137
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,200
to fight the fire.

138
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,270
But things are flammable
in such dry weather.

139
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,460
I’m afraid they couldn’t turn this around!

140
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,330
People with the Ministry of Punishments

141
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,920
have captured the Supervisor
of the Imperial Mausoleum,

142
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,080
Yuwen Huai.

143
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,240
Wait out there.

144
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,340
I’ll get in and tell His Majesty.

145
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,300
How dare anyone
put the Imperial Mausoleum on fire!

146
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,340
Your Highness.

147
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,890
What is it?

148
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,690
His Majesty wants you
to wait for a moment,

149
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,860
and he has something to tell you.

150
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,510
Your Excellency, we’ll talk later.

151
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,410
See you, Your Highness.

152
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,150
Your Excellency.

153
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,900
What do you want, General Yuwen?

154
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,280
Are you alright?

155
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,340
Is Xing’er alright?

156
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,280
Thank you for asking.

157
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,780
Everything is fine.

158
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,360
Greetings, Father.

159
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,640
You may rise.

160
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,150
Come on, stay with me for a while.

161
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,510
Thank you, Father.

162
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,310
Father.

163
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,420
We’re in a year of wars

164
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,790
filled with trouble and chaos.

165
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,550
I feel really gratified to see

166
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,560
that you have suppressed the rebellion

167
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,190
as the Deputy Commander.

168
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,010
Thank you, Father.

169
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,020
I didn’t just

170
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,280
pay a compliment to you.

171
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,580
I just have stated the facts.

172
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,160
Over the past hundreds of years,

173
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,570
it was often the case

174
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,840
that the old dynasty was replaced
with a new one.

175
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,940
I would feel worried

176
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,230
when anyone else has

177
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,310
the military power.

178
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:32,950
But you...

179
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,670
You’re my son.

180
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,730
The man I trust most.

181
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,510
Thank you, Father.

182
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,420
When I sentenced

183
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,320
Yan Shicheng,

184
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,440
everyone agreed with me,

185
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,390
except you and Yuwen Yue.

186
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,380
You had no relation with Yan Shicheng.

187
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,940
You also had a mere bowing acquaintance

188
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,220
with Yan Xun.

189
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,470
Then I realized

190
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,230
you were

191
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,660
the most loyal and considerate person

192
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,950
among them.

193
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,140
I was too young and naive.

194
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,140
Instead of helping you

195
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,310
to solve trouble,

196
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,980
I reported a few times to defend them.

197
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,790
I was terribly sorry.

198
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,200
This is why

199
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,560
I appreciate you!

200
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,130
You are honest

201
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,680
and straightforward.

202
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,340
Thank you, Father.

203
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,660
The Imperial Mausoleum was on fire.

204
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,950
I am so worried.

205
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,200
Now, you’ve made a triumphant return.

206
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,680
Finally,

207
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,020
I have someone who can help me.

208
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,880
I can at last

209
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,400
relax a bit.

210
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,750
Father, you are still vigorous.

211
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,710
You don’t need my help.

212
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,000
Besides,

213
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,570
my Third Brother, Fifth Brother,
and Thirteenth Brother

214
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,360
are all more capable than me.

215
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,110
When I manage

216
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,280
to come back

217
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,190
and learn from you,

218
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,790
I am indeed thrilled.

219
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,020
There is no need to humble yourself.

220
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,200
Among my sons,

221
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,800
you are excellent

222
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,320
and sensible.

223
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,190
Soldiers on the border

224
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,530
told me about that.

225
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,260
Without your bravery and talent

226
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,200
before you went out to battle,

227
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,580
they wouldn’t have won.

228
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,640
What you have achieved

229
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,340
is there for all to see.

230
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,620
When you’re back,

231
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,990
don’t let me down.

232
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,490
I shall do my best, Father.

233
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,000
Stand up.

234
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:51,820
Thank you, Father.

235
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,110
Long time no see.

236
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,590
How have you been doing?

237
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,570
You have asked already.

238
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,200
When many people were around in the hall,

239
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,830
I asked just to be polite.

240
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,510
Now, we’re alone.

241
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,630
I am asking from the bottom of my heart.

242
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,920
Everything is fine.

243
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,200
Thank you for asking.

244
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,150
I wrote letters to you
over the past two years.

245
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,940
Have you received them?

246
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,090
I was imprisoned in that courtyard

247
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,350
over the past two years

248
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,770
and life was boring.

249
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,590
But it doesn’t mean

250
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,050
I would read

251
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:53,840
whatever available.

252
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,440
I didn’t have a choice

253
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,450
for what happened that year.

254
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,050
When I received the news,

255
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,700
Marquis Dingbei had already died.

256
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,630
In order to save you,

257
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,530
- I had to…
- General.

258
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,150
Look.

259
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,940
Do you think the wind will make

260
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,380
the fire in the Imperial Mausoleum rage?

261
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,440
Although I’m known

262
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,680
as the Worst Idler in Chang’an,

263
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,320
it doesn’t mean

264
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,330
I am willing to sit down

265
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,730
and listen to you.

266
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,670
It is weird, though.

267
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,990
I knew

268
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,670
you had nothing special to say

269
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,220
but I was still curious.

270
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,520
I wished you would say something

271
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,090
I didn’t know.

272
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,090
Well,

273
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,520
why don’t you just take your side

274
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,010
and betray me

275
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,500
just like Zhao Xifeng and Yuwen Huai?

276
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,190
That would be better

277
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,810
than your hypocrisy.

278
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,810
You won the battle

279
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,520
and came back with honors.

280
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,570
You’ve also made friends with Prince Xiang

281
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,070
through life and death.

282
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,170
You are now an upstart

283
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,070
in Chang’an.

284
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,240
When a man like you

285
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,520
stays with a man like me,

286
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,000
people will gossip.

287
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,940
We’d better go back to our own places.

288
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,910
Xing’er isn’t dead.

289
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,750
She is with you, right?

290
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,840
What?

291
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,290
Want to kill her again?

292
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,340
= Oriole Courtyard =

293
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,580
You just walked back in.

294
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,550
Didn’t you fear Yuwen Yue would find you?

295
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,070
I met him in the Imperial Mausoleum.

296
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,650
We snatched each other’s sword

297
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,390
when we fought.

298
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,660
When I recognized him,

299
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,930
he recognized me as well.

300
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,730
Since he already knew I wasn’t dead,

301
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,820
why would I avoid him?

302
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,250
Yuwen Yue was in the Imperial Mausoleum?

303
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,980
He was probably visiting Yuwen Huai.

304
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,170
He noticed us

305
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,150
and then followed up.

306
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,510
Did he mention this

307
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,430
at court?

308
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:55,220
No, he pretended he knew nothing.

309
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,010
Yuan Che was furious after hearing this.

310
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,490
However, he didn’t say a word.

311
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,610
Compared to getting us killed,

312
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,390
he prefers to see Yuwen Huai die first.

313
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,900
Well, you know

314
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,800
he’s back now.

315
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,780
You must be more careful,

316
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,050
wherever you go.

317
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,000
He’s very scheming

318
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,590
and cruel.

319
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,050
He also knows us very well.

320
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,770
We must deal with him very carefully.

321
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,550
Everyone around us is an enemy.

322
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,090
He is no exception.

323
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,350
Oh, His Majesty ordered

324
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,240
that I should be no longer imprisoned here

325
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,060
and I should have free access to the city.

326
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,230
Really?

327
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,740
That’s awesome!

328
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,320
Don’t move.

329
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,880
It’s just flesh wound.
Haven’t you finished?

330
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,030
You should have cared more

331
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,910
for your appearance.

332
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,090
Few girls care so little
about their appearance

333
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,720
like you do.

334
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,470
If you continue to act this way,

335
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,030
no one will marry you.

336
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,290
I don’t want to get married, anyway.

337
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,320
Right.

338
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,070
You don’t need to worry about that.

339
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,200
What are you staring at?

340
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,680
You come straight to my place

341
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,090
after you leave the palace.

342
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,620
Are you deliberately telling everyone

343
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,290
we are partners now?

344
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,000
In my view,

345
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,700
no matter what we do or say,

346
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,070
people will assume we are partners.

347
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,070
Why don’t we just be straightforward?

348
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,650
Besides,

349
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,150
Father did not object to our partnership.

350
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,660
What are you afraid of?

351
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,350
Only Yuwen Huai is punished for the fire
in the Imperial Mausoleum?

352
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,630
This is the first imperial edict.

353
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,830
The Zhao family and Wei family

354
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,210
may not get away with it.

355
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,350
Is this why

356
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,140
His Majesty asked you to stay?

357
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,310
Of course not.

358
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,550
He also complimented me.

359
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,560
Do you believe him?

360
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,150
Why shouldn’t I?

361
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,790
I am his son

362
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,320
and I have made some achievements.

363
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,680
I deserve the compliment.

364
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,930
Sounds like

365
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,160
you still want to have battles

366
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,190
back at the border.

367
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,360
That’s good.

368
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,950
Chang’an isn’t
a comfortable place to stay.

369
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,330
Staying at the border will be better.

370
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,150
Look at you.

371
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,660
I’ve never managed

372
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,550
to hide anything from you.

373
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,820
My Third Brother is coming back.

374
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,300
Father ordered people

375
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,510
to rebuild his place.

376
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:37,100
He even hired workers and craftsmen

377
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,290
to build many new buildings.

378
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,320
Although he isn’t given

379
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,610
real military power as we were,

380
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,730
Father is treating him

381
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,340
very nicely.

382
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,870
Think about how he looked

383
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:48,610
when he left Chang’an

384
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,620
and how he behaved himself in the east

385
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,780
over the past two years.

386
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,750
If it weren’t for restraining you,

387
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,180
he would never come back to Chang’an

388
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,680
all his life.

389
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,300
Back then,

390
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,640
he and I were expelled

391
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,800
from Chang’an.

392
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,510
Now, he’ll come back after I do.

393
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,810
Looks like we’ll have no peace.

394
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,630
If you want peace,
you shouldn’t have come back.

395
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,560
Although “Chang’an” means peace,

396
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,090
there is the least peace in this city.

397
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,490
You know this.

398
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,050
Never mind.

399
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,120
We will find a way, whatever happens.

400
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,750
I was bad at scheming

401
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,150
so that I was tricked.

402
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,410
But with you around,

403
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,870
I don’t think

404
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,360
they can easily trick me again.

405
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,560
Oh, what do you think of the fire

406
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,880
in the Imperial Mausoleum?

407
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,200
What information have you got?

408
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,270
Nothing, for the moment.

409
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,800
Father is very worried about this.

410
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,400
If you can check it out soon,

411
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,610
he’ll certainly be satisfied.

412
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,190
Got it.

413
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,420
Good, Yue.

414
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,590
You didn’t let me down!

415
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,030
After experiencing the war,

416
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,630
you are getting calmer and steadier.

417
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,140
You flatter me, Grandfather.

418
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,070
I come back here today,

419
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,670
in the hope of activating
the Eye of Intel.

420
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:28,960
There is no rush.

421
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,850
The Eye of Intel is just a distraction.

422
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,870
Spies matter more than the system itself.

423
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,520
As long as we still have those spies,

424
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,060
the Eye of Intel

425
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,310
will regain its power someday.

426
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,350
Miss Yu has sold

427
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,220
those funeral objects

428
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,720
in the market.

429
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,440
We divided the objects
into a dozen groups.

430
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,680
Some of them will

431
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,870
get into the palace.

432
00:20:59,090 --> 00:20:59,960
By then,

433
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,210
when those funeral objects

434
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:01,660
which were immersed in water

435
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,060
are presented to His Majesty,

436
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,650
His Majesty will fly into a rage.

437
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,230
However,

438
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,970
it takes time.

439
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,700
Trade needs time.

440
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,870
It doesn’t matter.

441
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,770
The more naturally we sell them,
the more trustworthy they look.

442
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,030
In this case,

443
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,610
why don’t we

444
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,960
make a bigger trap?

445
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,600
Why did you cut it?

446
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,980
It’s worth a lot!

447
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,120
It is?

448
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,930
Of course!

449
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,230
It’s worth ten arrows,

450
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,600
twenty fine knives

451
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,750
and two pairs of horse armor.

452
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,290
All right. Tell Fengmian

453
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,440
not to send me any useless things

454
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,660
like this.

455
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,710
I don’t need any of them.

456
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,610
This isn’t for you.

457
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:47,530
It’s for His Majesty

458
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,910
at his birthday party.

459
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,020
How about giving him the root only?

460
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,210
Your Excellency. Miss Chu.

461
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:59,140
Time to have lunch.

462
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,400
I won’t have it!

463
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,470
Your Highness, have you met
His Excellency Yan Xun?

464
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,910
Yes, I have.

465
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,060
That’s fine, then.

466
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,790
He looks fine,

467
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,570
but not as vigorous as before.

468
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,450
He is a different person now.

469
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,560
He almost died.

470
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,900
Of course, he would change.

471
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,040
Sir,

472
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,920
what do you think of him now?

473
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:46,310
He used to be my old master.
I still care about him.

474
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,490
However,

475
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,800
I won’t forget

476
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,300
what I am now.

477
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,840
You mean?

478
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,300
If you want to get rid of him,

479
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,680
I won’t try to stop you.

480
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:11,210
It’s so cruel of you!

481
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,970
His Excellency is poor.

482
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,300
But ordinary people are innocent.

483
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,260
I know him better

484
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,680
than you do.

485
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,280
Since you know what he wants,

486
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,690
how would I not know?

487
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,860
We mustn’t let him go back to Yanbei.

488
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:42,170
His families were killed

489
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,780
out of no reason.

490
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,130
But now,

491
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,140
for our nation

492
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,890
and our people,

493
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,230
I won’t show any mercy

494
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,450
or set him free.

495
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,490
I’m afraid

496
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,980
General Yuwen doesn’t think so.

497
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,910
I hope he will come around sooner

498
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,710
in case

499
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,100
he betrays our friendship.

500
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,370
Put these things over there.

501
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:17,830
Aye!

502
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,050
Move them over there!

503
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:19,890
Aye.

504
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,110
Achu?

505
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,990
Your Highness.

506
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,180
Your Highness.

507
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:54,690
Yan Xun,

508
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,770
where have you been these days?

509
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:57,810
I haven’t seen you for a long time.

510
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:58,840
I missed you.

511
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,170
What a poor memory you have!

512
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,490
We just met a few days ago.

513
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,140
Really?

514
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,230
We did?

515
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,710
Why don’t I remember?

516
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,080
Achu, where have you been?

517
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,800
I visited Oriole Courtyard a few times,

518
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,690
looking for you.

519
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:17,070
But the guards always said you were out.

520
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,070
I was out.

521
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,160
I’m so jealous of you!

522
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,500
You can go out whenever you want.

523
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,100
The other day,

524
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,180
I also went out.

525
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,240
I went drinking

526
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,470
with my Eighth Brother.

527
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,880
I didn’t know why,

528
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,030
but Father knew about that.

529
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:31,860
I was grounded for three days

530
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,460
and made to copy Tao Te Ching
for two hundred times.

531
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,970
Two hundred times!

532
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,010
My hand was almost broken.

533
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,550
You were punished like that
for going to a restaurant?

534
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,470
You must have done something else bad.

535
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,260
My brothers took me there.

536
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,280
I didn’t do anything.

537
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,080
Yan Xun.

538
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,460
I want to borrow her for a while.

539
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,620
You’ll agree, won’t you?

540
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,940
I really appreciate it!

541
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,360
Let’s go. Hurry.

542
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:01,980
Achu.

543
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,280
Yan Xun is a fool.
But what’s wrong with you?

544
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,350
You know

545
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,080
Yuwen Yue is also here.

546
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,910
If he sees you,

547
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,200
you’ll be in great trouble!

548
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,320
I’ve already met him.

549
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,150
What? You met him?

550
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,190
Did he hurt you?

551
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,600
I am just a maid.

552
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,200
Maybe he doesn’t even remember me.

553
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,570
You’re not just a maid.

554
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,780
Everyone remembers

555
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:25,860
what you did

556
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,040
at Jiuyou Platform.

557
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,190
However,

558
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,360
Father absolved you and Yan Xun.

559
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,890
Yuwen Yue won’t do anything to hurt you.

560
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,450
Anyway, I’m around.

561
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,030
Is this what you want me for?

562
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,210
Not really.

563
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,490
In three months,

564
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,890
I can leave the palace,

565
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,210
have my own mansion,

566
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,340
and get married.

567
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:49,650
Is that so?

568
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,010
Congratulations.

569
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:52,890
It’s such a big thing.

570
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,060
Why aren’t you happy?

571
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,010
I’m happy.

572
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,020
You are not excited at all.

573
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,090
I’m excited.

574
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,190
But you’re not even smiling.

575
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,300
Not everyone shows their happiness

576
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,200
by smiling.

577
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,610
I am happy

578
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:04,270
and I’ve smiled many times

579
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,240
in my heart.

580
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,480
When you smiled in your heart,

581
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,400
I didn’t hear that.

582
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,930
Because I did it in my heart.

583
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:12,720
No way. It’s such a big thing.

584
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,510
You can’t just smile in your heart.

585
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,360
You must give me a present.

586
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,340
Your Highness.

587
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,490
You want a present from me?

588
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,920
Aren’t you asking for too much?

589
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,790
Not really.

590
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,830
Why don’t you just

591
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,700
give yourself to me?

592
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,580
Wait.

593
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:40,160
I... I don’t mean that.

594
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,860
I am saying

595
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,430
when I can have my own mansion

596
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,320
outside the palace,

597
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,880
you can come to my place.

598
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,300
To your place?

599
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,970
I mean... Yan Xun’s home

600
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,040
is too far away.

601
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,610
And...

602
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,710
It is poor there.

603
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,290
The snow may last for half a year.

604
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,040
Instead of living a hard life there,

605
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,680
why don’t you come to my place?

606
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,200
To be a maid in your place

607
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,670
who lives an extravagant life?

608
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,300
What are you talking about?

609
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,800
When did I ever treat you

610
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,120
as a maid?

611
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,310
Achu.

612
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,540
We have known each other

613
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,650
for so many years.

614
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,870
Especially since we met this time,

615
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,610
when or where did I ever

616
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,570
treat you

617
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,240
as a maid?

618
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,310
Forget it. I was just joking.

619
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,590
You’ve never made such a joke

620
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,480
with Yan Xun.

621
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,960
If you’ve got nothing to say,

622
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,950
I’d like to go.

623
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,310
Where are you going?

624
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,090
Go back to work as a maid.

625
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,750
This is the wilderness

626
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,480
with dangerous animals.

627
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,610
In case they eat you,

628
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:50,620
I’ll go and protect you.

629
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,460
Also...

630
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,550
Yuwen Yue and Zhao Xifeng

631
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,190
have both come.

632
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,080
You must be very careful.

633
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,790
Do you hear me?

634
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,570
Where is she?

635
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:12,980
Little rabbit.

636
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,420
Why are you here alone?

637
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,700
All right.

638
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:45,140
Zhama, what about this one?

639
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,170
Whose slave are you?

640
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,620
How dare you touch our prey?

641
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,870
I’m not a slave.

642
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,200
Then you are, now.

643
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,150
He’s just the prey,

644
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,000
isn’t he?

645
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,420
Let’s compete again.

646
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:01,520
No problem.

647
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,070
Take the money and run fast.

648
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,950
As fast as you can.

649
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,010
I told you to run.

650
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,450
Your arrow is fast enough

651
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,580
to shoot a running slave.

652
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:57,650
But I wonder

653
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,830
if you can shoot

654
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,530
a running horse.

655
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,430
Sure I can. I can even shoot down

656
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,130
a flying eagle,

657
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,320
not to mention a horse.

658
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:08,970
Good.

659
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,880
If I ride a horse,

660
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,270
can you shoot me down?

661
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,080
Zhalu, give him your horse.

662
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,590
Give him?

663
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,590
Just do it!

664
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,540
Here.

665
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,290
Thank you.

666
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,240
Can you ride a horse or not?

667
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,840
Don’t be trampled

668
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,590
even before I shoot you down.

669
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,560
All right. There you go.

670
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,640
Ride fast.

671
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,400
My… My horse!

672
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,570
He’s just gone with it?

673
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,370
Your Excellency.

674
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,340
Prince Yu asked a guard

675
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,380
to bring a present

676
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,980
to Miss Achu.

677
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,440
Put it there.

678
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,100
His Highness asked me

679
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,520
to give it to Miss Achu personally.

680
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,580
I’ll leave you alone, Your Excellency.

681
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,400
Ajing.

682
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,240
Your Excellency.

683
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,680
Bring me the present

684
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,430
for Princess.

685
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:42,700
Aye.

686
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:56,840
Your Excellency.

687
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,280
This is the latest dress

688
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,910
made of some special material
from the South.

689
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:02,980
It’s unique and perfectly made.

690
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,420
Princess will love it.

691
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:22,830
Miss Achu.

692
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,010
Whose horse is this?

693
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,010
Why is it hurt?

694
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,080
Leave it alone

695
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,250
and don’t tie it up.

696
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,640
It will leave itself.

697
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,960
What happened? Trapped in trouble?

698
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:35,970
Nothing.

699
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,300
What’s this?

700
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:42,360
This is for you.

701
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:46,390
For me?

702
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:57,880
Why... Why are you giving me this?

703
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,110
Someone else gave it to me.

704
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,600
I think it fits you well.

705
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,560
Do you like it?

706
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,510
I like whatever you give me.

707
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:13,590
But it’s been a long time

708
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,850
since I last wore a dress.

709
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,550
I don’t have a chance to wear it.

710
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,240
You do.

711
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,540
His Majesty

712
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,320
has absolved me.

713
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:31,570
And I’m no longer

714
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:32,650
locked up.

715
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,570
You can wear it as you wish.

716
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,030
By the way,

717
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,220
this is a present Prince Yu gave you.

718
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,550
Yuan Song?

719
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,860
Another dress?

720
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:02,860
Yeah.

721
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,920
Well, the color looks

722
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,590
like his taste.

723
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,690
But I think the dress you gave me

724
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:22,460
looks better.

725
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,400
Get out of the way.

726
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:30,960
Who are you?

727
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,320
Humble slaves!

728
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,820
Don’t you even recognize me?

729
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,110
You don’t need

730
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:35,960
such useless eyes.

731
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,080
Let me dig them out for you!

732
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:44,510
Let go of it!

733
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,900
You really are here.

734
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,830
I wondered who lived here.

735
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,240
It’s you, a young man from Yanbei.

736
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:58,320
Yan Xun, long time no see.

737
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,240
All your families are dead.

738
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:01,770
But you still live a cowardly life

739
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:02,160
under the protection

740
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,250
of your enemy.

741
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,420
It’s hard to find anyone

742
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,790
as generous as you.

743
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,580
Princess Zhama.

744
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,150
I am not here for you today.

745
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,870
This little slave

746
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,080
offended me just now.

747
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,020
I want to punish him.

748
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,900
How do you want to

749
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,460
punish him?

750
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,490
I haven’t decided yet.

751
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:23,620
But...

752
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,840
I won’t bother you.

753
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,420
How much shall I pay for one slave?

754
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,410
I’ll double the price.

755
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,350
How about I pay you

756
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,650
ten times of the price

757
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:35,350
to let go of this?

758
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,000
Yan Xun, think about it carefully.

759
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,270
I’m already showing mercy

760
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,180
when I don’t ask for trouble.

761
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:41,150
Now you even want

762
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,770
to offend me for a mere slave?

763
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,570
I won’t give him to you.

764
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:48,080
Even His Majesty comes,

765
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,550
I will not

766
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,400
give him to anyone.

767
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,680
Besides, he isn’t a slave.

768
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,970
Interesting.

769
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,080
Another love-stuck man from Yanbei.

770
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,450
Your father offended His Majesty

771
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:05,620
for Bai Sheng.

772
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,010
Then he was killed.

773
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,250
Seems like your family can never revive.

774
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,700
Others don’t need to ruin your family.

775
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,330
You’re the only one left

776
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,060
and you’re a gay!

777
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,400
Yan Xun, do you think

778
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,750
I’m asking for permission?

779
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,880
Think of

780
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,870
who you are now!

781
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,630
Today,

782
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,710
I must take the slave away!

783
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,790
Not only will I take him,

784
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,050
I will also torture him to death

785
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:34,290
right in front of you!

786
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,150
I’ll see what you can do to me.

787
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,320
So, you’re a girl.

788
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:46,340
Looks pretty.

789
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,530
Yan Xun, the hunting will last for days.

790
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,840
Take good care of your little maid

791
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,100
in case she’s caught

792
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,550
and chopped into paste.

793
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:04,440
Let’s go.

794
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,250
Your Highness.

795
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,460
Is everything alright?

796
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:16,040
Yes.

797
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,420
Something happened.

798
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:21,890
I know.

799
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,620
How domineering Zhama is!

800
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:30,330
Who do you think that girl is?

801
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,700
She’s likely

802
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,240
to be my old maid.

803
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:40,490
Maid?

804
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,600
Yes.

805
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:53,720
You changed your sword.

806
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,380
Go with me

807
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,790
to the party tonight.

808
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:02,880
Go with you?

809
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:04,740
Yes.

810
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,300
I’m afraid Zhama will come back

811
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,400
and make trouble.

812
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:11,390
When I’m around, you’ll be bullied

813
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,790
with a humble identity.

814
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,220
I’ll just hide around.

815
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,550
The hunting field is huge.

816
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,260
I don’t think she can find me.

817
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,180
You can’t always hide yourself.

818
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:23,370
You appeared just now.

819
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,610
In less than an hour,

820
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:27,290
all powerful families will know it.

821
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,930
Why don’t you just go to the party?

822
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:38,860
You...

823
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,450
Put this on for the party.

824
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,820
A dress?

825
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,310
Why not?

826
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,980
Things are different now.

827
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,220
We’re no longer what we were

828
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,290
three years ago.

829
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,820
I have the jade pendant
given by His Majesty.

830
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,610
All powerful families must

831
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:56,720
think carefully before doing anything.

832
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,610
Have you heard about that?

833
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,670
Yan Xun’s maid

834
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:10,800
wasn’t dead.

835
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,570
She has been hiding

836
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:15,300
around him.

837
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:17,750
Are you talking about Xing’er,

838
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,770
the bedchamber maid

839
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:19,480
of Yuwen Yue?

840
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,490
Precisely.

841
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,420
Everyone is discussing

842
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,070
about this.

843
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:26,080
Awesome!

844
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,010
If she died like that,

845
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:29,330
she would suffer nothing.

846
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:30,610
Finally, we have a chance

847
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:32,580
to kill her personally!

848
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:36,090
How about tomorrow?

849
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,530
Good idea.

850
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:42,110
Let’s set off together tomorrow morning.

851
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:44,610
Kill them smartly. Do not leave evidence.

852
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,780
Count on me.

853
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,200
You’d better not

854
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,590
act rashly.

855
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,780
This is an imperial hunting.

856
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,140
Envoys from all nations are all here.

857
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:52,830
Are you going to kill them

858
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,430
right in front of His Majesty?

859
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,290
What if people find it out?

860
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:56,820
So what?

861
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,920
He is merely a guilty man.

862
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,330
Killing him

863
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:02,300
will be as easy

864
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,040
as killing an ant.

865
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,010
Don’t forget!

866
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:05,580
His Majesty has given him a jade pendant.

867
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:07,310
He’s no longer

868
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:08,380
what he was!

869
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,250
Don’t you know?

870
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:10,270
Yeah.

871
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,640
He’s no longer what he was
after only three years.

872
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:15,500
If we do not take action now,

873
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:17,820
it will be too late.

874
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,580
Shuyou,

875
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,830
several beautiful girls are waiting for me

876
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:24,420
in my camp.

877
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,810
I gotta go.

878
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,150
Get everything ready for tomorrow.

879
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,120
See you.

880
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:30,850
Count on me.

881
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,050
Do you still fail

882
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:37,250
to figure it out?

883
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,390
Which family is the most powerful now?

884
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,240
The Zhao family.

885
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,100
Zhao Xifeng always wants

886
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,990
to overthrow our family.

887
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,150
Now,

888
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:49,300
His Majesty also

889
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,570
loves Imperial Concubine Zhao most.

890
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,740
Tomorrow, His Majesty will take her alone

891
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,390
for the hunting.

892
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,580
If anything happens,

893
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:59,770
blame the Zhao family for it

894
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:01,130
and make them the scapegoat.

895
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:04,280
As far as I see, Shuye,

896
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:06,920
it’s so kind of you

897
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,720
that you’ll never succeed.

898
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:19,310
Bravo!

899
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:22,880
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

900
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:27,410
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

901
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:33,450
What?

902
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:39,290
Why don’t you wear the dress

903
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:40,570
I gave you?

904
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:44,790
I think this dress looks good.

905
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:47,310
No, not at all.

906
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:49,210
It doesn’t suit you at all.

907
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:50,690
I think it suits me very well.

908
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,350
Yan Xun, it doesn’t suit her,

909
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:55,500
does it?

910
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,880
I also think it suits her well.
