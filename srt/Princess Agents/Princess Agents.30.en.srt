Qingshan House and the Eye of Intel

48
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,780
are at your disposal.

49
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,840
Yes, Young Master.

50
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,000
The journey ahead is long.

51
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,450
Please take care of yourself.

00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,360
The smell still lingers.

53
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,100
It reminds me of the moon.

54
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,910
Have you tasted the moon, Achu?

55
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,960
But whenever I see the moon,

56
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,450
I will think of the smell

57
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,160
of this liquor.

58
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,590
You should’ve seen it

59
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,210
on Xiuli mountain.

60
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:41,090
It’s bigger, brighter

61
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,750
and purer.

62
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,760
Be patient.

63
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,740
We’ll be

64
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,500
able to see it someday.

65
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,900
When we’re back,

66
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,190
let’s open this jar and drink it all.

67
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,200
Give it three more years.

68
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,220
I hope we won’t fail the moon
and this liquor.

69
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,710
I don’t want to fail you.

70
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,820
In order to

71
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,180
drink this liquor on time,

72
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,790
we need to take action.

73
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,860
Enough of the defense,

74
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,880
or we’ll be dead for sure.

75
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,740
You are right.

76
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,050
We alone aren’t able to

77
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,330
get out of the city.

78
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,760
We still have so many things

79
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,860
to do.

80
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,140
One step at a time.

81
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,350
I never thought Marquis Dingbei

82
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,400
would end up like this.

83
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,060
A son can’t blame his father.

84
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,630
Please be careful with your words.

85
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,940
Fortunately,

86
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,440
Yan Xun has managed to survive.

87
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,880
That’s a sort of comfort

88
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,550
to Marquis’ soul

89
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,670
in heaven.

90
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:04,650
It’s my fault. My words carry no weight.

91
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,110
There was nothing I could do.

92
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,800
Don’t blame yourself.

93
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,290
You already tried your best to stop it.

94
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,720
Marquis has passed away.

95
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,890
What is your next move?

96
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,870
Back to find His Excellency Yan?

97
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,670
Marquis helped me a lot.

98
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,140
So I agreed to stay and

99
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,310
assist him.

100
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:31,850
Now that

101
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,140
he’s gone,

102
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,000
I do not want to go back

103
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,220
to remind me of the pain.

104
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,170
If that’s the case,

105
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,950
why don’t you work for me?

106
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,500
Don’t worry.

107
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,880
I will treat you as well

108
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,530
as Marquis did.

109
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,890
No more hesitation.

110
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,050
Just stay.

111
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,810
When you have a better place

112
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:53,630
to settle down,

113
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,550
I won’t stop you then.

114
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,590
Thanks for your offer.

115
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,550
I’ll accept it.

116
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,940
And I appreciate your kindness.

117
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,740
Good! That’s great!

118
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,320
With you in my camp,

119
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,540
I’ll have someone to play chess with.

120
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,380
It’s good to have another player.

121
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,880
Most soldiers in my army are too crude

122
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,340
to handle the chess piece.

123
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,100
I heard Yuwen Yue

124
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,610
offended His Majesty,

125
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,150
and was exiled to the border.

126
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,170
He will be serving

127
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,270
under you soon.

128
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,790
He is skilled at chess.

129
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,830
Once he arrives,

130
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,590
you can play with him.

131
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,230
Those from the noble families

132
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,430
can only talk the talk.

133
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,360
Life at the border is tough.

134
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,390
I am sure he won’t be able to

135
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,980
stay here for long.

136
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,120
I don’t think so.

137
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,820
I have heard stories

138
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,940
about him.

139
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,520
And I’m looking forward

140
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,840
to meeting him in person.

141
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,260
Prince Xiang,

142
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,300
Yuwen Yue

143
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,870
is here to join your troops.

144
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,110
A nobleman like you

145
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,410
should’ve enjoyed your life

146
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,290
in the capital.

147
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,030
What are you doing

148
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,300
at this remote

149
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,160
and backward place?

150
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,580
If a prince like you

151
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,050
could come all the way here,

152
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,580
why couldn’t I?

153
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,680
You sound pretty lofty.

154
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,100
On your way here,

155
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,840
you must have seen

156
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,090
the enemies invade our border repeatedly.

157
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,280
The battle never ends.

158
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,780
I lack great minds and forces.

159
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,580
Since you are the heir

160
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,300
to the Eye of Intel,

161
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,590
you should know about military strategies.

162
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,530
Take my badge

163
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,050
to recruit more men.

164
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,100
I’m new here

165
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,620
without knowing anything.

166
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,850
How can I recruit others?

167
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,960
I know nothing about you either.

168
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,080
I’m not sure if you really are capable

169
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,950
or only seem to be.

170
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,550
I won’t allot the original forces

171
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,370
to you.

172
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,860
If you want to gain a foothold here,

173
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,720
you need to train your own men.

174
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,300
Once you’ve proven yourself,

175
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,580
we can talk again.

176
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:13,520
Take it.

177
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:50,540
= Jing Linxi’s Tomb =
= Jing Zhixiang’s Tomb =

178
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,940
= Jing Linxi’s Tomb =
= Jing Zhixiang’s Tomb =

179
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,620
= Xing’er’s Tomb =

180
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,880
From now on,

181
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,810
you are a professional spy.

182
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,740
The sword I gave you is called
Broken Rainbow.

183
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,630
Use it wisely.

184
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,550
Hold on to me.

185
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,480
Where exactly?

186
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,340
My sleeve. Or where else?

187
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,500
It is too crowded. If you get lost,

188
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,220
I’ll have to find you.

189
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,620
A disobedient woman

190
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,880
should better be dead.

191
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,800
= Xing’er’s Tomb =
You chose me to be your maid,

192
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,010
gave me the Silver Bell,

193
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,450
and the Broken Rainbow

194
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:51,440
only to make me

195
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,690
your Xing’er.

196
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,880
Now, she’s been

197
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,200
killed by you.

198
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,040
The one alive

199
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,870
is Chu Qiao.

200
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,440
Broken Rainbow?

201
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,630
Why not come inside?

202
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,280
The order says,

203
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,430
“no one shall come in

204
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,660
even if the sky falls”.

205
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,240
Really?

206
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,470
After I gave that order,

207
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,670
how dare they

208
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,610
let you in?

209
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,060
Miss Chu, there you are.

210
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,040
Knowing that you are back today,

211
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,470
His Excellency has been waiting to dine with you.

212
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,520
I have heated

213
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,780
the dishes several times

214
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,150
Really?

215
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,870
Are you sure it is not because

216
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,900
your cooking is bad

217
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,070
and he does not like it?

218
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,190
Impossible!

219
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,240
Try it yourself,

220
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,470
then you’ll know how well it tastes.

221
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,330
I prepared a big meal.

222
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,440
If you do not eat them,

223
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,950
I’ll be utterly disappointed.

224
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,620
Come. Let’s eat.

225
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:54,690
Achu,

226
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,830
you must be starving

227
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,990
after the long journey.

228
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,500
Eat as much as you can.

229
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,180
Look,

230
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,200
since you’re already back.

231
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,000
Don’t leave again.

232
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,400
Give me three years.

233
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,230
By that time,

234
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,280
I’ll take you back to Yanbei.

235
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,980
It will be midsummer

236
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,020
when we arrive.

237
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,810
The pasture will be all green.

238
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,730
I’ll take you to Xiuli Mountain.

239
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,470
We can go hunting there.

Can’t wait anymore?

263
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,450
The jar of liquor that

264
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,520
has been buried under that tree

265
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,620
for over a year.

266
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,560
One year plus 33 days.

267
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,230
It has been so long.

268
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,350
No wonder it smells so good,

269
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,000
and enticing.

270
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,900
Be patient.

271
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,550
It takes three years

272
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,000
to mature to perfection.

273
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,630
Report! General,

274
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,750
the enemies are approaching,

275
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,120
about two thousand people.

276
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,370
They’re fast,

277
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,740
and have arrived at the Wind Range.

278
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,480
Give me the map.

279
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,020
It seems that

280
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,330
their target is

281
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,050
Prince Xiang.

282
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,090
His Highness is at war with Lyu’s Army

283
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,600
along the Dark River.

284
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,250
Let’s take them on.

285
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,420
But we only have five hundred people.

286
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,170
We’re outnumbered.

287
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:06,710
General.

288
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,330
At a time like this,
focus on the greater good.

289
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,240
Pass my order.

290
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,420
Sharpen the sword

291
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,670
and fight with me.

292
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,370
Aye!

293
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,260
Yuwen Yue, after the fight yesterday,

294
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,850
I understand something.

295
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,880
When I first came here,

296
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,130
I thought

297
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,240
I was exiled by Father.

298
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,780
Now, I’ve realized

299
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,410
I do not live for him.

300
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,250
What is the point of hanging on

301
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,120
to the vanity and scams.

302
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,320
This is the world

303
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,010
that needs me.

304
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,200
I no longer fight just for my father

305
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,650
and the state,

306
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,100
but for those civilians

307
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,940
struggling at the border.

308
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,230
People have to see the war
to understand that

309
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,950
life is the most precious thing

310
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,660
in this world.

311
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,800
Therefore, Yuwen Yue,

312
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,750
thank you.

313
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,740
I should thank you.

314
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,520
What for?

315
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,290
After this war,

316
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,720
I find that

317
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,130
I am not a straggler anymore.

318
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,230
I will obey your order

319
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,590
and help you train the troops.

320
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,540
What is the point of training them?

321
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,530
No one wins

322
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,780
in the war.

323
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,520
There will be causalities on both sides.

324
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:00,560
Death befalls all men alike.

325
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:04,870
Yuwen Yue.

326
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,630
As the heir to the Eye of Intel,

327
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,360
you have great responsibilities.

328
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,750
This is not your battlefield.

329
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,040
A good spy

330
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,870
is equal to an army.

331
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,700
Now, spies of Liang are everywhere.

332
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,770
They even get documents

333
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,160
issued by the court

334
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,490
sooner than I do.

335
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,820
And they’re behind

336
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,830
our recent failures.

337
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:37,610
Yuwen Yue, I understand that

338
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,480
you went through a lot

339
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,460
earlier in Chang’an.

340
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,450
But don’t forget

341
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,400
we’re men.

342
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,260
We have

343
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:46,910
our own duties.

344
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,770
Stop running away from them.

345
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,680
You should go back.

346
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,290
Come out.

347
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,360
So annoying!

348
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,230
Every time I want to play

349
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,400
hide-and-seek with you,

350
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,470
you see right through it.

351
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,840
Boring.

352
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,490
Princess.

353
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,850
What did you say?

354
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,610
What did you call me?

355
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,660
Chun.

356
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,250
Answer my question.

357
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,640
Why didn’t you attend

358
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,680
my birthday ceremony?

359
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,460
I sent you an invitation.

360
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,220
Forgive me, Princess.

361
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,700
What are you saying? What princess?

362
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,600
Who is Princess?

363
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,750
Where is Princess?

364
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:57,910
Chun, I was held up by an emergency.

365
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,500
What emergency could it be?

366
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,080
I knew it!

367
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,960
You were avoiding

368
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,970
Wei Shuyou and the others.

369
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,100
He just finished his confinement.

370
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,650
I didn’t know

371
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,190
he’d come.

372
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,820
Yan Xun,

373
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,850
don’t be mad at me.

374
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,780
I wouldn’t dare.

375
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,750
Why are you always calling me Princess?

376
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,860
Yan Xun.

377
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,130
Are we still friends

378
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,140
or not?

379
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,700
Don’t treat me as a stranger.

380
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,500
Today is my birthday

381
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,180
and you didn’t come to see me.

382
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,200
I had to come here instead.

383
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,850
I am a noble princess of Wei.

384
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,220
During the ceremony,

385
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,260
those noblemen present

386
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:53,460
liked me so much.

387
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,690
But Yan Xun,

388
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,020
why couldn’t you like me

389
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,590
even for a moment?

390
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,760
Our identities are different.

391
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,000
I hate this difference.

392
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,170
Couldn’t we get along

393
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,470
like what we did in our childhood?

394
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,040
Do you remember when I was nine,

395
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,480
we snuck out of the Palace?

396
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,910
Then we hung out on the streets,

397
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,400
eating snacks

398
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,010
and having so much fun.

399
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,740
We even got into a fight.

400
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,410
But now...

401
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,040
You are reluctant to

402
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,870
call my name.

403
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,590
I was young and naive at that time.

404
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,330
Forgive me, Princess.

405
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,300
Yan Xun,

406
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,310
if you go on talking to me like this,

407
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,520
I will be mad.

408
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,930
I will stop talking to you.

409
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:43,870
I shall leave.

410
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,370
Please wait, Princess.

411
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:47,750
Ajing.

412
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,330
This is my gift for your birthday.

413
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,520
It’s just a little something.

414
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,920
I hope you can take it.

415
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,430
You prepared a gift for me?

416
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,710
It’s Huanhuan’s tail.

417
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,630
I heard that

418
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,090
Huanhuan bit your fingers

419
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:39,850
the other day.

420
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,320
Noble Concubine killed it

421
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,100
and threw it out.

422
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,590
You cried for a long time.

423
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,430
So I had my men

424
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,890
find the rabbit

425
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,620
and cut off its tail

426
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,600
as a memorial.

427
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,180
I’d appreciate it

428
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,600
if you could accept it.

429
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,240
Usually,

430
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,580
others give me pearls and gold.

431
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,860
It’s nothing new.

432
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:06,980
With this tail,

433
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,560
I’ll feel as if

434
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,210
Huanhuan didn’t leave

435
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,650
and would always be with me.

436
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:13,940
Yan Xun,

437
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,750
this is the best gift

438
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,960
that I’ve ever had.

439
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,910
Thank you.

440
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,060
I’ll leave then.

441
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,810
See you later.

442
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,280
Ajing.

443
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,510
Burn this.

444
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,670
Aye, Your Excellency.

445
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:04,850
What are you drawing?

446
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,500
It’s a secret.

447
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,410
Eat some when you have time.

448
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:34,600
Your Excellency.

449
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,360
Message from Mr. Wu says

450
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,070
he has been recruiting in Yanbei.

451
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,210
And he’ll help you return to the north

452
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,590
in Chang’an.

453
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,070
Your Excellency,

454
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,430
I know that you

455
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,600
tell everything to Miss Chu.

456
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:53,240
However, this is too important.

457
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,210
Please...

458
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,310
Achu?

459
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,200
Our secret is safe with her.

460
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,180
What is it

461
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,000
that’s hidden in your bag?

462
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,350
Can’t you tell me now?

463
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:30,610
Isn’t it...

464
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,630
The legendary Triple Crossbow?

465
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,620
I saw it in the Yuwen’s Mansion.

466
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,630
And I made some adjustments to it

467
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:38,120
according to the layout

468
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,620
of the Oriole Courtyard.

469
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,070
Careful!

470
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,870
Don’t mess with me.

471
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,090
Go to sleep.

472
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,450
I’ve been grounded for two years.

473
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,740
It’s killing me.

474
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,620
This is so much fun!

475
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,390
Thanks to Yan Xun,

476
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,540
your place has become a prison.

477
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:17,550
I must revenge!

478
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:21,140
Three years will soon expire.

479
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,890
Take action now, or it’ll be too late.

480
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:27,820
If, by any chance,
His Majesty releases Yan Xun,

481
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,580
that’ll be bad news.

482
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:34,220
Whether His Majesty releases him or not,

483
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:37,000
he must die.

484
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:44,430
A long delay means trouble.
The sooner the better.

485
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:51,900
= Weipin Pavilion =

486
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,210
Ms. Wei,

487
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:55,360
I’ve long heard about your reputation.

488
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:56,950
In order to

489
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,560
find this kind of dress,

490
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,920
I’ve been to almost every store

491
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,500
in the city.

492
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,630
People say

493
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,580
only your store sells it.

494
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,400
It’s true.

495
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,430
Your reputation is well-deserved.

496
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,010
Where do you purchase this kind of dress?

497
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,610
From the south.

498
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:13,380
We have

499
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,620
everything here,

500
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,510
and it is of the best quality.

501
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,360
Also, we have special offers

502
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,610
from nine to eleven.

503
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:19,780
You’ll enjoy

504
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,820
a 90 percent discount

505
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,630
on this outfit.

506
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,090
And we can deliver it to your place.

507
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:23,960
There will be new arrivals from the south

508
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,050
in a few days.

509
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:28,470
They can only be found here.

510
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,950
It’s truly good.

511
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:30,920
However,

512
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,280
the weather is bad today.

513
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,460
You’d better close down earlier,

514
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,650
so as not to let the rain

515
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:37,020
ruin these

516
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:37,970
exquisite goods.

517
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,720
I’ll take these.

518
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,600
Please send them to this address.

519
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,700
Rest assured.

520
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,060
They will arrive tomorrow morning.

521
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,880
Take care.

522
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,550
Sure.

523
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,920
Your Excellency. Achu.

524
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,730
Wei Shuyou is out.

525
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,900
The first thing

526
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,700
that idiot did

527
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,240
was to cause us trouble.

528
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,590
We have to

529
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,990
get rid of him later.

530
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,430
Why later?

531
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,720
This time is the time.

532
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:22,220
= Oriole Courtyard =

533
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,080
How many people on earth are here?

534
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,910
We got the wrong information.
What should we do?

535
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:13,620
Let’s get out of here.

536
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:38,060
= Pine Hall =

537
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,470
Finally, it’s all gone.

538
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,190
Worrying over the thief is worse
than theft.

539
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:06,950
Your Excellency,

540
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,740
the next three months

541
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:09,710
will be tough.

542
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:20,530
Those noble families are not going to

543
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:21,780
give up easily.

544
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,690
Enemies are lurking in the dark.

545
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,770
We can’t sit and do nothing.

546
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,420
Do we have any ways to counterattack?

547
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,760
So we have to deal with

548
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,660
Yuwen, Wei and Zhao,

549
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,210
the three noble families at the same time.

550
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,090
The Imperial Mausoleum
of the late emperor.

551
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,700
We can start from the mausoleum

552
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,400
to play them off against each other.

553
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,440
Kill three birds with one stone.

554
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,380
But those three

555
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,680
have no overlaps in business.

556
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:49,060
Where should we start?

557
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:52,110
Who built the Mausoleum,

558
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,510
and who provided the building materials,

559
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,420
and now, who are watching over it?

560
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,230
Yuwen Huai is the guard.

561
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:59,130
The Zhao family built it

562
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,290
with materials

563
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:01,120
from the Wei family.

564
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,570
If someone broke into the Mausoleum,

565
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,270
none of them can get away from it.

566
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,160
That’s true.

567
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,030
Their power has been expanding,

568
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,140
posing a threat to imperial power.

569
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,150
Emperor has been eager to

570
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,240
find fault with them.

571
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:15,390
What we need to do is

572
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,090
to advance the dog-eat-dog fight.

573
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:18,910
Problem is

574
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,250
Yuwen Huai is at the Mausoleum.

575
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,470
Achu,

576
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,430
we should be more careful

577
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,420
and wait for the right time.

578
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:29,260
That may come

579
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,680
at any moment.

580
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,110
You said that Yuwen Huai has waited
for three years.

581
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,320
Would a person like him

582
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,900
do night shifts?

583
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,150
Absolutely not.

584
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,340
He is full of resistance,

585
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:42,490
so he must be far away from that place

586
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,730
and will not do the job for his master

587
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:44,650
with all his heart.

588
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,690
It’s been a long time.

589
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,830
Even the wind of Chang’an

590
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,690
smells so sweet.

591
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,610
The sweeter it smells,

592
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:20,210
the more dangerous it gets.

593
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,440
Back then,

594
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,290
I wept and wailed

595
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:28,040
for being expelled from Chang’an.

596
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:31,430
Come to think of it, it was so childish.

597
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:34,470
But I’m grateful

598
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,960
for being able to leave.

599
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,690
Looks like Prince Mu, Yuan Qi,

600
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,900
has another competitor.

601
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,970
He’s too dumb

602
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,600
to be our match.

603
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:49,370
We can’t underestimate the enemy.

604
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,200
This city is filled with talents.

605
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:54,400
The top ones

606
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,060
still remain under the table.

607
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,120
Let’s go.

608
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,800
Zhong Yu, look.

609
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,280
We can make a big fuss about

610
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,000
the leaking underground water.

611
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,240
If the imperial mausoleum is been robbed.

612
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,010
treasures in the grave are sold,

613
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,800
and the coffin is soaked in water,

614
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,310
let’s see

615
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,380
how big the trouble

616
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,270
our filial emperor will stir up.

617
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:31,810
Let’s do it.

618
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,210
We’ve got company. Let’s split.

619
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,060
Let’s go. I will set it on fire.

620
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:54,800
Fine.

621
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:55,970
Achu.

622
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,560
Are you alright?

623
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,390
I’m fine.

624
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:05,780
How did you get hurt?

625
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:12,690
I encountered a master inside.

626
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,490
It’s on fire.

627
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:16,550
Let’s get out of here.

628
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:17,910
Sure.

629
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,140
Young Master, please get in.

630
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,770
Broken Rainbow?

631
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,130
