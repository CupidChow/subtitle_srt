Yuwen Zhuo is still alive.

18
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,740
That grand funeral

19
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,980
was just a play

20
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,990
to fool others.

21
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,010
Linxi

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,220
became a worthless

23
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,500
sacrifice.

24
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,600
That makes sense.

25
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,570
He even dared to trick the Emperor,

26
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,940
not to mention me.

27
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,790
In his eyes,

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,090
I’m nothing but a spy sacrificed to lure the enemy.

29
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,070
But Yuwen Yue,

30
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,010
do you know

31
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,950
I almost trusted you?

32
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,690
Young Master,

33
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,820
we have thoroughly searched the slums

34
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,330
in Chang’an,

35
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,600
but we found no trace of the spies

36
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,370
of Liang.

37
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,480
All the other parts of the city,

38
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,100
including the inns and hotels,

39
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,760
have also been searched

40
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,020
but to no avail, either.

41
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,280
Even a mouse

42
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,050
or a sparrow

43
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,340
can’t get away

44
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,460
without being noticed,

45
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,560
let alone

46
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,430
three people.

47
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,400
How could the three of them

48
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,060
disappear into thin air?

49
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,430
The mausoleum of the previous dynasty

50
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,640
situates on the wasteland outside the city.

51
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,810
That’s right, Young Master.

52
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,910
Unfortunately,

53
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,420
it’s been visited by tomb raiders.

54
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,630
There is no one there

55
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:10,470
except for

56
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,170
a few empty tombs.

57
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,940
Young Master,

58
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,000
I led Yue Guards

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,210
to follow Yuwen Huai

60
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,590
as you requested.

61
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,130
Have you found anything?

62
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,700
Yuwen Huai is cunning.

63
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,420
He’s been circling around the city.

64
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,140
The more cunning he is,

65
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,830
the more he is eager

66
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,570
to meet with

67
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,410
the spies of Liang.

68
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,350
We followed him

69
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,200
outside the city.

70
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,030
It seems

71
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,140
the spies of Liang

72
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,680
have been hiding in the tombs.

73
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,920
They couldn’t stay in the city,

74
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,090
so the mausoleum was their only choice.

75
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,980
Young Master,

76
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,290
Master is making Xing’er a lure

77
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,550
to clobber those spies.

78
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:58,920
I must kill them

79
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,120
as soon as possible.

80
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,440
Gather all Yue Guards.

81
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,390
Aye.

82
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,330
Congratulations, Young Master Huai.

83
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,270
You’ve finally become

84
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,730
the head of Hongshan House.

85
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,170
You must have helped me for a reason.

86
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,010
What do you want?

87
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,650
We came here

88
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,580
to collect evidence

89
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,520
of Marquis Dingbei’s attempted rebellion.

90
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,110
Why would he rebel?

91
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,390
I bet

92
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,590
Liang is playing

93
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,890
Yanbei and Wei off

94
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,460
against each other

95
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,320
in order to benefit from it.

96
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,670
You are sharp indeed.

97
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,770
Next,

98
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,790
I’d like you to…

99
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,600
Betray my own state?

100
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,310
You came here to meet with me

101
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,780
at this late hour.

102
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,470
What do you call this?

103
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,010
Your grandfather

104
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,030
has been collaborationist

105
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,230
for over a decade.

106
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,710
He has enjoyed wealth,

107
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,960
and been surrounded by beauties.

108
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,700
Besides,

109
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,740
only the winner takes all.

110
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,110
Don’t you want to rule the Wei State?

111
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,950
I have one more doubt though.

112
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,310
Why did you pick me?

113
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,290
Well,

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,810
your talent and status

115
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,700
don’t qualify for my best choice,

116
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,650
but there is something in you

117
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,640
that no one else has.

118
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:02,890
Which one?

119
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,670
Your ambition.

120
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,050
Young Master Huai,

121
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,820
that’s why I chose you.

122
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,590
Desire

123
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,390
drives everyone in the world

124
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,090
to fight for a better life.

125
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,720
I do admire

126
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,300
the ambition you have.

127
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,280
Fine.

128
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,130
From now on,

129
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,880
you and I are on the same boat,

130
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,120
going through thin and thick together

131
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,310
in order to achieve our goals.

132
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,450
To accomplish our goals,

133
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,880
we must get rid of Marquis Dingbei first.

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,300
A few days ago,

135
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,810
I switched the letter

136
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,900
from Yan Xun

137
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,900
to Yan Shicheng.

138
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,210
Also, we’ve made arrangements in Yanbei.

139
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,930
Once Marquis Dingbei received the letter,

140
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,100
he would definitely

141
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,560
come to Chang’an in person

142
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,710
to protect his son.

143
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,470
Then you can

144
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,780
lead the troops

145
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,910
to eradicate him.

146
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,130
But the Emperor is not

147
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,270
against Marquis Dingbei officially.

148
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,110
Let me take care of that.

149
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,530
All you need to do…

150
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,460
Why?

151
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,900
Please trust me.

152
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,210
You will see at tomorrow noon.

153
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:42,720
Princess,

154
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,170
Yuwen Yue is heading towards us

155
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,250
with his troops.

156
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,670
Let’s go together.

157
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,810
No.

158
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,370
Young Master Huai,

159
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,880
your priority is to

160
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,290
pay a visit to the Emperor of Wei.

161
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,380
No delay is allowed.

162
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,510
We can take care of

163
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,800
Yuwen Yue.

164
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,740
How could I leave you here alone?

165
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,530
Didn’t you just say

166
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,910
we are in this together

167
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,160
to achieve our goals?

168
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,590
Vacillation will only lead to failure.

169
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,970
You should leave now.

170
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,080
Watch out!

171
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,670
Princess, are you alright?

172
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,380
The spies of Liang

173
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,950
are surprisingly skilled.

174
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,590
Who are you?

175
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,020
Guards, tie them up!

176
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:47,980
- Aye.
- Aye.

177
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,360
Are you all right?

178
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,890
I’m fine, Young Master.

179
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,220
Cuties.

180
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,370
Where are you from?

181
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,450
Every one of you has fur.

182
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,600
Be careful. Slowly.

183
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,660
Cutie.

184
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,690
Cutie. Little cutie.

185
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,500
You also

186
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,610
carry a weapon.

187
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,900
Both of you!

188
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,190
How adorable! So cute!

189
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,070
Be careful.

190
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,040
Fine. Since you are here,

191
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,020
you can stay

192
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,220
and live with me.

193
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,090
You can be my buddies.

194
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:31,440
Here.

195
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,920
As my buddies,

196
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,440
let me treat you

197
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,520
to some goodies.

198
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:36,810
Melon seeds.

199
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,350
Here.

200
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,210
Eat.

201
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,780
Eat them all up.

202
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,280
Long time no see, Mr. Zuo.

203
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,620
I’m here to check on you.

204
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,460
I didn’t invite you.

205
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,150
What are you doing here?

206
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,050
I’m here

207
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,630
for a favor, of course.

208
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,460
So,

209
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,190
how do you like

210
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:20,900
this pair of

211
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,820
mice brothers?

212
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,040
They’re cute. I can tell

213
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,500
you’ve done your work.

214
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,310
You bet.

215
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,700
Don’t forget

216
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,220
we have a deal.

217
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,850
I knew it.

218
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,490
There’s no good seeing you.

219
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,360
What deal?

220
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,830
I don’t remember.

221
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,310
I’ve got amnesia

222
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,550
that might have come from you.

223
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,570
I’m sure you’re familiar with it.

224
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,560
Right?

225
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,590
I’ll take these gifts back

226
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,750
and give you something else next time.

227
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,630
Wait.

228
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,330
How could an adult like you

229
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,360
take back the gifts you gave out?

230
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,390
Isn’t that embarrassing?

231
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:05,920
I can give you something bigger

232
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,050
next time.

233
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,060
Like what?

234
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,760
Like a big cat

235
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,970
who will eat all these cuties.

236
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,640
Oh, silly.

237
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,510
Why don’t you give me a tiger instead?

238
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,060
A big cat? Come on!

239
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,720
What do you want?

240
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,120
What do I want?

241
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,640
All those

242
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,960
sharp weapons you have.

243
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,950
You’re greedy!

244
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,620
Follow me.

245
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,650
Princess, are you all right?

246
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,560
I am fine.

247
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,040
Hadn’t you put your life on the line,

248
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,380
we wouldn’t have

249
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,670
gone out easily.

250
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,510
Princess,

251
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,030
may I ask a question?

252
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,260
You want to ask about Yuwen Huai?

253
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:16,540
You mean

254
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,720
to use him to our advantage.

255
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,090
But just now,

256
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,280
you asked him to leave first

257
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,760
and put yourself in danger.

258
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,200
Why?

259
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,670
You think I might actually fall for him?

260
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,230
You have nothing to worry about.

261
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:35,620
Aye.

262
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,850
Princess would never

263
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,160
fall for Yuwen Huai.

264
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,770
He is capable,

265
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,550
but all too cunning.

266
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,630
He can

267
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,790
be our partner

268
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,480
but not a friend

269
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,470
or an enemy.

270
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,130
We do need Yuwen Huai’s help

271
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,890
to drive an edge between Marquis Dingbei

272
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,550
and the Emperor of Wei.

273
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,200
If those two are against each other,

274
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,660
in that case,

275
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,010
the fragile balance of power

276
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:07,770
inside Wei

277
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:08,850
will also be tipped.

278
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,040
Once we get rid of Yan Xun, too,

279
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,120
Yanbei will become leaderless.

280
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,920
At that time, those warlords

281
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,070
will fight against each other for that land.

282
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,170
The Wei State will fall apart.

283
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,510
Then we can

284
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,910
benefit from that.

285
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,450
I feel sorry for that young and handsome

286
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,850
His Excellency Yan Xun.

287
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,410
He probably doesn’t know

288
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,340
he has become

289
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,130
Princess’s prey.

290
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,860
He won’t survive after his state collapses anyway.

291
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,160
As for Yuwen Yue,

292
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,860
all our operations

293
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,960
are hindered by him.

294
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,860
If he sticks around...

295
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,070
Now,

296
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,770
it’s not the best time

297
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:55,880
to finish him.

298
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,420
One misstep will lead to our downfall.

299
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,280
Let him live for a few more days.

300
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,360
Yuwen Yue

301
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,550
is so full of himself.

302
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,150
If we don’t show him

303
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,930
what we are capable of,

304
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,390
he won’t take us seriously.

305
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,050
Where are the spies of Liang?

306
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,390
How do you feel

307
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,320
coming back here once again?

308
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,200
Excited?

309
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,410
What are you waiting for?

310
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,400
Come out.

311
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,130
See who’s here?

312
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,580
Look who’s back?

313
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,510
Look, guys.

314
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:45,000
Actually, when you asked for

315
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,740
the map of Pleasure Pavilion last time,

316
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,290
I knew

317
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,020
you planned to assassinate Yuwen Xi.

318
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,660
Right?

319
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,390
You have a beef with him?

320
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,910
Are you sure about this?

321
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,070
Fine.

322
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,300
Listen up!

323
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,430
Yuwen Xi

324
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,690
is an old jerk,

325
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,140
a perverted one!

326
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,540
Heaven knows how many beauties

327
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,480
out there

328
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,070
died in his hands.

329
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,830
His sin is beyond forgiveness!

330
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,330
He is a piece of trash!

331
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,350
May Xing’er

332
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,530
kill him successfully!

333
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,150
End Yuwen Xi once and for all!

334
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,260
End Yuwen Xi once and for all!

335
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,290
You may leave.

336
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,570
We all support you.

337
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,080
How knightly we are!

338
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,650
Pleasure Pavilion is tightly guarded

339
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:08,720
and full of traps.

340
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,910
How many people have you tricked

341
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,000
into killing that geezer with you?

342
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,730
One hundred?

343
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,680
A thousand?

344
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,750
No.

345
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,640
Ten thousand?

346
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,190
Just me.

347
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,540
Just you?

348
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:31,880
I’m taking a man’s life,

349
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,080
not running a circus.

350
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,220
I can do it alone.

351
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,810
You are not going to kill a man

352
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,750
but to get yourself killed.

353
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:41,840
So what?

354
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,420
So what?

355
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,360
Even if you want to die,

356
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,760
I won’t allow it.

357
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,170
You cannot die!

358
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,830
Uh…

359
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,830
I... I mean…

360
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,890
If you die

361
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:00,790
where could I get

362
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,760
information about the Storm Token.

363
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,550
Take this.

364
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,290
How should I use it?

365
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,390
Simple.

366
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,520
Seduce him.

367
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,230
That’s a necessary skill.

368
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,980
This is not

369
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,350
like any other hairpins.

370
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,530
It’s not as simple as it seems.

371
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,560
Take a good look at it.

372
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,670
When you go into the Pleasure Pavilion

373
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,330
you cannot take any weapon with you.

374
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:40,670
This is all you have.

375
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,830
At that time,

376
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,580
it will be your only weapon.

377
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,780
Understand?

378
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,500
Killing Yuwen Xi alone

379
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,870
is hard enough.

380
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,870
And you have to come out alive.

381
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,310
This is not enough

382
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,640
Why are you laughing?

383
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:04,570
Follow me.

384
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,960
You may need this.

385
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,160
The folding crossbow.

386
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,190
Follow the map

387
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:26,970
I gave you,

388
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,430
then you’ll find the exit.

389
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,070
Once you’re there,

390
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,950
you will be on the top floor
of the Pleasure Pavilion.

391
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,750
Go to the roof and you’ll see

392
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,710
all these stuff

393
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,840
I put in advance.

394
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,540
They will get you out of the siege.

395
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,200
If you can get in yourself,

396
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,030
why not take me in

397
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:43,920
with you?

398
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,470
That place is extremely dangerous.

399
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,180
I do want to help you,

400
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,430
but not at the cost of my own life.

401
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,240
Fine.

402
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,940
One more gift for you. Satisfied?

403
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,600
That’s so generous of you.

404
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,820
Thanks a ton.

405
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,880
You are welcome.

406
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,970
I have plenty of treasures here.

407
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:21,990
Take them with you

408
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,160
You have more?

409
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:29,440
Show me.

410
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:33,600
There is none.

411
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,590
You just said it. Let me see.

412
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,510
No. No. Nothing.

413
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,670
Nothing else, really

414
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:39,930
You said you have more.

415
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,100
Take them out.

416
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,260
I have none.

417
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,230
Hurry up!

418
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,440
Are you done?

419
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,240
I’ve given you these

420
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,470
for free.

421
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,060
You didn’t even pay me a dime.

422
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,060
Enough is enough!

423
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,630
You have no shame, huh?

424
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,610
I don’t have a choice.

425
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:54,970
You said you don’t want me to die.

426
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,540
I…

427
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,080
Don’t be petty.

428
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:09,350
One more and that’s it.

429
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,340
Here you are.

430
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,390
See?

431
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,710
Don’t know how to use it, do you?

432
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:34,620
I know from just one glimpse.

433
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,220
Will you be back alive?

434
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,110
Don’t worry.

435
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,120
I still owe you

436
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,300
information about the Storm Token.

437
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,850
I can’t care less about you, really.

438
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,320
But my mice here

439
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,250
may worry about you

440
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,910
I’m leaving.

441
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:12,710
Take care.

442
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,300
Don’t forget to bring me the weapon.

443
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,320
Tell me when you

444
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,660
decide on the date.

445
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:45,690
Your Excellency.

446
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,930
I asked you

447
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:47,930
to go back to Yanbei with me.

448
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,070
Have you made your decision?

449
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:52,930
Yes.

450
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,620
Why didn’t you tell me?

451
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,190
Your Excellency,

452
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,910
is Yanbei really as beautiful

453
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,710
as you said?

454
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,930
Is there really not a slave?

455
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,780
What I told you is all true.

456
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,850
Endless grassland.

457
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,160
Running horses.

458
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,670
Mountains full of flowers.

459
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,450
You and your two sisters

460
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,530
can go back to Yanbei with me.

461
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,640
You won’t

462
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,910
work as slaves anymore.

463
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,290
How’s that?

464
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,590
Fine, I’ll take your word for it.

465
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,700
That’s great.

466
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,100
I’ll let you know

467
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,120
once I set up the date.

468
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,760
Your Excellency.

469
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,740
This way, please.

470
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,230
This is the best saddle

471
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,720
in our shop.

472
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,680
See?

473
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,920
The pattern is exquisite

474
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,510
and popular

475
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,810
among ladies in Chang’an.

476
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,490
It’s the latest model.

477
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,330
What those noble ladies like

478
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,270
may not to her taste.

479
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,670
This girl

480
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,230
is special.

481
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,700
Sir,

482
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:26,550
do you have

483
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,810
better ones?

484
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,880
Take them all out

485
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,580
and let me see.

486
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:32,420
Of course.

487
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,040
A new one just arrived yesterday.

488
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,940
You’ll like it.

489
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,770
How about this?

490
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,520
Pretty good.

491
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,850
Only this one can match

492
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:56,940
that special girl

493
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,110
I said.

494
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,100
Wrap it up.

495
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,880
Yes.

496
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,460
Yan Xun.

497
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,550
Chun, what are you doing here?

498
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,430
Yan Xun, thank you

499
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,310
for giving me

500
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,790
such a special saddler.

501
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,420
I hate the ones

502
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,500
with heavy decorations.

503
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,870
The one just now

504
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,670
is perfect.

505
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,420
Thank you for your effort.

506
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,520
Yan Xun,

507
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,450
thanks for the saddler.

508
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,250
It’s unique and beautiful.

509
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,890
Once I arrive at Yanbei,

510
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:37,970
I’m going to

511
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,040
use it a lot.

512
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,910
Chun, that saddler is actually...

513
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:42,880
Yan Xun,

514
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,140
do you remember

515
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,760
the first saddler you gave me?

516
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,290
When did I give you

517
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,700
another one?

518
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,570
Have you forgotten?

519
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,470
When I was ten,

520
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:55,000
I went hunting

521
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,990
with my brother

522
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,690
and father for the first time.

523
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,650
At that time

524
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,430
you brought me a saddler

525
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,350
remade by yourself

526
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,950
and you forced me to take it,

527
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:03,750
didn’t you?

528
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,930
I remember that day.

529
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,650
That day

530
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,080
I almost fell

531
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,250
from the horse.

532
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,320
Only you…

533
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,470
Only you rushed forward

534
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,220
and caught me instantly.

535
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,730
And there’s still a scar

536
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,570
on your leg now.

537
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,130
It healed long ago.

538
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:25,940
So

539
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,620
since that day…

540
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,800
Since then…

541
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,950
I’ve decided to ...

542
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,250
Since then,

543
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,540
I’ve found that

544
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,850
you are a brave girl.

545
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,190
I swear to heaven

546
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:41,820
I’ll treat you

547
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,910
as my own sister.

548
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,150
You and I grew up together.

549
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,530
I swear

550
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,860
I’ll protect you.

551
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,310
And you’ll always be my little sister.

552
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:56,850
Chun?

553
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,190
I... I almost forgot…

554
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,000
I uh…

555
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,870
I need to go back to the palace.

556
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,220
I still have a lot of things to do.

557
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,720
I should leave now.

558
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:11,230
Chun.

559
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,590
Yan Xun,

560
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,840
I really have tons of things

561
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,870
to do.

562
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,550
I almost forgot about them.

563
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,440
My coming-of-age ceremony is approaching.

564
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,780
I have to pick the gown

565
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,550
and… And my headwear.

566
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,190
I have no time

567
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,420
to talk to you.

568
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,710
I have to go back to the palace.

569
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:35,530
Uh…

570
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,790
As for that saddler,

571
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,050
I’m sorry about that.

572
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,480
I’ll have Caiwei

573
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,210
take it to your place later.

574
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,990
Good day, Yan Xun.

575
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,630
Princess.

576
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:00,660
Yan Xun,

577
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,610
did you upset Chun

578
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:05,570
again?

579
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,760
Something is better known

580
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,140
sooner than later.

581
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,530
Do you know

582
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,380
you’ve broken her heart?

583
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,420
Things like this cannot be forced.

584
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,430
Did you fall in love with someone else?

585
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,290
Is it that Xing’er

586
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,120
at Yuwen Yue’s mansion?

587
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,210
Yuwen Huai, you came to the palace at midnight

588
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,110
saying there is a sign of bliss.

589
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,910
How far

590
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,350
is that said bliss?

591
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,500
Your Majesty,

592
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,530
Sibao Mountain is just ahead.

593
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,340
It’s said a rare stone is there

594
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,070
with a 100-year-old

595
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,170
pine tree growing from it.

596
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,900
That sign could only happen once in a century.

597
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,830
Long live,

598
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,190
Your Majesty!

599
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,430
Hurry! Hurry up!

600
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,260
Come on!

601
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,390
Come here!

602
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,530
- Halt.
- Slow down

603
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:17,520
Careful.

604
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:19,990
Push. Push.

605
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,040
Push.

606
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,280
Slow down.

607
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,590
Come on. Careful.

608
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,810
Slow down. Slowly.

609
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:28,100
Watch out.

610
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,350
Watch it.

611
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,600
What’s with the noise?

612
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,810
We are guilty.

613
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:46,110
Please forgive us.

614
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,200
What’s that?

615
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:53,230
It’s... It’s…

616
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,510
I am asking you.

617
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,710
Answer my question.

618
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:01,400
It’s... It’s…

619
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:05,080
Go check it.

620
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:06,110
Aye.

621
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:22,500
What’s that?

622
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:29,100
I dare not say.

623
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:30,740
It’s sacrilegious.

624
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:55,620
= “Wei is dying. Yan will rule the world”. =

625
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,750
“Wei is dying.

626
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,600
Yan will rule the world”.

627
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:13,200
That’s your so-called

628
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:14,730
bliss for me?

629
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,350
I’m sorry, Your Majesty.

630
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,700
= “Wei is dying. Yan will rule the world”. =

631
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,200
Bastard!

632
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,790
Please calm down.

633
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,870
What do you think?

634
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,890
Wei Guang.

635
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,260
I think

636
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:00,190
the crooked must’ve planted it

637
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,340
and shall be arrested immediately.

638
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,640
All the farmers and officials

639
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,180
on the river levee

640
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:09,050
must be interrogated

641
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,690
to find the mastermind

642
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,390
and punish him by the law.

643
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,120
The crooked did it?

644
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,910
So,

645
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,090
you don’t think

646
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,670
it’s heaven’s warning to me?

647
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,670
How would heaven

648
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,650
give such a ridiculous warning?

649
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:35,380
Zhao Gui, what do you think?

650
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,040
I agree

651
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,750
with what Mr. Wei said.

652
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,820
And you?

653
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,470
We all

654
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,490
agree with Mr. Wei.

655
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,670
Then who do you think

656
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,550
is the mastermind?

657
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,900
Yuwen Huai,

658
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,560
you’ve been with me this whole day.

659
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,100
Who

660
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:17,660
do you think did this?

661
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,270
I’m too benighted to judge.

662
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,520
But I’m sure someone did it

663
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,700
for a purpose

664
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,540
and an answer.

665
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:30,850
It was made for Your Majesty to see

666
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,000
so that the culprit

667
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,240
would use this so-called heaven’s warning

668
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,280
to mislead the public.

669
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:37,290
If people believe it,

670
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,250
they will go join him

671
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,400
and his force

672
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,970
will expand,

673
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,740
leading to an unnecessary

674
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,490
battle.

675
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,580
You’re as benighted as you said.

676
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,020
That’s obvious

677
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,860
to everyone.

678
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,510
But

679
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,260
only you dare to say it.

680
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,460
We all have doubts.

681
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,830
Is it

682
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:18,420
a man-made plot

683
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:21,780
or an alert from heaven?

684
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,760
We wouldn’t dare.

685
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,510
No?

686
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,790
You’re lying!

687
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:30,470
Drop your act!

688
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,000
All traitors

689
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,310
must be executed.

690
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,150
Please do not be angry.

691
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,840
Please calm down.

692
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,240
Yan Shicheng

693
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,830
is an ungrateful jerk!

694
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,960
I trusted him so much.

695
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,840
How could he plot against me?

696
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,030
Your majesty,

697
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,090
so far, no evidence

698
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,710
has suggested that Marquis Dingbei

699
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,950
is responsible for it.

700
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,290
Maybe someone did it on purpose

701
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,820
to frame him.

702
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:22,020
Your Majesty, beware of the ill-intentioned

703
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:25,100
to… To sow discord

704
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,070
among us.

705
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,910
The ill-intentioned?

706
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,390
Hadn’t I seen it earlier,

707
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,260
by this time tomorrow,

708
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,600
people who bought that lie

709
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,550
would flock outside my palace.

710
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:46,590
With all due respect, Your Majesty,

711
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,510
you seldom go out.

712
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:50,550
What are the odds that you run into this?

713
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,510
Isn’t it too coincidental?

714
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,430
General Song, what do you imply?

715
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,870
Are you saying

716
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,700
I’m the one behind this?

717
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,270
You are too sensitive.

718
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,530
That’s not what I mean.

719
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,600
His Majesty’s encounter today

720
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,310
only shows

721
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:13,320
he’s chosen by heaven.

722
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,550
General Song, you came from the north,

723
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,950
and were stationed at the border for three years.

724
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:21,190
So, you are well acquainted with Marquis Dingbei.

725
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,390
Here’s a reminder.

726
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,630
You should be aware of your position.

727
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:30,180
Don’t confound right and wrong, and aid the evil.

728
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,100
Yuwen Huai,

729
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:34,630
this incident is still under investigation.

730
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:36,350
Yet you claim that

731
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,590
Marquis Dingbei is behind it.

732
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,420
Marquis Dingbei has been

733
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,890
guarding Yanbei for years.

734
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:47,570
He battled Rouran with undivided loyalty.

735
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,750
Besides, he is the sworn brother of His Majesty.

736
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,590
I’m sure

737
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,240
he’d never do this.

738
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,790
I’m confused.

739
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,600
The answer is quite clear now.

740
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,540
And you are still defending Marquis Dingbei.

741
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,500
Who are you loyal to?

742
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,670
Shut up!

743
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,490
Wei Guang.

744
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:22,380
Yes, Your Majesty.

745
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:23,940
What do you think?

746
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,590
I also think

747
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,550
Marquis Dingbei is the prime suspect.

748
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,320
What about you, Zhao Gui?

749
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:39,920
I find

750
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,690
Marquis Dingbei quite suspicious.

751
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,000
He has attempted to rebel

752
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,870
since a long time ago.

753
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,340
I wouldn’t be surprised

754
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,180
if he did something treacherous.

755
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,650
Mr. Zhao,

756
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:54,830
who told you

757
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,520
Marquis Dingbei attempts to rebel?

758
00:41:58,130 --> 00:41:59,480
Do you have any proof?

759
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,080
Why don’t you share it with us?

760
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,340
Say it!

761
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,430
What…

762
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,750
Relay my edict.

763
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:20,550
Arrest rebel Yan Shicheng.

764
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:22,580
Also,

765
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,750
Wei Guang and Yuwen Huai,

766
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,740
capture Yan Xun.

767
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,130
Everyone on the river levee

768
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:34,740
must be executed.

769
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,580
Whoever

770
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,170
gives away

771
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:51,960
what happened today

772
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,950
must die!

773
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,840
