the real me.

18
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,780
Likewise.

19
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,440
I could share my feelings

20
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,070
and suffering

with Xiaoyu.

22
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,180
Because I am

23
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,970
your most loyal friend
who can keep your secrets.

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,740
You are.

25
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,190
What a pity…

26
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,150
What a pity…

27
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,210
I will ruin the wooden bird

who Yue is.

32
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,160
You may find this ridiculous.

33
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,790
All these days,

34
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,660
I got myself into exile.

35
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,200
For the first time ever,

36
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,860
I wanted to abandon my title.

37
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,680
I wanted to throw away everything I had

38
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,600
to find you.

39
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,360
Isn’t that ridiculous?

40
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,740
Sorry.

41
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,010
Before you came,

42
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,460
I had trapped this place
to knock you down.

43
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,890
I’m always haunted by you.

44
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,740
Only if you die

45
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,880
can I return to normal.

46
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,710
Why…

47
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,620
Why didn’t you kill me?

48
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,000
You’ve given me

49
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,540
the best experience I’ve ever had.

50
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,140
Growing up,

51
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,150
I’ve never experienced family warmth,

52
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,020
loyalty

53
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,520
and friendships.

54
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,870
I don’t want

55
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,000
to ruin

56
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,420
the last bit of purity in me.

57
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,780
Fine.

58
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,670
Me neither.

59
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,060
You didn’t

60
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,490
stab me after all.

61
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,700
So we are even.

62
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,800
Although we’re on opposite sides,

63
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,030
can’t we move forward together?

64
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,370
We can’t.

65
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,300
Where’s your little slave?

66
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,490
I got the secret log of
the Death Camp.

67
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,780
According to the log

68
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,920
and my information,

69
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,050
she is the heiress
to the Underworld Spies,

70
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,850
the daughter of Luo He,

71
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,620
the mortal enemy of the Eye of Intel

72
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,690
for generations.

73
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,930
Why is she

74
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,160
different to you?

75
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,630
You’re intelligent.

76
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,280
How could you not know?

77
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,120
Opposite sides or whatnot

78
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,340
are mere excuses.

79
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,680
Some words

80
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,080
are better not spoken out.

81
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,470
Some things

82
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,800
should be let go.

83
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,110
May we

84
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,540
never meet again.

85
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,500

Chun,

144
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,550
I heard about

145
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,670
things in Chang’an.

146
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,540
Our father did make mistakes.

147
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,160
As his child,

148
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,030
you could hate him

149
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,220
but shouldn’t kill him.

150
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,720
That’s against nature.

151
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:46,990

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,360
How’s everything here?

156
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,530
Are you alright?

157
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,620
Are you recovered?

158
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:19,680
I’m doing well.

159
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,620
Look,

160
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,660
life here may not be too comfortable,

161
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,980
but staying away from

162
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,840
schemes and deception in Chang’an

163
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,710

164
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,690
Are fame and wealth

165
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,510
that important?

166
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,040
I don’t think so.

167
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,900
That’s good.

168
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,850
Chun, what about you?

169
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,340
Have you let it go?

170
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,310
What do you mean?

171
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,430
Your resentment towards Father,

172
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,880

173
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,800

00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,170
It doesn’t matter
whether I let it go or not.

176
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,670
I have already

177
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,900
lost everything.

178
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,690
Chun.

179
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,900
Don’t say that.

180
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,950
You still have me.

181
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,000
Father is in

182
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,230
poor condition.

183
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,240
Yuan Che takes charge

184
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,140
of everything in court.

185
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,720
I’m sure

186
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,850
he won’t be hard on you.

187
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:03,470
Brother, don’t worry about me.

188
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,570
Right now,

189
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,950
I’ve never been this clearer.

190
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,380
All those people,
those things in the past,

191
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,650
good deeds,

192
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:17,920
bad deeds,

193
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,510
let them stay in the past.

194
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,060
The only thing

195
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,410
I need to know

196
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,150
is what I should do now.

197
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,370
Some things

198
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,000
should be ended.

199
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,600
Chun.

200
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,510
I am happy to see you

201
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,230
moving on.

202
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,090
Wei Shuye’s sacrifice

203
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,650
isn’t in vain.

204
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,900
He was a fool.

205
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,330
He knew exactly

206
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,360
what kind of person I was,

207
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,110
and what I was up to

208
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,860
but he still sacrificed his life

209
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,560
for me.

210
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,400
Chun, he wasn’t a fool.

211
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,780
He loved you.

212
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,550
Love?

213
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,860
Only fools believe in love.

214
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,930
Heaven played a cruel joke on you

215
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,180
that you loved the wrong man in the past.

216
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,190
But I believe

217
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,070
you will find your true love.

218
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,640
I hope so.

219
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,890
Brother, I am hungry.

220
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,350
I haven’t had a proper meal

221
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,730
for a long time.

222
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,430
I have some

223
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,690
fresh vegetables.

224
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,360
I will cook for you.

225
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,960
You can even cook now?

226
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,970
Of course.

227
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,740
So can you in a while.

228
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,030
I’ll teach you.

229
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,660
Chun.

230
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,680
I am going to make goodies for you.

231
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:31,770
Wait here for me.

232
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,170
Yes.

233
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,450
Your Highness.

234
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,760
Your Highness, what’s wrong?

235
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,360
“I wish I could still be your sister

236
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,000
in the next life”.

237
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,540
Your Highness,

238
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,890
are you having a headache again?

239
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:48,910
General Ajing has tracked down

240
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:49,670
that female physician.

241
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,320
She’s here.

242
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,890
I was about to report to Your Highness.

243
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,750
Arrange for it.

244
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,290
Aye.

245
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,950
Your Highness,
Physician Shui Xiang is here.

246
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,940
Let her in.

247
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,510
Aye.

248
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:17,880
Your Highness.

249
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,570
You may leave.

250
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,290
Yes.

251
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,640
Your Highness,
I am going to take your pulse.

252
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,910
Your condition isn’t serious.

253
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,210
It’s brought on by overwork

254
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,680
and lack of sleep.

255
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,830
I will prescribe you medicine.

256
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:06,880
Take it

257
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,470
and rest more.

258
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,540
Is that

259
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,940
your natural voice?

260
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,720
Your Highness,

261
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,550
when I was young, our house was on fire.

262
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,840
The smoke damaged my voice.

263
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,100
I can give you

264
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,430
acupuncture

265
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,460
to relieve your headache.

266
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,070
Your Highness, would you like to try it?

267
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,140
Sure.

268
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,290
Please lie down.

269
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,390
I heard you’re a skilled masseuse, too.

270
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,750
Give me a massage first.

271
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,080
Yes.

272
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,480
You may begin.

273
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:45,380
Why are you covering your face?

274
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,950
My face is disfigured.

275
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,890
It might scare others.

276
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,200
The fire did that too?

277
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,090
Yes.

278
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,290
Where do you come from?

279
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,130
Minzhou.

280
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,310
Minzhou?

281
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,760
Your accent

282
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,600
is similar to that of Chang’an.

283
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,980
I lived there when I was young.

284
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,880
So did I.

285
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,680
Do you like Chang’an?

286
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,830
Chang’an is prosperous.

287
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,200
It is.

288
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,250
Do you like it, Your Highness?

289
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,450
When I was there,

290
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,090
I always thought of

291
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,020
the days

292
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,260
I spent with my parents

293
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,440
and siblings in Yanbei.

294
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,920
Now, I am back,

295
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,400
yet I often think of

296
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,320
the days in Chang’an.

297
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,280
Maybe that’s human nature,

298
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,690
always clinging

299
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:17,070
on to the past.

300
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,680
What about you?

301
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,560
Judging from your figure and stride,

302
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,050
you should be quite young.

303
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:34,360
Why are you living in seclusion?

304
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,800
Because nothing

305
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,120
is valuable to me

306
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,510
in this busy world anymore.

307
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,710
It is too early

308
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,480
to draw a conclusion to your life.

309
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,410
Some people’s lives

310
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,290
can be easily anticipated.

311
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,650
Your Highness,

312
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,070
should I do the acupuncture now?

313
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,740
Assassin!

314
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,790
Chun.

315
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,320
Protect His Highness.

316
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,020
Princess Yuan Chun.

317
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:08,820
Your Highness...

318
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,940
Leave.

319
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,280
Your Highness!

320
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,360
Leave.

321
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,110
- Aye.
- Aye.

322
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:29,880
You...

323
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,010
Just go.

324
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:43,990
Chun.

325
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,220
I am sorry.

326
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,550

= To Your Highness =

364
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,510
Your Highness,

365
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,450
are you still hesitating
about sending the army?

366
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,930
Do you have any advice?

367
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,150
Your Highness should know

368
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,860
that letter is fake.

369
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,650
In the letter...

370
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,090
The handwriting and wording

371
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,280
are of Yuwen Yue’s style.

372
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,900
I can’t tell the difference.

373
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,550
The problem doesn’t lie
in those two aspects

374
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,560
but the content.

375
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,490
I have placed some scouts

376
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,190
in Yanbei.

377
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,710
Were it really as serious

378
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,020
as General Yuwen said in the letter,

379
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,920
how could my scouts

380
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,230
know nothing about it?

381
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,580
Not a single message

382
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,070
has been sent back.

383
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,180
Maybe your scouts

384
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,440
are incompetent.

385
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,030
They can’t be

386
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,160
that bad.

387
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,910
Yanbei won the last battle

388
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,320
but they also suffered huge losses.

389
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,250
It’s impossible

390
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,750
for Yan Xun

391
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,690
to take action so soon.

392
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,650
All that doesn’t matter.

393
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,680
What matters is

394
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,580
the benevolence

395
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,170
of Your Highness.

396
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,680
Your Highness,

397
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:05,340
do you really believe
Yan Xun will surrender,

398
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,480
and give up revenge?

399
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:13,390
Your Highness, if we let this chance slip,

400
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,170
thus enabling Yanbei to recuperate,

401
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,720
I am afraid

402
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,910
the situation will be harder

403
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,530
to control then.

404
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,930
The person who forged this letter

405
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,660
must know Your Highness
wouldn’t be fooled.

406
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,930
After all,

407
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,320
all you need is a

408
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,040
proper excuse to convince the army

409
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,420
that is haunted by the fear of war.

410
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,850
You are incisive,

411
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,120
as always.

412
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,280
Your Highness,

413
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,120
you are the future ruler.

414
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,650
This empire

415
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:53,000
is built on flesh and blood.

416
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:55,940
Do you remember

417
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,340
what you told me

418
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:57,760
the first time

419
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,110
we met?

420
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:07,610
I said every inch of the land,

421
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,140
all four seas,

422
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,120
the vast desert in the west,

423
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,730
steeps mountains in the south,

424
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,700
the snow in the north,

425
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,930
and the boundless sea in the east,

426
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,730
will all submit to Wei.

427
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,570
And all that

428
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:32,450
starts with me.

429
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,750
At this stage,

430
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,930
are you still thinking the same?

431
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,190
I’ve never forgotten about my ambition.

432
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,140
If so,

433
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:49,680
we will start with Yanbei.

434
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,580
Let’s go!

435
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,400
Yan Xun went to great lengths this time

436
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,270
and leveled a dozen camps

437
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,290
of ours.

438
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:30,440
Casualties are huge.

439
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,480
Young Master has been

440
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,250
on a winning streak lately.

441
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,060
Yan Xun is desperate.

442
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,280
The reason

443
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,200
we won is that

444
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,640
we got the information
about their deployment

445
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,550
and generals beforehand,

446
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,650
so we could counterattack accordingly

447
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:46,780
and beat them one by one.

448
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,650
After several times,

449
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,600
they must have figured out

450
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,650
what the problems are.

451
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,780
Young Master, what about Yuejiu?

452
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,210
The last time we got

453
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:57,020
his information

454
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,410
was at a farmer’s house

455
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:59,470
near Xiuli Villa,

456
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,150
while he was with Zhuang Qing’s children.

457
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,570
Zhuang Qing’s whole family

458
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,010
died in Yan Xun’s hands.

459
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,470
If the kids are captured...

460
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,490
I will go save them.

461
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:13,940
Please think twice, Young Master.

462
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,380
They were there

463
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,180
because of me.

464
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,350
I cannot let anything happen to them.

465
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,020
Young Master, I’ll go with you.

466
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,690
No need.

467
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,090
You stay and protect Prince Yu.

468
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,670
Yueqi will go with me.

469
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:31,410
Aye.

470
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,090
Aye.

471
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:22,180
= Mountain God’s Temple =

472
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,700
Come on. Let’s drink.

473
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,340
Come on. Fill the cup. Dig in.

474
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,090
Refill. Come on.

475
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:56,900
Come on.

476
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:02,910
Yueqi.

477
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,750
Yueqi.

478
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:15,890
Take the two kids

479
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:16,680
and go downhill.

480
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:18,090
I will catch up with you.

481
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,120
Young Master.

482
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,230
Go.

483
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,490
Aye.

484
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:25,790
Come on. Let’s go.

485
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:26,910
Come.

486
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:27,920
Let’s go.

487
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,010
You came in the nick of time.

488
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,360
What a coincidence!

489
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,420
Eat with me.

490
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,140
What happened?

491
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,390
Meilin Pass doesn’t welcome you,

492
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,660
so you came here to eat?

493
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,080
This place belongs to Yanbei.

494
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,720
And you are wanted here.

495
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,460
Aren’t you afraid that I will capture you?

496
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,520
If you want, just go ahead.

497
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,550
Come on, it’s still hot.

498
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,070
This is God’s temple.

499
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,760
Eating isn’t allowed.

500
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,740
You can watch me eat.

501
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:36,500
I thought you don’t drink.

502
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,220
Things have changed.

503
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:42,590
Now, I actually think

504
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,970
liquor is a cure.

505
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,100
It helps put trouble behind.

506
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:03,490
Let me toast you.

507
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,870
Thank you for helping me over and over.

508
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,630
So,

509
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,030
what are you here for?

510
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:32,930
Not for you for sure.

511
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,240
I know

512
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:34,990
you didn’t come here for me.

513
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,870
Under your watch, Meilin Pass

514
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,910
is impregnable

515
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,030
and you’ve beat back Yan Xun’s attacks

516
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,440
several times with fewer troops.

517
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,290
Right now, at Meilin Pass,

518
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:44,540
you’re in your pomp.

519
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,130
Ladies from prominent families there

520
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,440
have been throwing themselves at you.

521
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:49,000
How could you still think of me?

522
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,350
People change

523
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,090
with time.

524
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,700
They have started to
know their limitations.

525
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,670
But don’t worry.

526
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:04,650
As Xiao Ce said,

527
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,550
I always have bad taste.

528
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,130
Those ladies

529
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,570
are beautiful, fit

530
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:13,610
and well-educated.

531
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,840
But they aren’t my type.

532
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,250
I heard that you got promoted.

533
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,460
Yes.

534
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,080
I defended Hongchuan

535
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,140
and killed Yuan Qi.

536
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,060
That’s enough for a promotion.

537
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,130
But I also heard

538
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,850
that Xiuli Army had been abolished.

539
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:36,140
It’s no longer part of the Yanbei Troops.

540
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,160
Even their use of weapons

541
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,900
is restricted.

542
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:41,850
Xiuli Army has been reassigned to

543
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:42,570
Xiuli Mountain

544
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,770
and answers to the local government.

545
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:44,790
It’s natural

546
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:45,980
to restrict the weapons.

547
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,870
But I heard

548
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,430
that Zhao Gui had sent his family members

549
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,650
to Meilin Pass

550
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:52,950
to separate your powers.

551
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,720
People always make wishes.

552
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,280
Whether they can be realized or not

553
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,650
is another story.

554
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:02,310
Zhong Yu is confined to Lancheng.

555
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,000
I’m quite curious

556
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,460
about the reason.

557
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,600
There are always some little hassles

558
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,850
within every organization.

559
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,540
You’ve been through ups and downs, right?

560
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:15,990
Besides,

561
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:18,130
what you heard isn’t necessarily true.

562
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,670
Just like I heard

563
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,620
that the Death Camp has changed sides

564
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,530
and merged into the Eye of Intel.

565
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,700
Those rats

566
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,410
are everywhere.

567
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,150
They know almost everything

568
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,180
in the world.

569
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,070
As for the things

570
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,340
you have investigated for long,

571
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:46,560
have you got answers with their help?

572
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,440
Hearsay bears no credibility.

573
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:53,850
I heard Mr. Wu is back.

574
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:55,480
Have you met with him?

575
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,230
Mr. Wu is erudite

576
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,630
and skilled at medicine.

577
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,180
Have you regained your memory?

578
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,550
Have you figured out

579
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,790
where you’re from

580
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:08,840
and who you are?

581
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,380
Mind your own business.

582
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,310
You do have some prestige

583
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,360
at Meilin Pass,

584
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,460
but tons of people

585
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,470
can’t wait to take you down.

586
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,630
The eight tribes

587
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,970
are disobedient

588
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,780
and they hate Yan Xun’s guts.

589
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,500
I guess Yan Xun is determined

590
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,280
to battle Wei

591
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,290
at all costs.

592
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,040
But not everyone supports him.

593
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,980
Yuan Che has dispatched troops to Yanbei,

594
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,790
and the so-called truce for peace

595
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,710
is just a joke

596
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:39,770
to fool the public.

597
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:02,690
Early on,

598
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,450
I heard

599
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,840
Yan Xun would bring you betrothal gifts.

600
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,640
Do you think next time,

601
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,510
when we meet,

602
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,830
I should address you

603
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,850
as Duchess Yanbei?

604
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,050
You’ve probably

605
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,480
gotten married and had kids by then.

606
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:46,880
I have seen Cheng Yuan.

607
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,790
He is scheming and hard to deal with.

608
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:51,910
If Yan Xun

609
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,190
doesn’t take your side,

610
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,870
you will not be his match.

611
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,400
The power struggle

612
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,850
is deep-rooted in Yanbei.

613
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,070
You shouldn’t be here.

614
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:07,540
I was too soft

615
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,250
and failed to seize the chance.

616
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,500
The struggle for power

617
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:13,570
shows no

618
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:14,590
mercy on everyone.

619
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,930
I naively assumed

620
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:19,750
that everyone would be as pure as me.

621
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,130
But I couldn’t be more wrong.

622
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:25,210
It’s not others’ faults

623
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,750
that things end up like this.

624
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,880
It’s good you know it.

625
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,620
Yuwen Yue.

626
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,490
It’s never safe on the battlefield

627
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:40,830
or in court.

628
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,160
You’d better take care of yourself.

629
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:47,360
Relax.

630
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:49,490
They can’t hurt me.

631
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,160
And the only one who can

632
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:59,370
will soon belong to someone else.

633
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:17,990
This time, I came here

634
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:20,250
for personal business.

635
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:22,520
Don’t worry.

636
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:26,680
I’m done eating.

637
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,150
