once the imperial edict arrives,

18
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,470
you will be the one to blame.

19
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:00,680
Ma’am.

20
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,290
This is my son,

21
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,890
Commandant of Cavalry,

22
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,450
Yan Ting.

23
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,090
On May 15th,

24
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,560
Zhao Dongting of the Zhao family

25
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,940
used the Xiuli Army

26
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,590
to make a massacre in Beishuo.

27
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,300
Yan Ting fought back hard

28
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,570
but was stabbed to death.

29
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,980
This is my other son,

30
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,000
Commandant of Gallantry,

31
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,240
Yan Xiao.

32
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,370
22 years old.

33
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,660
Enlisted at 13.

34
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,110
Followed his father

35
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,380
to fight north and south

36
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,520
and clobbered tartars
in the north three times.

37
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,690
He safeguarded the state with his life

38
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,190
and never stepped back on the battlefield.

39
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:49,310
He had over 40 scars on his body

40
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,000
for protecting the civilians of Wei.

41
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,660
On May 16th,

42
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,060
he left his post in Hongchuan

43
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,490
and set out with his force

44
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,050
but was ambushed

45
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,230
in the valley of Sangu Pass.

46
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,630
A giant stone

47
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,040
broke his spine

48
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,660
and cut off his legs,

49
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,560
causing him to die of blood loss.

50
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,280
This is my daughter,

51
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,810
Princess of Yanbei,

52
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,070
Yan Hongxiao.

53
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,880
After the massacre,

54
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,420
she rode a horse to rescue

55
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,330
her abducted mother

56
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,490
but was captured, too.

57
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,690
After reaching Chang’an

58
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,200
she was shot to death

59
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,920
by Commandant Zhao Xifeng.

60
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,490
She was seven-month pregnant.

61
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,860
They were soldiers of Yanbei,

62
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,480
and sons and daughter of Wei.

63
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,720
They betrayed their state.

64
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,510
They were traitors and rebels!

65
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,610
Mr. Yuwen,

66
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,860
execute them.

67
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,050
Proceed immediately!

68
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,780
Xun!

69
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,150
Xun!

70
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,200
Xun!

71
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,000
Mr. Yuwen,

72
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,190
His Majesty promised that
he would pardon my son.

73
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,570
The imperial edict will arrive soon.

74
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,530
Xun.

75
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,860
Don’t cry.

76
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,070
The Yans

77
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,800
would rather bleed than weep.

78
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,220
Mother.

79
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:30,840
Mother.

80
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,010
Father left me.

81
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,170
Elder brother left me.

82
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,140
They all left me.

83
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,380
Why...

84
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,950
Why did you

85
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,990
leave me as well?

86
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,190
Mother.

87
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,720
Mother.

88
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:23,900
Xun.

89
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,920
You must survive

90
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,830
however low you have to bend.

91
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,420
You cannot give up.

92
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,300
Don’t forget

93
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,420
Yanbei needs you.

94
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,300
Our people

95
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,950
need you.

96
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,660
The deceased

97
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,290
also need you.

98
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,730
You have tons of unfulfilled missions.

99
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,170
I used to think

100
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,030
the mountains and waters of Liang

101
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,380
were my favorites.

102
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,490
There was no winter,

103
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,370
no snow.

104
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,150
The sun was always shining.

105
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,340
The weather was always warm.

106
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,170
But now, I realized

107
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,670
I was wrong.

108
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,210
All that I love the most

109
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,030
is in Yanbei.

110
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,460
Now,

111
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,730
I’m going back to them.

112
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,970
Yan Xun!

113
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,850
Here comes the imperial edict!

114
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,710
The edict is as follows:

115
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,640
Rebels of Yanbei plotted
against the regime,

116
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,160
and thus shall be sentenced to death.

117
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,160
His Excellency Yan Xun

118
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,830
grew up in Chang’an
without involvement in the revolt.

119
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:42,130
Therefore, he’s spared from death.
Respect this.

120
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,060
Is he pardoned?

121
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,690
Mother!

122

Your Majesty!

124

Your Majesty!

125
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:07,960
Aye.

126
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,140
Your Highness.

127
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:00,760
You may leave.

128
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,470
Your Highness!

129
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,460
I’m sorry.

130
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,000
I’m sorry, Yan Xun.

131
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,910
I can’t do anything for you.

132
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,950
I can’t help you.

133
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,650
I’m really sorry.

134
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,800
I’m sorry.

= Qingshan House =

136
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,770
Young Master, it’s a bit cold in here.

137
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,180
Let me fetch a brazier

138
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,150
to warm your hands.

139
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,870
Young Master,
don’t be too hard on yourself.

140
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,080
What’s done is done.

141
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,390
Fortunately,

142
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,470
His Excellency Yan Xun is safe.

143
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:05,870
Time is running out.

144
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,270
I should do something.

145
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:16,710
Father,

146
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,880
what does His Majesty mean?

147
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,900
Is he really going to spare Yan Xun?

148
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,290
Yan Xun’s mother was an old hen.

149
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,020
What was His Majesty thinking?

150
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,370
How come that woman hit his fancy?

151
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,800
Shut up!

152
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,970
His Majesty is always suspicious

153
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,590
and fickle.

154
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,830
Although he spared Yan Xun

155
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,510
for old times’ sake,

156
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,290
once his grief wears off,

157
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,990
he may change his mind.

158
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,300
Uncle, you mean...

159
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,330
Yan Xun’s life is still on the line?

160
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,630
Yes,

161
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,900
but His Majesty is hard to predict.

162
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,760
We can’t pin our hopes on

163
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,230
His Majesty alone.

164
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,970
Yanbei is a wonderland.

165
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,930
Father,

166
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,470
do you have any ideas?

167
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,770
The Zhaos slaughtered Yan Xun’s family.

168
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,100
Zhao Xifeng

169
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,340
killed his pregnant sister.

170
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,730
Yuwen Huai beheaded Yan Shicheng.

171
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:20,900
Those people

172
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,540
want Yan Xun dead

173
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,790
more than we do.

174
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,830
But the head of Imperial Prison

175
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,750
is Luo Yongchen.

176
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,220
He and Marquis Dingbei

177
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,680
go way back.

178
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,710
Isn’t his youngest son

179
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:38,240
always following you around?

180
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,360
I hear that Luo Yongchen

181
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,960
adores him.

182
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:48,680
I understand. I’m on it.

183
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:56,040
Uncle, I should take my leave as well.

184
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,580
It’s chaotic outside.

185
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,140
Don’t go out these days.

186
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,600
Aye.

187
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,550
Young Master,
your brother has gone out.

188
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,930
Sneak out now

189
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:15,260
and go to Qingshan House of Yuwen.

190
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,290
Find Young Master Yue

191
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,000
and tell him His Excellency Yan Xun is in danger

192
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,230
and needs his help.

193
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:19,860
Aye.

194
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,680
Young Master.

195
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,830
Has Wei Shuyou left?

196
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,910
Yes, he has.

197
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,150
Young Master,

198
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,320
what is Young Master Wei up to?

199
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,810
What is he up to?

200
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,530
To kill Yan Xun with our hands.

201
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,150
He wants me to get rid of Yan Xun.

202
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,090
Then let’s...

203
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,540
Yan Xun is pardoned by His Majesty.

204
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,350
One rash move,

205
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,300
I’ll be digging

206
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,030
my own grave.

207
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,730
Then should we turn a blind eye to it?

208
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:57,160
Of course not.

209
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,890
What if His Majesty lets him go

210
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:00,950
on the spur of the moment?

211
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,870
Won’t that be worse?

212
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,290
Then what should we do?

213
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,920
I’ll write a letter now.

214
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,890
Send it out immediately.

215
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:35,850
Young Master,

216
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,120
Wei Shuye’s servant

217
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:37,760
is here,

218
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:38,980
saying that Wei Shuyou

219
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,680
is inciting Yuwen Huai and Zhao Xifeng

220
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,540
to get rid of His Excellency Yan Xun.

221
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,490
It’s just as you expected.

222
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:48,720
Keep Mr. Luo’s family

223
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,140
safe.

224
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,850
As long as he’s not under threat

225
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,870
when guarding the Imperial Prison,

226
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,140
no one dares to harm His Excellency Yan Xun.

227
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:57,830
Can we trust him?

228
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:02,000
Prepare a horse for me.

229
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:03,790
Aye.

230
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,170
Caiwei.

231
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,620
Your Highness, you need me?

232
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,930
Help me shower and get dressed,

233
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,600
and prepare a carriage for me.

234
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,430
I’m going out.

235
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,870
Your Highness,

236
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,290
where are you going?

237
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,880
Qingshan House of Yuwen.

238
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,730
I need to see Yuwen Yue.

239
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,180
Your Highness, Master Yuwen Yue

240
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:12,990
from Qingshan House

241
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,250
is requesting an audience.

242
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,440
The Zhaos and Weis

243
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,110
have planned everything well.

244
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,080
But that may only
be their wishful thinking.

245
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,520
Yuwen Yue has already sent people

246
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,840
to protect

247
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,200
Luo Yongchen’s family.

248
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:32,720
Half of Qingshan House’s men

249
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,870
are at Luo’s.

250
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,690
And the youngest son of Luo Yongchen

251
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:37,800
has been grounded.

252
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,990
If they’re trying to

253
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:40,890
work from that angle,

254
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,190
they will certainly be disappointed.

255
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,260
Why would they go to such lengths?

256
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,290
They fear to make a big fuss.

257
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:50,850
We don’t.

258
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,940
We can

259
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:00,020
finish Luo Yongchen.

260
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,100
You are wise indeed.

261
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,280
I’m on it.

262
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,700
= Imperial Prison =

263
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,170
Yan Xun.

264
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,190
Yan Xun.

265
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:54,650
Yan Xun.

266
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,200
Mr. Luo.

267
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,050
It’s time to eat.

268
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,590
Alright. I see.

269
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,600
Just put it down.

270
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,460
Aye.

271
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,030
You should know

272
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,430
why I’m here, Your Highness.

273
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,340
I don’t.

274
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,190
After what you did on Jiuyou Platform,

275
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,390
how could I trust you again?

276
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,320
You and I

277
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,310
are His Excellency Yan’s best friends.

278
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,870
Earlier today,

279
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:34,840
neither of us could help him

280
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:37,120
regardless of our positions.

281
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,390
Your Highness should be able to

282
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,630
understand my dilemma.

283
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,510
But people out there said

284
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,010
before Yan Xun was captured,

285
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,120
you shot him at last

286
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,180
and took him down.

287
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,660
Had I done that,

288
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,910
would I’ve

289
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,810
made it public?

290
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,940
You have a point.

291
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,060
Except for you,

292
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,060
I don’t know who I can trust.

293
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,910
So just get to the point.

294
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:46,630
Miss.

295
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,490
Yes?

296
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:59,290
Is His Excellency getting better?

297
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:02,590
Who are you?

298
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:04,930
I work under Mr. Luo.

299
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,990
Mr. Luo is Marquis Dingbei’s best friend,

300
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:09,140
and he is in charge of this prison.

301
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,200
He has been seriously injured,

302
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:13,730
and he needs clean water, food,

303
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:14,490
medicine

304
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:15,470
and a physician.

305
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,820
You know

306
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,170
it’s dangerous

307
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,150
to bring anyone in.

308
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,700
Look, Miss,

309
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,620
I have got some hot porridge.

310
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:25,310
You can feed it to His Excellency.

311
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,620
As for hot water and medicine,

312
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,210
I will get them prepared later.

313
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:28,960
Here you go.

314
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,470
Eat it while it’s hot.

315
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,700
Thank you.

316
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:33,580
You’re welcome.

317
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,970
You are a clever girl.

318
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,780
What a shame!

319
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:26,790
You two

320
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,240
could’ve died

321
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,020
a painless death.

322
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,180
Who sent you here?

323
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,800
Does it matter?

324
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,540
You know

325
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,270
many out there want you dead.

326
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,940
One more won’t make a difference.

327
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,020
Do yourself a favor
and end your suffering.

328
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,330
Come on.

329
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,100
Let me give you a hand.

330
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,990
The way you act shows

331
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,550
you aren’t an official, right?

332
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:50,760
You are from the underworld.

333
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,580
If so,

334
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,530
you must be familiar with the Storm Token.

335
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,570
How did you know the Token?

336
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,430
Speak! What’s your connection

337
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,830
with the Storm Token?

338
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,810
Aren’t you just a maid?

339
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:09,920
Were I

340
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,000
just a menial,

341
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,360
how could I survive

342
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,190
to this day?

343
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,190
Who are you?

344
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:18,820
My identity doesn’t matter.

345
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:19,540
What matters is

346
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,890
that I know where the Storm Token is.

347
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:21,870
Where is it?

348
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,990
What do you want?

349
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,810
Get me out of here.

350
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,040
You should know

351
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,460
there are traps everywhere.

352
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,980
Everyone wants him dead.

353
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,390
I can’t get you guys out.

354
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:41,540
Not him, just me.

355
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,370
Are you leaving him behind?

356
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:45,090
We aren’t related by blood.

357
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,940
Why should I die with him?

358
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,270
That makes sense.

359
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,690
But how should I know

360
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:51,510
what you said is true?

361
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,220
I have proof, of course.

362
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,090
What is it?

363
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,700
Storm Token is a nice bait.

364
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,390
If you want it,

365
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,180
go seize it in hell.

366
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:47,660
My lady,

367
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:49,990
Shadow made it.

368
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:51,850
Luo Yongchen is dead.

369
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:54,640
Where is Shadow?

370
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:56,910
He hasn’t come back yet.

371
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,650
Our men saw

372
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,150
Luo’s servant

373
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,060
go home in haste to report,

374
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,790
and found out what happened.

375
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,010
Shadow always

376
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,530
aims high

377
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,120
and thinks highly of himself.

378
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:18,670
I’m afraid

379
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,190
he’s going straight

380
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,200
to kill Yan Xun.

381
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,210
Would he?

382
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,310
You only sent him

383
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,550
to kill Luo Yongchen.

384
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,810
These people of the underworld

385
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,580
aren’t technically

386
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,480
obedient.

387
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,920
Alright. Forget about him.

388
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,670
My Lady,

389
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,480
a message just came

390
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,740
saying that Shadow was killed

391
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,830
by that maid with Yan Xun.

392
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:52,630
She said to Shadow

393
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,190
that she knew where the Storm Token is.

394
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,160
Will this work?

395
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,430
Do our best and leave the rest to heaven.

396
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,350
The result

397
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,530
is out of our control.

398
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:16,280
Young Master Yue.

399
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:17,560
Young Master Yue.

400
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,230
Mr. Luo was killed.

401
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,080
Really?

402
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,850
Yes.

403
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,020
The man who gave the obituary notice

404
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,490
is at the state office of Chang’an.

405
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,210
Clearly, heaven is on my side.

406
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,200
Yan Xun,

407
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,860
I can imagine how painful you feel.

408
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,830
Do you want to die

409
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,700
to end all your suffering
once and for all?

410
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,750
Dying is easy.

411
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,330
You’d have no pain

412
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,770
or hatred.

413
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,940
It’s just like taking a nap.

414
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,310
In your dream,

415
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:10,960
you are still

416
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,440
that high and mighty prince.

417
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,250
Your parents and siblings are still alive.

418
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:20,310
How wonderful!

419
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:24,470
Death is always the easiest.

420
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:26,990
What is really hard

421
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:33,190
is batting the thought of death to live.

422
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,320
Yan Xun.

423
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,300
I have nothing at all.

424
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,190
I don’t even know

425
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,470
where my birth parents are.

426
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:45,410
People who were nice to me are all dead.

427
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:51,880
Some took a hit for others

428
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,520
and died tragically.

429
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,420
Some were raped to death

430
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,800
and tossed among mass graves

431
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,910
like a pile of trash.

432
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,220
The world is supposed to be fair.

433
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,670
Even maids

434
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,790
should have the right to live.

435
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:18,750
I couldn’t understand

436
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:19,930
why people

437
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,050
are divided into separate classes

438
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,470
when they are born into this world.

439
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,560
Why rabbits are doomed to be wolves’ prey?

440
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,770
Why can’t they

441
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:28,620
fight back?

442
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:31,720
But now, I know.

443
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,710
That’s because rabbits
are not strong enough.

444
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,510
If you don’t want to be looked down,

445
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,280
you have to stand up first.

446
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,410
Yan Xun.

447
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,660
Right now, I’m still weak

448
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:51,130
but I’m patient.

449
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:53,290
I still have enough time.

450
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,230
Those people who owed me

451
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,400
will not get away with it.

452
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,190
I will watch them

453
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:12,150
pay the price for what they did

454
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:13,920
eventually.

455
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,670
Otherwise, even if I die,

456
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:22,170
I will turn in my grave.

457
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,460
Yan Xun.

458
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:31,960
Do you remember

459
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,510
your mother’s last words

460
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,770
to you?

461
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,250
She wanted you to live well.

462
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,550
However low you have to bend,

463
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,430
you must go on with your life.

464
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:48,760
Because you still have

465
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,390
tons of unfulfilled missions.

466
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,870
Do you know what they are?

467
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,960
Lower your hand and swallow your pride.

468
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:57,590
Endure the hardships

469
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,790
and wait for the right time to come

470
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:02,160
to kill all those people

471
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,390
who murdered your family

472
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:04,610
on your own,

473
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,240
and avenge their deaths.

474
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,170
They have high hopes in you.

475
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,540
They’re watching you

476
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,940
up there.

477
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:17,790
Are you going to let them down?

478
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:19,840
Are you going to

479
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,870
leave them there unavenged?

480
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:23,800
Are you going to watch them

481
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,200
ruin your father’s legacy?

482
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,100
Are you

483
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,030
willing to rot

484
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:34,320
in this disgusting cage

485
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:36,350
like a coward?

486
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:38,870
