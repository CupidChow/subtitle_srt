177
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,380
Don’t stare at me like that,
Your Excellency.

178
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,170
The Secret Service

179
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,320
and I

180
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,780
both work for Liang.

181
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,170
Our goals are the same, too.

182
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,720
The Emperor of Wei is so cruel
that he killed loyal ministers.

183
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,790
Such an honest man like me

184
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,380
can no longer stand that.

185
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,110
I need to do justice

186
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,440
by helping you

187
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,090
get back to Yanbei safely.

188
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,160
You want me

189
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,130
to rebel

190
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,830
and have a war with His Majesty

191
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,610
so that you can benefit from it?

192
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,910
Don’t be so straightforward.

193
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,550
Where are spies with the Secret Service?

194
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,030
They’ve gone back for some reason.

195
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,430
I am in control now.

196
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,750
However,

197
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,750
they didn’t tell me the plan

198
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,100
you made with them.

199
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,790
They left in a hurry.

200
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,680
Those who fell behind

201
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,360
have been arrested by Yuwen Yue.

202
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,570
But don’t worry.

203
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,100
This deployment diagram

204
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,540
can be authentic and reliable.

205
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,010
It includes the geography and

206
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,500
population of each place

207
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,120
from Chang’an to Yanbei,

208
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,150
the armies stationed there, their generals

209
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,250
and their war experience.

210
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,610
It is very detailed.

211
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,590
I spent half a year travelling here.

212
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,070
I wasn’t just enjoying the scenery.

213
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,710
All right. I am finished.

214
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,040
It’s late now.

215
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,490
Well, Your Excellency, wish you...

216
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,070
If it happens again,

217
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,440
I shall let you pay the price!

218
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,990
What are you talking about?

219
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,830
You know what I am talking about.

220
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,050
Achu.

221
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,360
Please get better soon.

222
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,860
I’m afraid

223
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,710
everything here will be ruined

224
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,960
in a couple of days.

225
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,630
If Yan Xun has the guts,

226
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,190
I would rather

227
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,400
he set the whole city on fire!

228
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,560
Your Highness.

229
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,840
Was Yan Xun rude to you

230
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,340
because of Taoye?

231
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,270
No.

232
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,190
Only because I put Qiaoqiao in danger

233
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,130
and she ended up wounded.

234
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:08,450
That’s fine, then.

235
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,500
I had planned to let Xiao Yu

236
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,870
hurt Qiaoqiao

237
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,360
so that Yan Xun

238
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,120
would hate her.

239
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,460
Then I could

240
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,510
take over her business.

241
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,760
Unexpectedly, Yuwen Yue interfered.

242
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,970
He wiped out all spies in Chang’an

243
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,770
who worked for Xiao Yu.

244
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,870
What a pleasant surprise!

245
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,760
But Yuwen Yue caught Taoye.

246
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,960
She knows a little bit

247
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,330
about Yan Xun’s plan.

248
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,100
Yan Xun isn’t aware of this.

249
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,850
If Yuwen Yue arrests Yan Xun,

250
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,670
will it disturb our plan?

251
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,550
Maybe.

252
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,820
Can Yan Xun get out of Chang’an safely?

253
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,220
I am not his father.

254
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,270
Why should I help him?

255
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,720
Anyway,

256
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,680
he’s going to rebel.

257
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,950
He should have a perfect plan

258
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,020
including a retreat.

259
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,360
If he cannot even

260
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,090
get out of Chang’an,

261
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,080
he won’t defeat anyone else

262
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,450
back in Yanbei!

263
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,530
If so,

264
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,270
he would rather die in Chang’an.

265
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,550
It’s just a pity for Qiaoqiao.

266
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,510
Achu.

267
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,870
You’re awake?

268
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,830
Does your wound hurt?

269
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,780
Not anymore.

270
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,030
You are so badly wounded.

271
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,070
You must feel the pain.

272
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,720
How reckless you were!

273
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,590
I knew

274
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,470
you wanted the deployment diagram

275
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,480
outside of Chang’an.

276
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,330
So, I wanted to take the chance

277
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,380
to check it out.

278
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,980
Unexpectedly...

279
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,530
When you were asleep,

280
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,780
Xiao Ce came.

281
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,060
What for?

282
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,800
He gave us the deployment diagram

283
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,010
from Chang’an to Yanbei.

284
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I know he can’t be

285
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,990
a common man.

286
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:36,940
I’m right.

287
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,550
But,

288
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,320
he’s born wicked.

289
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,710
I’m not sure

290
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,010
we can trust the diagram he gave us.

291
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,710
We’d better be alert.

292
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,470
He may not stay too long in Chang’an.

293
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,530
Since he has achieved his goal,

294
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,160
he will leave, I guess.

295
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,190
Does your wound ache again?

296
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,230
No, no.

297
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,480
I’m just wondering.

298
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,280
Since you took the risk
to get out of the city,

299
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,100
why didn’t you just escape?

300
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,500
You were badly wounded.

301
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,250
I needed to take you back
to see the doctor.

302
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,880
Sorry, sorry to be your burden.

303
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,010
Yuwen Yue has kept a close eye

304
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:26,980
on us.

305
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,540
Yan Xun.

306
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,190
I have something

307
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,910
to discuss with you.

308
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,320
What is it?

309
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,870
How will you

310
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,180
deal with Xiuli Army?

311
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,800
They opened

312
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,190
the Gate of Hongchuan and Beishuo

313
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,750
for Zhao Dongting.

314
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,640
Let me think about it.

315
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,110
Achu.

316
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:12,940
You must be hungry.

317
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,600
We can talk some other day.

318
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,020
Let me get you something to eat.

319
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,980
= List =

320
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,500
Young Master, we have checked it out.

321
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,680
What Taoye said is

322
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,910
mostly true.

323
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:34,980
We cannot find proof

324
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,280
for some people.

325
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,140
But I believe they are spies.

326
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,520
Most of them are officials

327
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,280
under the sixth level.

328
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,660
They seem common in normal times,

329
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,900
but work in every field of the government.

330
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,750
They can cause huge mess.

331
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:50,100
Put them under control.

332
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,950
Shall we inform Chang’an Office?

333
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,240
Not yet.

334
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,980
What we should do is

335
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,800
to use our own men to make sure

336
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,040
they cannot leave home

337
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,890
on the wedding day of the Princess.

338
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,140
Aye.

339
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,000
First, put Guard Deng Jia of the East Gate

340
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,420
under control.

341
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,630
On your birthday that year,

342
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,800
Princess Yuan Chun
brought us a jar of Jade Wine

343
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:50,840
from the palace.

344
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,510
She said it was the one and only.

345
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,330
We all found it precious

346
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,330
at that time.

347
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,790
But recently,

348
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,020
I’ve got another jar.

349
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,470
Seems like it’s how the world goes.

350
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,950
What you believed

351
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:23,760
may turn out to be wrong.

352
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,010
Right or wrong

353
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,870
depends on

354
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,510
who thinks of it.

355
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,870
You don’t decide

356
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,210
the right and wrong alone.

357
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:41,840
Are you really going to marry Yuan Chun?

358
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:43,910
Of course.

359
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,140
I am very curious

360
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,960
what you’ve prepared
as the betrothal present.

361
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,600
You are?

362
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,920
Check it out, then.

363
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:56,990
I am checking on that.

364
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,430
Meanwhile,

365
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,670
I’ve found an interesting list.

366
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,830
Cui Jia, Councilor
in the Ministry of Works,

367
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:14,620
Pei Mingshu, Left Officer
in the Construction Department.

368
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:19,220
Wang Mianzhi, Chief Director
of Fire Department.

369
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,530
Qu Yi, Warrior of Wulin Guards,

370
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,190
Deng Jia, Guard of the East Gate.

371
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,090
You want more?

372
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,190
I also checked the recent working record

373
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,610
in the Ministry of Works

374
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,210
and Construction Department.

375
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,800
I found Longsheng Canal,

376
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,470
Wei Canal and An Canal

377
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,500
had been all cleared recently.

378
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,070
Cui Jia led the work,

379
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:55,450
while Pei Mingshu assisted.

380
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,550
It is the rainy season now.

381
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,600
The water line rises.

382
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,150
You’ve made all these efforts
and spent all this money

383
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,690
to make them work for you.

384
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,320
Yan Xun.

385
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,990
Are you going to flood the city

386
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,040
on your wedding day?

387
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,780
How can you not know

388
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,230
what I want to do?

389
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,080
Eighty thousand families live in Chang’an.

390
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,070
Including stationed soldiers,

391
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,800
there’re over five hundred thousand.

392
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,830
You really want to

393
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,840
kill all of them

394
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,510
just for your own desire?

395
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:39,730
Then through the East Gate

396
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,110
where Deng Jia guarded,

397
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,790
you could break out of Chang’an.

398
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,650
Zhao Dongting attacked Yanbei by surprise

399
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,890
with fifty thousand imperial guards.

400
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,280
Beishuo and Hongchuan

401
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,700
were burned into ashes.

402
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:57,670
The fire lasted for three days and nights.

403
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,590
200 thousand soldiers and civilians died
in the fire.

404
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:05,930
They’re all innocent!

405
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,020
You also survived from the tragedy

406
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,270
and escaped from death.

407
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,150
You should know it
more than anyone else

408
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,670
how it feels

409
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,770
to lose families.

410
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,580
But what you plan to do is

411
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,780
exactly what Zhao Dongting did.

412
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,860
It is not.

413
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,310
He slaughtered innocent citizens

414
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,650
and killed loyal ministers.

415
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,660
But I only take revenge,

416
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,020
making eye for eye.

417
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,460
Pretty fair!

418
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,370
If you do this,

419
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,690
will you feel at ease?

420
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,560
Something may not

421
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,790
make me happy.

422
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,620
But if I don’t do it,

423
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,660
I won’t be happy for sure.

424
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,500
Happiness is not the only thing
we seek for,

425
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,280
living in this world.

426
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,720
I don’t think

427
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,950
you can understand.

428
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,700
Anyway,

429
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,550
I won’t let you succeed.

430
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:41,690
If you’ve made up your mind,

431
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,710
come to me at any time.

432
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,470
I will help you.

433
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:49,010
Don’t dream about

434
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,960
anything else.

435
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:56,070
Try me. We’ll see.

436
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,730
If you want to stop me,

437
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,300
come as you wish.

438
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,110
Does Xing’er know

439
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,280
what you plan to do?

440
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,750
I know people from Liang

441
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,650
can’t be trusted.

442
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,450
Turns out

443
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,340
they did something wrong

444
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,880
and exposed our plan.

445
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,320
Luckily, we have a backup plan.

446
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,600
Then can we still use

447
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,640
the deployment diagram

448
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,770
from the Crown Prince of Liang?

449
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,820
We have

450
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,920
a preliminary deployment diagram,

451
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,250
mainly the same as his.

452
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,670
I think we can use it.

453
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,700
Your Excellency, those guys don’t matter.

454
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,730
They are agents from Liang

455
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:09,160
and spies in the government.

456
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,890
It is Taoye’s plan

457
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,350
to flood Chang’an.

458
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:13,540
We never expected them

459
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,630
to succeed.

460
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,930
The problem is...

461
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,460
Deng Jia and Qu Yi

462
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,610
work for us.

463
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,590
After being exposed,

464
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,970
they are now controlled by Yuwen Yue.

465
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,740
Without them,

466
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,030
we would get no help from the military.

467
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,800
It will be too hard for us

468
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,430
to break out of Chang’an alone

469
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,710
and get rid of pursuing troops

470
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,130
on our way back.

471
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,800
I have an idea.

472
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,870
I wonder if I should say.

473
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,150
No.

474
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:56,830
I know what you want to say.

475
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,460
But Your Excellency,

476
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,920
- I...
- Our priority is

477
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,100
to stop Yuwen Yue.

478
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:04,560
When he’s around,

479
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,470
he will reveal

480
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,740
all our plans

481
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,000
on Zhuque Avenue.

482
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,540
Where are you going, Your Excellency?

483
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,710
Go get changed

484
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,110
and get to the palace.

485
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,310
You two.

486
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,600
Put the lamp in my bedroom.

487
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,080
- Aye.
- Aye.

488
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,330
Put this on the table.

489
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,990
Be careful!

490
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,750
All of you! Be careful!

491
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,350
Caiwei, how is everything going?

492
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,730
Everything’s ready.

493
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,880
If we need anything,

494
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,960
make it up.

495
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,390
Don’t overlook anything.

496
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,030
I see.

497
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,110
His Excellency Yan Xun has arrived!

498
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,630
Yan Xun.

499
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:53,790
What brings you here?

500
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,720
I come to have a look.

501
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,160
Are you coming to see

502
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,280
how ready I am?

503
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,220
Time is so tight

504
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,010
that many things can’t be prepared.

505
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,390
But it doesn’t matter.

506
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,650
When I can be with you,

507
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,130
nothing else matters.

508
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,710
Do you want to see

509
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,860
my wedding dress?

510
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,870
Let me show you. Go.

511
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,600
His Majesty has arrived!

512
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,730
Greetings, Your Majesty.

513
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,710
Greetings, Father.

514
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,280
You may rise.

515
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,540
- Thank you, Father.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

516
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:46,680
Father.

517
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,240
Yan Xun comes here

518
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,230
to see me.

519
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,220
You’re free to come here.

520
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,340
Seems like you’re mostly ready.

521
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,650
Ceremony Department is
taking care of this.

522
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,010
I think it’s almost ready.

523
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,650
Time is tight.

524
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:01,550
But I don’t want my daughter

525
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,800
to feel bad.

526
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,200
She is born

527
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,620
to be a naughty girl.

528
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,340
And she is

529
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,030
my favorite daughter.

530
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,390
I still remember

531
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,740
when she was of this height,

532
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:16,460
- I was thinking
- Father!

533
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:19,380
who would be

534
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,410
her husband.

535
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,450
How time flies!

536
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,990
Now she’s getting married.

537
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,140
Chun, if you need anything

538
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,100
or want anything,

539
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,680
just tell me.

540
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,010
Let the servants

541
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,560
do everything.

542
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,050
Don’t get exhausted.

543
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:41,480
Father, I am not tired at all.

544
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,880
When you marry me to Yan Xun,

545
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:46,080
this is the best award for me.

546
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:48,020
I feel happy from the bottom of my heart

547
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,610
and I don’t feel tired at all.

548
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,040
I’ll leave you alone.

549
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,340
I gotta go.

550
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,960
I’m getting in.

551
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,240
After the wedding,

552
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,780
you will go back to Yanbei together.

553
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,950
It’ll be a long trip.

554
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,890
I wonder

555
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:13,200
when we can

556
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,440
meet again.

557
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,280
Don’t worry, Your Majesty.

558
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,200
When you want to see the Princess,

559
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,750
I can take her back to see you

560
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,500
at any time.

561
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,610
Haven’t you lived enough

562
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:27,490
in this city?

563
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:31,190
Chang’an is wealthier than anywhere else.

564
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,910
I love it without doubt.

565
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,800
If I didn’t miss my hometown too much,

566
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,840
I would be living here forever.

567
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:41,490
By the way,

568
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,630
I haven’t picked the general

569
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,050
who would take you back to Yanbei.

570
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:46,940
Do you have any friend

571
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,570
in the army?

572
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:49,910
Choose one

573
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,500
who can send you back

574
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,120
in case you get bored on the way.

575
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:56,080
Pick whoever you want, Your Majesty.

576
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:58,550
No?

577
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,580
Isn’t Yuwen Yue

578
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,530
your friend?

579
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:04,760
I can transfer him from Cavalry Battalion

580
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,790
so that he can take you back to Yanbei.

581
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,030
His Majesty, to tell you the truth,

582
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,110
we were friends only when we were little.

583
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:16,770
Having not met each other for three years,

584
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,170
we are now strangers.

585
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,370
You were childhood friends.

586
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,790
Even if you’re not close now,

587
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,670
you will get to know each other soon.

588
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,470
Never mind.

589
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,090
Your Majesty.

590
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,000
I’m no longer a friend with Yuwen Yue.

591
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,490
Please choose someone else.

592
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,130
After he came back this time,

593
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,890
didn’t you meet him?

594
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,510
No.

595
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,250
No?

596
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,280
Achu.

597
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,110
You can walk?

598
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,900
I’m nearly recovered.

599
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,870
So is my wound.

600
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,300
Then I come out for a walk.

601
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,820
Your healing ability

602
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,380
is incredible.

603
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,480
Where is Yan Xun?

604
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,210
He visited the Empress Dowager last night

605
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:09,260
and didn’t come back.

606
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,060
Maybe he was asked to stay overnight.

607
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,170
Achu.

608
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,320
Are you going back to Cavalry Battalion?

609
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,030
No.

610
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,410
Yan Xun asked for a leave for me.

611
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,240
That’s good, then.

612
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,870
What happened?

613
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,620
Nothing. It doesn’t concern you.

614
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:36,710
Never mind.

615
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,360
Miss Yu,

616
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:40,880
I can see from your face

617
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,870
that something did happen.

618
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,830
Tell me what it is.

619
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:47,710
Someone from Xiuli Army came,

620
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,890
asking to see you.

621
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,400
I stopped him.

622
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,360
Someone from Xiuli Army?

623
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,450
His name is Ge Qi.

624
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:57,840
He asked

625
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,410
if you remembered a warrant

626
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:00,140
granted by Yuwen Yue

627
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,100
with which you could get new bows

628
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,130
for Xiuli Army from the arsenal.

629
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,690
I remember.

630
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,240
I gave it to He Xiao.

631
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,400
What? Did he not get them?

632
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:09,750
He said

633
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,200
He Xiao lost that warrant.

634
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,120
But people in the arsenal said

635
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,360
they received the warrant

636
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,570
and they gave the bows and arrows

637
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,840
to Xiuli Army.

638
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,120
However, no such weapons

639
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,710
can be found in Xiuli Army.

640
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,210
Now, He Xiao is arrested

641
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,300
and accused of embezzling weapons.

642
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,630
He is to be executed.

643
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,970
Executed? When?

644
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,280
At noon today.

645
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,070
At noon today?

646
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,770
I’ll go and check it.

647
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,500
He Xiao, time is running out.

648
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,160
Are you going to confess or not?

649
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,080
I have nothing to confess.

650
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,210
I lost the warrant.

651
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,070
I should take the blame for that.

652
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,360
However, Commander!

653
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:02,580
You accuse me of embezzling soldiers’ pay

654
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,320
and reselling military weapons.

655
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,420
I will never

656
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,620
plead guilty.

657
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,690
You sound stubborn!

658
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:16,280
Fine. Since you don’t confess to me,

659
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,370
confess to the demons

660
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,150
in the hell.

661
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,120
He Xiao embezzled soldiers’ pay

662
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,260
and resold military weapons.

663
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:27,000
According to military laws,
he should be executed!

664
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,180
Commander!

665
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,980
Neither Chief Commander
nor Deputy Commander is here.

666
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:30,840
How can you decide alone

667
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,330
such an important issue?

668
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:35,080
Mr. He has been in the army for years.

669
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,030
He is conscientious and loving!

670
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,820
He came to Chang’an

671
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,600
with no family around!

672
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,170
What does he need money for?

673
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,720
Yeah.

674
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,540
He is a good man!

675
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,930
Don’t kill the innocent man!

676
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:49,730
Don’t kill the innocent man!

677
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:52,880
- Don’t kill the innocent man!
- Shut up!

678
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,120
The evidence for his sin is conclusive.

679
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,930
As the commander of Xiuli Army,

680
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,760
I have the authority to punish him.

681
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,920
But you plead for him.

682
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,460
Are you his confederates?

683
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,300
Commander Xue.

684
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,670
Don’t sling mud at us!

685
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,770
Don’t sling mud at us!

686
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:07,680
Don’t sling mud at us!

687
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,230
- Don’t sling mud at us!
- Shut up!

688
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,560
Don’t sling mud at us!

689
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,790
There is human testimony
and material evidence.

690
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:14,730
I won’t take the blame

691
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,920
for slinging mud at you!

692
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,320
But look at you!

693
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:21,570
You slandered your superior.

694
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,190
What punishment do you think you deserve?

695
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:23,820
Our Vice Commander

696
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,580
isn’t a corrupt man.

697
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,590
Let him go!

698
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,180
Let him go!

699
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:27,980
Let him go!

700
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,100
- Let him go!
- Shut up!

701
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,230
Let him go!

702
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,970
Are you going to rebel?

703
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,850
Let him go!

704
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,410
Let him go!

705
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:36,560
Dudes!

706
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,120
Let him go!

707
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,930
Let him go!

708
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,610
Dudes.

709
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,330
I appreciate

710
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,660
your help.

711
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,110
However,

712
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,460
I took you to Chang’an,

713
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,640
leaving our hometown behind

714
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,250
and struggled for life,

715
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,250
not because I wanted you

716
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,710
to get killed like this.

717
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,970
We can’t go home

718
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,850
or acknowledge our families.

719
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,280
Everyone hates us.

720
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:10,330
We’re even abandoned by the whole world,

721
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:13,900
only because

722
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,270
we’re known as traitors!

723
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,200
But I know

724
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,880
you are not.

725
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,610
Nor am I!

726
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:26,800
Who can tell me

727
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,580
the highest honor

728
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,400
for a soldier?

729
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,820
Die in the battlefield!

730
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:38,710
Dudes, I don’t think

731
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:41,600
I’ve got a chance
to die in the battlefield.

732
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:43,920
Therefore,

733
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,930
you must survive.

734
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,310
When you have a chance
to protect your country,

735
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:51,670
and fight in the battlefield,

736
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,790
kill more enemies for me!

737
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,880
Use your blood

738
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,780
to wash off the shame

739
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,240
we’ve carried!

740
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,270
When I saw that in heaven,

741
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,990
I would be grateful!

742
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,760
Cut the crap.

743
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,350
Time is out. Kill him.

744
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:19,220
You can’t kill him!

745
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:19,960
What are you doing?

746
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,850
You can’t kill him!

747
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:21,760
Time is out!

748
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,530
You can’t kill him!

749
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:26,890
Stop!

750
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,580
Stop!

751
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,050
Ms. Chu?

752
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,260
What are you coming for?

753
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,170
What are you doing, Commander?

754
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:45,100
Punishing a sinner
according to military laws.

755
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,940
What is He Xiao’s sin?

756
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:50,440
He embezzled soldiers’ pay
and resold military weapons.

757
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,860
Which pay?

758
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,780
Bows and arrows

759
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,480
General Yuwen granted us.

760
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,930
He Xiao said he lost the warrant

761
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:59,380
and couldn’t take them back.

762
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:01,460
But according to the arsenal,

763
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,260
they received the warrant

764
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,440
and delivered the weapons.

765
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,940
If he hadn’t stolen them,

766
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,350
who else could have done that?

767
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,940
Maybe someone got the weapons

768
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,060
in his name?

769
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,360
I don’t know that.

770
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,910
Even so,

771
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,750
he is to blame for dropping the warrant

772
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,580
and making the weapons gone!

773
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:18,190
He should be killed as well!

774
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,400
Fine, do it then.

775
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,170
Ms. Chu.

776
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,570
What do you mean?

777
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,250
General Yuwen gave the warrant to me.

778
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:36,470
I lost it.

779
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:37,940
It didn’t concern He Xiao.

780
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,150
He was just taking the blame for me.

781
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,280
Ms. Chu.

782
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:40,910
Say no more.

783
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,360
I am on a mission given by His Majesty.

784
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,750
Also, I am a military officer.

785
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:46,490
The warrant was given to me.

786
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:47,440
I should take the blame

787
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,190
for its loss.

788
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:53,010
Ms. Chu, you asked

789
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:54,340
to get involved.

790
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,750
Do you think

791
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:58,600
I don’t dare to kill you?

792
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:01,910
You certainly dare.

793
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,130
As the Commander,

794
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:05,310
you dare to kill anyone.

795
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:06,750
However,

796
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,810
let me remind you.

797
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,170
When the Crown Prince Xiao Ce
was assassinated,

798
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,640
I stayed with him

799
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:13,260
and protected him.

800
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:14,150
The Crown Prince Xiao Ce

801
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:15,630
pleaded to His Majesty on my behalf.

802
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:18,020
His Majesty allowed me
to get recovered first

803
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,910
before he rewarded me later.

804
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:21,280
If you want to kill me,

805
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,360
you’d better report to your superior,

806
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:25,650
in case you get into trouble

807
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:27,360
due to your own decision.

808
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:29,440
Commander Xue.

809
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:31,610
I’m saying it for your own good.

810
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:37,230
Fine, I’m going to report it.

811
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:39,590
I’d like to see

812
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,620
how much support you can have!

813
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:44,880
You two, stay on your knees!

814
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:46,650
See you, Commander Xue.

815
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:53,440
