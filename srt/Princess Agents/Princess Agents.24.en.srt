You can see Jiuyou Platform from here.

Chun.

18
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,200
Whatever you’re doing now

19
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,470
can’t change anything.

20
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,430
Mother.

21
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,210
How could you be so heartless?

22
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,080
Yan Xun is a suspect of rebellion.

23
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,190
If you speak up for him openly,

24
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,990
you will be against your father.

25
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,160
By that time,

26
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,830
all your maids,

27

your brother and I

Mother.

30
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,210
Why did you take us

31
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,690
to the execution ground?

32
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,480
I want you here

33
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,940
to show you

34
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,070
that whoever you are,

00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,180
whatever title you hold,

36
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:54,980
you could be

37
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,960
on the chopping block.

Chief Supervisor of Execution

41

shall read the imperial edict!

Kneel!

43
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,540
The edict is as follows:

44
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,650
Marquis Dingbei, Yan Shicheng,

45
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,170
acted against heaven and earth,

46
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,500
bent the law,

47
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,300
misled the public,

48
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,780
sided with the crooked

49
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,800
and rebelled against the state.

50
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,550
He discarded justice,

51
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,320
built imperial pantheons,

52
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,430
assembled private troops secretly.

53
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,310
His heart of disloyalty

54
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,570
is evident to all.

55
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,550
Also, he dispatched troops to Chang’an

56
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,100
to take over the capital city.

57
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,220
His grave sins

58
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,300
are too numerous to be listed.

59
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,370
Thanks to heaven,

60
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,450
the revolt has been squashed,

61
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,580
and rebels have been exterminated.

62
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,640
Given that Yan Xun

63
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,140
grew up in the capital

64
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,430
and didn’t get involved in the rebellion,

65
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,070
he’s ordered to identify the culprits

66
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,140
and watch their punishments

67
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,990
to redeem himself.

68
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,040
Respect this.

= Jiuyou Platform =

70
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,420

71
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,150
Yes.

72
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,420
My family…

73
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,140
Send in the traitors!

74
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,670
Your Excellency Yan Xun,

75
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,920
they all have been executed

76
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,180
except you and your mother.

77
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,570
No one else is left.

78
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,550
Your Excellency Yan Xun, please receive the edict.

79
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,310
Kneel!

80
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,120
Yan Xun!

81
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,010
- Yan Xun!
- On your knees!

82
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:23,870
Kneel!

83
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,950
Yan Xun!

84
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,690
Identify the corpses as requested.

85
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:32,750
On your knees!

86
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,820
Then you will be spared.

87
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,340
Look, look!

88
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,440
He is revolting!

89
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,710
Kill him now!

90
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:14,960
Don’t!

91
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:18,660
Don’t!

92
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,320
Challenging the imperial edict

93
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,990
equals a capital offence.

94
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,610
Seize him!

95
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,790
Aye!

96
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,440
Wait!

97
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,140
Yan Xun.

98
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,000
Pick up the edict

99
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,280
and thank His Majesty!

100
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,020
Yan Xun, receive the edict.

101
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,150
It’s noon!

102
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,040
Time for the roll call.

103
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,380
Yan Xun!

104
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,420
Get up!

105
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:22,990
If you can’t do it,

106
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,410
I will.

107
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,150
Your Excellency Yan Xun.

108
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,620
It’s been a while

109
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,120
since you met your father, hasn’t it?

110
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:08,810
Come here.

111
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,600
Say hello to him.

112
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,250
Yuwen Huai!

113
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,880
Come here.

114
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,160
Yuwen Huai!

115
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,470
Don’t move.

116
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,780
Kill him if he refuses to comply.

117
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,930
Yan Xun!

118
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,250
See?

119
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,870
This is the cost of disobedience.

120
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,370
This is too much.

121
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,300
Why?

122
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,540
Why are they doing this

123
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,150
to Yan Xun?

124
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,410
Father!

125
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,630
Step down.

126
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,840
Yan Xun!

127
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,050
Yan Xun!

128
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,790
Yan Xun!

129
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,450
Yan Xun!

130
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,620
Get up!

131
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,780
Get up!

132
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:17,920
Move!

133
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,480
Yan Xun!

134
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,620
Yan Xun!

135
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,100
Yan Xun!

136
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,270
Yan Xun!

137
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,000
Disobeying the edict deserves the death penalty.

138
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,310
Go check if he is dead.

139
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,220
He seems so!

140
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,030
Yuwen Yue.

141
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,560
Go check

142
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,960
if your buddy is still breathing.

143
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,940
Jiuyou Platform is sacred.

144
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,390
He didn’t kneel or obey the edict.

145
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,560
That’s an act of revolt.

146
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,520
Bowmen!

147
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,010
Yan Xun.

148
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,410
Don’t come up again.

149
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,060
Chun!

150
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:30,750
Chun!

151
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,330
Yan Xun, please!

152
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,690
Don’t stand up again.

153
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,700
- Yan Xun!
- Chun!

154
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,390
- Yan Xun!
- Chun!

155
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,660
Yan Xun.

156
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,690
Don’t!

157
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,690
Mother.

158
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:20,380
Please do something!

159
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,430
He’s dying!

160
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,670
We’re losing him!

161
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,670
Please help him, Mother.

162
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,410
Mother!

163
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,780
Brother.

164
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,710
Please help him.

165
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,160
Do something.

166
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,610
Please save him.

167
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,120
Yan Xun!

168
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,620
Yan Xun!

169
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,800
Yan Xun!

170
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,050
Let go of me!

171
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,310
Let go!

172
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,460
Chun!

173
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,490
How dare you!

174
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,760
Obey the imperial edict now.

175
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:46,910
No identification is needed.

176
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,390
Execute them now.

177
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,890
Don’t you dare!

178
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,470
I’m given the order to execute rebels.

179
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,970
Are you following it or against it?

180
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,190
I hope I can

181
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,950
buy him more time.

182
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,930
The edict clearly stipulates

183
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,110
only after Yan Xun identifies the corpses

184
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:30,270
can the execution proceed.

185
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,620
Receive the edict, followed by identification.

186
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,110
Execute them now.

187
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:38,810
I will take

188
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,450
full responsibility for it.

189
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,850
If you disobey,

190
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,290
I can kill you right now.

191
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,780
If Yan Xun still refuses to obey,

192
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,430
I will end him right here.

193
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,240
Let me remind you again.

194
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,750
Xing’er is right over there.

195
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,450
Apparently, I’ll have to do it myself.

196
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,750
I’ll do it!

197
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,110
Wait!

198
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,970
Mr. Yuwen,

199
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,210
I’ll identify the corpses.

200
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,540
Those up there

201
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,510
are my husband,

202
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,460
sons and daughter.

203
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,360
They’re my family.

204
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,730
I believe

205
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,940
no one else

206
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,010
is more eligible than me

207
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,510
to identify their corpses.

208
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,090
Ma’am,

209
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,460
who allowed you to come here?

210
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,300
His Majesty, the Emperor.

211
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,520
His Majesty has issued an edict

212
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,110
to task me with the identification.

213
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:01,150
My son, Yan Xun, is young and ignorant.

214
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,160
I am sorry he offended you, Master Huai.

215
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,570
The edict is on the way.

216
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,270
You won’t disobey

217
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,270
His Majesty, will you?

218
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,330
Xun.

219
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,400
Mother.

220
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,100
Xun!

221
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,400
Xun!

222
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,970
Xun!

223
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,470
Xun!

224
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,380
Xun!

225
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,750
Mother!

226
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,760
It’s them.

227
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,410
They destroyed Yanbei.

228
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,200
Why?

229
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,400
Xun.

230
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,860
Do you believe your father?

231
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,760
I do.

232
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,840
Then don’t ask why.

233
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,700
Not everything

234
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,280
in this world

235
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:23,950
has its reason.

236
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,950
Like tigers eat wolves,

237
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,310
wolves eat rabbits,

238
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,300
rabbits eat grass.

239
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,830
All that happens without a reason.

240
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,660
Our family…

241
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:55,610
Father, eldest brother

242
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,640
sister…

243
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,190
This is my husband,

244
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:52,020
Marquis Dingbei of Yanbei,

245
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:56,760
Grand Marshal of Northwestern Wei,

246
00:37:58,730 --> 00:37:59,840
Yan Shicheng.

247
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,210
This scar

248
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,520
was left by a sword

249
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,210
outside the Palace

250
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:19,460
when quashing Prince Qi’s revolt.

251
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:23,290
Those rebels burned the Palace

252
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,640
and trapped everyone inside.

253
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,520
Shicheng took his men

254
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,090
and risked his life to save them.

255
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:37,910
He found His Majesty first

256
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:41,310
who was then a prince.

257
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,690
He carried the unconscious prince

258
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,270
and fought his way out

259
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:00,500
amid three thousand enemy troops.

260
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,280
His body and hands

261
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,060
were wounded over 30 times.

262
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,750
He could barely get out of bed

263
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,570
until half a year later.

264
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,520
All that happened

265
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,370
when he just reached 17.

266
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,980
You are here to identify the dead,

267
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,420
not to spew nonsense.

268
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,310
Please continue, Ma’am.

269
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,320
This scar

270
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:50,050
is due to his wound

271
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,090
during the Baima Pass Battle.

272
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:55,980
They were mourning the ancestors that day.

273
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,820
The entire imperial family

274
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,230
was present.

275
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:05,370
But Rouran launched a sudden strike.

276
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,100
They crossed the Pass

277
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,510
and surrounded the Ancestral Temple.

278
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:11,070
After Shicheng learned the news,

279
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,380
he and his men set out from Yanbei.

280
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,140
After riding for

281
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,510
seven days and nights

282
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,290
without rest,

283
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,700
they rescued everyone from danger.

284
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,730
Your emperor

285
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:28,080
vowed right there

286
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,800
that Wei and Yanbei

287
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,190
would never betray each other.

288
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,290
Most of you

289
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:41,080
witnessed that, too.

290
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:58,160
My husband’s head

291
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,330
was cut off by you, Mr. Yuwen Huai

292
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,980
right outside Chang’an.

293
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,900
You are in your prime with sharp eyes.

294
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,520
You can certainly recognize

295
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,510
the cuts made by your sword.

296
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,800
Did you make this cut?

297
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,450
Isn’t this man Marquis Dingbei,

298
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:22,490
Yan Shicheng?

299
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,570
Don’t you know that?

300
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,290
I confirm,

301
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,300
this man is my husband,

302
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,800
Marquis Dingbei of Yanbei,

303
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,980
Yan Shicheng.

304
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,510
Where is the edict, Ma’am?

305
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,060
I can order them

306
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:05,270
to kill Yan Xun now!

307
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:19,300
