“A guest comes from afar,

17
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,980
presenting me with a lacquered zither.

18
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,770
The wood and strings

19
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,860
express how much I miss you.

20
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,880
I will play this tune forever.

21
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,220
My heart will never change.

22
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,390
May our love be as beautiful as songs,

23
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,960
and we always sing in harmony”.

Du Ping’an.

25
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,890
Come here.

26
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:45,770
Miss.

27
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,370
Who taught you that poem?

28
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,990
My mother taught me when I was young.

29
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,240
I’m sure

30
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,150
she must be

31
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,570
a literate woman.

32
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,760
She was a musician from Liang.

33
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,000
She could sing beautiful songs.

34
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,120
A musician from Liang?

35
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,300
Why did she come all the way

36
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,300
to Yanbei?

37
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,360
Because there are no slaves here.

38
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,950
After she and Father came here,

39
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,490
they regained their freedom.

40
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,600
And they settled down here.

41
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,450
Do you know

42
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,710
what that poem is about?

43
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,870
It’s about a couple

44
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,950
missing each other

45
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,800
when they were apart.

46
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,900
You are young.

47
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,570
Do you know what that means?

48
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,800
Of course. My father died young.

49
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,960
Whenever I missed him,

50
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,420
I’d play the flute

51
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,720
he made for me.

52
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,490
Miss,

53
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,420
the melody from your Tartar pipe was sad.

54
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,950
Were you missing someone?

55
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,560
Something was on my mind.

56
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,900
I hope I was wrong.

57
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,160
You may leave.

58
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,200
Aye.

59
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:46,890
Aye.

60
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,430
Now, they will

61
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,470
attack us at any time.

62
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,040
Prince Xiang.

63
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,290
Rise.

64
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,690
You’re finally back.

65
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,760
Yan Xun’s troops

66
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,370
are approaching as we speak.

67
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,710
I know.

68
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,240
So I rushed back

69
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,280
to Chang’an overnight.

70
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,490
I have planted traps

71
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,540
around the city.

72
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,830
It seems that

73
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,020
you have mobilized

74
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,050
tons of troops to protect Chang’an.

75
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,220
You have invested in

76
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,200
all your resources.

77
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,650
Of course I should match you.

78
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,190
All that

79
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,580
is of little use.

80
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,590
Now, I’m counting

81
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,610
on your traps.

82
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,280
They will surely take a toll

83
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,130
on those beasts.

84
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,120
The most sophisticated trap

85
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,690
can only hold them for so long.

86
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,830
Wei Shuye has occupied Yanbei.

87
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,460
Yan Xun is approaching Chang’an.

88
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,370
Those who will suffer

89
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,120
are the civilians.

90
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,240
What is it? Speak.

91
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,300
Things can’t get any worse.

92
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,150
The main force of Yan Xun

93
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,360
has gone through Meilin Pass,

94
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,400
and now heading straight to Chang’an.

95
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,050
They’ve robbed and massacred residents
along the way.

96
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,180
Those cities

97
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,040
are left almost empty.

98
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,300
I didn’t expect

99
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,510
Yan Xun would be so cruel and merciless.

100
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,800
After what happened at Jiuyou Platform,

101
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,550
he has completely changed.

102
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:33,990
Yuwen Yue.

103
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,100
Take the Death Camp

104
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,830
and bring Chun back.

105
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,980
At least,

106
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,640
bring back the commander’s tally.

107
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,860
Distant water can’t put out a nearby fire.

108
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,920
Moreover, Chun is surrounded

109
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,840
by a group of masters.

110
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,810
Even the Death Camp

111
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,690
can’t make it.

112
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,340
Well then...

113
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,400
Kill them.

114
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,610
His Majesty has sent Yuan Song there.

115
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,690
I’m sure he has a plan.

116
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,210
You still want to protect Chun.

117
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,970
Yuan Song

118
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,910
is the best candidate

119
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,480
as he won’t hurt her,

120
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,000
or let her do anything stupid.

121
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,520
But now,

122
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,290
the only way out

123
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,690
is to assassinate Yan Xun.

124
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,280
Once he’s gone,

125
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,790
Chang’an won’t fall

126
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,110
into a bigger holocaust

127
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,170
than it already does.

128
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:37,970
We can

129
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,330
have a try.

130
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,440
Your Highness, are you awake?

131
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,220
Anything from Zhong Yu?

132
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,430
Has Achu arrived in Lancheng?

133
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,640
Not yet.

134
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,140
What if she isn’t on her way there?

135
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:35,970
I don’t think so.

136
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,840
Please be at ease, Your Highness. I’m sure

137
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,020
- you’ll hear from her soon.
- Report!

138
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,930
Your Highness,
Zhong Yu’s message has arrived.

139
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,930
Miss Chu has taken over the Xiuli Army

140
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,070
to guard Hongchuan.

141
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,000
They have already

142
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,010
fought twice there.

143
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,100
What did you say?

144
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,050
She’s still in Hongchuan?

145
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,500
She’s way outnumbered.

146
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,970
Aren’t they fighting an unwinnable battle?

147
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,290
Your Highness! Your Highness!

148
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,380
Your Highness!

149
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:04,610
Your Highness.

150
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,300
Where are you going?

151
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,150
Get off me.

152
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:08,640
Your Highness!

153
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,400
Let go!

154
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,460
If you go back to Yanbei,

155
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,110
what about the main force outside?

156
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,370
We have almost

157
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,630
reached Chang’an.

158
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,830
Your Highness.

159
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,670
There is a secret tunnel in Hongchuan.

160
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,430
Even if the city is lost,

161
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,260
Miss Chu can still escape

162
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,250
from that tunnel.

163
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,590
Now that she’s back,

164
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,970
she’s determined to guard the city.

165
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,150
I know her well.

166
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,250
She will not leave whatsoever.

167
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,560
Your Highness. You should focus
on the big picture.

168
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:46,650
Ajing, tell Zhong Yu

169
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,870
that she has two days

170
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,510
to get Achu out of Hongchuan.

171
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,790
That’s my one and only order.

172
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:56,720
Aye.

173
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,150
Chun, Prince Yuan Qi is dead.

174
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,140
Killing him is a capital crime.

175
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,780
I’ve already committed one by coming here.

176
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,090
If you are scared,

177
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,130
just leave.

178
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,430
What are you talking about?

179
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,260
You knew perfectly well

180
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,450
that I would never leave you alone here.

181
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,050
Why are you doing this?

182
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:39,970
Chun.

183
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,280
I’m worried about you.

184
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,450
Prince Yu!

185
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,500
Step aside.

186
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,320
Prince Yu.

187
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:52,990
Prince Yu.

188
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,040
What brings you here?

189
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,290
If I didn’t come,

190
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,220
you’d cause

191
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,470
even bigger trouble.

192
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,220
Wei Shuye.

193
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,450
Chun is young and ignorant.

194
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,870
But why did you make such mistakes
with her?

195
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,510
Do you know what it means

196
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,100
that she came here

197
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,520
with the tally and the imperial guards?

198
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,690
All that was my idea.

199
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,390
It had nothing to do with others.

200
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,800
I will take full responsibility.

201
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,730
You?

202
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,050
But how?

203
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,630
Chun.

204
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,890
Don’t be stubborn, please!

205
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,900
It is not too late to stop.

206
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,460
Father was furious knowing
that you stole the tally.

207
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,880
Have you thought about Mother?

208
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,040
We aren’t the same.

209
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,490
My business

210
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,040
has nothing to do with her.

211
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,040
That’s absurd!

212
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,140
You are her daughter.

213
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,970
If you do something wrong,

214
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,220
Mother will have to bear the consequence.

215
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,250
Chun.

216
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,870
Go back with me and apologize to Father.

217
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,200
I have already

218
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,640
crossed the line,

219
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,390
and nothing will stop me.

220
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,030
I’m well aware

221
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,740
of the consequence.

222
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,150
So there’s no need

223
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,080
to hesitate.

224
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,450
Once I take Hongchuan,

225
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,420
and take my revenge on Chu Qiao,

226
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,550
even if Father wants my head,

227
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,980
I will give it to him.

228
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,480
Chun.

229
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,590
Don’t go down the wrong path further,

230
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,430
please?

231
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,040
I also heard

232
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,240
Yan Xun had set off
from Yanbei to take Chang’an.

233
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,400
Towns and cities along the way
had been lost.

234
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,200
There are no troops to back up Chang’an.

235
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,590
If Chang’an is lost, too,

236
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,080
our state will collapse because of you.

237
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,500
What did you say?

238
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,680
Yan Xun is heading to Chang’an?

239
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,070
How could it be possible?

240
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,140
What about Yanbei?

241
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,690
What about

242
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,190
that tramp Chu Qiao?

243
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:51,970
Chun.

244
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,280
Even if you take over Yanbei, then what?

245
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,780
Without Chang’an,

246
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,240
we’ll lose everything.

247
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,110
Listen to me and go back with me.

248
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,370
No.

249
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:15,570
In this case,

250
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:16,790
I cannot leave!

251
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,960
Just give me one more day.

252
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,940
Just one day!

253
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,610
I will kill Chu Qiao.

254
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,750
I will take over Hongchuan

255
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,130
and chop Chu Qiao into pieces!

256
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,010
Then I will drop her head

257
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,220
in front of Yan Xun.

258
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,370
That’s how my revenge should be served!

259
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,040
- Have you ever
- I...

260
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,160
considered the locals in Chang’an?

261
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:32,930
Chun.

262
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,560
Please listen to Prince Yu.

263
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,400
We’re running out of time!

264
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,900
Those defending the city are some mobs

265
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,530
led by a humble maid.

266
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,800
A prince

267
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,550
and a distinguished general combined

268
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,110
aren’t even her match.

269
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,950
How could I count on you

270
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,670
to defeat Yan Xun and protect Chang’an?

271
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,920
If we

272
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,840
give up now,

273
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,450
all the effort we’ve made

274
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,370
will be in vain.

275
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,720
I will never allow that to happen.

276
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,160
Guards.

277
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,790
Escort Prince Yu back to the capital.

278
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,810
- Aye.
- Aye.

279
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,680
Chun.

280
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,260
Young Master.

281
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,140
I will figure out a way

282
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,180
to send Mo back tomorrow.

283
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,930
He snuck in.

284
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,080
We can’t keep him here.

285
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,370
I can’t do anything about him.

286
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,350
How could you?

287
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,960
He can’t stay with us.

288
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,930
This place could be struck by war

289
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:25,730
at any time.

290
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:26,830
It’s too dangerous.

291
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,960
That boy

292
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,710
has experienced a narrow escape.

293
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,450
What’s to fear

294
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,560
in this situation?

295
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,030
The thing he is most afraid of
is being abandoned.

296
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,290
Young Master.

297
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,330
I have located

298
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:49,930
Yan Xun’s tent.

299
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,330
We can take action at any time.

300
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,190
Wait for my order.

301
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,010
Don’t act rashly.

302
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,020
I understand.

303
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,950
Miss Chu is asleep. Stop!

304
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,480
Step aside. It’s urgent!

305
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:09,890
No!

306
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:10,720
Move!

307
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,390
You can come back

308
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,110
tomorrow morning.

309
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:12,960
- Ping’an.
- Move!

310
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,840
Let him in.

311
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,770
Miss Chu!

312
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,790
Get off me!

313
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:18,930
Miss Chu!

314
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:19,600
Get out.

315
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:26,860
Miss Chu.

316
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,830
Song Qifeng?

317
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,610
Weren’t you in Lancheng

318
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,530
with Zhong Yu?

319
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,830
Is she here to back me up?

320
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,370
She asked me

321
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,280
to see you

322
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,750
for something important.

323
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,220
Where is she?

324
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,820
Right outside the city.

325
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,180
Achu, it’s me.

326
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,810
Hongchuan will soon be lost.

327
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,620
Stop wasting your time.

328
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,690
His Highness ordered me to take you away.

329
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:08,910
This place is not safe.

330
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,850
I will explain it to you on the way.

331
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,360
Tell me,

332
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:14,660
you knew

333
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,940
the situation in Hongchuan

334
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,020
and how someone had run wild long ago,

335
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,360
didn’t you?

336
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,280
Yes.

337
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,560
I knew.

338
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,850
Wei Army split up

339
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,340
and fought their way across Chiyuan Ferry

340
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,270
to attack Hongchuan.

341
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:36,550
Did you know that?

342
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:38,940
I did.

343
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,600
Cheng Yuan excluded refugees,

344
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,840
killed our own people
and abandoned the city.

345
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,250
Did you know that?

346
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,710
I did.

347
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,150
Once Hongchuan is occupied,

348
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,720
there will be a massacre

349
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,580
of millions of civilians in Yanbei.

350
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,910
All of them will be slaughtered.

351
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,360
Did you know all that, too?

352
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:12,960
I did.

353
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,270
Why?

354
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,470
Why didn’t you stop it

355
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,840
while you knew everything?

356
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,250
Achu.

357
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,890
You still don’t get it?

358
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,880
There is no troop of Yanbei

359
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,780
in Lancheng right now.

360
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,340
The forces in Beishuo

361
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,750
have retreated.

362
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,280
Not only in Lancheng,

363
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,940
there aren’t enough troops

364
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,740
in Yanbei.

365
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,760
The hinterland of Yanbei

366
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,070
is wide open to anyone.

367
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,580
Any force of Wei

368
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,050
can take it.

369
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,730
But I couldn’t stop Cheng Yuan,

370
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,660
and I wasn’t ordered to do so.

371
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,890
The only mission I have got

372
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:46,950
is to take you away.

373
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,120
Other than that,

374
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:50,400
I haven’t received

375
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,390
any orders.

376
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,900
Yan Xun…

377
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,960
His Highness is not at Meilin Pass.

378
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,140
Are you crazy?

379
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:11,920
Yes.

380
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:15,230
It’s crazy, but it works.

381
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,640
Our main force

382
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,640
has pierced

383
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,260
Wei’s defense

384
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,330
and is heading straight to Chang’an.

385
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,700
The east and south wing

386
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,050
of Wei

387
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,590
are too far away to help.

388
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,370
A dozen cities in the northwest

389
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:25,890
have surrendered.

390
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,360
At this point, speed is the key.

391
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,810
The Black Eagle Army

392
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,040
will soon strike

393
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,740
the capital of Wei.

394
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,640
Achu.

395
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,330
His Highness knew that you would never

396
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,160
agree to his plan.

397
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,860
That’s why he kept it from you.

398
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,450
But that didn’t mean
that he didn’t trust you.

399
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,900
Yanbei’s poor condition

400
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,320
greatly limits

401
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,200
our development.

402
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,710
No matter how hard we try,

403
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,800
we can’t rival Wei.

404
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,230
Now that we’re outmanned,

405
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,270
it’s better to distract the enemy.

406
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,410
Only if

407
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,290
we launch the counterattack

408
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,360
by surprise

409
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,790
can we turn things around.

410
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,410
You are the closest person
to His Highness.

411
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,400
You should understand him.

412
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,860
To create

413
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,780
your so-called distraction,

414
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,810
you used millions

415
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,020
of innocent lives as the bait

416
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,990
and cannon fodder?

417
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,390
Achu.

418
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:30,980
Yes.

419
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,680
I did have my doubts.

420
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,400
I doubted Yan Xun.

421
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:39,830
That he

422
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,570
led the army to attack Meilin Pass

423
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,080
to wear out

424
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,010
the main force of the Second Troop

425
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,620
to strengthen his position in Yanbei.

426
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,310
But never have I imagined

427
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,350
that Yan Xun couldn’t care less

428
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,430
about Yanbei.

429
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,300
He used millions of civilians in Yanbei

430
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,250
as the bait

431
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,120
to set up a huge trap

432
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,290
at Hongchuan

433
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,300
to lure all the forces of Wei

434
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,610
to come here.

435
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,620
Then to everyone’s surprise,

436
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,620
he commanded the First Troop

437
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,430
and the crack troops in Lancheng

438
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,330
to fight his way into the land of Wei.

439
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:17,700
No wonder

440
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,340
before the war,

441
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,420
he emphasized the redirection of troops

442
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,690
to attack Meilin Pass.

443
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,100
No wonder

444
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,780
he didn’t bring me with him.

445
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,160
No wonder

446
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,110
the emergency signals I sent out

447
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,410
weren’t responded.

448
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,410
And my personal bodyguards

449
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,070
are all

450
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,220
Yan Xun’s trusted followers.

451
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,590
And Lancheng did nothing

452
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,950
to help Hongchuan out.

453
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,270
He is calculative

454
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,160
and scheming.

455
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,000
His plan is thorough and vicious.

456
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,770
Every step is organized and merciless.

457
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,350
That’s beyond my imagination.

458
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,700
Is he still that Yan Xun I know?

459
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,320
What about our agreement?

460
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,660
Zhong Yu.

461
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,450
Do you remember

462
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,090
what you said to me

463
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,160
when we met for the first time?

464
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,600
I do.

465
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,530
I said I hope one day,

466
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:48,930
in Yanbei,

467
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,530
there will be no orphans like you.

468
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:53,990
Yes.

469
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,780
Once we win,

470
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,750
there will be no orphans like me

471
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,270
in Yanbei.

472
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,480
Because people of Yanbei

473
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,170
will be completely annihilated!

474
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,020
Achu.

475
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,370
You have to lose something
to gain something.

476
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,270
If we want to live a peaceful life,

477
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,550
there will be a necessary sacrifice.

478
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,000
People of Yanbei

479
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,150
worship you as if you were God.

480
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,220
But you brazenly

481
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,180
tread on them.

482
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,120
Is that what you call

483
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,860
a necessary sacrifice

484
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,200
for peace?

485
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,650
Achu.

486
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,480
This is

487
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,070
strategically correct.

488
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,930
We will soon conquer Chang’an.

489
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,960
The ruler of Wei

490
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,480
will be shivering in front of

491
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,120
our army.

492
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,820
That’ll be a historic success.

493
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,720
Can’t you see that?

494
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,490
You should have seen it, Achu.

495
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,710
Yes.

496
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,520
That is

497
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,750
strategically correct.

498
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,300
But you abandoned

499
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,720
people who supported you.

500
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,880
You let them down.

501
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,840
You deceived them.

502
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:15,300
You sacrificed them

503
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,930
in order to

504
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,030
achieve your ambition.

505
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:23,730
Zhong Yu.

506
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,770
What is wrong with you?

507
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,070
Have you forgotten

508
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,320
what you said?

509
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,710
Achu.

510
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,340
Over the past days,

511
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,820
no matter how difficult

512
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,450
the situation was,

513
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,530
no matter how desperate

514
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:41,390
we were,

515
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,450
I always believed

516
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,600
you would come to rescue us.

517
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,150
Xiuli Army,

518
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,680
those so-called traitors

519
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,470
in your eyes,

520
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,970
came back here

521
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:50,920
to protect our people.

522
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,260
And what about you?

523
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,790
What did you do?

524
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,080
You gave them up.

525
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,960
Achu. Are you going back?

526
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,170
Yanbei is not my hometown,

527
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:08,880
but it always stands for

528
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,870
my faith.

529
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,310
You don’t want it, but I do.

530
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,570
You abandoned it,

531
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,790
but I didn’t.

532
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,530
Tell Yan Xun,

533
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,810
if I die,

534
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,800
don’t take revenge for me.

535
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,810
Because I am not killed by others

536
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
but him.

537
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,240
I can’t let you go.

538
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,260
Unless I die,

539
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,940
I won’t

540
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,910
leave Yanbei.

541
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,290
Zhong Yu.

542
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,800
The worst hasn’t come yet.

543
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,170
It’s not too late to stop.

544
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,110
Tell Yan Xun

545
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:00,960
I will be waiting for him

546
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,690
in Hongchuan.

547
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,460
Zhong Yu.

548
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,030
How could you let Miss Chu leave?

549
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,520
His Highness reiterated that

550
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,240
we must keep everything from her.

551
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,520
Yanbei, my dearest home,

552
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,530
I’m sorry.

553
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,350
I love you deeply,

554
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,170
but this is the only thing

555
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,800
I can do.

556
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,330
Report back to His Highness

557
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:35,130
that Miss Chu insists on staying
in Hongchuan.

558
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,810
Yanbei will be lost
if he doesn’t come in five days.

559
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,430
No one will survive by then.

560
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:42,500
Aye.

561
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:01,480
Have you found her?

562
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,200
No.

563
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:03,420
What about you?

564
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,310
Me either.

565
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,650
Commander,

566
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,180
no sign of Miss Chu in the city.

567
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,910
She’d never abandon us.

568
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:09,860
She didn’t abandon us

569
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,840
back in Chang’an,

570
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,950
and she certainly won’t now.

571
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:12,770
I agree.

572
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:13,730
Miss Chu would never

573
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:14,850
give us up.

574
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,540
She wouldn’t escape.

575
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,770
Without her,

576
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,180
what should we do?

577
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:19,930
What to do?

578
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:20,910
What about us?

579
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:21,760
Yes.

580
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,850
What should we do?

581
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:23,380
Yes.

582
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,600
Shut up.

583
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,700
If I hear anyone

584
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,420
spreading rumors

585
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,050
to ruin Miss Chu’s reputation,

586
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:31,780
I’ll execute them

587
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,840
for demoralizing the troops.

588
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:35,410
Listen to me.

589
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,920
Follow Miss Chu’s arrangement.

590
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,610
Go up and guard the city!

591
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,570
- Aye!
- Aye!

592
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:42,190
Let’s go!

593
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:06,560
Miss Chu is back!

594
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,550
- Miss Chu is back!
- Miss Chu is back!

595
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,830
- Miss Chu is back!
- Miss Chu is back!

596
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:09,970
- Miss Chu is back!
- Miss Chu is back!

597
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:12,130
- Miss Chu is back!
- She’s back!

598
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,050
- Miss Chu is back!
- Miss Chu is back!

599
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,640
- Miss Chu is back!
- Miss Chu is back!

600
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,140
- Miss Chu is back!
- Miss Chu is back!

601
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,080
Warriors,

602
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,710
His Highness’s reinforcement is
on the way.

603
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:27,110
They will arrive in two days.

604
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,670
Pull yourselves together and fight!

605
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,960
Fight!

606
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,500
- Fight! Fight!
- Fight! Fight!

607
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,640
- Fight! Fight!
- Fight! Fight!

608
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,390
- Fight! Fight!
- Fight! Fight!

609
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,760
- Fight! Fight!
- Fight! Fight!

610
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,630
Light of fire!

611
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,040
They’re outside our range of fire.

612
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,950
Defense!

613
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,590
Go! Go!

614
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,020
= Hongchuan =

615
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:43,490
Go!

616
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,650
Hurry!

617
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:49,980
Are you all right?

618
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,100
Guards!

619
00:32:59,310 --> 00:32:59,950
Go!

620
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,040
Go!

621
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,650
Move!

622
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:05,710
Over there!

623
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:06,560
Aye.

624
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,710
Over there!

625
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:11,530
- Aye.
- Aye.

626
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:12,240
That way!

627
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,240
Aye.

628
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:31,490
Miss Chu!

629
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:34,210
Go!

630
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,550
Go! Go!

631
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,330
Ping’an.

632
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:37,660
I am going to give you an important task.

633
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:38,990
When I’m not around,

634
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,260
you’ll represent me.

635
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,340
Do everything you can

636
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,530
to escort civilians in the city

637
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:44,180
to get out.

638
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,160
Take the secret tunnel.

639
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,500
Once you arrive at Lancheng,

640
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,800
you will be safe.

641
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,320
Aye.

642
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,960
Miss, take care!

643
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,620
I want you back intact.

644
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,270
Go!

645
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:03,890
Go! Go!

646
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:05,700
Go!

647
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,950
Go that way!

648
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:28,830
Go!

649
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,060
Run!

650
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,760
Run! Run!

651
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,990
Run for life!

652
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,520
Run!

653
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:37,200
That way!

654
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,310
Go!

655
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,110
Go!

656
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:43,990
Go!

657
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,370
Go! Go!

658
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:59,820
Meilin Pass is under my control.

659
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,920
We’re one step away from taking Chang’an.

660
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,600
To all of you!

661
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,280
- To Your Highness!
- To Your Highness!

662
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,380
Your Highness.

663
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,700
Has Achu arrived in Lancheng?

664
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,520
Good. Everything is ready.

665
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,010
I failed, Your Highness.

666
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,450
Please punish me.

667
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:22,190
What happened?

668
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,730
According to Your Highness’s order,

669
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,960
I was supposed to take Miss Chu
out of Hongchuan

670
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,700
and let Zhong Yu take care of her.

671
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,450
But Miss Chu

672
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,050
refused to follow your order.

673
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,630
She threatened us with her life.

674
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,260
We could only let her go.

675
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,110
She threatened you with her life?

676
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,090
Yes.

677
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,340
She said

678
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,390
she’d go back to Hongchuan

679
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,250
and live and die with civilians there.

680
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,200
And she asked me to tell you

681
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,970
it’s not too late to stop.

682
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,320
She will be waiting for you in Hongchuan.

683
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,410
How long can Hongchuan hold

684
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,750
given its condition?

685
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,770
Hadn’t Miss Chu

686
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:09,860
commanded the troops to battle,

687
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,640
we would’ve lost Hongchuan long ago.

688
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,990
Now, they’re running out of food
and weapons.

689
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,460
There isn’t much time left for them.

690
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,430
Gather the troops.

691
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,010
Your Highness!

692
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:38,420
Say no more.

693
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,250
Pass my order.

694
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:54,940
Go back to Yanbei to support Hongchuan.

695
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,290
Aye.

696
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:03,550
Your Highness.

697
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,090
I’m here to support you.

698
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,200
What happened?

699
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,130
Miss Chu insists on guarding Hongchuan.

700
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,130
She is losing it.

701
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:08,950
His Highness is going back to Yanbei.

702
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,270
No, Your Highness!

703
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,900
Go away.

704
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,530
Your Highness,
Chang’an is already in sight.

705
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,900
We’re about to get our revenge.

706
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,170
It’s now or never.

707
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:18,260
How can you retreat just for

708
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:18,880
a woman?

709
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,560
Are you insane?

710
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,370
Step aside!

711
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,660
Your Highness!

712
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,920
Back then, your entire family

713
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,290
was executed except you.

714
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:27,870
We lost 200 thousand people

715
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,330
in Hongchuan and Beishuo!

716
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,490
They are now all watching us

717
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:31,570
in heaven!

718
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,550
If we leave now,

719
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,370
a chance like this will never come again!

720
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,160
Please think twice, Your Highness!

721
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,330
- Please think twice, Your Highness!
- Please think twice, Your Highness!

722
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:50,230
Cities lost can be regained.

723
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:54,160
Troops separated can be rebuilt.

724
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:58,690
But lost lives can’t be brought back.

725
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,710
I can give up anyone in my life

726
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,320
except for Achu!

727
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,430
I don’t care if you understand or not.

728
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,680
Gather the troops and set off!

729
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:58,800
Report!

730
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:02,040
Young Master.

731
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,840
Yan Xun and his force have retreated.

732
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,800
Is that true?

733
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,860
Absolutely.

734
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,790
Now, the rear

735
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:08,640
is leading the troops.

736
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,730
They’ve gone five kilometers away

737
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,110
and have been lightening their load

738
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,390
on the way.

739
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,030
It seems that they’re speeding up

740
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,070
without any rest.

741
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,690
Don’t lower the guard.

742
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,650
Order Yue Guards to watch them
along the way.

743
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,530
Report back anything unusual.

744
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:22,370
Aye.

745
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,770
Young Master.

746
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,250
Yan Xun is heading back to Yanbei.

747
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,080
He left

748
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,160
for a girl named

749
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,920
Achu.

750
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,030
She’s been

751
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,030
guarding Hongchuan

752
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,680
for five days and nights.

753
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:38,520
Young Master,

754
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,260
is the assassination still on?

755
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,570
Abort it.

756
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,280
Hongchuan is short of supplies.

757
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:47,710
I’m afraid

758
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,710
they cannot hang on for long.

759
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,130
Princess.

760
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,040
Chu Qiao and the others have...

761
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,980
If you’re trying

762
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,130
to stop me,

763
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:52,690
just save it.

764
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,770
You’d better

765
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,840
figure something out

766
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,890
to take this little town for me

767
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:59,270
as soon as possible.

768
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,780
That way, when I return to Chang’an,

769
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,220
I’ll die more happily.

770
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:22,850
Pass my order.

771
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:25,150
The one who kills Chu Qiao

772
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,600
will be rewarded
with 10 thousand taels of gold!

773
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,340
Aye!

774
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,140
Kill them!

775
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,090
Kill!

776
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:37,610
Kill!

777
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:58,630
Shoot!

778
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:08,650
