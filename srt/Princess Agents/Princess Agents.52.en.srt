17
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,440
Yes, Your Majesty.

18
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,610
Give it to her.

19
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:47,950
Aye.

20
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,630
Your Majesty.

21
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,140
Your Majesty.

22
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,730
Are you really going to
give Chun poisoned liquor?

23
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,870
I know why you came,

24
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,430
but I am feeling unwell.

25
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,860
I don’t want to argue with you.

26
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,900
I’ve made my decision

27
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,480
regarding Chun.

28
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,040
From now on, take good care of Song.

29
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,040
Your Majesty.

30
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,770
Chun is young and ignorant.

31
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,680
Young and ignorant?

32
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,580
The state is at risk.

33
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,350
Severe punishment is needed
to stabilize the court.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,470
Besides, I lost a son

35
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,660
because of her reckless move.

36
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,990
Who should take responsibility for that?

37
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,480
Your Majesty.

38
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,590
She is our daughter after all.

39
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,040
Are you really going to kill her?

40
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,970
Enough.

41
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,860
I am tired.

42
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,770
Eunuch.

43
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,050
Go.

44
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,230
Wait.

45
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,970
Your Majesty. I know

46
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,070
Chun committed a capital crime.

47
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,530
If you don’t do anything,

48
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,830
the court won’t let it go.

49
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,070
She is my daughter.

50
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,500
It’s my fault

51
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,040
that she ends up like this.

52
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,180
I failed to raise her properly.

53
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,900
And I shall

54
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,850
die for her.

55
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,450
Your Grace!

56
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,810
Dear!

57
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,030
Dear!

58
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,270
Ning!

59
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,240
Ning!

60
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,550
Ning!

61
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,000
Call for Imperial Physicians!

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,780
Aye.

63
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,680
Why did you do this?

64
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:51,770
Your Majesty.

65
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,200
I still remember

66
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,050
when I first came to the palace,

67
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,800
I was at Chun’s age.

68
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,110
I was also young

69
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,990
and innocent.

70
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,410
The first time I met you,

71
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:17,270
I was too scared to bow.

72
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,150
When I was about to be punished,

73
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,840
you came to me

74
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,670
and said to me gently,

75
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,840
“I am sorry that I startled you”.

76
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,770
At that moment,

77
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,950
I knew

78
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,340
you

79
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,420
would be my husband,

80
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,980
the man I would serve
for the rest of my life.

81
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,000
It pained me

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,490
that I couldn’t spend every night
with you.

83
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,920
I had to face the fact

84
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,110
that other women would also give birth
to your children.

85
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,390
I know

86
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,400
that’s the price to pay

87
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,100
for becoming a ruler.

88
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,920
Your Majesty.

89
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,230
I have loved you

90
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,450
throughout my life.

91
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,390
Could you please do me a favor

92
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,150
and pardon Chun?

93
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,380
Please, Your Majesty.

94
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,840
I am begging you to forgive

95
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,330
our daughter.

96
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,900
Your Majesty, please promise me.

97
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,510
I promise you to forgive her.

98
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,290
I promise.

99
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,320
Ning.

100
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,650
Ning.

101
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,970
Ning.

102
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,870
Ning.

103
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,590
Come on!

104
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,280
Your Highness!

105
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:29,720
Quickly!

106
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,020
Chun. Come with me.

107
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,870
Now!

108
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,030
Chun. Come with me now.

109
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,500
Or it’ll be too late.

110
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,100
Come on.

111
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,550
What are you doing?

112
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:54,820
Fine.

113
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,710
Let me tell you what happened.

114
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,160
In order to save you,

115
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,220
Mother drank the poisoned liquor
Father prepared

116
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,050
for you.

117
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,330
Are you coming or not?

118
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,950
Mother is still waiting for you.

119
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,520
There’s no time to waste.

120
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,590
Are you coming or not?

121
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,050
Are you coming?

122
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,910
There you are.

123
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,710
You bastard.

124
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,710
It is your fault.

125
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,600
It is all your fault!

126
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,460
Your Majesty, please calm down.

127
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,160
How could you be so stupid?

128
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,890
How could you sacrifice

129
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,560
your life for that ingrate?

130
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,140
Your Majesty!

131
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:51,600
Your Majesty!

132
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,140
Your Majesty!

133
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,900
Your Majesty!

134
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:53,920
Your Majesty, wake up!

135
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,650
Your Majesty!

136
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:55,990
Your Majesty!

137
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,110
Your Majesty!

138
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,480
Your Majesty!

139
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,590
Your Majesty!

140
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,590
Mother.

141
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,370
Why did you do this?

142
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,480
I would rather die

143
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,850
than see you like this.

144
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,670
Mother.

145
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,600
Prince Yu, Princess Chun.

146
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,220
Here comes the imperial decree.

147
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,480
According to the imperial decree,

148
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,240
Princess Chun stole the commander’s tally

149
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,550
and diverted the troops
without authorization.

150
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,070
You were supposed to be given
the death penalty.

151
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,860
Given that you’re young and ignorant,

152
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,350
death is avoided.

153
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,420
You are deprived of your title,

154
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,630
and confined to the West Court

155
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,150
for the rest of your life.

156
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,100
Confer Duke Yanbei on Yuan Song

157
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,590
who shall command the troops to Yanbei

158
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,490
to suppress the rebellion

159
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,550
to make amends for your sins.

Young Master Wei.

191
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,320
Caiwei.

192
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,060
Is Princess getting better?

193
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,120
I’m afraid not.

194
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,430
She’s been going on a fast for days,

195
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,410
locking herself up in the room

196
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,780
without saying a word.

197
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,890
She’s running out of tears.

198
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,200
It is all my fault.

199
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,880
I should have stepped up

200
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,770
and stopped her.

201
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:50,550
It is already too late

202
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,730
to say these words.

203
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,100
Over the past years, Noble Consort

204
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,300
was always favored by His Majesty.

205
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,180
Lots of people hate her.

206
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,390
Now, she is gone.

207
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,670
Prince Yu left Chang’an too.

208
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,680
His Majesty is still mad at Princess.

209
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,810
I’m afraid

210
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,720
others may give Princess

211
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,200
a hard time.

212
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,130
Young Master Wei,

213
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,100
only you can protect her.

214
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,740
I can barely protect myself.

215
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,210
I was just released from prison.

216
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,150
Although His Majesty did not

217
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,480
blame me for my defeat,

218
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:29,060
he removed me from my post.

219
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,020
Now, I am resting at home.

220
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,880
There isn’t much I can do.

221
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,750
I’m only here

222
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,910
because I was assigned

223
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,490
to take care of Noble Consort’s funeral.

224
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:46,910
But don’t worry.

225
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,010
I will see what I can do.

226
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,980
Take care of Princess.

227
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,040
Tell her,

228
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,320
it’ll all be over.

229
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,800
I will protect her with my life.

230
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,660
Aye.

231
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,370
You want to see me?

232
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,100
Achu.

233
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,850
I want you to meet someone.

234
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,840
Come out.

235
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,660
Yan Xun, is this to

236
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,810
intercede with me on their behalf?

237
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,860
I’m not speaking for them.

238
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,930
It’s just their words don’t match.

239
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,950
So I want to check with you.

240
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,870
Your Highness, I am guilty.

241
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:21,890
Go on.

242
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,980
You appointed me to guard Hongchuan,

243
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,760
yet I did not follow

244
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,840
your schedule and plan,

245
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,300
but handed over

246
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,860
the garrison to Sun He in advance

247
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,270
to join you

248
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,930
and help you take Chang’an.

249
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,910
I did not obey your order

250
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,350
and deserted my post. Please punish me.

251
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,890
Deserted your post
and disobeyed the order?

252
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,870
You’re good at making excuses.

253
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,120
You think I’m blind?

254
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,310
You closed the gate,
expelled the civilians,

255
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,710
shot the allies,

256
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,830
killed the soldiers of Xiuli Army.

257
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,640
And you attempted to lure me in
to silence me.

258
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,000
You killed Feng Mian
who tried to alert me.

259
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,870
Did I do all that?

260
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,300
Your Highness.

261
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,180
Miss Chu,

262
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,020
it was me.

263
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,550
General has nothing to do with that.

264
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,750
You?

265
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,890
Who the hell are you?

266
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,400
Miss Chu,

267
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,450
back in Chang’an, you got through

268
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,750
three most dangerous years
with His Highness

269
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,270
and assisted him in the escape
from Chang’an

270
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,320
back to Yanbei.

271
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,200
Then you guarded Hongchuan with your life.

272
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,130
You killed Yuan Qi and clobbered Wei.

273
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,310
I admire you for what you have done.

274
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,730
But while all of you

275
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,100
had a hard time in Chang’an,

276
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,680
I followed General

277
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,610
and Mr. Wu

278
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,990
all around Yanbei,

279
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,720
eliminating traitors
and corrupted officials.

280
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,310
We went through fire and water.

281
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,300
My achievements

282
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,900
might not match yours,

283
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,700
but you can’t insult me.

284
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,520
How impassioned you are!

285
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,950
I’m almost convinced

286
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,900
the one who shot me

287
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,810
from Hongchuan that day

288
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,650
wasn’t you.

289
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,690
It was me.

290
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,390
But the troops of Wei were approaching.

291
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,280
I knew no reinforcement

292
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,030
would come to support Hongchuan

293
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,020
in the entire state.

294
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,420
When you came

295
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,730
with the Xiuli Army,

296
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,130
I did not know the truth.

297
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,790
So I mistook them for enemies.

298
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,990
That’s why I ordered to shoot them.

299
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,280
You mistook them?

300
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,820
So many loyal soldiers

301
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,910
died because of you!

302
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,340
You tell me you mistook them?

303
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,690
I accept it if you want to kill me.

304
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,460
But General has nothing

305
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,080
to do with it.

306
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,930
He had left with his troops at that time.

307
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,030
He was not in the city.

308
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,840
Please uphold justice.

309
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,380
Do not kill the innocent.

310
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,700
Your Highness.

311
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,110
Sun He is loyal to you.

312
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,930
There must be misunderstandings.

313
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,410
Please be lenient with him.

314
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,500
You all claimed

315
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,440
that you did not shoot Achu

316
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,420
and the Xiuli Army.

317
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,040
Who can testify for you?

318
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,760
My guards can.

319
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,670
Enough of your nonsense!

320
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,510
Achu!

321
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,250
Three years ago, when Wei invaded Yanbei,

322
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,170
our people fought with their lives.

323
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,480
Only 800 of 50 thousand men survived.

324
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:53,660
Over the past three years,

325
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,160
we’ve fought countless battles.

326
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,210
None of us have ever surrendered
or defected.

327
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,930
If you don’t trust

328
00:20:58,930 --> 00:20:59,810
your own people,

329
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,880
how could you trust the Xiuli Army?

330
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:03,870
Not to mention they have

331
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,110
betrayed Yanbei once.

332
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,170
Who knows if they’ll

333
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,280
do it again?

334
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,610
How could I entrust

335
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,950
the heart of Yanbei

336
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:11,470
to those traitors?

337
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,710
But they were the ones

338
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,990
who guarded Hongchuan,

339
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,370
while your so-called

340
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,170
loyal soldiers

341
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,050
fled the city!

342
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,400
They couldn’t have done it

343
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,330
without you.

344
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,430
Had I,

345
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,610
General or His Highness been there,

346
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,370
we would’ve probably

347
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:26,780
lost Yanbei by now!

348
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,360
What are you implying?

349
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,170
The whole world knows that Xiuli Army

350
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,290
only listens

351
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,070
to you.

352
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,440
Or how come right after His Highness

353
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,760
left Yanbei,

354
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,070
they found you

355
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:37,490
to lead them?

356
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,840
Don’t play us off against each other.

357
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,590
I didn’t!

358
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,040
Yan Xun,

359
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,950
do you believe him?

360
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,210
Miss Chu,

361
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,570
I will be responsible for what I have done

362
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,100
and pay with my life.

363
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,700
Sun He!

364
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,050
Sun He!

365
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,230
General,

366
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,910
do not forget the promise

367
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,290
we made.

368
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,340
Do not forget how our family

369
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,790
died.

370
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,650
Do not forget

371
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,790
what I said today.

372
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,990
Sun He! Sun He!

373
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,000
Sun He!

374
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:44,590
Sun He! Sun He!

375
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,590
How dare you commit murder!

376
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,220
Guards, take him into custody!

377
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,620
- Aye.
- Aye.

378
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,290
- Get up!
- Get up!

379
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,460
Wait.

380
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,450
Why do you want to kill me?

381
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,600
You vamp! Without you,

382
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,060
we would’ve taken Chang’an!

383
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,350
You distracted His Highness

384
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,800
so that we were defeated!

385
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,420
Wei troops

386
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,450
slaughtered my whole family.

387
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,800
We were so close!

388
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,040
You vamp!

389
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,430
Take him away.

390
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,430
Punish him by military law.

391
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,110
- Aye.
- Aye.

392
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,880
- We were so close!
- Move!

393
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,230
Go!

394
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,790
You vamp!

395
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,120
- Let me go!
- Move!

396
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,750
Move!

397
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:58,850
Your Highness.

398
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,100
Your back is still injured.

399
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,580
You can’t ride now.

400
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,020
Ajing.

401
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:08,790
Leave me alone

402
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,700
for a while.

403
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:11,830
Aye.

404
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:58,780
Yan Xun,

405
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,900
I didn’t gain your trust

406
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,750
at that time.

407
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,530
I insisted on guarding Hongchuan,

408
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,200
causing the huge loss of the troops.

409
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,740
Blood was shed. Lives were lost.

410
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:14,940
As their leader,

411
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,570
I’m furious and resentful.

412
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,770
But as the one

413
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,190
who went through thick and thin with you,

414
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,840
I gained your love and care

415
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,420
that overweigh everything.

416
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,020
I can’t repay you for that.

417
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,920
You returned to save me.

418
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,840
How can I still resent you

419
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,920
or blame you

420
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,930
for what happened?

421
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,950
I always believe that

422
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,920
war can devour everything

423
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,110
except faith

424
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,620
and conscience.

425
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,740
Princess.

426
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,720
Princess.

427
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,590
Princess.

428
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:19,410
Princess, I’m coming in.

429
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,490
Princess.

430
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,760
This is from Stewardess Wenshan.

431
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,260
She said

432
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,750
Noble Consort

433
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,730
had asked her

434
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,710
to give this to you

435
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,520
no matter what happened.

436
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,750
It will bless you to be safe
your whole life.

437
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,420
This is a talisman

438
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,420
I asked for you.

439
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,030
Take it

440
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,650
and you will be safe and sound.

441
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,320
Princess.

442
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,720
Your mother wouldn’t want to

443
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,240
see you like this.

444
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,130
Wenshan and the others are

445
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,230
still waiting outside.

446
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,700
Greetings, Your Highness.

447
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,640
Please don’t give yourself up.

448
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:41,380
You still have a long way to go.

449
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:43,930
Princess.

450
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,580
- Take care.
- Take care.

451
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,760
Help me wash up.

452
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,850
Aye.

453
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,460
= Qingshan House =

454
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,030
Good. Well done.

455
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:40,190
Grandfather.

456
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,810
Good job, Yue.

457
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,940
Your performance today is excellent.

458
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,500
You’re acute and calm,

459
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,110
unaffected by the battle of Hongchuan.

460
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,770
I am happy to see that.

461
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,510
You taught me well, Grandfather.

462
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,220
I heard that you’re

463
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,050
heading to Yanbei with Prince Yuan Song.

464
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,080
Don’t tell me

465
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,350
you still want to protect that maid.

466
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,670
You saved her

467
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:08,750
in the battle,

468
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,690
but enraged the court.

469
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,880
Do you think it is worth

470
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,830
ruining your future

471
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,060
for Yan Xun’s woman?

472
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,970
You must make

473
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,520
wise decisions.

474
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:22,950
You’ve mistaken it, Grandfather.

475
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,600
I am not going there

476
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,560
for her.

477
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:26,960
Go ahead.

478
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,390
Aye.

479
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,140
Yueqi.

480
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,510
I am going to write a letter.

481
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,270
Give it to Prince Che in the palace.

482
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,200
Aye.

483
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,860
Bad fortune and evil spirit are rising.

484
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:11,230
Is Yue going to

485
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,400
be in trouble?

486
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,440
There must be other reasons

487
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,810
for you to go to Yanbei.

488
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,510
After all, someone

489
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,350
you care about is there.

490
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,700
Another three years have passed.

491
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,350
How time flies.

492
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,750
Don’t you want to

493
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,150
say hello to your old friend?

494
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,990
Hello.

495
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:26,520
Satisfied now?

496
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,100
What do you want?

497
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,350
We haven’t seen each other
for three years.

498
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,310
Can’t you be honest with me for once?

499
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,800
About what?

500
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,990
My people have been following you

501
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,470
all the way here.

502
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,560
You committed murder, poisoning

503
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,270
and arson.

504
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,000
Everything you did is
against the government.

505
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,950
What are you up to?

506
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,110
Nothing really.

507
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,420
I just dislike them.

508
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,770
Who do you want to protect?

509
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,900
Now, I can’t

510
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,650
waste more time on you.

511
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,050
I am injured

512
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,150
and need treatment.

513
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:13,610
Also,

514
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:16,280
I was unable

515
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:19,730
to find the information you want.

516
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,370
If you want to fight against me,

517
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,170
just go ahead and do it.

518
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,830
Is the wanted girl’s name

519
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,560
Chu Qiao?

520
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:29,920
What?

521
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,770
Zhu... Zhu…

522
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:32,780
Zhu Jiao?

523
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,110
Don’t play dumb with me.

524
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,230
Over the last three years,

525
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,350
I have checked every spy of Liang

526
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,750
in Chang’an,

527
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:46,740
and all members of the Yuwen Household,

528
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,470
but found nothing.

529
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,730
I never expected that

530
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,430
Yan Xun would take her to Yanbei.

531
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,770
Right.

532
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,400
How could

533
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,700
Luo He’s daughter

534
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,940
be a nobody?

535
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,310
Wait. Wait. Wait.

536
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,220
I have to stop you there.

537
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,390
Because... I don’t understand

538
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,190
a word you just said.

539
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:18,740
Her family name is Chu, which means

540
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,590
Luo He married

541
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,890
a man surnamed Chu.

542
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:22,380
Shut up.

543
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,410
Is that right?

544
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,710
Enough of your nonsense.

545
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,320
It has nothing to do with her.

546
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:40,510
Zuo Baocang.

547
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,910
You said that you had just

548
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:45,150
met her once.

549
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,430
Why would you risk your life

550
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,870
to defend her?

551
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:53,290
Maybe in her eyes,

552
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:56,850
you were just a stray dog

553
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,870
who was about to be frozen to death.

554
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,120
Maybe she didn’t remember

555
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,140
you at all.

556
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:04,670
Yet you thought

557
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:05,910
so highly of yourself.

558
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:11,150
How pathetic!

559
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,660
I... I am pathetic?

560
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,120
Let’s say I am.

561
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,610
What about you?

562
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:33,210
Aren’t you just as pathetic as me?

563
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,380
Others are looking for

564
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,170
her daughter

565
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,610
in order to get the Storm Token.

566
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:46,310
What do you want?

567
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:52,510
You gave up your great mission

568
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,600
and traveled all the way here

569
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,150
to look for me.

570
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,870
For what?

571
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,030
Say it.

572
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:05,220
Let me tell you why.

573
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,820
Dongfang Ji, you are jealous!

574
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,720
You refuse to accept it!

575
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,460
You refuse to accept that she...

576
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,030
Aye.

577
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:13,640
He is dead.

578
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:36,990
Yuwen Yue.

579
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,010
Move his body to the cart.

580
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:48,470
