16
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:43,730
Commander,

17
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,590
aren’t we going to see Chief Commander

18
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,960
so that he’ll punish that woman?

19
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,720
You idiot!

20
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,540
She just did a meritorious deed.

21
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,710
And that stupid Crown Prince of Liang

22
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,820
had a crush on her!

23
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:55,790
At this time,

24
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,090
who dares to punish her?

25
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,440
Commander, do we just let her go?

26
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,640
Do we have another choice?

27
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,460
I had wanted to make a fortune out of it,

28
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,660
and seized the chance

29
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,170
to get rid of He Xiao in passing.

30
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,570
Unexpectedly,

31
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,910
she interfered!

32
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,040
If things get out of hand,

33
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,480
and the Ministry of War knows it,

34
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,760
I will die,

35
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,260
and you will die with me!

36
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,500
I don’t know who wanted to

37
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,930
scheme against Xiuli Army.

38
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,270
Do they want to scheme against He Xiao,

39
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,330
or against me?

40
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,550
Commander, in my opinion,

41
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,670
we’d better let them go.

42
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,350
No hurry.

43
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,530
Let them kneel for one day.

44
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,380
Go!

45
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,700
Aye.

46
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,720
Young Master, someone sent a letter here.

47
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:08,940
Who sent it?

48
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:09,970
I don’t know.

49
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,430
He left after leaving it at the gate.

50
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,980
= Xing’er is in danger.
Go to Xiuli Army to save her. =

51
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,020
Ms. Chu. You look pale.

52
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,260
Are you alright?

53
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,070
Do you have injuries?

54
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,470
If you feel uncomfortable,

55
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,610
don’t tough it out.

56
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,460
I’ll walk you back.

57
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,720
Kneel!

58
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,930
Do you want to die faster?

59
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:03,960
Take it easy.

60
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,210
When Chief Commander returns at night,

61
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,390
he will release us.

62
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,140
Now, we just wait quietly.

63
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:11,970
Understand?

64
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,510
Let them go back.

65
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,010
There’s no need for them to stay here.

66
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,660
Ms. Chu.

67
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,170
You are being punished because of us.

68
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,240
How can we go back?

69
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,520
Whatever.

70
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,240
Ms. Chu?

71
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,320
Ms. Chu?

72
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,760
Where is Xue Zhileng?

73
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,130
Where has he gone for such a long time?

74
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,850
He has gone to see Chief Commander

75
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,590
for report.

76
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,500
Vice Commander, take it easy.

77
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,470
Even if you want to die,

78
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,120
you should be patient, right?

79
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,780
You...

80
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,060
- I am warning you!
- What are you doing?

81
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,150
Don’t try to make trouble.

82
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,970
You made mistakes before you came.

83
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,610
If you dare to do violence again,

84
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,130
no one can defend you.

85
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,660
How dare you!

86
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,500
Stop it!

87
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,210
Ms. Chu?

88
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,400
I am really fine.

89
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,830
Let them not act rashly.

90
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,950
You, go find Xue Zhileng!

91
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,460
I am telling you.

92
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,780
If anything happens

93
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,110
to Ms. Chu,

94
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,890
we will

95
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,440
take his life.

96
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,550
Where can I find him?

97
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,520
Will you go or not?

98
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,740
Ms. Chu?

99
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,820
- Ms. Chu!
- Ms. Chu!

100
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,730
- Ms. Chu!
- Ms. Chu!

101
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,020
- Ms. Chu!
- Ms. Chu!

102
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,710
- Ms. Chu!
- Ms. Chu!

103
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,500
- Ms. Chu!
- Ms. Chu!

104
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,480
Your Majesty,

105
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,260
you ask me to keep watch

106
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,500
on every major battalion in Chang’an.

107
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,340
Today, nothing important happened,

108
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,390
except that Yuwen Yue,

109
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,100
Vice Commander of Cavalry Battalion,

110
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,920
went to the encampment

111
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,520
of Xiuli Army

112
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,920
and took away

113
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,200
the archery coach Chu Qiao

114
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,850
who made a mistake

115
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,180
and was punished to kneel.

116
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,120
I see. Leave me.

117
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,060
I’m leaving, Your Majesty.

118
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,010
Do you realize

119
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,710
Yan Xun is protecting Yuwen Yue?

120
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,110
What do you mean, Your Majesty?

121
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,960
He knows

122
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,910
I don’t like him

123
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,830
to get in touch frequently
with military officials.

124
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,410
If he hates Yuwen Yue,

125
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,780
wouldn’t he say that

126
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,680
he was in good relationship

127
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,700
with Yuwen Yue

128
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,450
to get me suspicious?

129
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,440
It makes sense, Your Majesty.

130
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,440
Besides, seems that he is afraid

131
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,140
I will take Yuwen Yue
off Cavalry Battalion.

132
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,050
Why?

133
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,240
He is afraid

134
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,710
General Yuwen will lose military power.

135
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,460
Then,

136
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,030
it is in his favor

137
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,770
when Yuwen Yue has military power?

138
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,630
It is only our speculation.

139
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,780
General Yuwen is loyal, Your Majesty.

140
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,240
I don’t think so.

141
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,720
The great thing is going to happen.

142
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,430
We should take precautions against

143
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,720
all speculations.

144
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,250
Once the speculation comes true,

145
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,750
it will bring disasters.

146
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,700
Why are you screaming?

147
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,630
Why are you here?

148
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,160
This is my tent.

149
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,590
Where else would I be?

150
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,110
Then why am I here?

151
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,290
Young Master.

152
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,570
What happened?

153
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,030
Who said that?

154
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,790
Imperial Concubine Wei’s men said

155
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,340
he heard it from Chief Eunuch Wang.

156
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,380
Wise trick.

157
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,480
Turns out that you know everything

158
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,430
that Yan Xun has done.

159
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,620
What do you mean?

160
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,160
Yan Xun is right.

161
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,720
The fight for power

162
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,850
depends on people’s ability.

163
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,910
However, it’s not time to laugh yet.

164
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,770
It is far from over.

165
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:43,850
Let’s wait and see.

166
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,680
Yuwen Yue!

167
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,050
Explain to me!

168
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,180
= Oriole Courtyard =

169
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,450
Your Excellency.

170
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,550
It’s so late.

171
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,950
But Achu hasn’t come back yet.

172
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,780
Your Excellency, keep waiting.

173
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,880
She will be fine.

174
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,280
How do you know?

175
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,800
Achu went to Cavalry Battalion alone.

176
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
I was worried.

177
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,270
And you were not here.

178
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,530
I had no choice,

179
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,320
but to inform Yuwen Yue.

180
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,450
Your Excellency, at such a crucial moment,

181
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,290
we should make use of

182
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,090
whatever we can use.

183
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,670
At this moment,

184
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,740
you should

185
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,620
put your own feelings aside.

186
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,580
Zhong Yu!

187
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:35,790
You...

188
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,880
Yan Xun, what happened?

189
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,010
Why are you so angry?

190
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:43,950
You are back?

191
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,170
How do you feel?

192
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,660
I’m fine.

193
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,510
Go see a doctor.

194
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,400
Don’t bother, Yan Xun.

195
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,200
I have something important to tell you.

196
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,710
About what?

197
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,870
Xiuli Army.

198
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,060
I have been in touch with them

199
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,400
since I went to Cavalry Battalion.

200
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,390
I find that every one of them

201
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,180
didn’t intend to rebel.

202
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,420
Also, they’re now

203
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,640
subordinate to Wei Army,

204
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:11,840
but they are marginalized

205
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,080
by other people.

206
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,250
Only because

207
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,320
they struggle to

208
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,960
keep the name and flag of Xiuli Army.

209
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,850
They’re loyal?

210
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,430
In fact,

211
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,920
they are in favor of Yanbei.

212
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,180
Yan Xun, I can’t assure easily

213
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,870
whether they are all loyal.

214
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:31,970
But I think

215
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,810
we are in urgent need of helpers now.

216
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,730
Since they are in favor of Yanbei,

217
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,520
we should

218
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,240
give them a chance.

219
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,220
Maybe,

220
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,680
there will be surprises.

221
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,090
Your Excellency.

222
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,270
We are in urgent need of helpers now.

223
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,270
When Xiuli Army wants
to correct their mistake,

224
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,300
we should

225
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,110
give them a chance.

226
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,130
Tonight, bring them to Deyue Hall

227
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,370
and see me.

228
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,070
OK.

229
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,350
Your Excellency.

230
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,850
I have something to tell you.

231
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,170
Go ahead.

232
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,690
Deng Jia and Qu Yi

233
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,330
have been controlled by Yuwen Yue’s men

234
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,010
and they can’t take any action.

235
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,410
It’s nearly impossible
to break out of Chang’an

236
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,480
on our own.

237
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,510
Your Excellency, we need helpers.

238
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:50,740
Xiuli Army is

239
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,830
what we can use right now.

240
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,810
They have already suffered
a lot of squeezing.

241
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,250
And they have completely respected Achu

242
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,650
for what happened today.

243
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,440
If you’re willing to accept them,

244
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,370
they will be

245
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,260
our trenchant edge.

246
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,120
That’s why you stole He Xiao’s warrant,

247
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,630
and gave it to Xue Zhileng

248
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,250
so that he could punish He Xiao

249
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,630
in his battalion.

250
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,640
Then Achu saved He Xiao

251
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,200
and won the support of Xiuli Army.

252
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,720
On the other side,

253
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,130
you tempted Yuwen Yue to save Achu

254
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,180
so that His Majesty suspected him.

255
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,890
You killed two birds with one stone.

256
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,270
I...

257
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,980
What a great plan!

258
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,630
But have you thought about it?

259
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,010
Achu has been badly wounded.

260
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,750
What if

261
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,430
Xue Zhileng had played hard with her

262
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,520
and Yuwen Yue had ignored her life?

263
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,560
We really need Xiuli Army

264
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,890
to take over the gate for you.

265
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,550
Zhong Yu.

266
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,900
I know that you are loyal to me.

267
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,580
Over the last few years,

268
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,160
you’ve helped me.

269
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,790
But I must warn you.

270
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,080
From now on,

271
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,040
you mustn’t make use of Achu.

272
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,170
If I know she gets injured

273
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,390
because of you,

274
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,450
I will never forgive you.

275
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:16,830
Aye.

276
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,500
Leave me.

277
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,700
What about Xiuli Army?

278
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,390
Just do it.

279
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,690
Yes. I’m going right away.

280
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,040
Yan Xun.

281
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,110
They are officers of Xiuli Army

282
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,920
that I mentioned to you.

283
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,260
This is His Excellency Yan Xun.

284
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,810
I guess you have already met him.

285
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,600
Your Excellency, I’m He Xiao,

286
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,380
the Deputy Commander of Xiuli Army.

287
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,810
I’m Ge Qi,

288
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,970
the Left Officer of Xiuli Army.

289
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,380
I’m Wu Danyu,

290
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,900
the Right Officer of Xiuli Army.

291
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,010
Your Excellency, we’re guilty.

292
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,550
We’re too ashamed to see you.

293
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,950
Achu told me about you.

294
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,340
At first, I refused to see you.

295
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,950
You were just ordinary soldiers

296
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,080
at that time.

297
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,930
The commanders should be blamed

298
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,680
for losing the cities

299
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,400
and it wasn’t your fault.

300
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,950
But you’re still soldiers of Yanbei.

301
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,100
After seeing your families be slaughtered

302
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,660
and two hundred thousand people
be engulfed in fire,

303
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,200
you even put on

304
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,430
the enemy’s armor

305
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,090
and lived in the enemy’s battalion

306
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,580
for three years already!

307
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:46,530
You’re traitors, anyway.

308
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,930
But Achu told me

309
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,990
you lived a hard life.

310
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,630
You have been suffering
humiliations and exclusions.

311
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,340
Seems like

312
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,340
anyone can

313
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,470
step on your heads.

314
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,310
I would resent you.

315
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,620
But anyway,

316
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,400
you are still my people!

317
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,440
You can die in Yanbei,

318
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,350
but you can’t be the dogs
under somebody else

319
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,720
in another place!

320
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,790
I would never let this happen!

321
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,580
So today,

322
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:23,900
I would like

323
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,370
to give you another chance

324
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,550
to follow me

325
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,150
and depend on me.

326
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,520
I can’t give you my words

327
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,090
that you would all survive,

328
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,670
or that you would get wealth and rank

329
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,160
in the future.

330
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:41,090
But as long as you are loyal to me

331
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,620
and don’t betray me,

332
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,850
when we are back in Yanbei,

333
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,890
you can return to your homes

334
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,190
with approval.

335
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,430
Your Excellency.

336
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,060
We made a heinous crime at that time.

337
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,570
In the past three years,
we have been suffering

338
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,780
and couldn’t sleep at night.

339
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,060
We’re afraid

340
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,930
we can never go back to Yanbei
before we die.

341
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:11,180
You’re giving us the grace of rebirth.

342
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,140
Everyone in Xiuli Army

343
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,860
will take your order!

344
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,890
We will never change our minds,

345
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,630
whatever happens!

346
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,220
The weather is dry.

347
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:37,950
- I didn’t expect His Excellency
- Watch out for fire!

348
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,240
to be so generous.

349
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,930
No wonder
he is the son of Marquis Dingbei.

350
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,650
Why do I feel it’s too easy?

351
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,750
He lost all his families.

352
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:45,950
If I were him,

353
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,340
I would like to kill us all.

354
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,450
Just shut up.

355
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,490
How can you compare yourself

356
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,450
to His Excellency?

357
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,860
Anyway,

358
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,720
I just feel something wrong.

359
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,340
You don’t trust His Excellency Yan?

360
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,500
Not really.

361
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,900
Ms. Chu.

362
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,350
After what happened that year,

363
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,910
we all thought we would never get a chance

364
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,790
to go back to Yanbei before we died.

365
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,200
But tonight,

366
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,950
His Excellency accepted us in person.

367
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:14,930
It’s really kind of

368
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,240
beyond our expectation.

369
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,080
Yes, that’s what I mean.

370
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,980
We were not

371
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,240
in charge at that time,

372
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,000
however,

373
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,300
we were still the members

374
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,050
of Xiuli Army

375
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,170
and we couldn’t get away from it.

376
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,630
His Excellency Yan lost all his families

377
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,450
and he just survived
on Jiuyou Platform.

378
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,580
He has borne the disgrace all these years

379
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,800
and suffered humiliations.

380
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,720
We will not hesitate at all

381
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,780
if he just lets the three of us

382
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,790
to die for him right now.

383
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,110
However,

384
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,010
we still have many others dudes

385
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,220
in Xiuli Army.

386
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,260
They just took the order at that time

387
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,640
and they were innocent.

388
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,470
I have to concern about

389
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,290
their safety.

390
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,010
I understand.

391
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:52,820
Commander He.

392
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,260
I have been following His Excellency Yan
for so many years.

393
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,690
I know him very well.

394
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,310
He is particular about loyalty

395
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,690
and never makes promise easily.

396
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,820
Trust me.

397
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,160
Since he has given you his words,

398
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,800
he will keep his promise.

399
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,360
Since you say so,

400
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,950
we could just be at ease.

401
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,300
Please rest assured.

402
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:13,300
Well,

403
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,290
we will just go back

404
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,270
and keep the army ready early

405
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,890
so that His Excellency can use us
at any time.

406
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,430
Okay.

407
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,210
You must be careful

408
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,410
and don’t let anyone else know.

409
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,090
Don’t worry.

410
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,490
No one with us

411
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,950
will betray him.

412
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,290
We will bring him

413
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,190
back to Yanbei safely.

414
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,590
Ms. Chu, you may leave.

415
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,570
We’re getting back.

416
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,560
Okay.

417
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:39,630
Bye.

418
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,520
Let’s go.

419
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,270
Please show some mercy, Your Grace.
I’m sorry.

420
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,210
What’s going? What happened?

421
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,170
Your Grace, little prince is...

422
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,720
He is missing.

423
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,960
What? My son is missing?

424
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,080
What are you talking about?

425
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,120
Just then, Young Master Huai asked his men

426
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,490
to bring you a box of silk fabrics.

427
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,300
While I was busy putting them away,

428
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,730
the little prince...

429
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,730
He was missing.

430
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:16,900
Damn fool!

431
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,280
Your Grace, I’m sorry!

432
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,620
I should be blamed!

433
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,110
Did you search the whole palace?

434
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,390
We have already searched

435
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,670
the whole palace.

436
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,980
But we still haven’t

437
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,050
found little prince.

438
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,440
I’m sorry, Your Grace. I deserve to die.

439
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:34,470
I don’t care

440
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,830
how you die!

441
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,200
How could your humble life

442
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,770
compare to my son’s?

443
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,020
I’m sorry! I’m sorry!

444
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,340
Your Grace, this is serious.

445
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,500
Shall we tell His Majesty about it?

446
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:50,160
Did you just say that Yuwen Huai’s men

447
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,560
brought me a box of silk fabrics?

448
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,790
Yes.

449
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,180
Where is the box?

450
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:59,530
The box is big and ugly.

451
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,790
They took the silk fabrics out of it

452
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,920
and then carried it away.

453
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,310
Couldn’t they?

454
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:11,850
Shut up!

455
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,220
No one shall tell anyone else

456
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,900
what happened today!

457
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,260
If anyone does,

458
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:20,960
I will kill him!

459
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,150
- Aye!
- Aye!

460
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,910
Go to Hongshan House

461
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,530
and ask Yuwen Huai to see me.

462
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,750
Aye.

463
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,760
Come on. Come on, Hao.

464
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,960
Walk forward. Walk forward.

465
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,060
Yeah, yeah. Here you go.

466
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,700
Young Master Huai.

467
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,110
Take him back.

468
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:58,980
Aye.

469
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,240
Mother!

470
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,960
What happened?

471
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,130
Young Master Huai.

472
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:09,810
Her Grace sent a messenger,

473
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,890
asking you to meet her.

474
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,660
That bitch.

475
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,480
She wouldn’t know how powerful I could be

476
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,030
until I showed her.

477
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,700
Go and get the horse ready.

478
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,780
Aye.

479
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,710
Young Master Huai, this way please.

480
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,710
Young Master Huai, there you are.

481
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,480
What is it?

482
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,500
His Majesty wanted to see you

483
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,040
and sent a messenger to your home.

484
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,560
I didn’t expect to see you here.

485
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:00,890
His Majesty wanted to see me?

486
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,770
Yes. Just come with me.

487
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,980
Come on. Come on.

488
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,340
Young Master Huai!

489
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,160
Her Grace is waiting for you!

490
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,520
Yuwen Huai, Zhao Dongting,

491
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,430
lead 500 imperial guards personally.

492
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,630
And this secret decree

493
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,090
is what I want you

494
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,450
to do for me.

495
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,100
On the day of the Princess’s wedding,

496
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,700
just do as the decree says.

497
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,750
Don’t ask anything.

498
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,550
Aye, Your Majesty.

499
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:47,430
If anyone else knows

500
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:49,250
about the secret decree...

501
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:52,300
I will kill myself to apologize!

502
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:55,970
So will I.

503
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,360
Good.

504
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,240
Leave me.

505
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,590
Mr. Yuwen, I will see you later.

506
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:12,940
See you, Mr. Zhao.

507
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,350
Young Master Huai.

508
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,410
Her Grace is still waiting for you.

509
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,190
Just let her wait.

510
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,570
I’m kind of busy right now.

511
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,150
I will visit her when I’m free.

512
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,300
Aye.

513
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,260
Did he really say so?

514
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,760
Yes.

515
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,330
How dare he!

516
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:41,830
Your Grace.

517
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:44,090
Maybe he’s really busy.

518
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,020
His Majesty just

519
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,010
summoned him.

520
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,720
He looked in a hurry.

521
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,470
I’m going out of the palace.

522
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,350
Your Grace.

523
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,560
You must remain calm!

524
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,560
Imperial Concubine Zhao keeps an eye
on us all day,

525
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,480
expecting you to make mistakes.

526
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,570
If you get out of the palace secretly

527
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:02,780
and are caught,

528
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,760
I don’t know

529
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,750
how she will slander you.

530
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,200
But my son...

531
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,090
Young Master Huai is at least

532
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:14,860
the little prince’s uncle.

533
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,780
No matter how daredevil he is,

534
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,700
he will not harm the little prince.

535
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,760
Please just wait for a while.

536
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,400
And send another one to Hongshan House

537
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,410
to summon Young Master Huai.

538
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:25,970
Even if you insist
on going out of the palace,

539
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,050
you need to find a chance

540
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,430
and get ready for that.

541
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,720
Qiaoqiao.

542
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,230
Qiaoqiao, you come to see me?

543
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,940
Stay away from me! Keep away!

544
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:45,750
Qiaoqiao.

545
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,570
We are kind of friends

546
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,800
who experienced life and death.

547
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:51,310
It will hurt me if you are so heartless.

548
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,860
Who would believe that?

549
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,340
Looks like you have already got well.

550
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,880
I hear you are leaving.

551
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,490
Yes, I am.

552
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,480
Who told you?

553
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,060
Do you know

554
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,130
who hijacked you?

555
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,670
I don’t. Do you know?

556
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,520
I don’t know, either.

557
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,370
But they had

558
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,270
so many masters.

559
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,490
It’s hard to deal with them.

560
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,510
In my opinion,

561
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,380
your guards all look unreliable.

562
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,940
It’s a long way from here to Jiankang.

563
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,020
Can they

564
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:25,780
escort you back home safely?

565
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,390
You make sense, Qiaoqiao.

566
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:37,120
What’s your suggestion, then?

567
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,170
Look.

568
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,590
These are the famous local generals

569
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,300
who are brave and skillful.

570
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,840
They are all proficient in the art of war

571
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,850
and they have outstanding martial arts.

572
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,210
Also, they are loyal and brave

573
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,210
to bear hardship without complaint.

574
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,610
If you let them escort you home,

575
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,250
you will enjoy a safe trip

576
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,030
without any trouble.

577
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,430
Not even a mouse will disturb you.

578
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:58,730
Miss Chu.

579
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,070
Could this be

580
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,790
Mu An,

581
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,210
General Mu Zhongqing?

582
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,290
If he is still alive,

583
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:10,390
he must be over 80 now.

584
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,110
Yes.

585
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,820
He is

586
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,800
over 80,

587
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,290
but he’s in good health.

588
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,770
He is seen to walk around

589
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,320
on Zhuque Avenue every morning.

590
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,140
Strong as he is,

591
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,140
he could beat five of you

592
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,110
on his own.

593
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:27,720
Zhou Batian?

594
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,090
What an arrogant name!

595
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,610
Does he have great martial arts?

596
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:32,250
Precisely.

597
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,360
He is a famous bandit in the southwest.

598
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,980
He is well known among all bandits.

599
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,800
But he was caught by the government

600
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,060
and he spent much money.

601
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,960
He kind of made amends for his mistake.

602
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,400
To save himself,

603
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,150
he sold out all his buddies.

604
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,440
Now, he is in my team

605
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,810
and works in Defense Battalion.

606
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,510
Would you like to meet him?

607
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,450
This one looks reliable.

608
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,340
He studied in Martial Art Department.

609
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,890
Even His Majesty thinks

610
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:07,020
he has the best martial arts.

611
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,760
He’s from a famous family
and has both arts and arms.

612
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,180
He’s good.

613
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,190
Yes, he is awesome.

614
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:17,910
He doesn’t have experience

615
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:18,740
in leading the troops,

616
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,830
but he is very enthusiastic.

617
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,520
As long as you ask,

618
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,200
he will not hesitate

619
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,310
and be here at once.

620
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,770
However, you should

621
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,440
discuss it with his parents.

622
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,590
He is 12 years old after all

623
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,080
and he hasn’t left home before.

624
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,400
All right.

625
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,240
We don’t need to check the list.

626
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:46,000
Qiaoqiao, I’ve made up my mind.

627
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,640
Wouldn’t you get to know it more?

628
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,210
This is the list

629
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,270
we elaborately chose for you.

630
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,030
Don’t bother.

631
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,320
I have already made my decision.

632
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,080
Then who will you pick, Your Highness?

633
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:04,490
The seventh prince, Yuan Che.

634
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,510
No wonder you are the Crown Prince.

635
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,350
You really have a good taste.

636
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,160
Prince Yuan Che is the commander in chief

637
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,010
of Cavalry Battalion.

638
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,490
Before this,

639
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,090
he has fought wars for many years

640
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,400
and guarded the frontier.

641
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,050
He has splendid military exploits
and skilled military tactics.

642
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:22,010
He has great martial arts
and he’s generous.

643
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:23,800
He is also well-informed and humorous.

644
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,810
He is proficient in the geography.

645
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:26,810
And the best of all, he is noble.

646
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:27,970
He is the best candidate

647
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:29,560
to escort you back to Jiankang.

648
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,040
You describe him so perfectly.

649
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,690
I even want to turn Tieyou into a girl

650
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,240
to marry her to Yuan Che.

651
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:38,550
Do you?

652
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,140
And this is one of his superiorities.

653
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,100
He is so handsome

654
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,480
and full of masculinity.

655
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,070
He will be pleasing to the eye

656
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,140
on your way back.

657
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,480
Qiaoqiao.

658
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,610
I really like you more and more.

659
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,310
Just go back to Liang with me.

660
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,600
I won’t.

661
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,740
Just let Prince Yuan Che

662
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,830
go with you.

663
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,120
Tricky girl.

664
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,010
How crafty she is!

665
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,680
You want me

666
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,330
to bring Yuan Che away for you.

667
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,170
You could just say it.

668
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,190
Why did you bother
beating around the bush?

669
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,280
You also did that

670
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,160
to cooperate with us.

671
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,420
I just learn from you

672
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,910
and followed your steps.

673
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,500
Qiaoqiao, you know

674
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,370
I will help you.

675
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:23,840
But,

676
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,250
how would you repay me

677
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,040
since I do such a big favor for you?

678
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,550
I risked my life to save you

679
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,930
and I haven’t asked you to pay.

680
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,530
How dare you ask me to repay?

681
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,010
Now I am repaying you

682
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,610
to let Prince Yuan Che
escort you back home.

683
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:40,550
Go get me the horse.

684
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,440
Where are you going, Your Highness?

685
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,900
Get to the palace to say goodbye
to His Majesty.

686
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:47,560
Aye.

687
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:52,640
Qiaoqiao.

688
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,400
Remember to see me off

689
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,440
when I am leaving.

690
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,070
Your Highness.

691
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,130
What kind of crime

692
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,410
did General Yuwen make?

693
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,850
Why was he

694
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:19,920
transferred to the palace urgently?

695
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,580
I’m afraid somebody did a trick.

696
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,300
Yuwen Yue

697
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,990
has fallen in a trap.

698
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,370
Who could it be?

699
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,740
Get me the horse.
I’m getting to the palace.

700
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,050
Aye.

701
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,830
Your Highness.

702
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,160
Your Highness, His Majesty orders you

703
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,640
to prepare 5,000 soldiers

704
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,860
from Cavalry Battalion

705
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,870
and escort the Crown Prince of Liang

706
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,620
back to Jiankang

707
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,940
tomorrow morning.

708
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,390
Aye.

709
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:23,240
Looks like the Crown Prince Xiao

710
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,570
wants to help Yan Xun on purpose.

711
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,000
Therefore,

712
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,960
he chose you to escort him back.

713
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,630
Everyone from Liang is evil.

714
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,660
They all want our nation

715
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,820
to fall apart

716
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,230
and get stuck in wars.

717
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,060
You can’t disobey His Majesty.

718
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,600
You must go.

719
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:49,980
I know.

720
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,060
I shall leave you

721
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,560
to take care of Chang’an.

722
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,560
Once something happens,

723
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,190
I hope

724
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,970
you won’t care for your previous master

725
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,130
for the sake of our people.

726
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,780
Don’t worry, Your Highness.

727
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,390
I shall do my best

728
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:11,050
to protect our nation.

729
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,170
So long.

730
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,930
Your Highness, wish you a smooth trip.

731
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,270
See you, Your Highness.

732
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,010
Master, are we really going to

733
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,130
work against His Excellency Yan

734
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,530
as Prince Xiang wants?

735
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,330
Now I work for Prince Xiang.

736
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,370
I should keep his best interest in heart.

737
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:49,510
Now His Excellency Yan Xun is
going to rule Yanbei.

738
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,190
His Majesty and Prince Xiang

739
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,630
doubt each other.

740
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,360
Suspicious as His Majesty is,

741
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,750
he wouldn’t use Prince Xiang

742
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,500
without a strong enemy.

743
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,120
You mean…

744
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,350
I mean...

745
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:11,280
I think His Excellency Yan

746
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,170
will give me some surprise.

747
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,540
I am looking forward to seeing

748
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:17,610
what he will become

749
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,200
after he returns to Yanbei.

750
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,910
How is my old friend

751
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,770
going to deal with this?

752
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,460
He’s been working for years

753
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,840
trying to help Yanbei,

754
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,750
but I’m afraid
he’s just digging his own grave.

755
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,340
The Buddha never comes

756
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,630
out of hell.

757
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:38,810
Only evils do.

758
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,700
You’re leaving, Your Highness?

759
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,030
But...

760
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,120
But Princess Chun

761
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,960
will get married soon.

762
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,470
I can’t disobey my father.

763
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,340
I am leaving tonight.

764
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,680
Your Highness, if you leave,

765
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,020
Her Highness will be so upset.

766
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:58,870
Shuye,

767
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,740
this is not my main concern.

768
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,610
After thinking over carefully,

769
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,370
I want to entrust you

770
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,310
with something important.

771
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,630
Please help me.

772
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,220
Your Highness, how can I help?

773
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,030
Keep an eye on Yan Xun for me.

774
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,490
If he makes any suspicious move,

775
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,790
lead your private soldiers

776
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,040
and stop him from leaving Chang’an,

777
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,720
whatever it takes.

778
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,500
If necessary,

779
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:32,880
kill him.

780
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,770
Your Highness, you mean?

781
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,970
You are not stupid.

782
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:43,340
You and Yan Xun are friends for years.

783
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,790
You know him

784
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,160
very well.

785
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:48,520
How could he marry

786
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,140
my sister

787
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,210
after he has suffered so much?

788
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:55,770
I’m afraid he is up to something else.

789
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,230
He is?

790
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,080
Chang’an is heavily guarded.

791
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,570
He doesn’t have soldiers or money.

792
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,910
What can he do?

793
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,850
If he really does that,

794
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,750
he is only looking for trouble.

795
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,580
Remember.

796
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,280
He is never an ordinary man.

797
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:14,170
You’d better be very careful.

798
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,230
Fine.

799
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,570
I see, Your Highness.

800
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,930
I shall keep a close eye on him.

801
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,350
Also...

802
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:29,460
Yuwen Yue.

803
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,130
He’s a close friend with Yan Xun.

804
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,670
I don’t trust him perfectly.

805
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,580
Mr. Dongfang at my place

806
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,200
served Marquis Dingbei before.

807
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,350
I also worry if he might help Yan Xun.

808
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,790
At such a critical moment,

809
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,940
I can only count on you.

810
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,530
If Yan Xun escapes,

811
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,720
it will bring endless trouble.

812
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:57,740
Don’t worry, Your Highness.

813
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,530
I understand how serious this is.

814
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,450
I will do my best
to keep Yan Xun under control.

815
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,250
Hope so.

816
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,900
= Pine Hall =

817
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:12,190
We have limited resources.

818
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,820
500 soldiers from Xiuli Army

819
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,430
and 300 men of sacrifice
under Miss Yu’s command.

820
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:20,180
So, we can’t set up defenses everywhere.

821
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,980
We need to gamble

822
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,370
on the places where they might attack.

823
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,880
This is the route of on the wedding day.

824
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,000
At noon,

825
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,550
Yan Xun will leave the Oriole Courtyard,

826
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,210
go along Shuncheng Avenue,

827
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,610
pass Fu’an Gate,

828
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,360
Chang’an Office, Sangye Pool

829
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,510
and reach the Imperial Ancestral Temple.

830
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:37,910
According to the ritual,

831
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,130
you’ll worship your ancestors here.

832
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,370
After that,

833
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:43,030
you will go back to the palace
with protocol officers.

834
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:44,780
You will pass Zhuque Avenue,

835
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,350
get off the horse at Chengguang Gate,

836
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,770
and wait for protocol officers
to lead you the way

837
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,430
to marry the Princess in the palace.

838
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,540
If he kills the princess’s husband
on the wedding day,

839
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,800
it’s hard to convince people

840
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,460
even when he makes up

841
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,720
a righteous excuse.

842
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,450
So, he would act secretly.

843
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:00,050
They will do it

844
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,640
in a sparsely populated place.

845
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,000
The Imperial Ancestral Temple is
in the south of the city,

846
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,730
guarded by imperial guards.

847
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,490
Ordinary guys can’t get close.

848
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,560
Guards for you

849
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,190
come from the Ministry of Rites.

850
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,710
They won’t risk their lives
to protect you.

851
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,200
Therefore,

852
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,450
we believe

853
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:19,100
they’re likely to kill you

854
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:20,590
in the Imperial Ancestral Temple.

855
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,160
But it is a place

856
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,140
for imperial ancestor worship.

857
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,610
Would they really dare

858
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,600
to kill him there?

859
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,750
His Majesty doesn’t care.

860
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,370
Once something goes wrong,

861
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:32,590
he can ask me

862
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,470
to take the blame.

863
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:37,930
Xiuli Army will control Xue Zhileng

864
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:38,670
in advance.

865
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,380
On the night before the wedding day,

866
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,330
about a hundred soldiers will be waiting

867
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:42,360
near the Imperial Ancestral Temple

868
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:43,980
to support Yan Xun.

869
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,670
The other four hundred soldiers

870
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,340
will take control over the East Gate
on the wedding day

871
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:48,730
to help us break out.

872
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:52,660
Chang’an is heavily guarded.

873
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,380
This plan is very risky.

874
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,870
There are four major battalions
in Chang’an.

875
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,530
East and West Military Battalions,

876
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,330
South and North Green Battalions.
There’s also Cavalry Battalion.

877
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:04,720
There are one hundred thousand soldiers
in the city.

878
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:08,430
There are also palace guards,
imperial guards,

879
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:10,030
Wulin Guards, Bingsu Guards

880
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,350
and soldiers from Chang’an Office.

881
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,710
There are totally one hundred
and fifty thousand soldiers.

882
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,360
East and West Military Battalions,

883
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:18,930
Without the commander’s tally,

884
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,750
four major battalions can take no action.

885
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:24,590
Don’t forget.

886
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:28,400
The Emperor of Wei

887
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,160
fears the mutiny most.

888
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,290
Wulin Guards, Bingsu Guards,

889
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,060
palace guards, imperial guards

890
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:37,890
and Cavalry Battalion.

891
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:40,110
Their generals have the right

892
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,880
to suppress the mutiny without the tally.

893
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:45,750
But palace guards and imperial guards

894
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:46,580
have the duty

895
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,370
to guard the inner city

896
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,210
and protect the Emperor.

897
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:54,500
So, Wulin Guards, Bingsu Guards

898
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,880
and Cavalry Battalion

899
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,190
are most likely

900
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,430
to send troops.

901
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,360
Xiao Ce has taken Yuan Che away.

902
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,060
Yuwen Yue is not at Cavalry Battalion.

903
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,990
It should be much easier for us.

904
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,200
Then we still need to deal with

905
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:09,990
two large troops,

906
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,490
which means ten thousand soldiers.

907
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:15,190
We need to find a way

908
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,020
to inactivate the control center

909
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,690
of Wulin Guards and Bingsu Guards.

910
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,600
We shall kill their commanders

911
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,420
so that they’ll lose their leaders

912
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,450
and can’t be dispatched in time.

913
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,850
Even if we kill

914
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:30,160
their commanders,

915
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,010
I think

916
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:33,630
others will know it soon.

917
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:34,940
We have placed people

918
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,390
in the main roads

919
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:37,150
to stop the communication

920
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,870
among battalions and offices.

921
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,270
Once the city is in chaos,

922
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:42,760
our men on Zhuque Avenue

923
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,970
will react immediately.

924
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,890
When they set fire,

925
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,010
people will run about.

926
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:49,020
Soldiers will be too busy
to do their duty.

927
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:50,500
Set fire?

928
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,320
We prepared that

929
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,260
between the residential area and shops.

930
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,290
Our men will set fire

931
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:58,400
to distract the army.

932
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,480
Be careful, then.

933
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:03,860
Don’t burn down houses

934
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,630
of common people

935
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,070
in case innocent people may die.

936
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,680
They won’t.

937
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,230
But we won’t show any mercy

938
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,310
to officials.

939
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,510
The next step is to get out of the city.

940
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,820
Xiuli Army

941
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,410
will take control of the East Gate.

942
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,670
Once the city is in chaos,

943
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,150
they will kill the guards
and open the gate.

944
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,460
When we all arrive,

945
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,730
we shall break out through the East Gate

946
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:27,620
and go towards the north.

947
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,680
Ferry at Weishui River near the city

948
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,920
has been desolated for years.

949
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,440
We will build a wooden bridge

950
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,110
one night before.

951
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:35,730
Horses will be ready across the river.

952
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:37,240
Once we are there,

953
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:38,840
we can escape from Chang’an

954
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,980
with the map Xiao Ce gave us.

955
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,620
We have more than three hundred people.

956
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,890
We also have Xiuli Army.

957
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:46,990
There are more than
eight hundred people in total.

958
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:48,650
The bridge needs to be built solidly.

959
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:49,970
Is one night enough?

960
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:50,680
Yes.

961
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:51,800
Those people

962
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,980
fought wars everywhere

963
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,350
with Marquis Dingbei.

964
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,620
They are very good at making ways

965
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,690
and building bridges.

966
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,380
We have planned thoroughly,

967
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,590
but we will still risk ourselves

968
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:04,070
when fighting a hundred thousand soldiers

969
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:05,420
with less than one thousand.

970
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,630
If any of them

971
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:08,960
fights against us,

972
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:11,540
we will all die.

973
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,370
This is a huge gamble

974
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,030
on no one fighting for the Emperor of Wei

975
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:19,950
after what happened on Jiuyou Platform.

976
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,910
General Yuwen, I’m sorry,

977
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:37,010
but you must guard Cuiwei Palace for now.

978
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:43,180
