I never thought

17
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:41,790
Xiaoliu could beat

18
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,950
so many maids with Silver Bell.

19
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,560
Maybe tonight

20
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,950
she’ll be able to avenge.

21
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,650
Here are

00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,120
all eyes and ears around.

tonight,

25
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,450
we’ll all die.

26
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,600
Let’s go to work.

27
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,290
Why don’t you kill me?

28
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,180
Have you forgotten

29
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,590
your brother was killed by me?

30
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,110
You can kill me now.

31
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,610
I dare not.

32
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,370
In your heart,

33
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,830
there is nothing you dare not to do.

34
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,190
Not anymore.

35
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,020
Come with me.

36
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,140
I’ve picked up your two sisters

37
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,400
to Qingshan House.

38
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,730
You can feel at ease.

39
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,400
Thank you, Young Master.

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,720
Remember.

41
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,760
Only in one circumstance

42
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,860
can you give a knife to others.

43
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,390
That is when you

44
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,720
have their weakness

45
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,110
in your hand.

46
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,970
Aye.

47
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,420
Come here.

48
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,470
Don’t use the name Jing Xiaoliu

49
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,410
anymore.

50
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,790
I’ll give you a new name,

51
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,230
Xing’er.

52
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,330
Thanks, Young Master.

53
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,220
Isn’t the name good?

54
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,820
Yes, it is.

55
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,930
Why don’t you smile then?

56
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,690
Can’t you even pretend?

57
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,140
In front of an opponent stronger than you,

58
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,950
don’t tremble

59
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,710
no matter how scared you are.

60
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,260
You should smile.

61
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,910
Smile happily.

62
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:29,910
Get ready for bed.

63
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,730
Since I determined

64
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,990
to be his bedchamber maid,

65
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,690
there’s no way back.

66
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,450
But...

67
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,620
There’s a bamboo slip on the bed.

68
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,690
Get it to me.

69
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,510
Receive your punishment tomorrow.

70
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:30,670
Why?

71
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,010
Receive

72
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,670
your double punishment tomorrow.

73
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:22,780
Aye.

74
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,190
Get me the midnight snack.

75
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,570
Aye.

76
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,120
Fool! Fool!

77
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,220
I want a whole set.

78
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:53,870
Young Master.

79
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,190
Aren’t you eating alone?

80
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,090
Whenever I eat,

81
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,320
with how many people,

82
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,250
get a whole set on my table,

83
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,080
no one less.

84
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,430
Aye.

85
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,610
I want plum blossoms.

86
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,250
Will you eat plum blossoms?

87
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,580
Fried ones

88
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,680
or boiled ones?

89
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,820
By making wontons

90
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,930
or cakes?

91
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,410
I want the bowl with plum blossom.

92
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:20,860
Aye.

93
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,670
Xiaoba.

94
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,860
What are you doing?

95
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,120
Are you eavesdropping?

96
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,330
Pooh!

97
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,730
Shameless.

98
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,810
Jing Xiaoliu and Young Master Yue

99
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,890
are really a perfect match.

100
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,460
Young Master. The snack is fish soup.

101
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,690
It will taste bad if it’s cold.

102
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,740
Please have it while it’s hot.

103
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,050
Come and serve me now.

104
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,310
Come.

105
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,270
Aye.

106
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,280
Give me your hand.

107
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,870
Young Master. What are you doing?

108
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,400
You’ll obey me

109
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,770
unconditionally.

110
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:52,960
It hurts!

111
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,600
Young Master.

112
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,090
What are you doing?

113
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,970
It hurts! It hurts!

114
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,500
It hurts!

115
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,920
It’s so fragrant.

116
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,710
You can’t even resist the timing incense.

117
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,350
Obviously you’ve never adventured the world.

118
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,640
The world?

119
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,740
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

120
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:09,790
Enough!

121
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,480
Enough! Enough! Enough!

122
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,210
It hurts! It hurts!

123
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,220
Enough! Enough!

124
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,700
It hurts! Enough!

125
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,780
Vixen!

126
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,570
It hurts!

127
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,490
Vixen!

128
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,590
It hurts!

129
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,170
I’m gonna fix you!

130
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,510
It hurts!

131
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,710
Young Master.

132
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,650
Will you continue reciting the Eye of Intel?

133
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,210
No.

134
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:57,720
Since you

135
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,330
saved her from the human hunting ground,

136
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,520
Master has asked me

137
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,570
to keep an eye on her in your stead.

138
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,240
This girl is wild

139
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,140
and obstinate.

140
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,390
If you don’t use her properly,

141
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,190
you may get yourself hurt.

142
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:16,050
Use her alertly. Then abandon her.

143
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,860
My dear grandson.

144
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,530
Keep it in mind.

145
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,770
Dear brother, Yu.

146
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,470
Through the extreme joys and sorrows these days,

147
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,890
many feelings come into my mind.

148
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,850
Living in turmoil

149
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,520
is like making a way out of thorns.

150
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,540
Every step is hard and dangerous.

151
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,360
I really wish to be carefree

152
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,570
and travel around like you.

153
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,590
That’s the real freedom.

154
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,700
Young Master

155
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,450
bedded with a girl the first time.

156
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,250
He’s young after all.

157
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,720
That girl

158
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,360
screamed last night and even in the morning.

159
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,090
Bring the breakfast to them now.

160
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,080
Let’s see how you will scream

161
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,980
when you die.

162
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:36,970
Why are you screaming?

163
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,620
Didn’t you beg me

164
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:39,940
for a chance

165
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,470
to bed with me?

166
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,380
Are you shy?

167
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:00,950
Listen.

168
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,600
My bedchamber maid

169
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,230
should know some martial arts.

170
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,050
Look carefully.

171
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,250
I only show you once.

172
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,360
Young Master is awesome! Awesome!

173
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,590
Young Master is awesome!

174
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,830
It hurts! It hurts!

175
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,580
Practice over and over

176
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,830
until you make moves naturally.

177
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,110
Young Master Yue.

178
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,980
Here comes the bad guy! Here comes the bad guy!

179
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,570
Don’t move!

180
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,740
You slut!

181
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,490
What are you standing here for?

182
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:05,860
What are you waiting for?

183
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,490
Go

184
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,110
and wash the bedding

185
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,170
you’ve stained.

186
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,590
I stained?

187
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,430
It’s you who stained it.

188
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,310
Bad! Bad!

189
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,130
I’ve been here for ten years.

190
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,550
It’s my first time to see

191
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,990
a maid is still an Iron Bell after bedding.

192
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,930
Isn’t she

193
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,870
just like a whore?

194
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,560
Sis. She’s much more

195
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,950
than a whore...

196
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,480
She’s a whore at night.

197
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,210
During the day,

198
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,110
she still follows the rules

199
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,260
and works as a maid with Iron Bell,

200
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,450
like washing bedding.

201
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:07,690
Forget it.

202
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,180
Ignore her.

203
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,380
If Xiaoliu

204
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,320
can have a son

205
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,410
or a daughter

206
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:13,790
for Young Master,

207
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,730
she’ll be free from slavery,

208
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,290
and become their mistress.

209
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,270
By then

210
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,720
no one will dare to bully us.

211
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,900
What did you say?

212
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,240
Sis. She said

213
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:25,920
we’ve offended

214
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,560
our future mistress.

215
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,230
I’m so scared.

216
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,410
What are you scared of?

217
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,340
You’re just daydreaming.

218
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,260
Chicken is chicken.

219
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,240
It can never be a phoenix

220
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,730
no matter how high it flies.

221
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,840
At least,

222
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,960
it’s better than a low chicken

223
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,940
all the lifetime.

224
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,980
Jinzhu.

225
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,260
The soup this morning was bad.

226
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,550
Young Master was unsatisfied.

227
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,180
Don’t threaten me with Young Master!

228
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,600
I’m telling you.

229
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,450
If Young Master really cares about you,

230
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,220
he won’t let you wash the bedding yourself.

231
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,850
You’d better get back to work.

232
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,540
Xiaoliu!

233
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,180
Was what she said true?

234
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,250
Xiaoliu.

235
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,000
Xiaoliu.

236
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,650
The grappling skills he taught me

237
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,850
are really awesome.

238
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,990
Don’t you feel bored?

239
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,250
- Princess.
- Princess.

240
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,320
Chun.

241
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,280
You’re dressed like a man.

242
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:08,820
What are you doing?

243
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,610
Am I like a man?

244
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,430
Don’t you think

245
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,360
I’m so handsome

246
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,860
and dashing?

247
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,910
Moreover,

248
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,370
don’t you think I look like someone?

249
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,190
Who?

250
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,330
Your Highness.

251
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,780
She looks identical

252
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,700
to you.

253
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,610
Alright.

254
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:37,130
I have

255
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,370
an idea for you guys.

256
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,530
Play the arrow-throwing blindfold.

257
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:41,580
Isn’t it more fun

258
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,660
and exciting?

259
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,840
Yan Xun.

260
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,330
Let me blindfold you.

261
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,090
Your Highness. Should I blindfold you?

262
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:48,880
I won’t.

263
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,680
Leave.

264
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:50,360
Aye.

265
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,640
Come on. Blindfold me.

266
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,240
Brother.

267
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,670
What are you doing?

268
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:57,890
Stop sitting there.

269
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:58,930
Go ahead. Go.

270
00:21:58,930 --> 00:21:59,500
Alright.

271
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,210
Hurry. Blindfold my brother.

272
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,090
Go playing.

273
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,850
Have a good time.

274
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,520
I’ll get some sleep.

275
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,120
Blindfold me.

276
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:06,750
Aye.

277
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,520
Yan Xun.

278
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:09,720
Yan Xun.

279
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,220
Have you fallen asleep?

280
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,150
No.

281
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,960
Not so soon.

282
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,680
Go. Go to have fun.

283
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,630
Don’t sleep.

284
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:25,660
Make way.

285
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,350
Your Highness.

286
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,440
Why don’t we play together?

287
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,120
No.

288
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,350
What do you want then?

289
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,370
I just want to stay here.

290
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,550
Stand here.

291
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,550
Watch him

292
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,840
sleep.

293
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,390
You can sleep anytime.

294
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,790
Why do you have to sleep now?

295
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,940
Wild Kitten. Don’t be naughty.

296
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,050
You just said

297
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,850
Wild Kitten thing.

298
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,180
Who is Wild Kitten?

299
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,020
What did I say?

300
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,990
Wild Kitten or something.

301
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,770
Don’t be naughty.

302
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,680
Wild Kitten is a wild cat.

303
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,720
Meow. Meow.

304
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,810
A... A wild cat.

305
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,340
Why do I feel

306
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,360
it’s not a cat?

307
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,240
Of course it’s a cat.

308
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,190
Right?

309
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,430
Alright.

310
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,850
I have something to do.

311
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:02,990
I’ll take my leave.

312
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,390
Yan Xun, where are you going?

313
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,600
Go feed my cat.

314
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,430
Cat?

315
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,770
What brings you here?

316
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,530
A prince is here.

317
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,490
Shouldn’t you stand up and salute?

318
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,370
You just became

319
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,770
Yuwen Yue’s bedchamber maid.

320
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:00,540
Now you dare to

321
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,470
ignore me?

322
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,530
You have no manners.

323
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,240
You won’t be promising.

324
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:07,790
Well, you are really something.

325
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:12,940
By the way,

326
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,100
it’s said Yuwen Yue

327
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,230
gave you a new name,

328
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,290
Xing’er.

329
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,300
Was it

330
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,010
to match his name Yue?

331
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:24,620
How romantic!

332
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,200
Did he last night...

333
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,660
Why are you so irascible?

334
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,550
I see.

335
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,410
No wonder you’re so irritable.

336
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,670
I guess

337
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,140
you might

338
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,770
fail your wish last night.

339
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,220
You were kicked out

340
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,960
by your cold master.

341
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,550
What are you talking about?

342
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,760
You’re a noble.

343
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,050
You’d better stay away.

344
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,450
Don’t get wet.

345
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,070
I’m reminding you out of kindness.

346
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,690
Yuwen Yue

347
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,770
is still in the mourning period.

348
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:22,070
He won’t touch you.

349
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,680
You... You...

350
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,980
What mourning period?

351
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:25,790
What is it

352
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,030
to do with me?

353
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,030
He’s mourning his grandfather.

354
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:30,590
Right?

355
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,570
But I’m not.

356
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,930
The men of Yanbei

357
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,750
are eagle bearers and horse riders,

358
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,080
handsome and broad-minded.

359
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,290
Why don’t you be with me?

360
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,350
Don’t!

361
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,280
Throwing such a big rob,

362
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,960
you’ll kill me.

363
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,050
I warn you.

364
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,590
We have nothing to do with each other.

365
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,190
You better not mess with me.

366
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,530
Otherwise,

367
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,270
I’ll teach you a lesson.

368
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,180
You! Stop!

369
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,640
What on earth do you want?

370
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,430
Come. Lead the horse for me.

371
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,810
Lead my horse.

372
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:34,750
OK.

373
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,790
Mount.

374
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,110
Who says I’m gonna ride?

375
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:49,090
I just want to take a walk.

376
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,270
Taking a walk.

377
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,050
You...

378
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,160
You? You what?

379
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,420
Catch up.

380
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,040
If I go far away

381
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,620
and Swift kicks you,

382
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,770
that won’t be my business.

383
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,150
You...

384
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,180
Mr. Cold has no interest in girls.

385
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,290
I don’t understand

386
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:27,300
why you keep Wild Kitten

387
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,180
beside you.

388
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,970
Who told you

389
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,430
I have no interest in girls?

390
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,730
It’s really strange

391
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,610
that Wild Kitten

392
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,090
could pass two games.

393
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,170
You really think

394
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,820
it’s a fluke for her?

395
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:57,930
She doesn’t know martial arts indeed,

396
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,590
but she’s quick

397
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,390
and agile.

398
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,940
She’s incredibly observant,

399
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,380
making good use of everything

400
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,910
in the environment.

401
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,690
Her memory is even more impressive.

402
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,890
She’s the only survivor

403
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,190
in the human hunting ground.

404
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,400
In Chang’an City,

405
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,790
she has no connections or backers.

406
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,570
That’s what I need the most.

407
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,920
Yes, exactly.

408
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,880
You’re absolutely right.

409
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,050
So,

410
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,880
I will take away

411
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,870
this Wild Kitten.

412
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,640
It’s too late

413
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,910
to take her away.

414
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,210
Alright.

415
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,550
Since I can’t take her away,

416
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,650
I’ll have to stay

417
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:49,190
in your House.

418
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,030
It’s a big place.

419
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,330
You can stay

420
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,420
as long as you want.

421
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,430
I’m serious.

422
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,180
Don’t do real things

423
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,640
with my Wild Kitten.

424
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:09,550
Piss off.

425
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:44,900
What are you doing?

426
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,280
Are you blind?

427
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:48,810
Why are you

428
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,260
pouring dirty water to my sister’s bed sheets?

429
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,760
I can sense her foul smell

430
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,610
even with my eyes closed.

431
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,720
That Iron Bell whore.

432
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,700
Who do you mean the whore?

433
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,440
Of course your sister.

434
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,420
Who else

435
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,530
could it be?

436
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,120
What?

437
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,100
Are you unconvinced?

438
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,210
A maid from the grassland

439
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:11,090
dreams to stand out in Qingshan House.

440
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,690
You can save your breath.

441
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,950
My sister isn’t a whore!

442
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,960
Isn’t she?

443
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,030
OK.

444
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,590
Get me some honey.

445
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,540
Aye.

446
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:27,710
What are you doing?

447
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:28,450
What are you doing?

448
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,540
Maids!

449
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,190
Come and catch them!

450
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,750
Even bugs know

451
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,070
your sister

452
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,060
is still a maid in her bones,

453
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,400
though she beds

454
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,740
with Young Master.

455
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,360
These ants and bugs

456
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,280
are obviously drawn

457
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,000
by your honey!

458
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,230
It’s your trick!

459
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,130
Your trick!

460
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,550
You’re pretty smart.

461
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:40,600
Yes.

462
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,680
It’s my trick.

463
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,990
I’m teaching you a lesson

464
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,110
and humiliating you.

465
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,410
So what?

466
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,800
I’m in a good mood.

467
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,570
I’ll teach you the rules

468
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,980
of Qingshan House.

469
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,750
No!

470
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,180
No?

471
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,010
Oh. It occurs to me that

472
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,940
maids from the grassland

473
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,500
have never

474
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,220
tasted honey before, right?

475
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,600
I’m in the mood today.

476
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:20,960
You can have enough.

477
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:25,910
Eat it!

478
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,190
You low slaves

479
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,780
dream to bed with Young Master

480
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,960
and be the mistress,

481
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,310
enjoying honor and wealth.

482
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,300
Alright.

483
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,130
I’ll let you have enough.

484
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,100
Eat!

485
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:36,480
Xiaoqi.

486
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:36,860
Let me go!

487
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,630
Hold her.

488
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,760
It’s you who hit me?

489
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,220
Are you talking to me?

490
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:15,950
Or what?

491
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,310
Is there anyone else here?

492
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,180
Xiaoliu.

493
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,110
Let them go.

494
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,000
Are you alright?

495
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,300
We’re fine.

496
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,710
These two low maids

497
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,730
don’t know rules.

498
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,500
I’m teaching them a lesson for Young Master.

499
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,220
Really?

500
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,420
Is it Young Master Yue

501
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,630
who asked you to punish them?

502
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,660
I’m punishing two maids.

503
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,390
Should I ask Young Master for permission?

504
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,650
Jinzhu.

505
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,470
You’re a maid with Silver Bell,

506
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,700
but don’t forget

507
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,720
you’re also a servant here.

508
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,930
There are rules.

509
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:56,820
You punish them

510
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,050
without permission.

511
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:58,890
Aren’t you afraid

512
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:00,000
to be punished by the House?

513
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,430
Should I tell Young Master Yue

514
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,030
how you

515
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:03,780
ignore the rules

516
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,680
of the House?

517
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:05,670
Right.

518
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,960
We’re all maids.

519
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,740
No one is nobler than others.

520
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,540
Sounds like

521
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,170
you’re the lady of the House.

522
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:11,990
Right.

523
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,400
Shut up!

524
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,500
You humble slave!

525
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:23,760
What are you waiting for?

526
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,890
Watching a show?

527
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,240
Beat their teeth out!

528
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,700
- Aye!
- Aye!

529
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,440
Come.

530
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,300
Hurry!

531
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,330
Can’t you behave yourself?

532
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,030
Why do you have to be a vicious dog?

533
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,280
How bold!

534
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,950
Young Master. Jinzhu started it first!

535
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,870
No. Young Master.

536
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,060
I was just teaching them rules.

537
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,000
But

538
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,140
they didn’t listen,

539
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,580
and even went against me.

540
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:48,960
Look.

541
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,750
If it goes like this,

542
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,680
Qingshan House

543
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,420
will be turned upside down.

544
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:55,410
Young Master, I...

545
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:56,070
Shut up.

546
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,580
You can’t even learn the rules.

547
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,570
Come.

548
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:00,610
Get punished.

549
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,730
Guys, you see?

550
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,340
You see?

551
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:30,310
Who does he defend?

552
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,130
Who does he punish?

553
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:32,930
Don’t you think

554
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,610
Xing’er will be favored

555
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:35,740
after bedding with Young Master.

556
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,940
In Qingshan House,

557
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,460
Jinzhu is still the boss,

558
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,520
the most favored maid.

559
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,470
Don’t you think so?

560
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:43,800
Go.

561
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,710
A rabid dog.

562
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,870
Excuse me?

563
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,520
Say it again.

564
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,610
Who do you mean the dog?

565
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,260
Bad guy! Bad guy!

566
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:58,800
Bad guy! Bad guy!

567
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,880
Bad guy!

568
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:02,600
Bad guy! Bad guy!

569
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,220
Overconfident

570
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,300
and troublesome.

571
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,810
I know I’m overconfident,

572
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,350
but I didn’t wanna be humiliated.

573
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,060
You’re humiliating yourself,

574
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,850
aren’t you?

575
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,660
Young Master. I’m wrong.

576
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,280
Actually,

577
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,180
I was not just

578
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,510
speaking up for myself.

579
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:32,560
I just

580
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,840
hate those who stand the truth on its head

581
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,950
and bully the weak.

582
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,930
This is a world dominated by the strong.

583
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,450
You’re weak.

584
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:44,790
How will you uphold justice for others?

585
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:49,220
Those who stand the truth on its head

586
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,300
and bully the weak

587
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,750
are so called the strong?

588
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,240
I don’t understand.

589
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,370
Please enlighten me.

590
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:06,700
You want to be strong, right?

591
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,270
Alright.

592
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,320
I’ll satisfy you today.

593
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:55,430
Young Master.

594
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,060
Xing’er.

595
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,450
Catch up with Young Master.

596
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,770
Young Master.

597
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,160
Throw stones.

598
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,550
Young Master.

599
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,150
Is the punishment over?

600
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:15,030
Just four leopard heads make you elated.

601
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:16,260
Keep practicing.

602
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,030
If you don’t do well,

603
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,850
Xiaoqi and Xiaoba

604
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:21,940
won’t leave Qingshan House alive.

605
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,420
Yueqi.

606
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,310
Start six leopard heads.

607
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:48,070
Now you may understand

608
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:49,540
stone-throwing should also

609
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,160
be accurate, fast and timely.

610
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:52,320
In the next 6 hours,

611
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,160
you’ll practice this.

612
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:55,120
If you are not good enough,

613
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,190
you won’t be necessarily punished.

614
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,200
Even those headless arrows

615
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,330
will make you suffer.

616
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,040
To avenge,

617
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,770
I’ll endure it however painful and hard it is.
