What do you think, Your Majesty?

18
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,590
It reminds me

19
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,020
of her youth.

20
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,690
Why can’t people

21
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,020
keep their innocence?

22
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,620
Why do they become so calculative

after growing up?

24
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,130
She thought I didn’t know

25
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,270
she did all this

26
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,290
for her son!

27
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,060
Your Majesty.

28
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,430
I think

29
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,820
Bai Sheng shouldn’t stay

30
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,890
in Chang’an anymore.

31
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,780
No.

32
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,650
Bai Sheng has to stay.

33
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,540
So does

34
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,770
her son.

35
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,120
In that case,

36
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,180
I don’t see any benefits but only the opposite.

37
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,440
His suspicions will rise.

38
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,180
You have a point.

39
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,850
Keeping Bai Sheng here,

40
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,480
Yan Shicheng will take precautions.

41
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,760
A lose-lose situation is the worst.

42
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,470
Only by sending Bai Sheng back,

43
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,410
will Yan Shicheng

44
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,760
lower his guard.

45
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,420
Darling, you’re indeed helpful.

46
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,580
Carry out my edict.

47
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,320
Send Bai Sheng back to Yanbei.

48
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,470
Yes, Your Majesty.

49
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,270
The less, the better.

50
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,070
Mother,

51
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,700
you just arrived in Chang’an.

52
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,260
Why are you going back so soon?

53
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,160
This is His Majesty’s order.

54
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,480
I have no choice.

55
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,590
After I leave,

56
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,510
you need to be careful.

57
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,860
Don’t worry, mother.

58
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,400
I have lived here since childhood.

59
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,500
Socializing with others is my strong suit.

60
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,050
You don’t need to worry.

61
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,230
But,

62
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,800
please talk to father.

63
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,530
His Majesty is skeptical.

64
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,470
Father wields an army

65
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,650
and poses a threat to His Majesty.

66
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,780
At this stage, showing his loyalty is of no use.

67
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:17,940
Only by getting hold of the army,

68
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,040
and keeping Yanbei under control,

69
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,950
can he ensure the safety of our people.

70
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,520
Never lend a ready ear to slander,

71
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,660
and do not act rashly.

72
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,460
Distance can test a horse’s stamina,

73
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,600
and time can reveal a person’s heart.

74
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,540
Whether we are loyal or not,

75
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,210
His Majesty would tell someday.

76
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,850
If we could struggle through this period,

77
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,370
everything is going to be fine

78
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,050
eventually.

81
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,770
in this dog-eat-dog city,

82
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,620
I must grow up quickly.

83
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,790
I didn’t plan to tell you this,

84
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,090
because I was afraid that your reaction

85
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,090
would be too obvious if you knew it,

86
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,490
and it would easily be told by others.

87
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,840
Since you’ve figured everything out,

88
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,550
I feel relieved.

89
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,130
Mother, just take it easy.

90
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:07,970
As long as you and father

91
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,100
are safe in Yanbei,

92
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,550
my safety in the capital will be guaranteed.

93
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,230
Someday, I will go back to Yanbei.

94
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,920
Lady Yan, we need to go.

95
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,010
Xun, I can’t wait

96
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,670
to meet the girl you love.

97
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,200
Take her back with you soon.

= Qingshan House =

99
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,540
The make of a spy

100
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,270
includes collecting intelligence,

101
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,030
wiretapping and surveillance,

102
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,520
infiltration and assassination,

103
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,790
protecting and guarding.

104
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,460
Collecting intelligence

105
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,080
requires thoroughness.

106
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,110
Wiretapping and surveillance

107
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,840
call for sharp senses.

108
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,820
I understand.

109
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,010
The latter two need superb martial arts.

110
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,500
You’re delicate

111
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,960
with no kung fu.

112
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,670
I do wonder

113
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,720
if you are qualified.

114
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,110
You have nothing to worry about.

115
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,600
Young Master, I’m sure

116
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,350
under your teaching,

117
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,340
I will become

118
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,630
the best spy.

119
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,910
Easier said than done.

120
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,230
The one who aims high with no ability

121
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,630
will doom to fail.

122
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,930
Lesson learned.

123
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:51,020
= Qingshan House =

124
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,640
When crossing the Yellow River,

125
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,970
and witnessing the waves crashing on the shore,

126
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,490
and when it was beginning to cloud over,

127
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,430
I discovered a small sandbar.

128
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,020
There I found spring willows budding,

129
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,350
and wildflowers in full bloom.

130
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,540
Leaning on a railing overlooking,

131
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,930
I gained inner peace.

132
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,190
Hope in the turbulent days,

133
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,190
you can still be sheltered

134
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,540
to share that happy moment.

135
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,660
In the turbulent days,

136
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,990
shelter is hard to be found.

137
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,510
I want to be a rock.

138
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,400
However the river flows,

139
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,390
I’ll always stand still.

140
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,520
Wherever leaves fall,

141
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,900
I’ll still have a place to stay.

142
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,080
Master, Young Master has arrived.

143
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,710
Young Master, please.

144
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,760
Why did grandfather

145
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,180
ask to see me?

146
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,700
I have pondered over it the whole night.

147
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,690
Although I suspect Yuwen Xi is the mole,

148
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,420
I have no evidence.

149
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,440
If I take actions,

150
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,390
it will only wake up a sleeping dog.

151
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,150
Now our foremost enemies

152
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,960
are still the spies from Liang.

153
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,380
Those spies are everywhere.

154
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,070
Now that they’re there,

155
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,660
I don’t think it’s only for

156
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,560
the Eye of Intel.

157
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,460
What do you mean?

158
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,650
Were they here

159
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,000
only for the Eye of Intel,

160
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,590
they’d leave right after the mission failed.

161
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:58,890
But they are still

162
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,300
hiding in the capital.

163
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,970
Obviously, they have other plans.

164
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,930
If Liang really

165
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,400
wants to trigger a bloody carnage

166
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,150
in this world,

167
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,530
the first thing

168
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,450
is to turn Yanbei

169
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,430
against Wei.

170
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,650
So in this battle

171
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,450
between the spies of Liang and us,

172
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,430
the fastest wins.

173
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,060
You are right.

174
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,850
Yue,

175
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,380
the blade you honed

176
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,230
should be put into use.

177
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:31,900
But this matter is important.

178
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,670
This time, the spies from Liang

179
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,530
are not ordinary people.

180
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,630
Besides, Xing’er has just started her training.

181
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,940
If we send her to execute this mission,

182
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,380
I am afraid it may backfire.

183
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,330
Liar. Liar!

184
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,480
It’s obvious that you are partial towards her.

185
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,690
The duty of the Eye of Intel

186
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,030
and the fortune of Wei

187
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,050
versus that cheap maidservant,

188
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,150
which one is more important?

189
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,160
I just…

190
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,470
Yueqi requests an audience.

191
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,310
Come in.

192
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,330
Young Master,

193
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,740
I’m sorry that I let you down.

194
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,370
The spies from Liang were in preparedness

195
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,610
Yue Guards and I

196
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,800
failed to acquire any information.

197
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,680
Send Xing’er there.

198
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,180
She is a new face.

199
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,060
Her skills won’t reveal her identity,

200
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,520
so she has a bigger chance to succeed.

201
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,690
If she fails,

202
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,680
that will prove

203
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,580
she doesn’t have what it takes to be a spy.

204
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,240
Besides, Qingshan House

205
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,030
won’t suffer any losses.

206
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,580
Fine.

207
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,400
Young Master,

208
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,740
given Xing’er’s current ability,

209
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,890
isn’t it too dangerous for her

210
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,130
to carry out this mission?

211
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,150
Follow her secretly.

212
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,900
If anything comes up,

213
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,860
she’ll have to handle it herself.

214
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,540
Aye.

215
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,760
Are you waiting for me?

216
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,550
Young Master, I just arrived.

217
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,240
May I ask, when can we

218
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,470
start my training?

219
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,410
These days,

220
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,750
you have learned

221
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,720
some basic skills,

222
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,610
but those are far from enough.

223
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,560
If you want to be

224
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,630
the best spy of the Eye of Intel,

225
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,910
you need to learn from the actual combat.

226
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,090
Do you mean

227
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,700
you are giving me a new mission?

228
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,130
But this mission

229
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,020
isn’t easy.

230
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,790
Young Master, don’t worry.

231
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,960
I understand.

232
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,310
You’re training me

233
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,160
to become

234
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,720
your sharpest weapon

235
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,980
and to be put into use

236
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,230
when you need me.

237
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,910
Last time, in the secret passage

238
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,960
of the Intel Building,

239
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,640
do you remember

240
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,630
the spies from Liang

241
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,770
who fought against you?

242
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,820
I’m sending you to stock them

243
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,430
for information.

244
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,360
Can you do that?

245
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:37,910
Of course.

246
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,640
I can use this opportunity

247
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,030
to improve my skills.

248
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:44,940
Once you complete

249
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,970
this mission successfully,

250
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:49,030
you can take the assassination course.

251
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,510
This is the wiretapping equipment

252
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,360
the Eye of Intel has studied for years,

253
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,160
Gold Listener.

254
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,430
This is another flying aid,

255
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,590
Bamboo-copter.

256
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,340
My lady.

257
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,150
News from Yanbei.

258
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,810
Yan Shicheng sent an ace

259
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:30,810
to Chang’an.

260
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,240
Who did he send?

261
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,480
A woman.

262
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,500
Woman?

263
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,430
According to my knowledge,

264
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,520
the top female martial artist in Yanbei

265
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,770
is Zhong Yu.

266
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,020
Did she come alone?

267
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,360
I don’t think so.

268
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,600
The house next to Hostage’s Mansion

269
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,230
is occupied by some people quietly.

270
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,350
Their accents and physiques show

271
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,210
they may come from Yanbei.

272
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,450
Obviously, they’re Zhong Yu’s people.

273
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,720
What is she up to?

274
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,250
She seems to be running around

275
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,060
in the black market secretly

276
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,760
to purchase something.

277
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,100
Also, she asked around

278
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,250
about Zuo Baocang’s whereabouts.

279
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,640
Zuo Baocang?

280
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,110
Yan Xun is planning to escape.

281
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,710
We cannot let him succeed.

282
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,270
But our movements are restricted

283
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,760
with Yuwen Yue being here.

284
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,900
We can’t do much.

285
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,880
Put them away.

286
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,100
Aye.

287
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,260
Soon this Yuwen Yue

288
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,650
will have his plate full.

289
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,340
Once our little bunny

290
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,580
rises to the bait,

291
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,200
we will send them to death

292
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,430
at the Fine Weaponry Shop

293
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,850
owned by Zuo Baocang.

294
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,540
Right now,

295
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,770
most of our hidden guards have been eliminated.

296
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,920
Our losses are huge and weapons lacking.

297
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,550
We are badly in need of weapons.

298
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,850
Is there any place in Chang’an

299
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,800
where we can buy weapons

300
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,460
secretly?

301
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,910
Of course.

302
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,670
Other than weapons,

303
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,280
fortunetelling, information of the underworld

304
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,050
maps of noble families and sharp weapons

305
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,040
are all available,

306
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,290
if you have money.

307
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,360
Who is the seller?

308
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,790
Zuo Baocang.

309
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,670
Fortunetelling, maps of noble families,

310
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,670
and sharp weapons.

311
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,950
So if I find this person,

312
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,160
I can enter the Pleasure Pavilion

313
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,170
without being noticed.

314
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,060
= Zuo’s General Shop =

315
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,830
Little Prince,

316
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,850
how many times have I told you

317
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,280
not to eat my salted fish?

318
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,000
Be good.

319
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,290
Excuse me.

320
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,450
Are you Zuo Baocang?

321
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:39,790
Yes.

322
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,250
I am the legendary

323
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,370
free-spirited and charming

324
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,190
shopkeeper Mr. Zuo.

325
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,570
So, Miss,

326
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,870
what can I offer you?

327
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,310
Salted fish, meat

328
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,120
or rice?

329
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,130
Everything you want.

330
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,040
I can give you a discount

331
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,600
since you are

332
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,180
a pretty girl.

333
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,750
I appreciate it.

334
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,900
Salted fish, meat and rice

335
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,480
aren’t what I need.

336
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,410
I want this.

337
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,820
Weapons.

338
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:15,980
I see.

339
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,120
But you came to the wrong place.

340
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,470
I don’t sell such things.

341
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,500
Wait.

342
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,900
Zhong Yu, Yan Shicheng’s aide.

343
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,030
Please.

344
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,710
Please.

345
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,470
Miss, please.

346
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,020
Miss.

347
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,470
A still tongue

348
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,780
makes a wise head.

349
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,190
Mr. Zuo.

350
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,130
Since you know this,

351
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,370
you should also know

352
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,920
I am not an ordinary person.

353
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,250
So,

354
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,930
let’s get straight to the point.

355
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,090
I know that.

356
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,090
The moment you walked in

357
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:34,860
I could tell

358
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,160
you are not of the common run.

359
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,440
You are certainly not a piece of work.

360
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,240
You may be five pieces of work,

361
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,540
or even six.

362
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:41,910
Sit.

363
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,960
What do you want and what’s your budget?

364
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,370
I want the best money can buy.

365
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,550
Miss, you…

366
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,280
You are so

367
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,710
generous.

368
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,580
But I am afraid that my small shop…

369
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,560
You’re doing big business.

370
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,450
I won’t

371
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,030
make it hard for you.

372
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,720
Swords, spears, halberds, bows and arrows,

373
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,850
I want fifty sets.

374
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,360
How many?

375
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,860
Fifty?

376
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,140
Miss,

377
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,610
what do you want to do

378
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:38,400
with so many weapons?

379
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,440
To build an army?

380
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,750
To rebel?

381
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,320
We certainly aren’t.

382
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,680
But someone

383
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,520
may accuse us of doing so.

384
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:12,010
We’ve got company.

385
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:24,120
It seems that my small shop

386
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,720
will have a blast today.

387
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,610
This is the best you’ve got?

388
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,410
Are you seeking death?

389
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,530
What message does your master have?

390
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,440
No wonder you are the head of Qingshan House.

391
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,430
My lady asked me to tell you

392
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,340
she had received your gift

393
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,210
and she would take away your maid’s life

394
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,320
in return.

395
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,230
More will come later.

396
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,290
Just wait for it.

397
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,620
Young Master.

398
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,000
Five taels.

399
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,560
Ten taels.

400
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,910
Twenty taels.

401
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,360
This is the most expensive one.

402
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,130
This costs fifty taels.

403
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,200
Taoye,

404
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,220
I don’t care who you’re trying to kill,

405
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,260
but why doing it in my shop,

406
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,530
and smashing my goods?

407
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,390
Shut up!

408
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,770
Goodness!

409
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,540
This is the antique I just bought this year.

410
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,410
I no longer want this shop.

411
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,270
500 taels,

412
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,760
then this place is yours.

413
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,670
You can smash or burn everything

414
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,890
as you want!

415
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,200
Fine. It’s a deal.

416
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,390
Get out now!

417
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,430
Deal.

418
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,300
Where is Xing’er?

419
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,390
Inside.

420
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,030
Alright. Gather all Yue Guards.

421
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,120
Aye.

422
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,040
You...

423
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,030
Who allowed you to come inside with me?

424
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,840
Fine. Just smash it,

425
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,080
smash them all.

426
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,570
You are going to pay

427
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:52,340
for all of them!

428
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,370
Five thousand! Fifty thousand taels!

429
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,810
All of you must pay me back!

430
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,000
Young Master Yue.

431
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,320
It’s not wise

432
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,460
to risk your own life

433
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,880
for a humble maid.

434
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,350
My lady, we made it.

435
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,140
They went in.

436
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,080
Really?

437
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:01,830
Actually, I only expected

438
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,070
the success rate to be 50%.

439
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,010
There are countless lovers

440
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,530
in this world.

441
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,360
But few of them

442
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,570
would sacrifice their own lives

443
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:11,410
for each other.

444
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,220
I didn’t expect

445
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,370
that Yuwen Yue would

446
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,360
risk his own life

447
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,050
for a maid.

448
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,210
He is the heir to the Eye of Intel,

449
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,800
and the grandson of the first branch
of the Yuwen Family,

450
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,590
but he is in love with a maid.

451
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,840
Even if he survives today,

452
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,670
he will come to no good end.

453
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,760
They could still be a couple in death.

454
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,250
We kind of helped them.

455
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:38,970
Let’s go.

456
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,470
The dragon-killing stone is down.

457
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,910
Yuwen Yue couldn’t fly away even if he had wings.

458
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,330
When people of his family come

459
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,760
and put out the fire

460
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,920
and dig their ways in,

461
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,710
he’s already frozen to death.

462
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,850
Let’s go.

463
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,720
Aye.

464
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,240
Don’t say that I haven’t

465
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,200
warned you two before.

466
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,250
That thing is the dragon-killing stone.

467
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,880
It weighs more than one thousand kilograms.

468
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,600
You can’t move it at all

469
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,080
no matter how good you are.

470
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,150
Just save your energy.

471
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,140
Are you with them?

472
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,110
No.

473
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,650
I’m not with them.

474
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,620
Isn’t it obvious?

475
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,840
Can’t you tell it?

476
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,310
Clearly, they just wanted to

477
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,410
take advantage of my place

478
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,830
and use you to lure him here,

479
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,810
to trap him to death.

480
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:01,530
To be honest,

481
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,490
the poorest man

482
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,570
in this whole thing should be me.

483
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,310
In the sunny afternoon,

484
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,740
I was just taking a nap in my shop.

485
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:17,620
Suddenly, a couple of women broke in,

486
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:21,040
and smashed my place.

487
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,910
I managed to get out there alive,

488
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,170
but now, I’m stuck here

489
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,400
with you two lovebirds

490
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,150
waiting for my death.

491
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,240
I don’t want to die!

492
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,480
Who are you calling lovebirds?

493
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,720
Open your eyes.

494
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,450
I am a maid

495
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:36,680
and he is my Young Master.

496
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,160
Sorry about that.

497
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,030
I… I made a mistake.

498
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:48,970
He is your Young Mother.

499
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,200
I mean Young Master, Young Master.

500
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,810
And you are his maid.

501
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,670
Your master is a great man.

502
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,260
He put his life on the line

503
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,930
to save a young maid.

504
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,340
He must be a saint.

505
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,530
I really admire you.

506
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:01,540
It’s good.

507
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,310
Is there another way out

508
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:04,930
in this cave?

509
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:05,730
No.

510
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,900
This is the place I leave with

511
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,260
all my treasures and fine weapons.

512
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,250
Hey,

513
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,810
will you build a back door

514
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:20,440
at the treasury

515
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,410
in your own house?

516
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,640
Why did you put the dragon-killing stone

517
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,030
in your treasury?

518
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,250
These are precious treasures.

519
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,720
Is it a problem

520
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,820
for some rich guy like me

521
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,840
to get some self-protection?

522
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,020
But right now, it didn’t protect you

523
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,190
but trap you here instead,

524
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:33,760
did it?

525
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,600
How could you

526
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,270
blame me?

527
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,680
Would I be trapped here

528
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,010
if it were not for you two?

529
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,400
All this would’ve

530
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,540
never happened!

531
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,130
You’re pointing the finger at me?

532
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,820
You said that you didn’t know

533
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,840
those two women at all.

534
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,870
Then how did they know

535
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,260
about the dragon-killing stone?

536
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,590
You know all men

537
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,660
have a thing for girls. You should…

538
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:10,620
You know...

539
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,040
That… That Taoye,

540
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,370
as you saw just now,

541
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,590
is above the average.

542
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,720
She used to

543
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,450
come to my shop

544
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,240
to buy stuff.

545
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,670
- So we kind of...
- Lothario!

546
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:22,860
You even told others

547
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,070
about the secrete

548
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,060
concerning your own life.

549
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,290
No wonder you end up here.

550
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,160
I’m happy to do that. It’s none of your business.

551
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,840
At least, I’m better than him.

552
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,910
He came here to seek his doom for you

553
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:30,750
without figuring out

554
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,600
what happened to you.

555
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,380
You...

556
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,530
Dodge!

557
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,970
Let’s go and search here again.

558
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,720
What happened?

559
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,830
Young Master is in trouble.

560
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,530
What?

561
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,580
Let’s go.

562
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:10,990
Come on.

563
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,540
Stay close and stop talking.

564
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,720
Where are you taking us to?

565
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,630
She is so verbose.

566
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,220
Who is verbose?

567
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,110
You.

568
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,540
I knew it.

569
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,620
Spies like you

570
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,000
are signs of trouble.

571
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,280
How did you know we are spies?

572
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,350
The sword you are holding is Broken Rainbow,

573
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:49,590
which means you are

574
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,080
the spy of the Eye of Intel.

575
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,980
And his sword is Waning Moon.

576
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,700
The swords you two use

577
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,160
are a couple.

578
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,130
Yet you told me

579
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:01,030
that you are not lovers.

580
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,800
I just didn’t want to expose you.

581
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,390
Now, do you think it’s fun to make me do it?

582
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,150
How awkward!

583
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,450
Also,

584
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,830
the girl who was here earlier

585
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,190
was using the Red Feather.

586
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,500
She must be Zhong Yu from Yanbei.

587
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,570
The girl who came later

588
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,510
was using the Sky Shadow Sleeves.

589
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,190
She was highly skilled.

590
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,970
If I’m not wrong,

591
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:25,040
she should be one of the best

592
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,470
among the spies of Liang.

593
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:31,230
You recognize people

594
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,250
by the weapons they use

595
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,270
but not by their faces?

596
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,250
How could you be so sure

597
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,580
you’re right?

598
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,930
There are two things

599
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:39,420
that can never fool my eyes

600
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,050
in this world.

601
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,940
One is the weapon,

602
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,320
and the other is woman.

603
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,220
What a braggart you are!

604
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,090
Watch out.

605
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,740
Don’t kill me!

606
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:32,960
Don’t kill me!

607
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,730
I had nothing to do with what happened in the past.

608
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,080
Don’t… Don’t kill me!

609
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,030
Don’t…

610
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,650
Yuwen Xi.

611
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,720
I just can’t bear to see

612
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,430
how cowardly and timid you are.

613
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,010
Princess of Liang.

614
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,950
You aren’t too old to be blind.

615
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:06,590
I didn’t expect that you’d be here.

616
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,190
Had you got everything done well,

617
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,650
would I’ve come here in person?

618
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,590
Yuwen Xi.

619
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,260
The map of the Intel Building

620
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,320
you gave us isn’t complete,

621
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,990
which almost ruined our plan.

622
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:20,720
It’s not my fault.

623
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,560
I have given you everything I got.

624
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,480
I’m just a useless old man,

625
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:28,010
and addicted to wine and women.

626
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:29,270
I… I swear

627
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:30,850
I have no more information.

628
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,320
Since you are aware

629
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,590
that you are useless,

630
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,070
just keep your hand off

631
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,790
Hongshan House.

632
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:39,980
Enjoy yourself

633
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,090
in your tender world,

634
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,390
and never

635
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,700
show up again.

636
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,950
So what you are saying is

637
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,030
I’m stripped of all duties?

638
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,270
Princess wants me to warn you,

639
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,140
Elderly Master Xi.

640
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:09,710
Don’t kill me! Don’t kill me!

641
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,430
Don’t… Don’t kill me!

642
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:19,070
If Yuwen Yue of Qingshan House

643
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:22,300
knows that the death of his mother...

644
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,560
From now on, I will keep my nose clean

645
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,270
and be a useless man.

646
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,150
- Move!
- You can’t go inside.

647
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:38,930
- Elderly Master Xi
- Back off!

648
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:39,830
is taking a rest inside.

649
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,750
Grandfather.

650
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:05,860
Grandfather.

651
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,670
Is everything alright?

652
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,830
Hongshan House

653
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:15,000
is no longer my business.

654
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,200
Come on, come here. Here we are.

655
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:46,160
Finally!

656
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:49,900
Come out. Come out.

657
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,820
Come out.

658
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,350
Make yourselves at home.

659
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,050
My dear babies,

660
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,620
do you miss me?

661
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,190
Feel free to do anything.

662
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,690
Feel at home.

663
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,140
Come here, Moneybag.

664
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,610
Moneybag.

665
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,160
What’s the matter with you?

666
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,250
Why didn’t you eat properly

667
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,620
while I was away?

668
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,260
Bad boy.

669
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,450
Come here, come here, eat up.

670
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,680
They really like it.

671
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,950
Look, how cute they are!

672
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:28,920
Alright, alright.

673
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,830
Finish your meal and leave.

674
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:35,140
Look at them.

675
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,110
Aren’t they cute?

676
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,470
Don’t you think

677
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,820
that they are super adorable?

678
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,990
I were just sitting well at home,

679
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:50,700
but the disaster befell me.

680
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:53,340
I almost lost my life.

681
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,680
What are you doing?

682
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,280
Taking a nap.

683
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,530
How could you sleep

684
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,010
at a time like this?

685
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:03,410
Get us out of here now!

686
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,950
Didn’t you pay attention to what I said?

687
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,750
How many times do I have to tell you

688
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,400
there is no way out?

689
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,440
What’s with the rush?

690
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:15,660
Use your brain, please.

691
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,860
Don’t you know who he is?

692
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,940
I’m sure help is on the way.

693
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,040
Just be at ease.

694
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,830
Somebody will come

695
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:23,830
to get us out soon.

696
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,120
All of us.

697
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:27,780
I have good news

698
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,280
for you.

699
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,720
This place is full of

700
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,470
rice, oil, salt and meat.

701
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,820
They can support three of us

702
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,110
to live for more than half a year.

703
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,390
It’s good news, isn’t it?

704
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,880
I’m going to sleep.

705
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,210
You guys can suit yourselves.

706
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:45,880
I always sleep like a log.

707
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,310
Waning Moon

708
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,550
belongs to the head of

709
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,420
the Eye of Intel,

710
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,950
which means

711
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,310
he must be the heir

712
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:04,860
to the Yuwen Family.

713
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,530
But he chose

714
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:09,710
to risk his life for a menial maid.

715
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,900
How pathetic!

716
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:16,090
I guess the Yuwen Family

717
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,030
is declining generation by generation.

718
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:19,780
Zip it!

719
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,220
Young Master.

720
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,260
What?

721
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,270
Aren’t we supposed to find a way out?

722
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,690
They went out of their way

723
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,880
to trap us in this place.

724
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,210
They must be plotting something.

725
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:53,230
He said there is no way out.

726
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,110
Do you believe him?

727
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,150
Do we have another choice?

728
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,220
Look at him. He is sleeping soundly

729
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,020
and doesn’t worry that

730
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,650
we will steal his treasure,

731
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,390
which means

732
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:13,400
we can’t find the way out on our own.

733
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,050
We can force him to talk.

734
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,670
Did you see

735
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,600
any food here?

736
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,380
This cave extends in all directions,

737
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:24,610
and it’s easy to get lost.

738
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,200
If we push him,

739
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,920
and he refuses to answer

740
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,350
or give us food,

741
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:32,300
we won’t last three days in here.

742
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,470
Then we just sit and wait?

743
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,270
