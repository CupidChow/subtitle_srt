= Episode 37 =

16
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,010
You want to see me when it’s so late.

17
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,170
What happened?

18
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,860
I just want to see you.

19
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,810
Achu.

20
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,040
About the wedding
between Her Highness and me...

21
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,780
I know.

22
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,370
His Majesty is ready to kill you.

23
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,080
You know?

24
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,870
I just never thought

25
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,120
he would use his own daughter

26
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,580
as the bait.

27
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,040
He cares for no one,

28
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,120
but himself.

29
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,070
Everyone else can be sacrificed.

30
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,840
Do you blame me?

31
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,380
How could I?

32
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,090
Under such circumstances,

33
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,830
we must take action accordingly.

34
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,390
I just have a little bit sympathy
for the Princess.

35
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,800
She’s born naughty,

36
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,650
her love for you is true.

37
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,080
How sad will she be

38
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,440
after the wedding?

39
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,760
It is not time

40
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,480
to care for her.

41
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,510
She may be heartbroken.

42
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,640
But you and I will also

43
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,750
lose our lives.

44
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,220
Man proposes, God deposes.

45
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,110
If this time,

46
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,650
we fail our proposal again,

47
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,540
what should we do?

48
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,900
I don’t believe in fate.

49
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,530
Achu.

50
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,070
I will take you back to Yanbei.

51
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,370
It’s a long way from here to Yanbei.

52
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,190
We need to pass across states and towns

53
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,650
where it’s hard to hide ourselves.

54
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,130
Since I was permitted

55
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:26,830
to walk freely

56
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,300
in Chang’an,

57
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,450
many soldiers have been stationed
outside of the city.

58
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,560
Once we escape

59
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,850
without permission,

60
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,200
we will be found

61
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,540
in less than fifteen minutes.

62
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,410
Most importantly,

63
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,020
we have no idea

64
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,220
how they’re guarding the city.

65
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,700
If we break out by force,

66
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,230
we’re likely to meet them.

67
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,090
So, what we should do first is

68
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,290
to get the deployment diagrams

69
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,810
of all the battalions

70
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,680
within thirty miles away.

71
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,160
The toughest problem for us

72
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,110
lies in the sudden marriage for me

73
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,450
which disturbs our original plan.

74
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,960
We need to make a detailed counter plan.

75
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,140
You mean we have no choice,

76
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,390
but to break out of the city.

77
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,720
But that is not a good way.

78
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,340
Don’t worry.

79
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,240
We’ll figure it out.

80
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,810
Achu.

81
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,260
There is something

82
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,910
I’ve never told you before.

83
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,390
Thank you.

84
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,660
Thank you for keeping me company
in the hell

85
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,800
for such a long time.

86
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,080
Without you,

87
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,750
I might have died

88
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,030
in the imperial prison

89
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,030
three years ago.

90
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,030
I will make it up

91
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,490
for what you have done

92
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,690
with my whole life.

93
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,160
When we are back to my hometown,

94
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,490
do not leave me, okay?

95
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,010
You don’t need

96
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,170
to say this to me.

97
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,260
Yan Xun.

98
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,180
Yanbei is my hometown.

99
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,310
Luo He.

100
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,290
I asked to see Chu Qiao.

101
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,890
She is grown-up,

102
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,880
beautiful,

103
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,360
and outstanding,

104
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,580
just like what you were.

105
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,210
But it seems like

106
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,040
she doesn’t remember anything of the past.

107
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,240
She’s forgotten who she is

108
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,860
or who I am.

109
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,430
Luo He.

110
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,920
I swear to you.

111
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,690
When she still doesn’t remember

112
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,930
who she is,

113
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,640
what happened to me

114
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,990
and do not hurt my child,

115
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,660
I will protect her

116
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,750
with my life.

117
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,300
Luo He, bless her

118
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,140
in the heaven.

119
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,060
Bless me as well.

120
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,270
Your Excellency.

121
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,820
His Majesty is farsighted and astute.

122
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,180
He wants to make use of the wedding

123
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,320
between you and the Princess.

124
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,600
We planned to escape in disguise

125
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,010
during the chaos.

126
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,570
Seems like we should drop the plan.

127
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,170
Now,

128
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,510
we have no choice,

129
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,580
but to break out of Chang’an by force.

130
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,150
But we may not be able

131
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,150
to control the gate of the city.

132
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,240
The stakes are too high.

133
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,170
Your Excellency, a message for you.

134
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,560
Wait.

135
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,310
This is not our carrier pigeon.

136
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,440
Your Excellency.

137
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:13,500
= Let’s meet at Zuixian Restaurant. =

138
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,860
Your Excellency, who sent the message?

139
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,720
An old friend of yours.

140
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,290
He invited us to Zuixian Restaurant

141
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,340
in the south of the city in four hours.

142
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,520
An old friend of mine?

143
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,160
He doesn’t leave a name.

144
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,110
It may be a trap.

145
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,270
If they want me dead,

146
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,350
they can just wait.

147
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,350
Why bother doing this?

148
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,920
Go. Let’s go and meet him.

149
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,340
Go.

150
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,650
Come in, please.

151
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,640
My Lady, there they are.

152
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,270
I’ll leave you alone.

153
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,790
Why you?

154
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,210
Zhong Yu.

155
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,320
We’re kind of old acquaintances.

156
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,100
You don’t need to take out your sword

157
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,770
every time you see me.

158
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,500
Who is she?

159
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,080
A spy of Liang.

160
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,990
When you were trapped in Jiuyou Platform,

161
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,810
they hid themselves in Chang’an City

162
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,670
and fought me many times.

163
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,030
I’m not sure how much they did

164
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,520
during that incident.

165
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,920
I’ve heard a lot about you,
Your Excellency.

166
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,940
A spy of Liang

167
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,030
has the nerve

168
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,170
to meet me here?

169
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,180
I don’t have the nerve
to meet someone else.

170
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,300
But you, Your Excellency.

171
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,610
Even if I tell you

172
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,370
I am going to assassin the Emperor,

173
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,690
I don’t think you’ll tell on me.

174
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,090
I don’t think so.

175
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,410
Maybe I can tell on you,

176
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,540
in exchange of his trust.

177
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,040
I am not that important

178
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,230
to make him

179
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,870
let you go.

180
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,020
Your Excellency, you are a clever man.

181
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,700
There’s no need

182
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,830
to beat about the bush.

183
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,770
What do you want

184
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:44,810
by inviting me here?

185
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,050
Cooperation.

186
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,970
You and me?

187
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,000
Yes.

188
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,640
The three-year period is due soon.

189
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,200
We both know

190
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,160
since His Majesty asks you
to marry his daughter,

191
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,340
it’s nearly impossible for you

192
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,100
to get out of Chang’an in disguise.

193
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,270
If you want to break out of Chang’an

194
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,300
and return to Yanbei,

195
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,750
the most important thing

196
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,080
will be breaking through the city gate.

197
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,230
Some of my men

198
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,670
have been commanding generals

199
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,910
who defend the East Gate.

200
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,900
I think

201
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,080
they can help you out.

202
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,010
Don’t believe her.

203
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,200
When you were on Jiuyou Platform

204
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,510
and afterwards in the imperial prison,

205
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,690
she stopped me from rescuing you.

206
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,370
Times have changed.

207
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,610
If Your Excellency had died then,

208
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,080
Yanbei would have been
anarchic and disunited.

209
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,300
Powerful families would have
scrambled for it.

210
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,060
When the Emperor of Wei
couldn’t control the condition,

211
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,050
his nation would fall apart.

212
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,660
The trouble in Wei

213
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,430
could be good news to my own nation.

214
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,290
Therefore, I certainly stopped you

215
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,090
from rescuing him.

216
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,750
Your Excellency.

217
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,770
Do you remember?

218
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,660
One of my men

219
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,340
attempted to kill you

220
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,960
in the imperial prison.

221
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,290
He failed, though.

222
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,380
But right now,

223
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,910
the situation is different.

224
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,420
The Emperor of Wei State
has intervened Yanbei

225
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,770
in your name for three years.

226
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,170
During that,

227
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,900
he has sent

228
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,260
many skeleton staffs to Yanbei.

229
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,800
So, all over the world,

230
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,010
nobody can easily

231
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,440
take Yanbei back

232
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,890
from him,

233
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,770
but you.

234
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,470
So, Your Excellency,

235
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,320
helping you

236
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,270
will be helping us.

237
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,470
It will be in the best interest of us.

238
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,260
So?

239
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,320
So, Your Excellency,

240
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,470
I am the only ally

241
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,360
you can trust

242
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,050
and the only person

243
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,600
you can rely on

244
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,520
in Chang’an.

245
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,150
Your Excellency,
the Emperor of Wei is shameless.

246
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,440
So many people in court

247
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,520
regard you

248
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,470
as thorn in their flesh.

249
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,450
So, hope you will

250
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,040
think about my advice carefully.

251
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,460
How do you want to cooperate?

252
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,630
You agreed?

253
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,100
You have sufficient reasons.

254
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,880
We have no permanent enemies,

255
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,190
but permanent interests.

256
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,260
It’s wise of you, Your Excellency.

257
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:26,890
Now,

258
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,060
I’m more confident

259
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,460
in our cooperation.

260
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,800
Your Highness.

261
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,720
How was it going?

262
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,770
Did Yan Xun say anything?

263
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,870
Why didn’t he

264
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,900
change even a single word?

265
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,440
Does he not want

266
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,720
to invite anyone?

267
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,420
His Excellency Yan Xun

268
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,750
didn’t read it at all.

269
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,070
He must have been too busy.

270
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,710
What could he be busy with?

271
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,890
Your Highness.

272
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:30,750
Are you sure

273
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,120
you want to marry him?

274
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,000
I don’t understand.

275
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,070
What advantages

276
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:37,900
does he have?

277
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,690
I feel that he has changed.

278
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,910
He looks at you,

279
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,050
but you don’t know

280
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,200
what he’s thinking of!

281
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,220
Besides, he cares so much

282
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,060
for that maid.

283
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,820
Your Highness,

284
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,630
you’re noble and beautiful.

285
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,300
You could have found a perfect husband.

286
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,450
Why must you marry him?

287
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,750
Caiwei.

288
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,300
You don’t understand.

289
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,630
When you like someone,

290
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,630
you want to see him every day.

291
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,680
When you see him,

292
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,530
you will be very happy.

293
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,160
Then you want to be with him.

294
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,420
That will make you

295
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,520
the happiest girl.

296
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:25,850
Furthermore,

297
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,140
no man loves a single woman

298
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,970
in his life.

299
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:29,990
Think about my father.

300
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,850
He has hundreds of concubines,

301
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,670
some of whom he barely knows.

302
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,890
If he really

303
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,520
likes her,

304
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,360
he can marry her

305
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,120
as his concubine.

306
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,420
Also,

307
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,940
I grew up

308
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,890
with Yan Xun

309
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:50,950
since we were little.

310
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,040
I believe

311
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,430
he has some feelings for me!

312
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,920
After we get married

313
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,310
and stay with each other
for the rest of life,

314
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,320
he will certainly accept me.

315
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,150
What?

316
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,660
When Yan Xun is getting married,

317
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,170
it makes you so heart-broken

318
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,750
that you can’t even aim at your target?

319
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,420
You want to leave

320
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,270
before your superior finishes?

321
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,780
Isn’t it too rude of you?

322
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,690
What exactly are you trying to say?

323
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,260
Yan Xun is getting married.

324
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,870
Are you happy?

325
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,900
What about you?

326
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,610
I’m very happy.

327
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,490
Idiot.

328
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,760
Well, it explains.

329
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,070
You’ve kept him company

330
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,540
for many years.

331
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,050
You must be feeling depressed.

332
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,540
I am not as bored as you!

333
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,420
What? Angry?

334
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,940
Yuwen Yue, you are smart.

335
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,420
I believe

336
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,860
you know what this wedding means.

337
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,610
When you stand here

338
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,260
and tease us,

339
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,820
what’s the difference

340
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,900
from what you did

341
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,210
on Jiuyou Platform?

342
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,300
Since you know it,

343
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,780
why don’t you escape?

344
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,160
Escape?

345
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,050
To where?

346
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,560
Can we make it?

347
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,890
I don’t believe that

348
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,260
you will await your doom.

349
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,080
Tell me. What are you going to do?

350
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,190
You should ask

351
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,310
your emperor

352
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,580
what he is going to do.

353
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,070
Don’t you know that?

354
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,960
The longer you stay,

355
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,080
the dangerous you will be.

356
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,060
Massive soldiers must be guarding
along your way.

357
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,560
If you want to survive,

358
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,370
you should steer clear of Yanbei

359
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,460
and stay out of the trouble.

360
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,340
I won’t stop you when you only escape.

361
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,980
But if you dare to disturb Chang’an,

362
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,760
you will be doomed.

363
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,680
Yuwen Yue.

364
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,080
Stay out of this,

365
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,690
or help us.

366
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,060
Just cut the crap!

367
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,020
Considering your family

368
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,540
and your position,

369
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,020
I’m afraid you won’t help us.

370
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,850
I don’t want to be your enemy.

371
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,080
You are, already.

372
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,570
If you act recklessly,

373
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,070
I won’t turn a blind eye.

374
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,990
As we are already enemies,

375
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,090
we don’t need to talk much.

376
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,230
If you’re in the way

377
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,610
of Yan Xun and me,

378
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,400
I don’t know what I will do.

379
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,390
Alright. Take them in.

380
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,410
- Aye.
- Aye.

381
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,250
Leave us.

382
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,220
Her Grace has arrived!

383
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,790
Mother.

384
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,850
Leave us.

385
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,250
- Aye.
- Aye.

386
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,440
Mother, what brings you here?

387
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,850
My daughter is getting married

388
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,360
and I am the last one to know.

389
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:22,250
What? Can’t I come here to see you?

390
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,980
I don’t mean that.

391
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,510
How dare you!

392
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,500
How dare you

393
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,340
make this kind of decision

394
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,480
without telling me!

395
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,270
Do you still

396
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,230
respect me?

397
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,270
I just don’t want

398
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,680
to marry the Crown Prince of Liang.

399
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,640
If you don’t,

400
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,940
you could have told me!

401
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,930
But you asked your father

402
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,680
to marry you to Yan Xun?

403
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,290
How can I have

404
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,130
such a silly daughter like you?

405
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,100
What’s wrong with marrying Yan Xun?

406
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,810
I just want to marry him!

407
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,530
Slap me!

408
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,130
Slap me to death!

409
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,660
When I am dead,

410
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,750
I don’t need to marry anyone.

411
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,700
Mother.

412
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:17,980
Please allow me

413
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,090
to marry Yan Xun.

414
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,400
I’ve always liked him since I was little.

415
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,640
You know that.

416
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,760
What a silly girl!

417
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,520
There is family feud

418
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,120
between you.

419
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,220
Don’t you remember what happened

420
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,340
on Jiuyou Platform three years ago?

421
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,300
I do.

422
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,720
I would always remember that.

423
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:47,990
That’s why

424
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,560
I feel guilty.

425
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,030
I could do nothing at that time.

426
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,980
I did nothing to help him.

427
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,470
But I’ve grown up.

428
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,280
I can protect him now.

429
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,190
If he becomes my husband,

430
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,320
no one

431
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,370
can hurt him,

432
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,500
including Father.

433
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,760
He will be safe.

434
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,980
How can you be this naive?

435
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,260
Mother,

436
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:14,760
I love no one else,

437
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,120
but Yan Xun.

438
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,010
All my life,

439
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,230
I can never

440
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,710
love anyone else

441
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,830
as much as I love him.

442
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,430
Have you ever considered

443
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,570
how Yan Xun feels?

444
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,020
Doesn’t he hate you?

445
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,900
Doesn’t he hate your father?

446
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,320
Doesn’t he hate our nation?

447
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,610
What will your life be like

448
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,300
after you marry him?

449
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,390
Your father killed his father.

450
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,860
How can he love you?

451
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,110
I don’t want to think too much.

452
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,430
Even if he dislikes me,

453
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,620
even if he hates me,

454
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,630
I will do whatever I can

455
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,420
to protect him!

456
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,770
I will even

457
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,830
die for him.

458
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:07,530
Mother,

459
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,010
this is my last request.

460
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,450
Please let me marry him.

461
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,770
Let it be.

462
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,160
It’s doomed love.

463
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,000
I wish

464
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,970
you wouldn’t regret on your decision

465
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,110
in the future.

466
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,400
I will never regret.

467
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,980
Greetings, Your Grace.

468
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,550
General Huai.

469
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,740
Haven’t I replied you?

470
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,670
I am too busy these days

471
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,050
to see you.

472
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,510
That’s why

473
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,200
I’ve been waiting here.

474
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,490
What do you want? Tell me.

475
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,930
It’s a long story.

476
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,430
I can’t explain clearly

477
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,340
before we go back to your palace.

478
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,670
How dare you!

479
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,750
General Huai,

480
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,630
you are my elder brother.

481
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,910
But you shouldn’t visit the palace

482
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,140
too frequently.

483
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,420
When I have some spare time another day,

484
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,040
I will ask you to come.

485
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,440
Let’s go.

486
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:33,890
You’re the best girl

487
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:34,930
to serve him.

488
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,670
You want me to serve someone important,

489
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,830
I guess.

490
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,170
He’s the Emperor.

491
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,250
Scared?

492
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,450
I am an abject girl.

493
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,430
Thank you for rescuing and cultivating me.

494
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,010
The palaces

495
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,840
can be a precious chance

496
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,210
for a young girl.

497
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,170
I won’t let you down.

498
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,760
Come on. Stand up.

499
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,180
Go get prepared.

500
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,190
After I send you there,

501
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,170
you can only rely on yourself.

502
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,910
Thank you, Young Master.

503
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,830
Bitch!

504
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,650
After I gave you to His Majesty,

505
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,190
you don’t even remember who you were.

506
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,740
Qiaoqiao.

507
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,230
Look. Here are flowers for you.

508
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,350
Do you like them?

509
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,170
I just picked them.

510
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,030
Do you like them?

511
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,190
Smell them. Still smell fragrant.

512
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,450
Qiaoqiao.

513
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,970
Are you mad at me?

514
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,340
Your Highness,

515
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,330
we’re at a local battalion.

516
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,010
I’m too busy to chat with you.

517
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,310
But I’m not busy.

518
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,720
I can chat with you.

519
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,490
Don’t... Don’t just turn me down.

520
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,680
Xiao Ce.

521
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,820
You are indeed

522
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,810
an annoying man.

523
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,000
I am?

524
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,460
No one

525
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,760
has said that before.

526
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,860
By the way, Qiaoqiao,

527
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,360
I bring you another gift.

528
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,960
As a girl, you are always

529
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,080
exposed to the weather

530
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:19,990
in the battalion.

531
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,820
You certainly never

532
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,630
do any skincare.

533
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,260
You know what?

534
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,380
- I’ve brought you...
- Stop that!

535
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:24,680
You know what?

536
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,850
I will simply tell you what I think

537
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,350
once and for all!

538
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,660
I really hate you!

539
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,150
I hate it

540
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:31,670
when you always stay around,

541
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,240
dressed in colorful clothes

542
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,380
like a woman!

543
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,910
I hate it when you always play dumb

544
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,710
and have fun fooling others!

545
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,670
I hate your foxy eyes!

546
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,240
I hate your honey tongue,

547
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:41,800
your importunate requests

548
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,090
and your desire to stir up trouble!

549
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,380
Talented.

550
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,110
Really good comment.

551
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,070
Anything else?

552
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,250
Yes.

553
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,240
We’d better get along peacefully.

554
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,930
If you mess up with me again,

555
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,860
I’ll still kick your ass.

556
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,350
What do I do?

557
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:04,990
The ruder you are,

558
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,180
the more I like you.

559
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,270
Your Highness!

560
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,910
If you do like me,

561
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,510
you’d better stay away from me!

562
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,810
Or I’ll punch you.

563
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,850
Qiaoqiao, I haven’t finished.

564
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,880
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

565
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,470
Your Highness, are you alright?

566
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,500
Qiaoqiao.

567
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,490
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

568
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:29,440
Are you alright?

569
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:29,980
Come here.

570
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,980
Get him up.

571
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,740
Stand up. Stand up. Stand up.

572
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,220
- Your Highness.
- Qiaoqiao.

573
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,640
Are you alright? Did you get hurt?

574
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,600
Come on and fan him.

575
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,230
Are you alright?

576
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,140
What happened?

577
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,760
General Yuwen,

578
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,680
His Highness has lived a wealthy life

579
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,820
and he’s very weak.

580
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,520
We didn’t know

581
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,810
your subordinate dares
to offend him like that!

582
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:50,550
This is a military confinement.

583
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,030
Your Highness,

584
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,440
don’t come unless you’re invited.

585
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,250
What... What are you talking about?

586
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,640
Wouldn’t you

587
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,310
punish her

588
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,620
to satisfy us?

589
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,150
Don’t be rude.

590
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,150
I fell personally.

591
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,730
His subordinate shouldn’t be blamed.

592
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,890
Qiaoqiao, look.

593
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,130
I had a terrible fall.

594
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:14,980
Wouldn’t you agree

595
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,140
to go for a walk with me?

596
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,660
Why do you always ask me

597
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,630
to accompany you?

598
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,950
Because I like you.

599
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:24,730
Your Highness.

600
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,760
If you want to take a walk,

601
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,850
I can go with you.

602
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,610
I want no one, but her.

603
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,440
Qiaoqiao.

604
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,120
So many soldiers are stationed
outside of the city.

605
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,950
They are all manly men
who give off an unbearable smell.

606
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,090
Without you,

607
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,650
the air wouldn’t be fresh.

608
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,500
Without you,

609
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,450
the scenery wouldn’t be beautiful.

610
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,390
Yan Xun is worried
about the military deployment diagram

611
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,950
outside the city.

612
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,180
Maybe, I could take this chance

613
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,110
to check out the military garrison
outside of the city.

614
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,810
Fine.

615
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,960
For the sake of your invitation,

616
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,230
I will take a walk with you.

617
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,960
Really? Let’s go!

618
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,320
Your Highness.

619
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,730
Do you have interest in hunting?

620
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:14,750
Not far ahead

621
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,290
was the imperial hunting field.

622
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,030
How could I do anything

623
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,260
so cruel?

624
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,220
I’m different

625
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:20,940
from local people.

626
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,360
Local people

627
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,810
don’t respect life at all.

628
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,390
What do you mean?

629
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,890
I have heard

630
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,120
there is a hunting way in this place,

631
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,520
called Human Hunting

632
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,490
where you hunt real people.

633
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,470
It’s indeed too dehumanizing!

634
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,740
Then you could just hunt animals.

635
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,550
Animals have life as well.

636
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,010
My father respects the Buddhism

637
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:44,110
and he thinks all beings are equal.

638
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,220
It’s so kind of you, then.

639
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,340
Of course, I am.

640
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,720
Some people enjoy destroying life.

641
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,130
But I enjoy creating life.

642
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,420
Creating?

643
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,470
If I could

644
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,080
create life

645
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,600
with the woman I love,

646
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,910
it would be a beautiful thing.

647
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,820
Qiaoqiao, would you like to try?

648
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,630
With our perfect bloodline,

649
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:09,420
we will create...

650
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,440
Enough! Shut up!

651
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:14,830
Qiaoqiao, wait for me!

652
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,470
Have you prepared the deployment diagram

653
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,400
for Yan Xun?

654
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,880
I got it ready long ago.

655
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:27,180
If Yan Xun manages to break out,

656
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,530
he should be grateful to you.

657
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,680
It’s not necessary.

658
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,560
Without my interference,

659
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,340
he wouldn’t have stayed here
for three years.

660
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,930
We place no private interest
above our nation.

661
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,670
I just hope

662
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,750
he won’t disappoint my expectation.

663
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,270
Hope he won’t be killed too early

664
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:54,150
by the Wei government.

665
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,600
I hear our Crown Prince

666
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,210
has already been out of the city.

667
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,550
Yes.

668
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,220
Did you send our men?

669
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,890
Sure.

670
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,440
I really hope

671
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,380
I don’t need

672
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,650
to see his face anymore.

673
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,910
Your Highness.

674
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,690
I once saw you riding a horse

675
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,780
very skillfully.

676
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,400
Why are you riding it so poorly today?

677
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,880
I only ride my own horse

678
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,050
very skillfully.

679
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:46,860
Because I’ve raised it

680
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,210
since it was born

681
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,580
and it listens to me.

682
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,660
But look at this one.

683
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,330
Seems like

684
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,590
it always wants to throw me out.

685
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,500
Then why aren’t your

686
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,760
riding your own horse?

687
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,600
Because I want to match you.

688
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,420
Look.

689
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:01,160
Today, you ride a pure black horse

690
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,080
with a little white on its nose tip.

691
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,200
Then I need a pure white horse

692
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,850
with a little black on its nose tip.

693
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,890
Sounds funny.

694
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,290
I used to think

695
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,510
you were not a normal guy.

696
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,730
Turns out I am right.

697
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,630
You’re not a normal guy without doubt.

698
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,570
Well, I’m not.

699
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,200
But, I always behave

700
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,410
very honestly.

701
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,660
Under any circumstance,

702
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,360
I lead

703
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,050
a licentious life

704
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:29,070
and I’m a debonair man.

705
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,400
Poisonous arrows.

706
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,510
Are you behind this?

707
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,870
Why did I ask someone to kill me?

708
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,380
Qiaoqiao.

709
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:55,000
You don’t need an excuse to hug me.

710
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,710
Shut up.

711
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:08,950
Get up!

712
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,600
Run!

713
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:50,680
Qiaoqiao.

714
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,230
Killers are ahead, too. What do we do?

715
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,150
Go!

716
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:11,950
What do we do?

717
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,250
Be careful!

718
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:29,950
Qiaoqiao.

719
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:31,200
I’m fine.

720
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:32,430
Let’s go.

721
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:19,480
They’re up there.

722
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,030
Shoot! Let’s flank them.

723
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,320
Jump.

724
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:27,560
No way.

725
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,940
We’ll be drowned.

726
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:44,960
Your Excellency.

727
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,110
We have adjusted the plan accordingly.

728
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:48,940
However, when we’re short of hands,

729
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,830
we’re unlikely to win

730
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,940
however hard we try
to break out of the city gate.

731
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:57,150
Xiao Yu has evil intents.

732
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,370
We can hardly trust her.

733
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,540
We have no choice,

734
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,560
but to use Xiuli Army.

735
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,030
I know what you mean.

736
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,110
But stop trying to use Achu

737
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,790
to control Xiuli Army.

738
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,050
Your Excellency!

739
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,830
Your Excellency, Miss Chu is in trouble.

740
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,030
In the south of Xiaoguan Pass.

741
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,300
Why is she there?

742
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:21,570
Today, Miss Chu has gone there

743
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,900
to figure out the new military garrison

744
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,810
by protecting the Crown Prince of Liang.

745
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,580
Is this true?

746
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,560
It is.

747
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,450
Sidie saw them

748
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:32,620
fall into an ambush of many killers.

749
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,580
Your Excellency, you can’t go!

750
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,060
If you go out of city without permission,

751
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,300
it means disobeying the order
of His Majesty,

752
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,260
and you will be...

753
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,970
Achu’s life matters more

754
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:41,990
than anything else.

755
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,010
You must remember two things.

756
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:46,580
Firstly, bring her back safely.

757
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,270
Secondly,

758
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,050
don’t let anyone know who you are.

759
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:50,950
Once you’re captured,

760
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,180
Ajing,

761
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,700
you know what you should do.

762
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,840
Yes, I do!

763
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,280
Go ahead.

764
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,540
Your Excellency.

765
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,580
The Crown Prince of Liang is under attack.

766
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,870
Do you know who is behind this?

767
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,500
No.

768
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,170
But if the Crown Prince dies,

769
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,590
Chang’an will fall into chaos.

770
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,240
It will do us a world of good.

771
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,070
Since we have the same goal,

772
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,990
why don’t we help them?

773
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:24,560
Besides, if Achu is still staying

774
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,430
with Xiao Ce,

775
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,340
I’m afraid she has already killed him.

776
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,020
Even God is helping me.

777
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,420
How stupid you are!

778
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,910
Don’t you know

779
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,610
it will help you a lot if I am dead?

780
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,680
How could this be so powerful?

781
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:41,600
Young Master.

782
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,920
The guards of the gate
found His Excellency Yan Xun

783
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,960
go out of the city in disguise!

784
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:45,680
How many guards are with him?

785
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:46,980
A couple of guards.

786
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,240
According to your order,

787
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,350
we didn’t stop him.

788
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:50,850
Where did they go?

789
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,210
They were riding fast

790
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,580
towards the south of Xiaoguan Pass.

791
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,740
Xiaoguan Pass?

792
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,580
Yes.

793
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,660
The Crown Prince of Liang
went out of the city this afternoon

794
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,220
together with Ms. Chu.

795
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,560
They have also gone there.

796
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,220
Yueqi, assemble all Yue Guards.

797
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,640
Remember not to disturb

798
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,690
other officers of Cavalry Battalion.

799
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:08,890
Ask my men to go with me

800
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,160
to the south of Xiaoguan Pass.

801
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,180
We must get Yan Xun back.

802
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,130
Qiaoqiao.

803
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,660
You’re awake, Qiaoqiao?

804
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,400
The stinky smell

805
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,390
has finally gone.

806
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,570
After being soaked in water

807
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:45,390
for a while,

808
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:47,000
the robe looked old and ugly.

809
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,250
Just use it for the time being.

810
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,930
Don’t move. Don’t move.

811
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:51,760
You are injured.

812
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,660
Don’t move.

813
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,410
It hurts a lot, doesn’t it?

814
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,010
Qiaoqiao. What do you think

815
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,620
we should do now?

816
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,730
Nothing.

817
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:04,770
Sit down.

818
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,370
Take a rest.

819
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,110
Qiaoqiao. Who...

820
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,580
Who do you think

821
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,030
are the killers

822
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,260
chasing us?

823
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,170
I have no idea.

824
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,950
In my opinion,

825
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,300
thinking of my own nation,

826
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,080
if I die,

827
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,940
the position of the Crown Prince

828
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,020
will be unoccupied.

829
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:28,950
Then my older brother

830
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,070
will have the chance to take the throne.

831
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:33,790
In Chang’an however,

832
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,650
your master Yan Xun

833
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,130
wants to kill me most.

834
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,080
If I die,

835
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,660
Chang’an will fall into chaos.

836
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,580
Then,

837
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,980
my father will fight your nation.

838
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,660
The Emperor of Wei State will be too busy

839
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,760
to deal with Yan Xun.

840
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,570
By then,

841
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,730
Yan Xun will remain invincible.

842
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,350
However,

843
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,170
you tried to save me,

844
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:57,830
regardless of danger.

845
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,960
I don’t think Yan Xun is behind this.

846
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:00,940
Right?

847
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,820
Shut up.

848
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,310
You’d better shut up.

849
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,660
Don’t you fear I would kill you

850
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,580
when you talked rubbish

851
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:11,810
in case you would be my burden?

852
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:12,680
Qiaoqiao.

853
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,910
I love it most

854
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,220
when you are smart and kind.

855
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,180
What a good girl you are!

856
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,810
Are you thirsty?

857
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,910
Shall I go

858
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:20,990
find you something to drink?

859
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:22,690
By the way, are you hungry too?

860
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,560
Shall I go

861
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,430
find you something to eat?

862
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,010
Qiaoqiao, what’s wrong with you?

863
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,670
Your wounds are bleeding again.

864
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,620
What should we do?

865
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:48,980
What should we do?

866
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:55,540
Kill him.

867
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,180
Go!

868
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,760
Me? Me?

869
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,670
But I...

870
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:03,310
Go!

871
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,780
Fine. I’ll kill him.

872
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:10,790
Don’t come over.

873
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,830
Don’t you hear me?

874
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,870
Qiaoqiao, this place is too dangerous.

875
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:38,920
Let’s go and hide ourselves.

876
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,340
Come on, let me get you up.

877
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:41,790
Come on.

878
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,230
Slowly.

879
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,490
Slowly.

880
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,550
Yan Xun disobeyed the imperial decree

881
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:10,900
and went straight to Xiaoguan Pass.

882
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,030
I’m afraid Xing’er would be in danger.

883
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:15,620
Young Master, going down from here

884
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,130
could save half an hour.

885
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:18,930
But it’s dangerous

886
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,310
to go past such cliffs.

887
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,590
We can’t waste even one minute.

888
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:28,680
Slow down.

889
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,220
Sit here, Qiaoqiao.

890
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:31,000
Come on.

891
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,710
Be careful.

892
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:36,570
What’s happening?

893
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:37,920
Your wounds hurt again, right?

894
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,760
There are some herbs over there.

895
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,990
Pick some for me.

896
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,490
This one? Okay.

897
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:02,840
Qiaoqiao.

898
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,130
You couldn’t afford

899
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,030
one more fight.

900
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,840
What should we do?

901
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:10,020
I think...

902
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:10,880
I think we could join hands

903
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,190
and kill them.

904
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,040
What do you think?

905
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:16,430
First,

906
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,820
I could kill them, not we.

907
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,270
Second,

908
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:23,820
there are a dozen enemies

909
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,460
while I am alone.

910
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:29,840
How many enemies do you think

911
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,960
I can kill now?

912
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,440
Let me remind you.

913
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,900
When there is no way to escape,

914
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,710
I would like to turn you in

915
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:45,040
in exchange for a way out.

916
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:55,670
How...

917
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,980
How about this, Qiaoqiao?

918
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,680
I will distract the enemies,

919
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:04,450
and then you can run away in full flight.

920
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,280
Okay?

921
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,430
By the way,

922
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:09,970
take this.

923
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,320
I have no martial arts.

924
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,280
My father gave me this secret weapon

925
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,260
to protect myself.

926
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:14,440
Once you rotate it,

927
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,780
50 needles will fly out.

928
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,190
Each of them is poisonous.

929
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:18,290
Whoever touches it will die.

930
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:19,440
Keep it well,

931
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:21,150
and it will save your life
at the crucial moment.

932
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:28,850
Do you suddenly realize

933
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:30,290
you have fallen in love with me?

934
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,520
It’s fine. Don’t worry.

935
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:34,910
When we come back to Chang’an,

936
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:36,220
there will be so many chances for you.

937
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,140
There they come.

938
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,290
I’ll distract them.

939
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:45,370
Be careful.

940
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:46,210
I’ll be fine.

941
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:52,980
