= Episode 21 =

16
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,070
Young Master, we’re back ahead of schedule.

17
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,590
Aren’t you afraid His Majesty would be mad?

18
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,690
With this case, what’s there to be afraid?

19
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,300
Hand in

20
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:54,690
this valuable case

21
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,760
to His Majesty immediately.

22
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,140
Once Yan Xun is captured,

23
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,200
I’ll go to the palace.

24
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,670
Go!

25
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,690
Yes, Young Master.

26
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,120
Bad news! Bad news!

27
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,490
What’s with the scream?

28
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,420
Young Master, something terrible happened.

29
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,230
Elderly Master Xi

30
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,240
was assassinated.

31
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:16,630
By whom?

32
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,410
The maids said

33
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,500
it was that menial, Xing’er.

34
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,360
How dare she!

35
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,500
All traps

36
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,030
in the Pleasure Pavilion

37
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,150
are marked.

38
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,120
Find a place to hide.

39
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,420
Don’t run around.

40
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,820
Or, you might trigger the traps

41
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,040
and get yourself killed.

42
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,570
Where is his head?

43
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,670
It… It… It…

44
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,970
It was cut off.

45
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,610
Useless!

46
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,010
He got killed by a maid.

47
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,260
It is good, though.

48
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,270
Once I take over Hongshan House,

49
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,420
no one will lecture me.

50
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,460
You are absolutely right.

51
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,790
Where are those damn guards?

52
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,400
They were all

53
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,840
killed by Xing’er.

54
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,160
Let’s go

55
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,170
capture that tramp.

56
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,070
Aye.

57
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,060
It is time to change shifts.

58
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,510
Young Master.

59
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,090
Where is Mr. Zuo?

60
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,400
Young Master, there you are.

61
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,090
I fell into those spies’ trap

62
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,040
and managed to get out just now.

63
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,490
Why are you in panic?

64
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,290
What’s wrong?

65
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,430
Elderly Master Yuwen Xi was assassinated.

66
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,900
Who did that?

67
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,780
I am not sure yet.

68
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,470
All I know is

69
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,430
it was a maid

70
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,600
who was sent into the Pavilion tonight.

71
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,740
And

72
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:41,960
Xing’er, Xiaoqi and Xiaoba

73
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,710
are gone.

74
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,650
Xing’er!

75
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,330
I’m an honest businessman.

76
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,250
I always keep my word.

77
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,860
I won’t let you down.

78
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,390
I know you’re the best.

79
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,890
Hurry up!

80
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:44,880
What are you doing?

81
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,810
Can’t you tell?

82
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,720
I killed Yuwen Xi.

83
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,870
And now, I’m leaving.

84
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,920
Don’t give me

85
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,940
that surprised look.

86
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,750
Yuwen Xi killed my sister.

87
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,720
So I had him

88
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,870
pay with his dirty blood.

89
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,440
It is lenient enough.

90
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,440
So this is the real you.

91
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,130
I was struggling in a dog-eat-dog world,

92
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,040
surrounded by beasts.

93
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,020
Hadn’t I disguised myself,

94
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,530
how could I

95
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,520
have possibly lived to this day?

96
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,550
Well done.

97
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,240
You even fooled me.

98
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,370
I learned from the best.

99
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,130
Well,

100
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,790
don’t be sad about losing me.

101
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,640
After all, you only trained me

102
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,980
to be a perdue.

103
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,310
No one else is here.

104
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,920
Just drop your act.

105
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,640
You and Hongshan House are at each other’s throats.

106
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,930
You should be glad

107
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,710
that I got rid of Yuwen Xi for you.

108
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,280
Are you saying

109
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,110
I should thank you?

110
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,140
You’re welcome.

111
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,380
Because you are going to

112
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,730
pay for Linxi’s death.

113
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,590
What exactly do you want?

114
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,120
Avenge Linxi’s murder.

115
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,090
I have explained

116
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,320
about his death.

117
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,590
Have you?

118
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:24,900
What’s your explanation?

119
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,400
That he was only a pawn,

120
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,800
or the fact that

121
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,110
Yuwen Zhuo is still alive?

122
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,160
How did you know that?

123
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,040
Does it matter?

124
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,510
By the time I found out,

125
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,780
it was already too late!

126
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,270
To mislead the world into believing

127
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,780
Yuwen Zhuo is dead,

128
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,870
you sacrificed Linxi’s life!

129
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,740
Xing’er, listen to me.

130
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,760
Don’t call me that!

131
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,860
I am not!

132
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,790
I am not Xing’er!

133
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,070
Xing’er!

134
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,950
Let go of me!

135
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,240
Let go!

136
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:30,730
Yuwen Yue,

137
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:31,680
I’ll forever

138
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,660
cut ties

139
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,000
with Qingshan House!

140
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,060
Xing’er!

141
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,710
= Qingshan House =
Xing’er!

142
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,580
Let me down.

143
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,480
You’re so not cute.

144
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,550
I saved you one more time.

145
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,410
How are you going to repay me?

146
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,320
You are just a little girl,

147
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,850
but the trouble you’ve caused isn’t little at all.

148
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:54,780
The Yuwen family

149
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,010
was digging their own grave

150
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,680
by hiring you as their maid.

151
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,300
I’ve finally killed that bastard,

152
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,380
Yuwen Xi.

153
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,600
I should thank you, though.

154
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,810
Thank you for saving my life.

155
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,060
But

156
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,550
I don’t want you to be implicated.

157
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,470
You should leave.

158
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,950
What are you saying?

159
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,900
Go to Yanbei with me.

160
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:16,800
Then nobody

161
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,990
can do anything to you.

162
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,630
Let’s go.

163
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,130
Your Excellency Yan Xun,

164
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,760
I agree to leave with you

165
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,240
but don’t get me wrong.

166
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:30,560
Fine.

167
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,680
I see.

168
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,650
I thought too much, alright?

169
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,400
Happy?

170
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,780
Aren’t someone’s two sisters

171
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,860
still waiting

172
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,080
at the west gate?

173
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,120
You saw them?

174
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,700
No, I didn’t.

175
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,580
I came for you right after knowing

176
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,790
you were in danger.

177
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,150
They must

178
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:51,840
still be at the west gate.

179
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,330
Let’s go.

180
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,630
What are you waiting for?

181
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,360
Chop-chop.

182
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:13,850
Young Master.

183
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,020
Where is Xing’er?

184
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,850
Yan Xun took her away.

185
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,950
His Excellency Yan Xun?

186
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:19,180
What’s wrong?

187
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,580
His Majesty has just ordered

188
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,180
guards of all noble families

189
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,290
to besiege his mansion

190
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,860
and capture him.

191
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,410
Gather Yue Guards now.

192
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:26,970
Aye.

193
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,280
By the way,

194
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,640
Master needs you immediately.

195
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,560
His Majesty is determined

196
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,040
to wipe out the Yan clan.

197
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,580
Do not interfere.

198
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,350
Xun is Yue’s best friend.

199
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,740
I’m afraid he’d jump into it

200
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,470
out of brotherhood.

201
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,830
You must stop him.

202
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:05,680
Young Master.

203
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,340
Grandfather.

204
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,850
Have you captured Xing’er?

205
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,460
Not yet.

206
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,340
Is it because you can’t

207
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,320
or you just

208
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,060
don’t want to?

209
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,030
I’ve tried my best

210
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,920
but failed.

211
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,630
Really?

212
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,260
Yes.

213
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,320
Xing’er killed Yuwen Xi

214
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,870
and pinned everything on you.

215
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,850
Do you know that?

216
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,170
Yes.

217
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,750
Find her and bring her back!

218
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,950
Murdering a court official isn’t a minor offence.

219
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,390
If she runs away,

220
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,350
you can’t defend yourself.

221
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,070
You must seize her!

222
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,620
When I got there,

223
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,510
it was already too late.

224
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,410
You…

225
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,530
Yue,

226
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,440
you’ve changed.

227
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,130
Are you going to risk Qingshan House

228
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,650
and me

229
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,210
for a girl?

230
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,950
Fine.

231
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,140
Let’s put her aside.

232
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,930
But now,

233
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,520
I’m asking you

234
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,820
to put your principles

235
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,710
and emotions behind

236
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,270
and do not involve in Yan Xun’s affair

237
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,810
for the sake of Qingshan House,

238
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,650
the Eye of Intel

239
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,080
and yourself.

240
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,320
Grandfather…

241
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,920
Yue,

242
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,900
you are not only Yan Xun’s friend,

243
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,360
but also my grandson,

244
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,760
and the head of Qingshan House.

245
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,880
The eradication of Marquis Dingbei
and his family can’t be helped.

246
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,700
His Majesty has made up his mind.

247
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,450
Whatever you do

248
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,800
is of no use

249
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,960
but only costs you

250
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,440
your own life.

251
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,390
Zhan Mou.

252
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:12,650
Yes.

253
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,270
Kneel for me.

254
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,240
Beg your young master

255
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,260
to take your lives into consideration.

256
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:24,390
Young Master,

257
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,690
I’m kneeling on behalf of Master.

258
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,750
Young Master,

259
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,220
please think twice.

260
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,420
I know you resent my decision.

261
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,200
I wouldn’t dare.

262
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,030
You would if you could.

263
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,440
But Yue,

264
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,530
you must always

265
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,550
keep this in your mind

266
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,600
that you cannot risk our entire clan

267
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,730
for your

268
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,120
so-called friendship.

269
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,510
You have no right to do that.

270
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,340
And they shouldn’t endure

271
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,490
such sacrifice.

272
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,680
Grandfather!

273
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,610
Yue.

274
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,210
Fine.

275
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,850
I’m on it.

276
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,270
Master.

277
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,230
Xiaoba,

278
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,910
I’ll go check if Xiaoliu has come.

279
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,840
It’s ten already.

280
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,220
Why isn’t she here?

281
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:21,630
Xiaoba,

282
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,390
what if something happened?

283
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,960
Something like what?

284
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,050
I bet she can’t wait

285
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,200
to get rid of us.

286
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,730
She’s not even close

287
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:31,580
to be here.

288
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,230
She’s abandoned us.

289
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,370
Xiaoba,

290
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,900
she cares so much about us.

291
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,350
How could you say that?

292
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,530
Don’t lecture me.

293
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,140
Don’t you also have the same concerns?

294
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,500
Now, she’s with

295
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,820
His Excellency Yan Xun.

296
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,240
Once she arrives at Yanbei,

297
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,870
she’ll be showered with wealth.

298
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,620
She won’t care about us anymore.

299
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,430
Who are we to her anyway?

300
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,020
Lower your voice.

301
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,780
She’s not that kind of person.

302
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,490
If she heard that

303
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,910
and thought we don’t believe her,

304
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:58,770
she would be heartbroken.

305
00:19:58,770 --> 00:19:59,930
Heartbroken?

306
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,200
Right now, her heart is filled with joy

307
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,190
because of His Excellency Yan.

308
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,190
Xiaoba!

309
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,040
I’ve told you already.

310
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,950
I don’t want to

311
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,230
leave Qingshan House.

312
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,710
As long as I’m there,

313
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,380
I could still serve Young Master Yue.

314
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,160
That’s more than enough

315
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,470
for me.

316
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,570
Xiaoba,

317
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,370
what are you thinking?

318
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,750
Didn’t Xiaoliu say

319
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,490
once we get to Yanbei,

320
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,790
we’ll be free

321
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,460
from all menial jobs.

322
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,150
You keep calling her your sister,

323
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,480
but where is she?

324
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,180
Where’s our sister?

325
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,090
She…

326
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,430
She won’t bail on us

327
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,590
for no reason.

328
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,120
Oh, no!

329
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,700
Is she really in trouble?

330
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,110
Xiaoba,

331
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,100
hey,

332
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,500
let’s go find her.

333
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,370
Come on.

334
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,760
No. Go ahead on your own.

335
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:52,910
Fine.

336
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,370
Just stay here and wait for me.

337
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,430
Don’t go anywhere.

338
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,640
I’ll be back

339
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,700
after I find her.

340
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,590
Xiaoqi!

341
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:12,370
Xiaoqi!

342
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:12,850
Xiaoba?

343
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,910
How could you leave me alone?

344
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:14,990
You said you wouldn’t come.

345
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,240
Report!

346
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,260
Report!

347
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,530
Young Master,

348
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,780
Yan Xun is heading towards the west gate.

349
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,430
Let’s go.

350
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,120
Where are Xiaoqi and Xiaoba?

351
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:09,870
Your Excellency.

352
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,060
Is everyone here?

353
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:11,680
Yes.

354
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,770
Your Excellency!

355
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:14,790
What’s to panic?

356
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,120
Something’s wrong.

357
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,080
Troops in and out of the city

358
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,580
have been mobilized.

359
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:19,810
This place is dangerous.

360
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,370
We’d better leave now.

361
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,830
Where are you going?

362
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,100
- Step back.
- Protect His Excellency.

363
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,260
Go, Your Excellency!

364
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,220
Step back!

365
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,690
What are you doing, Zhao Xifeng?

366
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:31,940
Yan Xun, you’re a hostage.

367
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,780
Going out of town without permission

368
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,570
is inappropriate, isn’t it?

369
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,660
I’m going to take a ride.

370
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:39,980
Why so serious

371
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,060
about such a trifle?

372
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,840
Today is not your lucky day.

373
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,990
His Majesty forbids anyone

374
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,840
from leaving the city tonight.

375
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,640
All violators

376
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,170
shall be executed.

377
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,170
His Majesty’s imperial edict

378
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,380
for Yan Xun is as follows:

379
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,410
Marquis Dingbei colluded with foreign enemies

380
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,000
in his attempt to rebel.

381
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,710
Wei Shuye is ordered to

382
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,310
to take Marquis Dingbei’s son Yan Xun

383
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:14,900
into custody

384
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,160
at Court of Justice.

385
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,210
Yan Xun, drop your weapon.

386
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,610
Resistance is uncalled for.

387
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,620
Why wasting time on him?

388
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,790
They all came for you.

389
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,960
Sorry about dragging you into this.

390
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,110
No worries.

391
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,590
We’ll be even

392
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,580
after this.

393
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:42,460
Yan Xun, this is His Majesty’s order.

394
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,630
Don’t blame me

395
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,650
on your way to hell.

396
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,700
Drop your weapon! Open the gate!

397
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,210
Or I’ll kill him!

398
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,510
Bitch,

399
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,850
I’ll slaughter you!

400
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,980
Let them go!

401
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,400
Help!

402
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,790
Let them go!

403
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,020
Let’s go!

404
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,770
Hurry up! Go!

405
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,630
Come on!

406
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,460
Let’s go! Hurry!

407
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,000
Come.

408
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,670
Watch out.

409
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,310
Why hasn’t she come?

410
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,170
Yes.

411
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,240
Didn’t she ask us to meet her

412
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,460
at the west gate?

413
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,540
Coming through. Step back.

414
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,010
We are searching for rebels!

415
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,160
Anyone harboring them

416
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,380
will be executed!

417
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,350
Search!

418
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:51,790
Let’s go.

419
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,710
Shut up. Move!

420
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,550
Follow me!

421
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,910
Move! Move!

422
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,930
We should protect ourselves first. Let’s go.

423
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,340
Open the door!

424
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,100
Open the door! Let me out!

425
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,780
Open the door!

426
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,000
Mother!

427
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,900
Huanhuan,

428
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,660
what should I do?

429
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,090
How can I get out?

430
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,150
Your Highness,

431
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,470
Noble Consort asked me

432
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,610
to bring you some food.

433
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,920
Is my mother outside?

434
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,420
Who else is there?

435
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,440
No,

436
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,960
she is not outside.

437
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,590
Only two guards are at the door.

438
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:17,230
What about Caiwei?

439
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,550
Where is she?

440
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:20,810
Caiwei

441
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,760
has been locked up by Noble Consort.

442
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,520
Your Highness, please have some food.

443
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,330
These are

444
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,080
all your favorites.

445
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,360
Come here.

446
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,890
Can you do me a favor,

447
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:47,640
please?

448
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,360
Your Highness…

449
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,350
Take off your clothes.

450
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,270
What are you trying to do, Your Highness?

451
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,650
I need to escape.

452
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,730
Escape?

453
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,680
I’m simply going out for a while.

454
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,030
Do me a favor.

455
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,460
Lend me your clothes.

456
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,980
Lie down on my bed

457
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:06,640
and pretend to sleep.

458
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,630
I’ll be back shortly.

459
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,800
Please don’t make it hard for me, Your Highness.

460
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,160
If Noble Consort finds out about this,

461
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,760
she’ll beat me to death!

462
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,330
Get up

463
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,050
and listen.

464
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,600
If I don’t leave now,

465
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,540
I won’t be able

466
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,810
to save Yan Xun’s life.

467
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,300
That way,

468
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,330
he will die.

469
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,600
If he dies,

470
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,620
I won’t live alone.

471
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,760
Do you want to see me die?

472
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,310
No, right?

473
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,560
So right now,

474
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,910
you’re my only hope.

475
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,400
You’ll be

476
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,410
saving two innocent lives

477
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,600
and both of us

478
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,570
will be in your debt.

479
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,340
Stop!

480
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,100
Untie him.

481
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,160
Off you go.

482
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,300
His Majesty has zero tolerance

483
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,300
for rebels.

484
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,140
Cut the crap!

485
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,280
Just go before I change my mind.

486
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,630
You shouldn’t have let him go.

487
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,320
If I killed him,

488
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,690
Yanbei would be guilty

489
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:53,800
of treason.

490
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,200
I cannot take that risk.

491
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,470
He wouldn’t be grateful

492
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,810
even if you let him go.

493
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,040
And

494
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,850
he’d come after you in the future.

495
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,030
If we can leave safely,

496
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,430
there’s no need to kill him.

497
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,050
If we can’t,

498
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,430
killing him wouldn’t be of help.

499
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,020
By the way, you helped me

500
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,820
just now

501
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,350
and cut off Zhao Xifeng’s fingers.

502
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,260
I bet

503
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,450
he demands payback.

504
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,120
It is unknown yet who will pay.

505
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,710
Indeed.

506
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,980
After the fight at the west gate,

507
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:30,130
everyone must’ve known by now

508
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:32,050
that you are mine.

509
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,430
I belong to myself, not anyone else.

510
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,790
I’m not yours.

511
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,520
You are.

512
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,010
I have something important

513
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:42,480
to do.

514
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,570
I’m done wasting time on you.

515
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,760
You’re wanted

516
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,920
in the entire city.

517
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,630
Where do you think

518
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:49,660
you can go, kid?

519
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,550
Thank you for your concern.

520
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,890
But I’m not

521
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,200
a kid.

522
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,540
I guess you are right.

523
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,200
You could beat ten men on your own.

524
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,180
As manly as those guys seem,

525
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,200
they look like

526
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,970
a bunch of schoolgirls

527
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,680
in front of you.

528
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,240
So?

529
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,730
So however strong you are,

530
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:10,650
you are still

531
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,980
a delicate

532
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,750
little girl.

533
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,030
And however cruel you seem,

534
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:17,860
in my eyes,

535
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,110
you’re always an innocent girl.

536
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,010
Who are you calling cruel?

537
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,430
I am little, so what?

538
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,270
It’s the brain that matters.

539
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,390
As strong and tall as you are,

540
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,600
you’re brainless.

541
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,130
You were abducted

542
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,170
and almost killed by Zhao Xifeng, weren’t you?

543
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:34,930
That’s why

544
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,060
I need you

545
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,530
to escort me back to Yanbei.

546
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,980
I’m done bickering with you.

547
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,650
Your Excellency,

548
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,260
we’re still on a mission.

549
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,780
Getting out of the city

550
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,840
doesn’t guarantee our safety.

551
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,340
Not to mention all those noble families

552
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,510
who are still hunting for us.

553
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,360
Let her leave.

554
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,090
Yan Xun,

555
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,820
thanks for helping me over and over.

556
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,020
We’re sort of friends.

557
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,400
The road ahead is tough.

558
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,570
Take care.

559
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,690
Once I find my sisters,

560
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,980
we will probably go to Yanbei, too.

561
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,750
I’ll visit you.

562
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,830
Really?

563
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,040
I’ll take that as a promise.

564
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,880
If you wish.

565
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,720
Report!

566
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,080
Young Master Huai.

567
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,270
We have found where Yan Xun is.

568
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,490
Where is he?

569
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,800
2.5 kilometers outside the west gate.

570
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,070
Lead the way.

571
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:47,660
Aye.

572
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,820
What happened to you?

573
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,240
Speak.

574
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,510
Wait here. I’ll go

575
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,840
bring that bastard Yan Xun back

576
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,780
for you to take revenge.

577
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:27,740
Mother, it was my idea.

578
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:29,130
Don’t blame her.

579
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,780
Take her out and beat her.

580
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,380
Spare me, please!

581
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,620
Your Highness!

582
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:36,700
- Get up!
- Your Highness!

583
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,480
- Your Highness, please help me!
- Get up!

584
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:39,780
Let go of her!

585
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,340
Your Highness!

586
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,670
Let her go!

587
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,040
- Don’t touch her!
- Your Highness!

588
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,860
Don’t beat her!

589
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,060
Mother!

590
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,910
Mother, I’m begging you!

591
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:47,920
Let go of me.

592
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,380
Mother,

593
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,030
it’s my fault.

594
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,070
I forced her to do that.

595
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,090
She is innocent.

596
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,240
Mother,

597
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:56,710
punish me instead.

598
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,850
Beat me for it.

599
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,320
Please don’t hurt her.

600
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,740
She is innocent.

601
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,570
Your Highness!

602
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:08,670
Your Highness, help!

603
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,480
Mother!

604
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:12,350
Mother!

605
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,120
Mother,

606
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,080
I gave her the order.

607
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,700
I’m the one to blame.

608
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,050
I know I made a mistake.

609
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,360
I’m really sorry.

610
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,150
I swear I won’t do it again.

611
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,940
I’m begging you!

612
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,200
Mother, please have mercy on her!

613
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,650
Please let her go. I’m begging you!

614
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,710
Mother!

615
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,830
Mother, I’m sorry!

616
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,960
Mother,

617
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,610
it’s my fault.

618
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,110
I’m begging you.

619
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,510
Please spare her.

620
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,090
Punish me, please!

621
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,150
I’m sorry, Your Highness.

622
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,900
I beat her too hard

623
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,130
and killed her.

624
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,330
Rules are the rules.

625
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,430
Your father is determined to kill Marquis Dingbei

626
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,970
because he

627
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,330
broke the rules.

628
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,880
I punished this maid

629
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,570
because she broke my rules.

630
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,450
You are my daughter,

631
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:01,830
a princess.

632
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,790
I’m soft-hearted towards you.

633
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,660
But your maid

634
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,980
is not that lucky.

635
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,060
Mark my words,

636
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,350
if her death

637
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,190
can make you

638
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,580
feel less guilty

639
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,950
when you think of Yan Xun,

640
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:25,980
then it’s worth it.

641
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,130
Xiaoba?

642
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,940
What was Young Master Yue thinking

643
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,120
that he sent me, The Disguiser,

644
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,670
to deal with a little girl?

645
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,860
Where is Xiaoba?

646
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,240
Who’s Xiaoba?

647
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,700
You don’t know?

648
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,620
She is the girl you are disguising as.

649
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:32,950
I’m only following the order.

650
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,430
Whose order?

651
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,390
Say it!

652
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:40,990
Yuwen Yue’s.

653
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,590
Go!

654
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,350
You killed her?

655
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:45,650
Who gave you the right?

656
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,030
You…

657
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,240
You are still alive.

658
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:08,950
Thanks to you,

659
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,280
I’m healthy as a horse.

660
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:12,140
But

661
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,480
I can’t say the same to you.

662
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,950
Smart trick

663
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:19,950
you used.

664
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,010
You taught me well.

665
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,420
Why can’t you

666
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,480
just let me go?

667
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,730
Won’t my death pain you?

668
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,850
Will you kill me?

669
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,760
Try me.

670
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:35,720
Fine.

671
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,080
I taught you everything.

672
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,790
How can you kill me?

673
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,820
= Yue =

674
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,070
Xing’er killed Yuwen Xi

675
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:42,370
and pinned everything on you.

676
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:43,330
Do you know that?

677
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,750
Murdering a court official isn’t a minor offence.

678
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,060
If she runs away,

679
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,340
you can’t defend yourself.

680
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,880
You must seize her!

681
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,470
Take her.

682
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:14,810
I saved you again.

683
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:16,200
Go to Yanbei with me.

684
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:16,780
Are you crazy?

685
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:17,820
Why are you back?

686
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:18,690
You want to die?

687
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,500
What would you do without me?

688
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,390
Hold me tight.

689
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,110
Stop!

690
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:31,790
