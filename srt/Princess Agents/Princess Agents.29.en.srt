16

Wei Shuyou!

17
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,380
You bastard!

18
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,010
How dare you call my name!

19
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,030
Surrender now

20
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,600
to die intact.

21
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,930
I killed those men and hurt him.

22
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,150
Do your job.

23
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,010
If we don’t take action now,

24
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,520
it’ll be too late to save His Excellency.

25
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,460
Anything we do

26
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,000
will prove Yan Xun guilty.

27
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,790
We can’t leap in the dark anymore.

28
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,100
But Emperor is fickle

29
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,450
and gullible.

30
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,300
At court, His Excellency will...

31
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,590
I have an idea.

32
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,490
It’s feasible.

33
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,500
But you’ll be in grave danger.

34
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,530
I’ll do it.

35
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,910
Alright, I can’t go see her.

36
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:48,890
Only you can.

37
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,120
Time is running out.

38
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,730
Any delay,

39
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,570
we’ll be stuck in here.

40
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,890
Fine, you take care.

41
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,310
Princess.

42
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,250
What’s wrong?

43
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,340
His Excellency Yan Xun’s maid

44
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,520
bought over an entrance guard,

45
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,720
and is waiting outside.

46
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,380
She says that His Excellency Yan Xun is in trouble

47
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,580
and needs your help.

48
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,110
Move!

49
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,730
Mr. Zhu,

50
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,640
Young Master Wei Shuyou failed.

51
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,100
Yan Xun is being sent to the Palace

52
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:30,830
to see His Majesty.

53
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,510
Young Master asked us

54
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,550
to move the killers’ bodies away

55
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,090
on the sly.

56
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,590
Go check.

57
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,280
Aye.

58
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,320
You guys take the chance

59
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,270
to bury those bodies.

60
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,030
Be quick.

61
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:45,980
- Aye.
- Aye.

62
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,230
Take those bodies away.

63
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:39,950
Get lost!

64
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,900
Princess has orders

65
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,630
to secure the killers’ bodies.

66
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,250
Go!

67
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,630
Move!

68
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,040
Mr. Zhu,

69
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,980
someone ambushed Wei’s guards.

70
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,110
Those bodies were taken away

71
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,080
by Princess’s men.

72
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,810
That useless Wei Shuyou!

73
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,500
Mr. Zhu, what’s next?

74
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,330
You need to ask? Get them back!

75
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,150
- Aye.
- Let’s go!

76
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,030
Take them outside the city.

77
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,360
They’ll be unconscious there

78
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,860
for at least for 4 hours.

79
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,130
They won’t make any trouble.

80
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,470
Your Majesty, your liquor pot is empty.

81
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,510
Here’s more.

82
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,520
Who are you?

83
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,590
I’m your maid

84
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,970
and your woman.

85
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,210
My woman?

86
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,350
Everyone and everything in this world

87
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,400
belong to you.

88
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,800
Aren’t you sweet?

89
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,590
What’s your name?

90
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,760
My name is Lan’er.

91
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,340
Lan’er.

92
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,020
Your Majesty!

93
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,740
Your Majesty. Are you asleep?

94
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,920
It’s urgent!

95
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,450
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

96
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,180
Come in.

97
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,910
Your Majesty.

98
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,230
What happened?

99
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,610
Something urgent

100
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,970
requires your immediate attention.

101
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:59,630
She is good. Promote her to Concubine

102
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,960
with the title Lan.

103
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,570
She can move into the Palace of Orchid.

104
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,510
Aye.

105
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:13,970
Yan Xun, I’ve just pardoned you.

106
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,940
You haven’t atoned for your sins

107
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,010
before wounding others.

108
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,110
I’m guilty.

109
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,050
I can’t thank you enough
for your kindness.

110
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,900
But that was self-defense.

111
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,140
Wei Shuyou attempted
to assassinate me earlier.

112
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,380
If I didn’t fight back,

113
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,720
I wouldn’t have a chance to survive.

114
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,660
Your Majesty,

115
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,570
I went there

116
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,740
for Yan Xun’s safety

117
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,980
to patrol as usual.

118
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,250
But I caught him

119
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,400
trying to escape,

120
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,420
so he wanted me dead.

121
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,830
Your Majesty.

122
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,850
Just like his father,

123
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,710
Yan Xun is too wild to be trusted.

124
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,670
Are you blind?

125
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:55,850
Can’t you see

126
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:56,780
those dead bodies

127
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,690
all over the Oriole Courtyard?

128
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,220
Wei Shuyou assembled the assassins

129
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,340
and Yan Xun

130
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,460
just tried to protect himself.

131
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,670
Prince Yu.

132
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,860
Don’t you believe

133
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,420
your own cousin?

134
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,120
Did you see any assassins, Your Highness?

135
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,150
Or did you see any dead bodies?

136
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,690
I didn’t.

137
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,090
- But...
- Song.

138
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,560
Stand down.

139
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,460
Your Majesty, I have got the testimonies

140
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,700
from the guards overnight.

141
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,460
They only saw Wei Shuyou and Yan Xun

142
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,790
without any sign of assassins.

143
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:59,530
Your Majesty,
guards of the Oriole Courtyard

144
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,070
all came from the Yuwen family.

145
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,870
Their testimonies are unreliable.

146
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,920
Your Majesty, I understand

147
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,670
it’s hard for me to defend myself.

148
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,730
But I grew up in the capital city.

149
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,610
Your Majesty are
a good judge of character.

150
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,170
What kind of person am I?

151
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,210
Would I stoop so low

152
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,330
as to act as the crooked?

153
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,970
I believe

154
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,130
Your Majesty will have
your own conclusions.

155
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,510
Your Majesty,
if you punish Yan Xun for this,

156
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,450
that may be categorized as persecution.

157
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,070
Like father like son.

158
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,950
Here you are playing the martyr.

159
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,370
You not only framed Young Master Wei,

160
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,430
but also fooled Noble Consort.

161
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,250
You are much better

162
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,980
than that treacherous father

163
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,250
of yours.

164
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,640
What’s this called?

165
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,910
The son outdoes the father.

166
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,520
Young Master Huai.

167
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,880
If I were really as good as you said,

168
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,840
I wouldn’t have

169
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,040
ended up like this.

170
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,210
But thanks for showing me a backstabber,

171
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,100
fabricator and liar.

172
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,270
I’ve learned

173
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,250
my lesson.

174
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,230
Your Excellency,

175
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,970
don’t throw dirt on me.

176
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,120
His Majesty can tell the truth.

177
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,450
Well,

178
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,360
you wounded others

179
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,260
in custody.

180
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,700
We all saw that.

181
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,740
Who saw your so-called assassins?

182
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,770
Do you have eyewitnesses?

183
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,300
You are lying to His Majesty.

184
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,500
He who has a mind to beat his dog
will easily find his stick.

185
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,890
I’m only a concubine’s son
with no power at all.

186
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,760
Telling lies aside,

187
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,130
I wouldn’t dare to wound anyone.

188
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,680
You overestimated me.

189
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,910
Yuwen Huai.

190
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,830
You alone aren’t that capable, of course.

191
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,640
My respects to you, Father, Mother.

192
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,240
What are you doing here?

193
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,630
Don’t mess around.

194
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,610
Go back, now.

195
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,210
Father,

196
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,090
I’ve got something important

197
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:29,910
to report.

198
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,440
Go ahead.

199
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,590
The dead body outside

200
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,010
was the assassin

201
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,280
sent by the Wei family

202
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,140
to kill Yan Xun tonight,

203
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,640
and he was

204
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,830
Wei Shuyou’s henchman.

205
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,590
Wei Shuyou always went out

206
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,580
with him.

207
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,530
Many people in the Palace recognize him.

208
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,530
And some of you here

209
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:47,770
must be familiar with him

210
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:48,980
as well.

211
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,120
Young Master Yuwen, am I right?

212
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,580
Song, Yuwen Huai,

213
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,880
check the body outside.

214
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,850
- Aye.
- Aye.

215
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,160
Your Majesty.

216
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,750
The dead man was indeed

217
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,960
Wei Shuyou’s henchman.

218
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,500
What Chun just said is true.

219
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,320
Young Master Yuwen, don’t you

220
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,800
recognize him?

221
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,030
He looked familiar, but I don’t know him.

222
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,350
Yuwen Huai.

223
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,390
What do you mean by “he looked familiar”?

224
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,250
You hang about

225
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,230
with Wei Shuyou every day.

226
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,090
How could you not know

227
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,160
his henchman?

228
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,500
Shuyou, go and check the body,

229
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,810
and see if he was

230
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:00,630
your servant.

231
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,760
Look carefully.

232
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,820
Don’t you think

233
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,600
you can muddle through this

234
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,370
by telling lies.

235
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,230
You know,

236
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,550
I have got so many ways

237
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,520
to verify your story.

238
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,590
Aye.

239
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,640
Your Majesty. Your Highnesses.

240
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,160
It’s true that man

241
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,920
was my servant.

242
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,710
Did you hear that, Yuwen Huai?

243
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,590
He has admitted it himself.

244
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,030
What more do you have to say?

245
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,340
Your Highness,
although he was their servant,

246
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,700
he could be a spy

247
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,880
planted next to Young Master Wei.

248
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,500
You...

249
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,630
By the way,

250
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,620
when Marquis Dingbei planned to

251
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,380
rebel,

252
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,500
he could certainly plant spies

253
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,570
in noble families.

254
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,690
You...

255
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,170
That’s right.

256
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:16,880
How could Princess know

257
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,910
what happened in the Oriole Courtyard

258
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,510
in the middle of the night,

259
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,010
and then encountered the assassin

260
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,600
and brought him to His Majesty?

261
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,260
Your Majesty.

262
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,640
This man was my servant,

263
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,170
but never a henchman.

264
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,840
He seemed to be smart,

265
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,310
so I kept him.

266
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,070
I didn’t expect

267
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,330
he was skilled in martial arts.

268
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,480
I bet someone powerful

269
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,340
planted him next to me.

270
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,890
I have been living in the capital
since childhood.

271
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,620
I have always been cautious

272
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,080
to stay away from mistakes

273
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,300
and trouble.

274
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,690
I don’t have

275
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,940
any fighters around me,

276
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,800
not to mention highly skilled ones.

277
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,970
Liar!

278
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,350
There are two

279
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,580
skilled martial artists around you.

280
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,840
A man and a woman.

281
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,630
Your Majesty,
if you have no idea about that,

282
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,730
we can bring them here for questioning.

283
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,280
Your Majesty, the truth is

284
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,390
Wei Shuyou planned
to assassinate me first.

285
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,030
And now, he’s framing me.

286
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,280
He’s evil beyond forgiveness.

287
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,440
I’m a sinner.

288
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,110
Thanks to your mercy,

289
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,080
I can live to this day.

290
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,240
I would never have any martial artists

291
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,140
around me.

292
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,680
Nonsense!

293
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,210
Without them,

294
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:27,680
how could you survive

295
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,110
the assassination tonight?

296
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,320
You would have been chopped into pieces

297
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,540
by us.

298
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,890
So that’s what happened.

299
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,480
Did you hear that, Father?

300
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,890
He said it himself.

301
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,690
However you spin this,

302
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,370
it’ll be of no use.

303
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,870
Didn’t you just say there was nobody else

304
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,410
other than Yan Xun and Wei Shuyou

305
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:58,690
in the Oriole Courtyard?

306
00:20:59,050 --> 00:20:59,960
Your Majesty.

307
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,560
He’s on drugs,

308
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,950
so he doesn’t know what he says.

309
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,770
Do I look like a fool?

310
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,390
Your Majesty, I’m to blame.

311
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,430
I’m negligent.

312
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,380
His Majesty’s given the explicit order

313
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,230
to forbid noble families
from approaching Yan Xun.

314
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,400
Shuyou,

315
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,970
you’ve really

316
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,360
disappointed His Majesty.

317
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,080
You’ve crossed the line

318
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,420
and tried to deceive His Majesty.

319
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,860
You should be damned.

320
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,860
But Your Majesty,

321
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,480
I watched him over the cradle.

322
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,860
Although he’s rash,

323
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,870
he has a good nature.

324
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,780
It’d never be his intention

325
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,370
to do such things.

326
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,580
He must’ve been abetted

327
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,060
in the deception by the ill-intentioned.

328
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,220
You are right.

329
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,050
Father, the truth

330
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,440
has come out.

331
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,130
They should be punished.

332
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,590
Yan Xun is a victim here.

333
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,560
Please let him stand up.

334
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,130
Yan Xun, you may rise.

335
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,740
Thank you, Your Majesty.

336
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,720
Wei Shuyou,

337
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,950
since Noble Consort has
put in a good word for you,

338
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,790
you shall be flogged 20 times.

339
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,700
Reflect on yourself in home confinement.

340
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,050
Without my permission,

341
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,100
you are not allowed to leave your place.

342
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,480
Father,

343
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,920
he was going to assassinate Yan Xun

344
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,310
and he lied to you.

345
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,710
He has committed more than one felony.

346
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,620
How can you just

347
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,550
flog him 20 times?

348
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,070
Where are your manners?

349
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,410
- Father…
- Chun.

350
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,570
You may all leave.

351
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,250
My night is totally

352
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,010
ruined by you.

353
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:05,910
Your Excellency,

354
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,280
you are quite smart

355
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,050
and made Wei Shuyou confess.

356
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,450
But smart men in history

357
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,270
weren’t necessarily the winners.

358
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,900
Power matters the most.

359
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,370
Yuwen Huai.

360
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,070
You are sharp-tongued

361
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,340
and good with words.

362
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,280
Your Highness.

363
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,250
I meant well.

364
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,230
Meant well?

365
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,330
Give it a rest.

366
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,780
From now on, stay away from

367
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,070
Yan Xun.

368
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,290
Next time,

369
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,870
I’ll make you pay.

370
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,370
Your Highness, I know in your eyes

371
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:44,410
Yan Xun

372
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,540
is the best.

373
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,480
Whatever I do is wrong.

374
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,530
Here’s a friendly reminder

375
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,470
to Your Highness as well.

376
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,380
Don’t trust the wrong one

377
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:55,840
and get yourself hurt.

378
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,720
Yan Xun,

379
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,840
I got this ointment
from the Imperial Physician.

380
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,800
Apply it to your wound.

381
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,280
It’s just a scratch.

382
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,400
This is unnecessary.

383
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,950
Thank you for your help today,
Your Highness.

384
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,960
I appreciate it.

385
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:34,340
Yan Xun…

386
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,720
Your ointment.

387
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,020
Your Excellency, hold on.

388
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,850
Yan Xun, I am sorry

389
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,380
for what you went through.

390
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,060
I apologize

391
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,090
that I didn’t visit you.

392
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,150
What’s your point?

393
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,690
If you don’t like Her Highness,

394
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,860
don’t give her false hopes.

395
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,620
Will His Excellency make it back tonight?

396
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,420
He will.

397
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,180
You’re injured.

398
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,640
It is nothing serious.

399
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,920
You’d better go inside and have some rest.

400
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,070
I’ll wait here.

401
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:35,680
I am fine.

402
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,470
Yan Xun.

403
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,410
Your Excellency.

404
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,740
Yan Xun.

405
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,350
How are you?

406
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,070
We are fine.

407
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,960
What did Emperor say?

408
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,140
He flogged Wei Shuyou 20 times

409
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,830
and gave him home confinement.

410
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,710
That’s all?

411
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:02,910
Yes.

412
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,500
His Majesty never intended to

413
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,560
punish Wei Shuyou.

414
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,860
That was to send a message.

415
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,980
If he was punished too harshly,

416
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,680
everyone would act cautiously from now on.

417
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,860
No one

418
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,350
would ever

419
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,600
try to kill Yan Xun again.

420
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,840
Clearly,

421
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,660
that’s not His Majesty’s intention.

422
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,580
He only wants to control Yan Xun

423
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,610
in order to control Yanbei.

424
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,260
Yan Xun in danger

425
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,350
is easier for him to deal with

426
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,420
than him being safe.

427
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,780
Look likes we need to be

428
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,990
more careful from now on.

429
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,900
As long as we are still in Chang’an,

430
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,710
we need to be extremely careful.

431
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,790
He wants me dead.

432
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:41,000
And I want the same

433
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,880
for him.

There you are.

437
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:56,600
I think

438
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,740
we are safe for tonight.

439
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,060
I’ll sleep here.

440
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:01,910
You are wounded.

441
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,100
It’s nothing serious.

442
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,150
Let me see.

443
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,710
I am fine.

444
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,290
Let me check.

445
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,480
I have had it treated.

446
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,760
It’s stopped bleeding now.

447
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,720
Yan Xun.

448
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:18,660
Where are you going?

449
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,410
To get some medicine.

450
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,730
From where?

451
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,140
From Princess.

452
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,130
There are killers everywhere.

453
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,620
We are wounded.

454
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,090
Even if we are not killed by them,

455
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,810
you are committing a felony.

456
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,980
Please don’t

457
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,380
cause more trouble.

458
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,290

459
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,130
Yan Xun. Be patient.

460

Hang in there.

I am fine.

462
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,570
Don’t lose your head

463
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,520
because of me.

464
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,120
We almost died.

465
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,180
We need to be

466
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,540
very careful.

467
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,230
Think about your family.

468
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,310
Think about your parents.

469
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,550
They are looking at you from heaven.

470
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,100
Don’t act rashly.

471
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,350
Be patient. Be patient.

472
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,880
Be patient, please.

473
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,310
Everything will be fine.

Young Master is here
to visit Master Xi’s wife,

not Young Master Huai.

486

Her Ladyship has been paralyzed for years.

Her condition is too bad
to meet with anyone.

How are you?

a dead woman walking.

You are Yue.

497
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,840
I have heard that

498
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,760
you’ve devoted yourself to Buddhism

499
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,890
since I was little.

500
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,150
I’m surprised to see

501
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,110
you imprisoned

502
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,900
in this secret chamber.

503
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,360

to ask you to check an old item.

509
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,040
This was what my mother

510
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,270
was changed into

511
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,520
in the Pleasure Pavilion.

only the lowest concubine in the Pavilion

514
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,420
would wear this Herbaceous peony dress.

515

Two months ago,

516
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:22,490

this is a peony dress

00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,710
are similar

523
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,820
and this dress was damaged on purpose.

524
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,010
You are right.

525
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,240
This is mine.

526
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,500
My mother was framed.

527
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,240
They accused her of adultery

528
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,930
because she was found drunk

529
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,610
with Yuwen Xi that night

530
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,180
and changed into

531
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,410
a dress she didn’t even

532
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,120
recognize.

533
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:13,390
Yuwen Xi lied

534
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:14,750
to everyone.

535
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:16,780
Your mother was with me

536
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,400
that night.

537
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:21,560
With you?

538
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:30,020
I am the daughter of the Xie family

539
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,450
dating back to the Southern Dynasties.

540
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:34,580
I am your mother’s aunt.

541
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:39,840
That night, your mother came to visit me.

542
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,350
We had some liquor.

543
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,780
I asked your mother to stay for the night.

544
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,440
I’m sure you know

545
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,450
Yuwen Xi’s character.

546
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:55,730
I was afraid that your mother’s reputation
might be ruined,

547
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:58,610
so I activated the mechanism

548
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,270
and went down here.

549
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:04,270
I asked your mother

550
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,030
to change into this peony dress.

551
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,900
Then what happened?

552
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,870
Then?

553
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,490
It was a disaster.

554
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,500
That night,

555
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:24,460
Yuwen Xi went out his way

556
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,720
to trap me here

557
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:28,800
for 16 years.

558
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,590
Only two deaf maids are here

559
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,850
to watch and serve me.

560
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,730
How could he be so cruel?

561
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,180
Then why didn’t he kill you?

562
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:42,800
You think he didn’t want to?

563
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,430
He kept me alive

564
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,630
only for his greedy desires.

565
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,830
He hooked up with the spies from Liang.

566
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,960
I have talked too much today.

567
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,350
It takes time

568
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,090
to tell you everything.

569
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,460
Yuwen Yue.

570
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,610
Who let you in?

571
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,620
I came in myself.

572
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,310
Can’t you see it?

573
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,460
You started it.

574
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,250
Don’t blame me for it.

575
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,060
By the way,

576
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,520
I took your grandmother away.

577
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,660
You’d better

578
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,580
be smart

579
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,900
and give her back.

580
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,810
Or there will be a bloodbath

581
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:06,530
in Qingshan House.

582
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,720
Are you threatening me?

583
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,800
What do you think?

584
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:13,080
You may be fine

585
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,460
with being laughed at

586
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,450
for the internal strife.

587
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,580
But aren’t you afraid

588
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,840
your grandmother’s reappearance

589
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,910
will destroy

590
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,460
the entire Third Branch?

591
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,840
Once the secret is revealed,

592
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:32,220
I may not get away with it.

593
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,000
But you are also a Yuwen.

594
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,150
You can’t

595
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,520
stay out of it, either.

596
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,390
Fine. We’ll see.

597
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,070
If I told His Majesty

598
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,940
about your branch

599
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,290
colluding with the spies from Liang,

600
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,620
would he

601
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,310
let me off the hook

602
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,020
for telling the truth?

603
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,560
Yuwen Yue.

604
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,030
What the hell do you want?

605
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,420
I’m about to go to the border.

606
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,000
Wild wind, bad weather.

607
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,630
Not comfortable to live there.

608
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,890
While I am there suffering,

609
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,350
you can still

610
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,950
enjoy yourself in your mansion.

611
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:22,570
I don’t have a big heart. It upsets me.

612
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:24,160
How about this?

613
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,240
I have another place for you to stay.

614
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,260
Go guard the Imperial Mausoleum.

615
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,100
Because you are really good at

616
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,690
dealing with dead people.

617
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,800
I give you three days
to volunteer for the job.

618
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,910
I don’t want to see you in the city

619
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,200
before I leave.

620
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,170
Or,

621
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,530
I’ll send you to hell

622
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,690
to accompany your grandfather.

623
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,760
Yuwen Yue,

624
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,700
how dare you!

625
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,770
Young Master.

626
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,110
Young Master.

627
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,760
Come in.

628
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,530
Young Master, good news.

629
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,500
Yuwen Yue is leaving Chang’an

630
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,360
for the border

631
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,330
tomorrow morning.

632
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,750
Young… Young Master…

633
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,700
Why are you hitting me?

634
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:46,730
No reason.

635
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,190
You deserve it.

636
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,410
Your Highness.

637
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:27,130
I received a secret report.

638
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,630
Yuwen Xi’s wife

639
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,220
has been moved to Qingshan House

640
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,660
from the Pleasure Pavilion.

641
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,300
No wonder Yuwen Huai

642
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,220
volunteered

643
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,780
to guard the Imperial Mausoleum.

644
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:47,010
Yuwen Yue must’ve had

645
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,880
dirt on him.

646
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,570
You are really wise.

647
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,130
Your Excellency, as per His Majesty’s order,

648
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:14,660
we’ll be guarding this courtyard.

649
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:18,810
And Prince Yu asked me

650
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,380
to bring you this sword

651
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,150
to return it to its original owner.

652
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,120
Please extend my gratitude to him.

653
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,360
Aye.

654
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:34,920
Starting from tomorrow,

655
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,300
the lockdown will be lifted.

656
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:37,840
Except for His Excellency,

657
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,410
everyone has free access to the courtyard.

658
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:51,310
Your Excellency, it’s true

659
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:52,590
that Yuwen Huai and Yuwen Yue

660
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:54,220
will leave the city.

661
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:56,690
The Yuwen family won’t target us for now.

662
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,260
Although our biggest enemy Yuwen Huai

663
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,550
is gone,

664
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,110
we still need to be cautious.

665
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,830
I understand.

666
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:10,650
Taste the dishes

667
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:11,670
from my hometown.

668
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,330
Haven’t had these for a while.

669
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:15,220
Have they been tested?

670
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,050
Your Excellency.

671
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,060
Your Excellency, Ajing is here.

672
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,880
Ajing, do you remember me?

673
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,690
Your Excellency, I thought

674
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,630
I’d never see you again.

675
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:32,380
Get up.

676
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,020
Where is General Meng He?

677
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,930
Your Excellency.

678
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:43,750
My father died on the battlefield.

679
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:44,950
His last words were

680
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:47,120
to find you.

681
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,230
Luckily,

682
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:50,740
I survived the war.

683
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,930
Then I came to Chang’an.

684
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,990
I looked for you for three months

685
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,410
before finally meeting Zhong Yu.

686
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:02,410
Your Excellency, my father died a tragic death.

687
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,510
Rest assured.

688
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,900
We will take revenge for the deceased.

689
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:12,340
Your Excellency, I want to follow you around.

690
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,340
I can cook

691
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:15,650
and wrestle.

692
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:17,460
I will do whatever

693
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:18,640
I can for you.

694
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:20,050
Good.

695
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,470
