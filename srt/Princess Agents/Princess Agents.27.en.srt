What?

17
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,950
His Majesty appointed Yuan Song

18
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:43,900
to take charge of the Imperial Prison?

19
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,420
The...

20
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,670
The commission has arrived
at the Ministry of Personnel.

21
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,930
His tenure starts tomorrow morning.

22
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,210
Those geezers

23
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,070
always jump up and down

Once something happens,

26
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,190
they’re mute as stones.

27
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,550
His Majesty is in a fit of anger.

28
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,240
Right now,

29
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,610
nobody dares to take the risk.

00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,530
Yuwen Yue

31
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,690
won’t watch Yan Xun die

32
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,430
and do nothing.

33
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,210
Since he acts against me,

34
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,050
I will show no mercy

35
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,270
on him.

36
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,700
Young Master, you want to...

37
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,010
Go to the Court of Judicial Review

38
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,750
to get the warrant

39
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,510
and take the killer of my grandfather out.

40
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,150
Young Master, are you...

41
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,370
Shut up and go!

42
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,590
Aye, aye.

43
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,860
Where is Yan Xun?

44
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,990
Who are you?

45
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:37,900
Go!

46
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,430
Over there. Over there.

47
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,020
Get up!

48
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,920
Achu!

49
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,730
Yan Xun!

50
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,400
Achu!

51
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,040
Yan Xun!

52
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,760
Don’t move.

53
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,140
What did you do

54
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:09,960
to Yan Xun?

55
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,140
Miss Xing’er,

56
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,400
could you please not

57
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,860
make things difficult for us?

58
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,880
Otherwise, His Excellency Yan Xun

59
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,460
will suffer more.

60
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,800
Take her away.

61
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:19,710
Aye!

62
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,030
Move!

63
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,170
Go to hell!

64
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,300
= Guilty-slave Chamber =

65
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,070
What a small world!

66
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,870
Speak.

67
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,690
You can’t go anywhere.

68
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,930
In the presence of Mr. Zhang,

69
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,730
tell us who ordered you

70
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,570
to kill my grandfather?

71
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,440
It was you.

72
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,750
Nonsense!

73
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,720
Are you still covering up for Yuwen Yue?

74
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,300
Didn’t you say

75
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,120
Yuwen Yue was the one that sent you

76
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,820
to kill my grandfather that day?

77
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,650
Does it matter who killed him?

78
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,380
Members of your family

79
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,790
are always at each other’s throats.

80
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,990
One man’s death isn’t a big deal.

81
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,850
Still won’t talk?

82
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,430
Let’s see how tight-lipped you are

83
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,970
under torture.

84
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,000
Guards!

85
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,960
Young Master Yue has arrived!

86
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,100
You’re fast.

87
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,090
Mr. Zhang.

88
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,210
Young Master Yue,

89
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,800
this crime

90
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,840
was committed by your maid.

91
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,560
She is supposed

92
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,700
to be at your disposal.

93
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,100
But Master Yuwen Xi

94
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,670
was a high-ranking official.

95
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,220
His case

96
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,840
has been recorded by my office.

97
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,600
Therefore,

98
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,810
I have to attend this interrogation.

99
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,710
As for the punishment,

100
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,280
it’s subject to your decision.

101
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,500
The office and I won’t interfere.

102
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,380
You have no right to deal with

103
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,790
members at Qingshan House.

104
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,490
Your member

105
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,210
killed my grandfather.

106
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,680
Don’t I deserve to know the truth?

107
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:34,690
Fine.

108
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,960
In this case, I will take her away

109
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,500
and reply to you later

110
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,800
after the interrogation.

111
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,510
Yueqi, take Xing’er away.

112
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,290
Yuwen Yue,

113
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,670
what do you think you’re doing?

114
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,780
Who says you can take her away?

115
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,660
Tell me, do you like her?

116
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,890
What’s the secret between you two?

117
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,390
It pains you, doesn’t it?

118
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,530
Fine.

119
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,070
Does it break your heart
seeing her like this?

120
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,420
How awkward!

121
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,650
I will make you regret

122
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,370
for the rest of your life.

123
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,030
A disobedient woman

124
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,270
should better be dead.

125
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,680
Take her out.

126
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,680
Hold on.

127
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,530
Who knows if she is really dead?

128
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,180
Mr. Zhang.

129
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,530
Fine, I’ll check.

130
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,160
Young Master Huai,

131
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,310
she is utterly dead.

132
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,710
Yuwen Yue,

133
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,250
I underestimated you.

134
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,840
My man can only die

135
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,580
in my hands.

136
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,400
Good day, Mr. Zhang.

137
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,350
You, too, Young Master.

138
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,190
Yueqi,

139
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,550
take her away.

140
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,640
Young Master Yue,

141
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,530
His Majesty summons you to the Palace.

142
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,790
I see.

143
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,930
Let me go back and get changed.

144
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,260
There’s no time

145
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,130
for you to get changed.

146
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,600
Young Master Yue, hurry up and follow me.

147
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,270
Any delay,

148
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,750
His Majesty will be mad.

149
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,150
Take the body back, awaiting my order.

150
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,150
Aye.

151
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:03,410
After you.

152
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,270
Alright.

153
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,230
My needle

154
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,480
hit Xing’er’s Guanyuan point,

155
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,610
blocking her blood
and thus making her faint

156
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,110
as if she were dead

157
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,740
to make it look convincing.

158
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,030
But without timely treatment,

159
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,120
she will die of blood stasis.

160
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,780
Where is Yue?

161
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,070
His Majesty summoned him

162
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,730
to the Palace.

163
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,360
Right now?

164
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,410
That doesn’t seem right.

165
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,480
What is he busy with these days?

166
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,020
I don’t know, either.

167
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,320
He hasn’t come to see me

168
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,630
since that day I told you

169
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,420
to shot Yan Xun with his Ice Arrow,

170
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,810
and spread the news.

171
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,100
Young Master

172
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,680
should be able to understand that.

173
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,800
You did it for his sake.

174
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,620
Where is Yueqi?

175
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,720
I need to see him.

176
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:47,670
Aye.

177
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,500
There is a tip-off saying that

178
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,730
the prison raid that day

179
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,010
was your idea.

180
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,380
Your Majesty,

181
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,860
that’s purely a false accusation.

182
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,380
Two days after that,

183
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,730
I was

184
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,530
outside the Imperial Prison every night

185
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,640
and killed the assassins.

186
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,620
It was you?

187
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,180
Yes.

188
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,610
Your Majesty

189
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,050
has granted His Excellency Yan amnesty,

190
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,190
but there are still people

191
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,850
who intend to take his life

192
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,550
for their own interests

193
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,040
regardless of Your Majesty’s order

194
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,190
and the law of our state.

195
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,150
As a member of Wei

196
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,500
and Your Majesty’s trusted help,

197
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,760
I can’t just sit back and watch.

198
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,640
You are quite honest.

199
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,020
Thank you, Your Majesty.

200
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56,310
The border has just been alerted,

201
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,950
saying that situation there is tense.

202
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,200
If you’re loyal as you claimed,

203
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,460
the border can use your service.

204
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,980
As for the Eye of Intel,

205
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,690
you’d better

206
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,710
step down.

207
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,160
From now on,

208
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,400
Yuwen Huai will take over your post.

209
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,030
You can set off

210
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,450
after finishing

211
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,070
your business at hand.

212
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,780
What?

213
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,160
Is there a problem?

214
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,080
I will obey your order.

215
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,710
You may leave.

216
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,210
Your Majesty,

217
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,910
do you suspect Yuwen Yue?

218
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,270
Not exactly.

219
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,810
People like Yuwen Yue

220
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,010
have their

221
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,030
own principles.

222
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,760
He’s not one of us.

223
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,040
Where is Xing’er?

224
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,800
Xing’er... Xing’er is dead.

225
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,930
Where is her body?

226
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,070
Her body was sent to the graveyard.

227
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,150
By whom?

228
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,070
Mr. Zhan Mou.

229
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,690
There’s one hour left.

230
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,970
Xing’er, wait for me!

231
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,950
Young Master Yue, well played.

232
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,250
You turned things around effortlessly

233
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,770
and saved Yan Xun’s life.

234
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,000
How admirable!

235
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:21,750
Young Master, go!

236
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,480
Young Master!

237
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,230
Young Master, you are injured!

238
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,070
Where is she?

239
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,390
Where is she?

240
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,140
Over... Over there.

241
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,870
She might be there.

242
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,420
Who are you?

243
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,580
A female body arrived just now

244
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,590
in prison garb.

245
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,430
Where is she?

246
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,380
Misters,

247
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,000
there’s an epidemic in the city.

248
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,500
All female bodies were burnt

249
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,730
as soon as they arrived.

250
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,030
I didn’t notice

251
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,320
the one in prison garb.

252
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,470
What did you just say?

253
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,690
She has been burnt.

254
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:48,590
Young Master.

255
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,840
Put out the fire!

256
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,510
Quickly!

257
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,080
Yes.

258
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,660
Hurry up.

259
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,480
I will

260
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,080
give this Finger Blade to Yueqi.

261
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,040
Give it to him for me.

262
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,100
Young Master,

263
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,820
I just tried it on.

264
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,300
The size of it

265
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,650
fits mine perfectly.

266
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,160
It’s too small for Yueqi.

267
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,520
So...

268
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,860
Thank you anyway.

269
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,680
I will always

270
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,390
remember your kindness to me.

271
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,110
Thank you, Young Master.

272
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:50,650
Achu!

273
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,550
Achu!

274
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,080
Achu!

275
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,720
You’re awake, Your Excellency.

276
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,510
Where is Achu?

277
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,180
She has been taken away

278
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,410
by Yuwen Huai’s men.

279
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,060
Yuwen Huai?

280
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,960
Achu is in danger.

281
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,120
Open the door.

282
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,160
Let me out. I need to save her.

283
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,520
I’ll be back once she’s safe.

284
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,430
But... I...

285
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,600
- I...
- Open the door!

286
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,360
Your Excellency, you can’t go out.

287
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,820
Prison breakers

288
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,060
will be condemned.

289
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,070
Open the door!

290
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,150
If that girl is fine,

291
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,400
but you are condemned for this,

292
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,010
it’s not worth it.

293
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:40,990
Open the door!

294
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,070
Don’t worry. I have already sent someone

295
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,110
to inform Young Master Yue

296
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,150
at Yuwen’s.

297
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,320
Everything will be fine.

298
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,710
Your Excellency, where there is life,

299
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,630
there is hope.

300
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,680
Prince Yu

301
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,190
came to visit you this morning

302
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,650
with a physician to treat your injury.

303
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,220
Princess also had

304
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,860
tons of goodies delivered here

305
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,200
for you to enjoy after waking up.

306
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,590
Your Excellency,

307
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,000
please hang in there.

308
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,430
Luck will be on your side.

309
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,220
Piss off!

310
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,360
I thought

311
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,100
you had a heart of stone.

312
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,480
I didn’t expect

313
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,610
you’d care so much about fame and wealth.

314
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,510
His Majesty only took away

315
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,830
the Eye of Intel from you.

316
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,480
Is a blow such heavy?

317
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,160
Why are you here?

318
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:26,880
Take over the Eye of Intel.

319
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,180
Are you playing deaf

320
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,420
to His Majesty’s order?

321
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,070
The Eye of Intel.

322
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,950
All that you’ve done

323
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,500
is to seize it?

324
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,320
You’re pathetic!

325
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,660
I’m afraid that you have no idea

326
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,590
what the Eye of Intel is.

327
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,390
Enough of this nonsense!

328
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,620
After you, brother.

329
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,280
Fine.

330
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,270
I’ll lead the way.

331
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,400
I hope you won’t regret it.

332
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,420
This is

333
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:33,070
the archive of the Eye of Intel,

334
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,600
Intel Building.

335
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,850
Since the founding of this agency,

336
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,070
every piece of information

337
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,620
has been kept here.

338
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,500
Why are you showing me these?

339
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,720
Don’t you want the Eye of Intel?

340
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,500
Here you are.

341
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,470
I don’t want

342
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,130
any old records.

343
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,380
Give me the list of spies,

344
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,070
manuals of martial arts,

345
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,480
all kinds of poison

346
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,410
and the treasure of all sections.

347
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,000
Are those important?

348
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,770
Yes.

349
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,410
The Eye of Intel has been around
for decades.

350
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,470
Tons of secrets

351
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,910
are kept in this room.

352
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,990
Don’t you understand

353
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,930
the value of this place?

354
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,590
In the ninth year
of the late emperor’s reign,

355
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,390
Zhu Xu died.

356
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,430
People all assumed

357
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,500
he fell off the horse and died.

358
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:19,810
But no one knows

359
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,660
that he ran into his wife’s affair

360
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,760
with Prince Lu,

361
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,190
and was killed by him.

362
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,670
Now,

363
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,280
Zhu Xu’s son commands a strong force.

364
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,950
If this information

365
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:33,990
gets out,

366
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,750
can you imagine the consequence?

367
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:38,980
= Zhu Xu =

368
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,670
A year before his death,
the Yellow River burst the banks.

369
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:53,550
After that,

370
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,870
28 officers were found guilty,

371
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,270
and 36 merchants got beheaded.

372
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,400
But the truth was,

373
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,790
the late emperor embezzled money

374
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,550
for river regulation

375
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,750
to build a resort for himself.

376
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,780
Fifteen years ago,

377
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:20,390
Wei Guang had an affair
with his sister-in-law,

378
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,270
and killed his elder brother.

379
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:24,880
But based on

380
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,830
how Wei Guang treats Wei Shuye,

381
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,030
it’s hard to tell

382
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,380
whether Wei Shuye

383
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,360
is his nephew

384
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,550
or son.

385
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,770
If Wei Guang knows

386
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,350
you have dirt on him,

387
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,460
won’t he silence you?

388
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,780
= Wei Guang =

389
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,060
What I want is the power

390
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,120
to rule the world,

391
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,680
not to get myself killed.

392
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,520
All the dirty secrets

393
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,890
of the noble families,

394
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,410
even sections in the underworld

395
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,610
can be found here.

396
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,350
Now that they’re yours to keep,

397
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,910
are you ready to

398
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,020
battle against the whole world

399
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:13,960
and protect yourself

400
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,920
from constant assassinations?

401
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,060
Let me show you something.

402
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,580
This is the self-destruction device.

403
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,900
Do you know

404
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,390
how many times

405
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,300
I want to destroy it every day?

406
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:51,870
Now, problem solved. I’m free.

407
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,540
It’s all yours.

408
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,610
Once you step into this place,

409
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,590
you will have to

410
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,890
stay in the darkness forever.

411
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,260
Just like me,

412
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,080
you will be trapped

413
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,950
in this cage forever

414
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,500
with no way out.

415
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,230
You are lying!

416
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,700
You didn’t even know

417
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,670
what the Eye of Intel is

418
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,510
before snatching it away from me.

419
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,170
You have no idea of the value

420
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,090
of life.

421
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,750
One more thing.

422
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,430
Do you know
if Yuwen Xi is your grandfather,

423
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,890
or your father?

424
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,170
The answer is also in here.

425
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,420
You are lying!

426
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,950
You are lying! You are lying!

427
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,520
You are lying!

428
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,320
You are lying!

429
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,550
Thank you for walking into this cage

430
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,360
and giving back my freedom.

431
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,150
Take care.

432
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,600
Come back!

433
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:28,720
Come back!

434
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,510
Yuwen Yue.

435
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,270
I won’t be your scapegoat!

436
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,990
Yuwen Yue!

437
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:41,120
Yuwen Yue! Come back!

438
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,390
Go, go, go!

439
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:02,910
Come on!

440
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,830
Put out the fire! Hurry!

441
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:06,880
Come on! Come on! Come on!

442
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,050
Go get water! Put it out!

443
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:10,030
Hurry up!

444
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,160
Don’t bother.

445
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,980
- Just let it be.
- Young Master.

446
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,800
Are you alright?

447
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,100
Come on! Put it out!

448
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,510
Hurry up!

449
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,880
Come on! Come on! Hurry up!

450
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,590
Get more water! Come on!

451
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,470
Go get water!

452
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,270
Stop. Let it burn!

453
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,620
Burn everything down!

454
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,790
Everything!

455
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,250
The Intel Building was on fire?

456
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,870
Did Yuwen Yue set the fire?

457
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:39,220
It’s said that Yuwen Huai

458
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,170
activated the self-destruction device

459
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,410
by accident,

460
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,570
and burnt the Building down.

461
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,270
Looks like

462
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,360
he is intimidated.

463
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,710
I thought

464
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,450
he has guts.

465
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,410
And the Eye of Intel?

466
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,660
Hold it off for now.

467
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,040
Aye.

468
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,010
By the way,

469
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,750
transfer Yan Xun

470
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,720
from prison to the Oriole Courtyard.

471
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,000
Aye.

472
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,200
You may leave.

473
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,520
As long as Yan Xun is alive,

474
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,130
he poses a threat to me.

475
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,720
But once he dies,

476
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,950
those noble families
will seize the opportunity

477
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,560
to carve up Yanbei,

478
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,620
and shake my reign,

479
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,790
leading to greater harm.

480
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,140
Please, sir.

481
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,820
Please.

482
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,680
An edict for Yan Xun.

483
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,510
Listen to the edict on your knees.

484
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,560
Sir,

485
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,800
His Excellency Yan is badly injured

486
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,950
which might’ve affected his hearing.

487
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:20,020
The imperial edict is as follows:

488
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,080
Yan Xun, son of the traitor, Yan Shicheng,

489
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,750
is young with a misdemeanor,

490
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,730
thus shall be confined
in the Oriole Courtyard

491
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,780
to reflect on himself

492
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,190
and serve the state in the future.

493
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,280
Once the three-year confinement is met,

494
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,360
he can go back and reign Yanbei.

495
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,360
The end.

496
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:51,420
= Imperial Prison =

497
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:26,620
= ﻿Oriole Courtyard =

498
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,380
= ﻿Oriole Courtyard =

499
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:17,960
Your Excellency.

500
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,470
How many guards are outside?

501
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,630
80 visible ones

502
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,590
and more in the dark.

503
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,600
They have surrounded

504
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,440
this place

505
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,150
very tight.

506
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:49,360
On the way here,

507
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,970
most of the pedestrians

508
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:52,180
are male.

509
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,430
They’re fighters

510
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,690
or employed by the government.

511
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,910
There are only a few shops

512
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:58,580
in which buyers aren’t into shopping

513
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,100
and sellers never smile.

514
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,910
It looks like they have bought out

515
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,090
all dwellings and shops

516
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,240
in this neighborhood.

517
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:07,260
Yanbei is leaderless.

518
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:08,920
All eyes are on it.

519
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,340
With you around, they can’t do anything.

520
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,590
But once you’re gone,

521
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:14,960
they’ll carve up

522
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,950
the entire land.

523
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:17,960
I bet

524
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,510
no one wants you

525
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,860
to live till the confinement ends.

526
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,310
Emperor’s attitude is unclear.

527
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,920
He hasn’t decided

528
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,120
whether to kill you or not.

529
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,780
But once he comes round

530
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,310
and issues the edict to pardon you,

531
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,270
it won’t be easy for them

532
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:35,830
to kill you

533
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,400
and justify their action.

534
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:44,430
Marquis was tricked

535
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,480
into leaving Yanbei
with few men and was killed,

536
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,600
but the foundation he laid is unaffected.

537
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,890
We still have our own army.

538
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,430
All people there are loyal as before.

539
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,860
Once our people arrive,

540
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,070
you will be safer.

541
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,390
We know this.

542
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,820
So do they.

543
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,930
Now is their best chance

544
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,180
to take action.

545
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:12,260
The problem is who will act first.

546
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,970
That doesn’t matter

547
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,860
to us, though.

548
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,770
We’ll finish whoever it is.

549
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:27,760
You are still up?

550
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,560
This place is way too big

551
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,800
for the three of us.

552
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,640
Looks like His Majesty spent a fortune

553
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,090
to imprison us without being known.

554
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,840
Achu.

555
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:47,930
How did you escape

556
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:49,060
from Yuwen Huai?

557
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,470
Zhong Yu saved me.

558
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,060
Yuwen Huai took me

559
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,100
to the Guilty-slave Chamber.

560
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,620
In order to protect himself,

561
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,260
Yuwen Yue tried to kill me

562
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,680
before Yuwen Huai.

563
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,170
But he didn’t know

564
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,420
I was still alive.

565
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,140
When they were about to cremate me,

566
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,610
Zhong Yu arrived

567
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:16,350
and saved me.

568
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,100
Yuwen Yue?

569
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:30,730
Young Master.

570
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,190
You may leave.

571
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:34,910
Aye.

572
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,200
Caiwei, what brings you here?

573
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,290
Did anything happen to

574
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:46,360
Princess?

575
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:47,820
No.

576
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,870
Young Master Wei,

577
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,880
Princess has a message for you.

578
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,240
What is it?

579
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,300
It’s about His Excellency Yan.

580
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:00,120
His Excellency Yan

581
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,000
is in a tough situation right now.

582
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,690
Princess is worried about him.

583
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,350
So

584
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:07,820
she sent me to tell you

585
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,600
to keep an eye on him.

586
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,700
If anything happens,

587
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,160
please let her know immediately.

588
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,310
Noble Consort won’t be happy

589
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:17,520
about Princess’s involvement in this.

590
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,570
That’s why we came to you for help.

591
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:20,540
She said

592
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,580
you’d definitely help her.

593
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,690
Even if

594
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,030
she receives any information,

595
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,480
she won’t be able to stop it.

596
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,600
Besides, she’s in the Palace

597
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,260
and can’t come out easily.

598
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,330
I am afraid

599
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,100
when the news reaches her ears,

600
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,500
it is too late already.

601
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,160
Princess also said

602
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,130
if you can’t

603
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,280
inform us in time,

604
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,730
just go to Qingshan House

605
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:48,820
and notify Young Master Yue.

606
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,730
Yuwen Yue?

607
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:52,630
That’s right. She said

608
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,280
when it comes to His Excellency Yan Xun,

609
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,990
Young Master Yue is still trustworthy.

610
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,020
= Pine Hall =

611
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,740
I have

612
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,810
made the bed on the floor.

613
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:22,910
I’ll sleep here.

614
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:24,510
You take the bed.

615
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,140
No.

616
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,500
Why not?

617
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:28,820
You are…

618
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,300
What?

619
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,050
The prince?

620
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,150
I am just a dead man walking.

621
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,950
It’s good enough

622
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,790
to have a place to sleep.

623
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,320
How about this?

624
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,920
We can’t both

625
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,180
fall asleep anyway.

626
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,860
I’ll take the first shift,

627
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,390
and you the second.

628
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:58,360
Whoever is on guard can stay here.

629
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,380
Achu.

630
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,710
Say no more.

631
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,790
Otherwise, neither of us can sleep.

632
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,670
You should go to bed now.

633
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,270
The next shift is yours.

Yan Xun.

672
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,950
We survived.

673
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,800
We both did.

674
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:07,170
Young Master,
Hongshan House is on the move.

How many are they?

676
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:11,730
About ten.

677
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,630
All highly skilled martial artists.

678
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:16,160
Stop them.

679
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:17,640
Can we interfere

680
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,610
directly?

681
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:20,280
Don’t worry.

682
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:22,680
Even if we kill them all,

683
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:24,180
do they dare to make a noise?

684
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,000
