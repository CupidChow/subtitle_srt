Young Master.

19
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,380
I’m so sorry that I let you down.

20
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,680
You’re slow and clumsy.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,900
You can’t complete

22
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,750
any of my tasks.

23
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,870
When you’re out there,

24
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,570
don’t tell others you’re my disciple.

25
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,240
There was somebody

26
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,260
who sneaked up on you.

27
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,790
You held me back.

28
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,280
What? Are you talking back to me?

29
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,930
If so,

30
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,840
why didn’t you kill me in the cave?

31
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,320
I wanted to, but I dared not.

32
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,400
Dared not?

33
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,000
I don’t think so.

34
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,260
As the spy of the Eye of Intel,

35
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,600
the worst thing is to act without permission.

36
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,060
Once you acquired information

37
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,020
about the spies of Liang,

38
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,500
you should’ve reported it to me,

39
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,470
and waited for my order.

40
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,410
There wasn’t enough time

41
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,430
for me to report.

42
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,550
You followed me there first.

43
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,060
Alright.

44
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,640
You’re injured. Go back and rest.

45
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,050
If you have anything to report,

46
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,080
wait until I get back

47
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,150
to the House.

48
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,310
Aye.

49
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,710
Young Master is here!

50
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,650
Young Master.

51
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,390
Where is Yueqi?

52
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,330
We found the trace of those spies.

53
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,060
Yueqi and our men

54
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,480
tracked them down to Hongshan House.

55
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,460
Hongshan House...

56
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,630
Head to Hongshan House now.

57
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,570
Aye.

58
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,690
Young Master, let me go with them.

59
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,230
Didn’t you hear what I just said?

60
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,560
Go back and rest.

61
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,370
Enjoy your dishes.

62
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,860

“A dreamlike bubble”.

00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,700
= A dreamlike bubble =

67
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,570
Xiaoliu, how are you feeling?

68
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,560
I’m fine, don’t worry.

69
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,610
Xing’er.

70
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,490
Young Master asked me to bring you these herbs.

71
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,740
They can heal your wounds.

72
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,870
Xiaoliu.

73
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,680
They are pricy.

74
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,360
Young Master cares so much about you.

75
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,420
She’s one lucky girl.

76
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,010
Unlike me, no one cares about me.

77
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,240
Xiaoba.

78
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,560
This ointment can remove your scar.

79
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,990
It’s from Young Master as well.

80
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,070
Young Master gives me medicine, too.

81
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,390
Please convey my gratitude to him.

82
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,000
I’m off.

83
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,730
I have no idea that Young Master Yue

84
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,140
has such great power.

85
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,250
How come he knows everything?

86
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,720
It’s good, though.

87
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,780
You two

88
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,040
can recover soon.

89
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,550
Xiaoliu,

90
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,830
I’m going to decoct herbs for you.

91
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,820
I’m going to

92
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,340
try my ointment, too.

93
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,550
Chu Qiao.

94
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,510
My name is Chu Qiao.

95
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,090
I’m indeed not a Jing.

96
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,850
Luo He.

97
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,460
My mother.

98
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,100
Who killed her?

99
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:08,840
Young Master.

100
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,720
How come grandfather collapsed suddenly?

101
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:12,800
Master found out

102
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,000
you went to rescue Xing’er.

103
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,380
He was so furious that he fell sick.

104
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,430
Who told him that?

105
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:23,930
Young Master.

106
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,150
Master said

107
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,400
he didn’t want to see anyone.

108
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,420
Open the door.

109
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,060
The...

110
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,580
The Eye of Intel

111
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,500
can’t be destroyed in my hands.

112
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,940
The Eye of Intel…

113
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,270
The Eye of Intel

114
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,790
can’t be destroyed in my hands.

115
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,800
The Eye of Intel

116
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,700
can’t be destroyed in my hands.

117
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,930
Zhao, Qian, Sun, Li,

118
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,150
Zhou, Wu, Zheng, Wang,

119
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,590
come home for lunch!

120
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,590
You do nothing but fooling around.

121
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,780
Zuo Baocang,

122
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,460
are you turning a blind eye

123
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,150
to your old friend?

124
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,630
Dongfang Ji.

125
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,780
You are really at leisure, Zuo Baocang.

126
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,960
Why are you here?

127
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:44,880
What a jinx!

128
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,160
Every time I see you,

129
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,310
nothing good happens.

130
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,580
Why didn’t you stay at Yanbei
to assist Marquis Dingbei,

131
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,790
but came to Chang’an alone?

132
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,420
I’m sick of that place,

133
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,560
so I left for some sightseeing.

134
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,870
Sightseeing?

135
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,080
I still remember vividly

136
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,740
that after your last sightseeing,

137
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,970
Luo He was assassinated.

138
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,930
Are you back to

139
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,860
help His Excellency Yan to escape?

140
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,550
I suggest you stay out of it.

141
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,700
Or, someone else will die.

142
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,070
You’ve got me wrong.

143
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:20,690
Wrong?

144
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,910
I’m never wrong about you.

145
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,900
If I could choose,

146
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,080
I would choose

147
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,600
not to know you at all.

148
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,670
Really?

149
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,080
Without me,

150
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,750
you would’ve been long gone.

151
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,020
How could you

152
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,160
dwell here for so many years?

153
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,990
So who did you offend this time?

154
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,370
Your store

155
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,100
has been completely shattered.

156
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,500
So?

157
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,730
How does it concern you?

158
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,570
Just get to the point.

159
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,190
How about the person

160
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,400
I asked you to find?

161
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,960
I have got something.

162
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,350
Let me see.

163
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:34,570
Good. Very well.

164
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,690
I’ve found a young lady

165
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,220
who’s carrying

166
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,350
the wood bead with her

167
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,490
that you made

168
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,210
and used to be worn by Luo He.

169
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,330
How old is she?

170
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,600
16 or 17 years old.

171
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,440
Did you check her out?

172
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,340
Yes.

173
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,650
But too bad,

174
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,600
she has a memory loss.

175
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,560
So she doesn’t remember

176
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,730
what happened before.

177
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,750
What a shame!

178
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,920
Memory loss?

179
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,260
How skilled is she?

180
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,440
No inner power.

181
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,230
Her style of kung fu is different from yours.

182
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,570
Did she

183
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,470
hide that on purpose?

184
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,240
Do you really think a young lady

185
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,530
can hide that when she was between life and death?

186
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,400
Where is she right now?

187
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,740
Where is she?

188
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,830
Do you think

189
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,120
I will tell you that now?

190
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,190
Will she still be alive

191
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,790
if I tell you?

192
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:43,970
Rest assured.

193
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,660
You have my word.

194
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,070
I will get to the bottom

195
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,310
for you.

196
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,810
If she is really the little killer

197
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,800
who assassinated Luo He,

198
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,830
I will certainly

199
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,640
give her to you.

200
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,160
If she is not…

201
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,870
If she is not,

202
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,520
what will you do?

203
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,630
If she is not,

204
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,140
I will protect her with my life.

205
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,150
Zhong Yu.

206
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,350
What brings you here?

207
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,230
Marquis sent me here

208
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,290
to pick you up.

209
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,070
What happened?

210
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,210
To my son Yan Xun.

211
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,580
We’ve parted for years. I miss you so much.

212
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,790
I’m old and sick and looking forward to your return.

213
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,490
I am aware that you’re held as a hostage

214
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:57,980
and if you leave Chang’an openly,

215
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,640
it will definitely set Emperor off.

216
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,290
So I’m sending Zhong Yu

217
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,710
to help you come home secretly

218
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,470
so that we can finally reunite.

219
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,220
Father wants me to go back with you?

220
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,720
I know it came all too sudden

221
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,380
but please try to understand

222
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,620
your father’s yearning

223
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,950
and work with me.

224
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,030
What’s he thinking?

225
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,600
I’m a hostage.

226
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,510
Leaving the capital without permission is a felony.

227
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,080
If I go back,

228
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,160
Emperor will condemn

229
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,270
the entire Yanbei.

230
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,420
Then will father chain me up

231
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,510
and send me back to Chang’an

232
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,770
or wage a war against it?

233
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,800
Your Excellency,

234
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,370
I’m afraid that the Emperor of Wei

235
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,140
will accuse your father

236
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,950
of treason

237
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,720
even if you don’t leave.

238
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,950
Things have come to that stage?

239
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,370
So far, everything is fine.

240
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,340
As long as Marquis still controls the army,

241
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,740
his safety is guaranteed.

242
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,860
But if you are held by His Majesty,

243
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,140
however influential Marquis is,

244
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,580
his life will still be in others’ hands.

245
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,640
Only if you’re back to Yanbei

246
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,400
will Marquis be spared from any concerns,

247
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,520
then he can attack or defend as he wishes.

248
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,780
Besides,

249
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,900
if His Majesty has nothing

250
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,550
on Marquis,

251
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,290
he will start to be discreet.

252
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,260
Your Excellency, time is running out.

253
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,310
Please make the decision as soon as possible.

254
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,660
I’m going back with you,

255
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,690
plus someone else.

256
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,580
Who is it?

257
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,980
A girl.

258
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,460
I have promised her that.

259
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,740
Give me a few more days.

260
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,080
She will leave with me.

261
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,870
Your Excellency,

262
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,460
you’re monitored by spies,

263
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,760
and your mansion is under surveillance.

264
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,460
We need a thorough exit plan.

265
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,020
If anything leaks,

266
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,080
there will be

267
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,400
dire consequences.

268
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,840
Don’t worry.

269
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,710
She is just an ordinary girl,

270
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,110
and won’t leak anything.

271
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,530
Besides,

272
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,080
everyone knows

273
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,370
that I will go back to Yanbei

274
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,700
after celebrating Princess Chun’s coming-of-age.

275
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:58,960
Now, we’re simply

276
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,220
moving that up a little bit.

277
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,630
If so,

278
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,730
I will arrange everything soon.

279
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,600
Please let your father know

280
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,890
so that he can feel at ease.

281
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,740
= Dear father =

282
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:24,660
This is urgent.

283
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,020
Deliver it as soon as possible.

284
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,080
Yes, Your Excellency.

285
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,880
I will send it out at once.

286
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,200
Sir,

287
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,070
just now, I saw a person from Liang

288
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,050
outside His Excellency Yan’s mansion

289
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,650
who swapped his letter.

290
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,990
It all goes as you expected.

291
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,430
Next,

292
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,090
it all depends on you.

293
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,470
I’m going back to Yanbei

294
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,460
to hand this letter

295
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,060
to Yan Shicheng myself.

296
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,410
All these weapons are well-honed.

297
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,250
Every one of them

298
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,500
is sharp enough to kill Yuwen Xi.

299
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,560
Young Master, here is Marquis Dingbei’s letter

300
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,980
to his son.

301
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,110
When you were stealing the letter,

302
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,800
did Yan Xun suspect anything?

303
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,210
He noticed nothing.

304
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,100
Why did they steal the letter?

305
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,570
If His Majesty sees this letter,

306
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,460
Yanbei will get into

307
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,270
serious trouble.

308
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,630
I’m changing it into a normal family letter

309
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,780
for His Majesty to review.

310
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,560
Hope this can protect Yanbei from disasters.

311
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:55,910
Hand in this letter

312
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,270
to His Majesty right now.

313
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:58,990
Aye.

314
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:26,180
Sir, Master needs you for urgent matters.

315
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,220
Let’s go.

316
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,390
Why did Yuwen Yue

317
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,550
swap Yan Xun’s family letter?

318
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,830
Young Master, today’s training

319
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,940
seems different.

320
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,080
How different?

321
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,770
Guess I

322
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,300
can finally learn

323
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,840
actual combat skills.

324
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,360
You seem overeager.

325
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:26,750
In the latest battle

326
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,500
against the spies from Liang,

327
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,590
hadn’t you

328
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,060
come to save me...

329
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,070
I know my skills are lacking

330
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,960
so I want to learn more.

331
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,710
A girl like you

332
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,800
is surprisingly competitive.

333
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,300
That’s because I’m a spy.

334
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,710
If I’m not capable enough,

335
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,040
won’t that make you

336
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,190
embarrassed?

337
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,130
You’ve become bolder.

338
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,470
It’s just that I can start to

339
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,070
pour my heart to you.

340
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,830
Don’t you want a heart-to-heart?

341
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,700
Take your heart back.

342
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,830
I don’t want it.

343
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,830
That’s a wise decision.

344
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,000
All right.

345
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,230
I’m going to teach you

346
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,640
how to kill a man secretly

347
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,300
from afar.

348
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,450
This is a crossbow that can be folded.

349
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,380
It is portable,

350
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,200
light and fast.

351
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,710
It can fire six consecutive arrows

352
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,220
in a flash.

353
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,170
It is invincible.

354
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,260
The crossbow is yours now.

355
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,980
Six consecutive arrows?

356
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,320
What if the target is still alive

357
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,090
after that?

358
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,030
What should I do then?

359
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,000
That means

360
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,360
you are against a top master.

361
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,450
Have you ever heard about the Ice Arrow?

362
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,230
Ice Arrow?

363
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,000
Isn’t it just yours?

364
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,980
Any weapon can be held by anyone.

365
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,230
The point is

366
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:40,850
if you can control it.

367
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,820
To control the Ice Arrow,

368
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,890
your body and hand

369
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,290
cannot go wrong.

370
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,670
It’s not like any other arrows.

371
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,060

The Ice Arrow is made of cold ice.

390
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,260
Once fired,

391
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,320
the body will melt.

It takes lives without trace

396
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,590

Your Grace, I didn’t know you’d come.

404
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,810
I apologize for my rudeness.

405
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,730
I heard that you’re back,

406
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,610
so I came to visit you.

407
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,710
Thank you, Your Grace.

408
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,400
How did it go?

409
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,570
Is everything alright?

410
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:34,880
All is well.

411
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,750
To be honest,

412
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,430
I need a favor.

413
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,320
This is a letter.

414
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,720
Have a look at it.

415
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,920
Do you think

416
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,090
it was Xun who wrote it?

417
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,030
Liang people did it.

418
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,180
Liang people?

419
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,530
Exactly.

420
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:17,710
In Chang’an, I saw them

421
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,470
switch His Excellency’s letter.

422
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,960
They’re trying to lure you to the capital

423
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,100
and have Emperor

424
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,680
kill you

425
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:30,010
so that Yanbei and Wei will go to war.

426
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,250
But His Excellency saw through

427
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,890
those spies’ tricks

428
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,910
and asked me to bring another letter to you.

429
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,680
Xun

430
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,980
wrote another letter to me?

431
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,430
Here it is.

432
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:03,060
= Father =

433
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,240
What’s wrong, Your Grace?

434
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,700
I’m afraid

435
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,990
something must’ve happened on Xun.

436
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,210
How come?

437
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,050
In this letter, Xun was worried about my back pain,

438
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,650
and he said

439
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,710
he had found a highly-skilled physician,

440
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:30,220
and would soon send him to Yanbei

441
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,450
to treat me.

442
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:35,160
That’s the secret code

443
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,200
we made.

444
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,800
It means that

445
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,940
Xun’s life is at stake,

446
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,440
and he desperately needs help.

447
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,280
How did that happen?

448
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,070
Those people

449
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,150
have gone too far!

450
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,070
I’m leaving for Chang’an

451
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,710
right now.

452
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,670
That’s a bad idea, Your Grace.

453
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:11,070
As long as I have Emperor’s permission in advance,

454
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,630
and go there aboveboard,

455
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:18,670
what can they do about me?

456
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,620
In my opinion,

457
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,200
if we’re really going,

458
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,750
we must be well-prepared.

459
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,190
Gather the troops in case of emergencies.

460
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,270
In Chang’an,

461
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,510
if Emperor wants to kill me,

462
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,400
I will have no chance to survive.

463
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,300
All right.

464
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:46,100
No more hiding.

465
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,700
I’ve had enough!

466
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,890
I’m going to write an application now.

467
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,840
Have it sent to Chang’an

468
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,420
for Emperor to review.

469
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,940
Tell him,

470
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,860
I, Yan Shicheng, am coming.

471
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,390
If he wants to kill me,

472
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,160
then do it.

473
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,500
But,

474
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,670
stay away from my son.

475
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,920
Sir,

476
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,210
I am lucky

477
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,960
to have you by my side.

478
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,780
I trust you the most.

479
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,010
Your Grace,

480
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:43,420
Emperor has way crossed the line.

481
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:46,190
Even so, you aren’t going to

482
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,690
replace him?

483
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:53,030
I have said it a million times.

484
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,880
In my lifetime,

485
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,480
I can hide from him

486
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,270
or be offhand with him,

487
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,330
but under no circumstances

488
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:06,100
will I ever rebel against him.

489
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,480
I am making preparations now.

490
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,330
You are incompetent!

491
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,820
You don’t deserve the throne.

492
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:23,480
Help! Help!

493
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,290
- Your Majesty.
- Help!

494
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,220
Help!

495
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,150
Your Majesty.

496
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,550
Darling, darling.

497
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,370
Your Majesty.

498
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,160
Look at me.

499
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,900
Is my head still on my neck?

500
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,200
You’re worrying about nothing.

501
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,070
It’s just a dream. It’s not real.

502
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,780
It’s horrible!

503
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,930
I dreamed that

504
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,220
Yan Shicheng cut off my head,

505
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,000
and hung it on the wall of Yanbei.

506
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,620
You’re safe, Your Majesty.

507
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,000
Forget about it.

508
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,780
Put down the ginseng soup and leave.

509
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:58,960
Aye.

510
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,770
There, there, Your Majesty.

511
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,140
Everything is fine.

512
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,570
Yan Shicheng dares not hurt you.

513
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,020
I

514
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,650
must kill him.

515
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:26,980
He must be wiped out.

516
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:29,510
Fine. Even if he’s disloyal

517
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,580
in a dream,

518
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,930
he is unforgivable.

519
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:32,780
No.

520
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,280
I want evidence.

521
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,590
Solid proof of his rebellion.

522
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,960
Go

523
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:41,770
ask Yuwen Yue

524
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,380
and Yuwen Huai to find it.

525
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,350
Have them gather the evidence.

526
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:44,620
Yes.

527
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,790
Find it.

528
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,090
All right, Your Majesty,

529
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,170
I’m here to help you.

530
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:50,110
I am going to tell them now.

531
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,350
Report!

532
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:53,130
Your Majesty.

533
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,980
A confidential letter from Yuwen Yue.

534
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,620
A family letter?

535
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:06,490
What do I need it for?

536
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,110
Find out

537
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,710
what Yuwen Huai is doing.

538
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:17,530
Aye.

539
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,430
Sir, this must be Marquis’ letter

540
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:35,930
to Emperor.

541
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,740
It requires immediate delivery, right?

542
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:41,670
Jiang He,

543
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:45,460
if a man has no dreams,

544
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,730
how is he different from an animal?

545
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,670
Master said that I’m too crooked

546
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:55,170
to study the art of assisting Emperor.

547
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,780
But I have dexterous hands.

548
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,270
My hands

549
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,000
could make me

550
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,680
a legendary handicraftsman.

551
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,350
But I deserve

552
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,640
more than that.

553
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:12,450
Sir, I think you can…

554
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,820
Ten years.

555
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,600
It took me ten years.

556
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,860
Yan Shicheng

557
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,120
is not the person that I’ve been looking for.

558
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,970
Jiang He,

559
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:39,060
go pack up.

560
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:40,520
Yanbei

561
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,760
is not our destination.

562
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,300
Every weapon

563
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,970
has its advantages

564
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,200
and disadvantages.

565
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,000
According to the battle where you fight,

566
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:02,710
choose the right weapon.

567
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:10,750
If the weapon

568
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,400
is used in the wrong way,

569
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,880
its power

570
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,200
can’t be fully unleashed.

571
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:18,840
Young Master,

572
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,070
in some special circumstances

573
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,160
when I have no weapons,

574
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,950
what should I do to finish the job?

575
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,030
Who says

576
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,450
only weapons can kill?

577
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,110
That depends on

578
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,840
how flexible you are.

579
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:38,740
Now,

580
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,860
I am going to teach you

581
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,820
necessary skills

582
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,780
to deliver letters.

583
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:46,210
Follow me.

584
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,600
What does it say?

585
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,380
All confidential letters

586
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,520
must be processed in a special way.

587
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,060
Or the message would be leaked.

588
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,630
This

589
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:15,990
is the Developing Powder.

590
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,290
The other

591
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,000
is the Disappearing Powder.

592
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,920
These two bottles of powder

593
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,190
are yours now.

594
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,740
You’re going to need them someday.

595
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,560
Thank you very much.

596
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,880
Xiaoqi, have you done yet?

597
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,310
Yes, yes.

598
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,220
Didn’t the butler ask us

599
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,520
to clean the front hall.

600
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,260
Just one second.

601
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,760
What is Xiaoliu doing

602
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,170
these days?

603
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,510
She is mysterious,

604
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,170
and seldom seen.

605
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:10,010
Xiaoliu, there you are.

606
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:10,670
Are you hungry?

607
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,000
I prepared food for you.

608
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,560
I am not hungry, just a little tired.

609
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,520
All right.

610
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,400
She’s incredible.

611
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,200
What could possibly happen to her?

612
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,220
But if we’re late for the cleaning,

613
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,170
something bad will happen to us.

614
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:19,530
Let’s go. Come on.

615
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,830
Xiaoliu, don’t forget to eat them.

616
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,360
If you’re in danger,

617
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:37,050
go to Yanbei to find Mr. Wu.

618
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,200
He will protect you

619
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,370
and answer your questions.

620
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,650
Yanbei?

621
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:22,960
Young Master.

622
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:24,680
Young Master.

623
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:27,220
Young...

624
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:31,170
It’s weird.

625
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:32,830
Where’s Yueqi?

626
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:53,860
Master.

627
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:56,140
You asked to see me on short notice.

628
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:57,640
Do you have urgent tasks for me?

629
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,960
How come

630
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,230
spies from Liang got away with it?

631
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,370
I failed in my duty.

632
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:07,410
Yuwen Zhuo is still alive.

633
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:11,140
I faked my own death

634
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,860
to fool others outside,

635
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,540
but it doesn’t mean

636
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,230
I give up on

637
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,830
the Eye of Intel.

638
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,870
No negligence is allowed

639
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,640
in future actions.

640
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:25,620
I understand.

641
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,200
Please forgive me.

642
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:31,640
What is Yue

643
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,440
going to do next?

644
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,520
Young Master

645
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,540
is having men

646
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,850
track down those spies in the city.

647
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:36,960
Meanwhile,

648
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,050
he’s assigned the best hidden spies

649
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,160
of the Eye of Intel

650
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,520
to watch Yuwen Huai.

651
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:42,440
Young Master hopes to find

652
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,230
the evidence that Yuwen Huai is colluding with

653
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,430
the spies from Liang.

654
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,900
Good. Once something turns up,

655
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,650
just stick to the original plan

656
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,490
and plant Xing’er as a perdue.

657
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,200
Perdue?

658
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,560
Once this mission is over

659
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,980
I’ll send her to Liang to work undercover

660
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,920
at all costs.

661
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,270
Master,

662
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:12,570
isn’t that a suicide mission?

663
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:15,000
Yue is training her

664
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,520
to become

665
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,960
the sharpest weapon

666
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,170
to finish the target when necessary.

667
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:30,610
