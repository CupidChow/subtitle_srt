Greetings, Prince.

Here comes the bad guy! Here comes the bad guy!

Say it again!

Your Highness.

23
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,800
Young Master is taking a noon break.

24
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,190
Please allow me to report.

25
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,470
Noon break?

26
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,680
Good.

27
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,320
No bother reporting.

28
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:30,890
Move away.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,570
Aye.

30
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,750
Yuwen Yue.

31
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,390
Yan Xun.

32
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,140
Are you a monkey?

33
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,430
I just stained

34
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,380
your quilt.

35
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,590
Not a big deal.

36
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,680
You may ask Xing’er

37
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,890
to wash it by the river.

38
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:40,710
Xing’er.

39
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,940
That’s what you’re talking about, right?

40
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:46,920
By the way,

41
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,040
where have you hidden

42
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,920
Wild Kitten?

43
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,820
None of your business.

44
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,540
I’m just afraid that

45
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,530
her claws

46
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,500
become blunt under your torture.

47
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,690
Aren’t you afraid

48
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,390
to be disfigured by her claws?

49
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,080
Of course I’m not.

50
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,700
But you should be careful.

51
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,730
Young Master. It’s been six hours.

52
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,520
Your guest is still here.

53
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,070
Young Master.

54
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,610
Have I got through the test?

55
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,360
You think you’ve got through it?

56
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,020
It’s just the second pass.

57
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,320
Now start eight leopard heads.

58
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:44,680
Yueqi.

59
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:46,840
Show her.

60
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,660
Now you might have seen it clearly.

61
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,600
If you make it through,

62
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,720
ring the doorbell and get out.

63
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,530
Or you can’t go to rest

64
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,520
until midnight.

65
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,670
Xiaoqi. Xiaoba.

66
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,480
Help!

67
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:39,520
What’s wrong?

68
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,340
Xiaoliu.

69
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,170
What’s wrong, Xiaoliu?

70
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:45,520
Slowly.

71
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,740
Jinzhu.

72
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,790
How come Young Master allows her

73
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,410
to share a room with us?

74
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,830
Listen up.

75
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,560
This low maid offended me.

76
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,710
Young Master punished her in person.

77
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,590
You guys

78
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,720
move her here.

79
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,400
No. No. No.

80
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,580
Well...

81
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,790
Jinzhu.

82
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,180
The hinge of that window is broken.

83
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,650
The wind will blow in at night.

84
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,670
It’ll be very cold.

85
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,760
That’s great.

86
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,920
She bedded with Young Master just for one day

87
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,870
and was driven back to maids’ room.

88
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,430
The wind can sober her up.

89
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,040
My sister is injured.

90
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,300
She can’t bear the draught.

91
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,000
You’re talking too much.

92
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,210
- That’s ridiculous.
- Yeah.

93
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,820
She was beaten so hard.

94
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,570
It’s so miserable.

95
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,360
What are you doing? Be gentle.

96
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,910
Go to bed. Go.

97
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,110
That Yuwen Yue

98
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,020
is unreasonable.

99
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,320
He hurt Xiaoliu like this.

100
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,620
The Yuwens

101
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,080
are all so evil.

102
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,800
It doesn’t make sense.

103
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,920
A guilty maid

104
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,790
should be either whipped

105
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,280
or sent to the Guilty-slave Chamber.

106
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:20,770
How come a master

107
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,980
tortured her in person to the midnight?

108
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,350
This is...

109
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:38,650
Come. Come.

110
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,200
Come here.

111
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,170
Listen.

112
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,920
We must take good care of Xiaoliu.

113
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,280
Perhaps

114
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,680
our future and lives

115
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,020
can be counted on her.

116
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,430
What do you mean?

117
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,880
You won’t understand.

118
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,290
Also,

119
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,140
remember not to

120
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,200
take out

121
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,400
that wooden ball ever again.

122
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,880
Understand?

123
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,020
Girl. Keep this in mind.

124
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,840
You only have yourself

125
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,940
to rely on.

126
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,240
Get yourself up when you fall.

127
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,330
To stop the flow, get the source cut off.

128
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,300
Should this count?

129
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,730
Why not?

130
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,220
Young Master said

131
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,310
as long as I could get the eight heads done,

132
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,680
I could ring the bell and get out.

133
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,120
I’ve got them done.

134
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,810
Young Master

135
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,230
is training your speed,

136
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,500
not your tricks.

137
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,250
I’ve got the knack

138
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,170
dealing with arrows

139
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,110
from eight directions.

140
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,850
Young Master.

141
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,680
It took me a whole year

142
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,240
to master this skill.

143
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,430
Wonderful!

144
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,390
Now your eyes are sharp

145
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,510
and hands are quick.

146
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,640
You know what it is but not the reason behind.

147
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,230
I know what my wrongdoing is.

148
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,060
The punishment will go on tomorrow.

149
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,730
Order from Young Master.

150
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,020
You can’t rest until three hours later.

151
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,030
Is this the last pass?

152
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,680
Get up.

153
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,050
I stood well just now.

154
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,700
You hit me with date

155
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,650
and I fell down.

156
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,860
Ridiculous.

157
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,120
Don’t come down.

158
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,500
Sword.

159
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,570
You’re so weak. Why are you still showing off?

160
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,570
I knew you wouldn’t amount to anything.

161
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,470
I’ll only show you once.

162
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,010
Look carefully.

163
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,070
I’ll hold on.

164
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,210
Hold on.

165
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,650
So weak.

166
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,600
Xiaoqi! Xiaoba!

167
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,870
Give me a hand!

168
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,020
Hurry up.

169
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,350
Hurry!

170
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,500
Xiaoliu.

171
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,840
What’s wrong? Are you alright?

172
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,890
How come Young Master Yue tortured her

173
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,090
so badly again?

174
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,760
Butler Zhu.

175
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,670
Any news recently?

176
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,290
Young Master Yue

177
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,040
is training that slut Xing’er secretly

178
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,880
in the name of punishment.

179
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:22,130
I don’t know the catch.

180
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,130
So Yuwen Yue

181
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,420
is putting that maid into use?

182
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,260
Definitely.

183
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,460
I see.

184
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:37,330
I’m gonna think about it.

185
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,010
I think that Xing’er

186
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:39,930
will be a big trouble to us

187
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:40,980
sooner or later.

188
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,950
We might as well kill her

189
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,450
before she gets strong.

190
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,480
Look for a chance

191
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,120
to try her capability out.

192
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,580
I’m at your disposal, Butler Zhu.

193
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,530
Xiaoliu.

194
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,380
That Jinzhu is so arrogant.

195
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,290
Yeah.

196
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,610
Xiaoliu.

197
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,260
We’ve missed you so much these days.

198
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,350
Did she bully you again?

199
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,330
No.

200
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,860
She just talked a lot of dirty words.

201
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,400
Now

202
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,980
I love her talking dirty words.

203
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,730
The more she says,

204
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,960
it means the more jealous she is of us.

205
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,150
The more jealous she is,

206
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,400
the happier I am.

207
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,770
Look at yourselves.

208
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,830
Now you are

209
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,610
just like Jinzhu somewhat.

210
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:22,830
Really?

211
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,270
Xiaoliu is praising us

212
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,750
that we’re like a senior maid.

213
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,440
You’re not like a senior maid.

214
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,120
You’re just

215
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,370
as mean as her.

216
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,720
Are we mean?

217
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,080
Being mean is good.

218
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,730
That way, we won’t be bullied.

219
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,360
You have a point.

220
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:41,690
Come.

221
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,330
What for?

222
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,740
Before the supper,

223
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,900
wash these clothes

224
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,890
and hang them up.

225
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,600
Take them to my room tomorrow morning.

226
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,030
They aren’t Young Master’s clothes, are they?

227
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:52,900
Are you blind?

228
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,450
Of course

229
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,630
they are not.

230
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,820
They are mine.

231
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,350
Yours?

232
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,190
Why should Xiaoliu

233
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,460
wash your clothes?

234
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,270
- Yeah.
- You humble maid!

235
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,420
How dare you talk back?

236
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,180
She really thinks she’s the boss.

237
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,940
Yueqi.

238
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,330
Help!

239
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:41,700
Yueqi!

240
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,420
Yueqi! Help! Yueqi!

241
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,700
Yueqi! Help me!

242
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,810
Get me down!

243
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,290
What a fuss.

244
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,850
What’s the big deal?

245
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,470
Big deal...

246
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,360
Big deal is...

247
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,780
Put me down!

248
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,160
Young Master wants some tea.

249
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,040
No one gets it for him.

250
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,020
Go make tea then.

251
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,110
Aye.

252
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,630
Go.

253
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:14,450
Go.

254
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,040
That’s the story.

255
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,660
Xing’er

256
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,450
can already deal with Jinzhu

257
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,340
very well.

258
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,750
Looks like her hard work

259
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,770
paid off finally.

260
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,440
Is my training

261
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,390
just for her to defend herself?

262
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:26,630
Young Master.

263
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,640
I have to say something.

264
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:30,850
Don’t think it’s strange?

265
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,430
Xing’er is progressing so fast.

266
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,120
It doesn’t make sense.

267
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,840
Unless...

268
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,900
What?

269
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,630
Unless she

270
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,220
has got harsh training since her childhood,

271
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,110
and has honed her skills very well.

272
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:45,650
I’ve asked Yue Guards

273
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,420
to look into her further.

274
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,610
She isn’t a big threat for now.

275
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,960
Xing’er is a sharp blade.

276
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,230
To get her used by Young Master soon,

277
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,270
should we

278
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,060
make it harder for her?

279
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,660
That way, we can test her potential better.

280
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,060
= Qingshan House =

281
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,470
Come here.

282
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:05,630
You...

283
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,000
Get me the scissors.

284
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:25,970
Aye.

285
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,520
Young Master.

286
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,450
Silver bell.

287
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,070
I’ve never seen that.

288
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,350
Yeah.

289
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,280
The silver bell of Xing’er

290
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,970
is much prettier than Jinzhu’s.

291
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,920
Jinzhu.

292
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,260
Empty your room.

293
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,970
It belongs to Xing’er now.

294
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:58,990
No.

295
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,120
I’m sent by Lady Dowager

296
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,000
of the Third Branch.

297
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,340
No one can take my room away.

298
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,170
This is Qingshan House.

299
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:08,830
Miss Xing’er

300
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,010
is Young Master’s personal maid.

301
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:10,820
Jinzhu.

302
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,220
Put yourself in a proper position.

303
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,480
Don’t cross the line.

304
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,310
From now on, only the silver-bell maid

305
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,740
can clean Young Master’s study.

306
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:17,960
Only Miss Xing’er

307
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,040
can access Young Master’s

308
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,660
bedroom.

309
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,800
Understand?

310
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,820
Dismissed.

311
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,250
Go.

312
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,450
That Xing’er

313
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,190
is really something.

314
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,540
She even can get Young Master’s favor.

315
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,250
Exactly.

316
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,050
Stop!

317
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,590
You all hear that?

318
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,600
You should be much kinder to Xing’er

319
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,480
in the future.

320
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:46,850
Aye.

321
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,590
Young Master.

322
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,320
Is this your so called making it harder to her?

323
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,210
I thought you’d

324
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,520
torture Xing’er

325
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,700
to get her number.

326
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,090
Why did you

327
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,960
offer her so many benefits?

328
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,760
For her, the biggest pressure

329
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,930
is to bear the unbearable

330
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:10,680
luck.

331
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:13,140
Let her be admired

332
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,440
and envied.

333
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,000
Coming.

334
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,570
Coming! Coming!

335
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:25,720
Look at her.

336
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,440
She really thinks

337
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,490
she’s awesome.

338
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,950
Who does she think she is?

339
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,730
She’s indeed good

340
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,220
getting Young Master Yue hooked.

341
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,910
Who knows what she had done

342
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,160
behind the scene?

343
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,610
Excuse me.

344
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,670
Where is the honey?

345
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,900
Could you tell me

346
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,820
where the honey is?

347
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,220
Ignore her.

348
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,230
Use this stool.

349
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:20,880
Thanks.

350
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,620
Who did this to the stool?

351
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,460
The cut is so neat.

352
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,370
Obviously it’s cut with knife.

353
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,280
You stay

354
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,330
in this room all day.

355
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,920
I know you know it.

356
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,250
We don’t know it.

357
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,440
We’re so busy every day.

358
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,890
No one notices these things.

359
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:54,810
Alright.

360
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,600
It doesn’t matter.

361
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,080
I won’t look into it.

362
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,560
But I do have

363
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,930
some words to tell you.

364
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,020
Xing’er.

365
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,720
You bed with Young Master Yue

366
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,880
and your status gets higher.

367
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,580
But that stool

368
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,160
was broken by you.

369
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,910
If the butler asks about it,

370
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,810
we’ll report it honestly.

371
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,910
We’re all maids.

372
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,230
No one is nobler

373
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,600
or humbler than others.

374
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,670
I come here just to

375
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:18,680
get my sisters and myself

376
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,510
to survive.

377
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,000
I won’t bully you

378
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,840
for no reason,

379
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,960
but you’d better not mess with me as well.

380
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,710
I won’t tolerate that.

381
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,630
The more women, the more troubles.

382
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,670
Flattering, bullying, playing dirty tricks,

383
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,590
these are common

384
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,730
in the maid room.

385
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,270
But I advise you

386
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,560
it’s hard for everyone

387
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,570
to live in such a noble family.

388
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,500
Rather than scheming against each other,

389
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,650
we’d better take care of

390
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:46,960
each other.

391
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,980
Miss Xing’er. We’re wrong.

392
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,890
You know where the things are

393
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,480
and what role you play.

394
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,400
I know even better.

395
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,560
I’ll serve Young Master Yue by his side

396
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,270
afterwards.

397
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,130
I’ll associate with you a lot.

398
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,330
One for all, and all for one.

399
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,520
I believe

400
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,030
you know it well.

401
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,130
It’s so lively.

402
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,780
Turns out Xing’er is

403
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,030
giving a lecture here.

404
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,200
Miss Jinzhu.

405
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,300
What? You just became the silver-bell maid.

406
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,070
Now you’re lecturing others.

407
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:30,660
I dare not, Miss Jinzhu.

408
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:32,350
It’s just that

409
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,130
I am the personal maid

410
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,070
of Young Master Yue now.

411
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,480
So I come

412
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,760
to greet them.

413
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,910
Good.

414
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,730
They didn’t know the rules

415
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,270
and didn’t prepare you a gift.

416
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,370
It doesn’t matter, anyway.

417
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,170
I’ve prepared one for you.

418
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,870
Generally,

419
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,420
maids like us

420
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,300
cannot eat

421
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,660
such goodies.

422
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:54,330
Oh, right.

423
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,840
You grew up on the grassland.

424
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,730
It’s said you even

425
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,850
took mice as food.

426
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,390
I guess you’ve never

427
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,790
eaten such good cakes.

428
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:05,250
How about taking these back

429
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,040
for your sisters to have a taste?

430
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,430
Take them as my gift.

431
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,460
What?

432
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:17,160
Are you angry?

433
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:19,870
Listen up.

434
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:22,050
Don’t be ungrateful.

435
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,170
Or

436
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,750
should I teach you more rules?

437
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,520
Miss Jinzhu.

438
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,310
Rules should be taught by someone who knows.

439
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,340
I guess

440
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,910
you’re not qualified.

441
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,250
Don’t you think Young Master Yue

442
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,660
will back you up.

443
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,900
Let’s wait and see.

444
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:46,710
Alright.

445
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,030
Prince.

446
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,850
Spring breeze is so enjoyable.

447
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,390
Are you staying

448
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,670
in the room

449
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:07,660
to get mildewed?

450
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,040
Prince.

451
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,790
Are you plotting another prank?

452
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,150
Not a prank.

453
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,290
We’re gonna paint the town

454
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,730
red.

455
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,940
Zhao Xifeng and his father

456
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,180
came back from the river inspection.

457
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,480
They planned to play polo on the hunting ground.

458
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,740
We’ll all go.

459
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,460
But I heard that

460
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:30,890
Yuwen Huai wasn’t invited.

461
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:32,160
Don’t tell others

462
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,570
I told you these.

463
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,710
Zhao and Wei

464
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,380
both prepared

465
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,570
the best food.

466
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,280
I’m telling you.

467
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,880
If you won’t go,

468
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,380
you’ll regret

469
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,190
in the whole spring.

470
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,270
If I go,

471
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,000
you and all the food

472
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,600
will regret.

473
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,100
You mean

474
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,110
you will go?

475
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:58,910
By the way,

476
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,730
you can take Wild Kitten

477
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:01,500
along

478
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,430
and have fun with us.

479
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,150
Take her out

480
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,310
to broaden her horizon

481
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,600
so that you can use her someday.

482
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:11,930
Why?

483
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,850
Why?

484
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,740
She’s just a maid.

485
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,320
You’re so mean.

486
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,700
Alright.

487
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,860
I’ll give my father’s Ferghana horse

488
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,630
to you.

489
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:25,650
I’ll take Xing’er away

490
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:28,300
to cheer for me.

491
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,760
I won’t take her or borrow her to you.

492
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,920
I don’t want the horse.

493
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:37,840
We’re unfamiliar.

494
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,790
Unfamiliar?

495
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,890
You said

496
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,290
unfamiliar?

497
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:46,250
I see you

498
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,630
as my best friend in Chang’an.

499
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:48,850
Unfamiliar?

500
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,050
Unbelievable.

501
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,930
She progresses so fast!

502
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,250
Why are you coming here again?

503
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,960
It’s such a fine day.

504
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,780
And there’s a special scene

505
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,900
in your House.

506
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,010
I don’t wanna miss it.

507
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,660
I’m so sorry.

508
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,450
You’re too slow and clumsy.

509
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:45,990
Why don’t you

510
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,220
wipe my clothes now?

511
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:48,570
Aye.

512
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,870
Seems I still punish you

513
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,130
too little.

514
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:29,390
Young Master. I don’t understand.

515
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,000
Why do you always punish me?

516
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,630
Don’t you?

517
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,320
Because you’re my bedchamber maid.

518
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,020
The stake punishment

519
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,010
is to make you

520
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,480
keep steady and consistent

521
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,740
when carrying water for tea making.

522
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,150
Leaping punishment

523
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,280
is to train your agility

524
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,490
for elegant postures.

525
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:48,090
Stone throwing

526
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,520
is to train your flexibility of eyes and hands,

527
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,190
so that you don’t look stupid

528
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,770
and always get targeted by them.

529
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,230
I understand, Young Master.

530
00:36:58,650 --> 00:36:59,630
What do you understand?

531
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,690
You’re considerate

532
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,240
and very kind to me.

533
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,540
Do you mean it?

534
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,280
Of course I mean it.

535
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,390
I really appreciate it.

536
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,050
Don’t do any tricks to me.

537
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,250
Leave.

538
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:21,490
Aye.

539
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,220
It’s been three days.

540
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,480
When will you move away?

541
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,360
I’m waiting here

542
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,720
to help you tidy up.

543
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,330
What’s this?

544
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,130
That’s not mine.

545
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,590
How could I know it?

546
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,450
You think I don’t know it?

547
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,470
An obscene carving.

548
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,870
Who knew

549
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:08,110
you, a humble slave,

550
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,830
intend to cheat on Young Master.

551
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,240
How do you prove that

552
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,280
it’s my stuff?

553
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,350
I found it from your bag.

554
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:19,830
Also,

555
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,910
only obscene people

556
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:23,520
will take such obscene things

557
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,960
along with them.

558
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,350
People growing up

559
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,910
on the grassland like you

560
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,770
are filthy and shameless

561
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,580
by nature.

562
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:34,980
Rather than doing so many

563
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,440
foolish tricks,

564
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,810
you’d better use your brain more.

565
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,310
Given your current situation,

566
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,750
you think you can still hurt me?

567
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,270
Lady Dowager of the Third Branch sent me

568
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,330
to Qingshan House

569
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,400
just because Young Master is young

570
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,610
and the maids must be upright.

571
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:49,880
No obscenity is allowed.

572
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,270
Once they’re found obscene,

573
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,670
they’ll be sent to Lady Dowager’s mansion

574
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,370
right away

575
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:55,350
and beaten to death.

576
00:38:59,140 --> 00:38:59,970
Alright.

577
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,370
I’m gonna tell the butler.

578
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,910
Let’s see how he will handle this.

579
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,050
Miss Jinzhu.

580
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,730
Your stuff is broken.

581
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:18,040
Jing Xiaoliu. Watch your mouth.

582
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,170
Don’t go too far.

583
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,170
Things change

584
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:23,400
as time goes.

585
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:24,830
Jinzhu.

586
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,350
I’ll just say this once.

587
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,530
I’m warning you.

588
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,610
You better know the situation.

589
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,590
Before trying to frame me,

590
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,570
you may

591
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,910
use your brain and think carefully.

592
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,270
Don’t be like a stupid pig.

593
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,750
Now

594
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,850
get out of here.

595
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:46,580
You!

596
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,790
Could that masked woman

597
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,450
be Jinzhu?

598
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,380
Young Master Huai.

599
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,480
Young Master Huai.

600
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,810
Xing’er is a big trouble.

601
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:19,030
I cannot handle her.

602
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:20,730
I beg you.

603
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,860
Please do something

604
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,820
and wipe her out.

605
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,840
This slut never makes

606
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,380
but always breaks.

607
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:37,610
When it’s the time,

608
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,740
I’ll eliminate them all.

609
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:52,040
Go back quietly and wait for my order.

610
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:54,770
Aye.

611
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,250
Are the human-skin gloves still with you?

612
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:00,780
Yes.

613
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,720
Hide them well.

614
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:05,710
If you lose them,

615
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,940
I’ll skin you

616
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,770
to make gloves.

617
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,330
Wait.

618
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,990
If you expose yourself,

619
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:20,190
you’ll die.

620
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:24,620
Leave.

621
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,310
Could she

622
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:34,550
have the other human-skin glove?

623
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:52,940
What are you looking for?

624
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,550
I lost something the other day.

625
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,980
I come to have a look.

626
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:58,860
What is it?

627
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,780
Nothing. It doesn’t matter.

628
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:02,120
Go ahead.

629
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:04,550
Let me see what you’re looking for exactly.

630
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:10,130
Never mind. On second thoughts,

631
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,570
it’s necessary to find it.

632
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,420
You’ve lived here

633
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,850
for so many days.

634
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:14,830
I wonder

635
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:15,730
if it’s still here.

636
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,540
I am kind. Take it

637
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,860
as a gift for a beggar.

638
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:25,230
She must have a guilty conscience.

639
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,590
Linxi’s death

640
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,800
must have something to do with her.

641
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:58,420
Young Master. We’ve found out that

642
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:00,270
Xing’er came to the Jing family three years ago.

643
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:01,150
It is said that

644
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,880
She’s Jing’s illegitimate daughter.

645
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:04,680
But no one knows

646
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,460
where she lived

647
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,530
and who raised her up

648
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:07,750
before she came to the Jing family.

649
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:09,990
I wonder if you still remember that

650
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,620
Luo He was murdered one year ago

651
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:15,790
and his daughter fell into water and got lost.

652
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:19,370
Perhaps I just think too much.

653
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:22,830
But the martial arts of Xing’er improve too fast

654
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:24,310
to make me doubt it.
