16
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,190
Since Mother passed away,

17
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,970
Chun has isolated herself in the chamber

18
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:50,940
without seeing anybody.

19
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,730
She didn’t see me off when I left.

20
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,990
I am all alone now.

21
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,950
You are not alone.

22
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,530
All these people are right behind you.

23
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,020
So am I.

Duke Yanbei.

25
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,370
As Duke Yanbei, I have nothing.

26
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,320
I’m worse than a prisoner.

27
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,070
My future aside,

28
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,470
I may easily lose my life.

29
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,070
Young Master Yue,

30
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,800
thanks for caring for me.

31
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,900
There are ups and downs in life.

32
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,360
But the sun shines again after the rain.

33
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,770
I believe Noble Consort

34
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,360
would want both of you

35
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,370
to be safe and sound,

36
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,700
and in good shape.

37
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,430
Who is it?

38
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:10,720
It’s me.

39
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,710
- What are you doing?
- It’s me.

40
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,020
What happened?

41
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,350
We caught them

42
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,750
stealing our food at night.

43
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,620
Your Highness, Young Master,

44
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,590
what should we do with them?

45
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,850
- Please spare our lives!
- Grandfather.

46
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,510
Since the war broke out,

47
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,230
we have got nothing to eat.

48
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,010
All my family members are dead.

49
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,820
Our village is destroyed.

50
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,570
I am starving.

51
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,770
Or I wouldn’t dare

52
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,370
to steal your food, Master.

53
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,460
Please forgive us this time,

54
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,440
and spare our lives.

55
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,760
Grandfather.

56
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,560
Grandfather.

57
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,250
Let them go.

58
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,290
Grandfather.

59
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,150
Meng Feng,

60
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,710
give them something to eat.

61
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,120
Grandfather.

62
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,720
Here, take it.

63
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,760
Grandfather, eat.

64
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,660
You eat it.

65
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,940
Eat it, grandfather.

66
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,050
You eat it.

67
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,110
Take your time. Slow down.

68
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,650
It tastes so good.

69
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,500
Eat up.

70
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,510
Here.

71
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,190
Give me some water.

72
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,340
Give me some water.

73
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,200
Here.

74
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,470
Here, take it.

75
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,550
Thank you.

76
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,500
There’s more.

77
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,070
Thank you. Thank you.

78
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,270
Take your time. Take your time.

79
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,990
Thank you.

80
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,890
Eat slowly.

81
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,060
Although I’ve suffered so much,

82
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,360
it’s nothing

83
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,500
compared with them.

84
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,760
If the war doesn’t stop,

85
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,830
how many more lives

86
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,260
can we save on our own?

87
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,700
Right.

88
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,620
The only way to save them is
to stop the war.

89
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,100
But at this stage,

90
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,630
what can I do?

91
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,000
The minute I set foot in Yanbei,

92
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,100
I instantly become a target.

93
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,360
Don’t worry.

94
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,870
I’ve made plans.

95
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,820
Your Highness, I don’t think

96
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,170
Miss Chu will

97
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,180
forgive me.

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,340
Should she forgive you?

99
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,050
How dare you!

100
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:01,860
Your Highness.

101
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,300
You thought you could fool me?

102
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,900
How stupid you think I am?

103
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,160
I wouldn’t dare.

104
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,110
You wouldn’t dare?

105
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,390
I think you are way too daring.

106
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,120
I’m innocent.

107
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,800
Your Highness.

108
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,130
When you led the troops
to attack Chang’an,

109
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,060
my heart was torn with anxiety

110
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,960
and I was afraid I’d miss it,

111
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,550
so...

112
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,920
- Miss Chu... I...
- Cheng Yuan.

113
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,590
If you do it again,

114
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,200
I’m warning you,

115
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,920
just go to hell

116
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,230
to wait for your enemy.

117
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:35,970
Aye.

118
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,430
Get up.

119
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,440
Thank you, Your Highness.

120
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,390
Your Highness.

121
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,470
The scout just reported

122
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,970
that Prince Yuan Song of Wei

123
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,470
had camped outside the Meilin Pass.

124
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,370
And he proclaimed himself

125
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,450
Duke Yanbei.

126
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,310
How many troops does he have?

127
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,940
That strikes me as odd.

128
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,080
There are only a dozen

129
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,030
old, weak and wounded men.

130
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,680
Did he come here to meet his doom?

131
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,310
General.

132
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,920
Bury Sun He

133
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,240
outside the city

134
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,660
where the view is nice.

135
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,530
Aye.

136
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,760
Select a few skilled soldiers

137
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,220
to get out of the city with me tonight.

138
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,380
What for?

139
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,120
To kill Yuan Song.

140
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,820
Is that His Highness’s order?

141
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,240
He just arrived at the Meilin Pass

142
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,370
without a firm foothold.

143
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,230
It’s the best time to kill him now.

144
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,120
He and Chu Qiao are best friends.

145
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,700
We must get rid of

146
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,640
all her contacts.

147
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:05,710
Aye.

148
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,440
Don’t leave too fast, man.

149
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,770
Soon, you’ll have company

150
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,640
and won’t feel lonely on the way.

151
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,250
Yuan Song.

152
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:19,720
Move.

153
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,270
We have been waiting for you.

154
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,350
Stop.

155
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,030
Yan Xun.

156
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,160
His Highness intends to keep Cheng Yuan.

157
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,600
There’s nothing else

158
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,280
we can do.

159
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,520
Cheng Yuan is cruel and merciless.

160
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,170
All he cares about is revenge.

161
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,200
And he is best at

162
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,460
manipulating others’ minds.

163
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,930
I heard he had gained strong support

164
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,160
from the troops of Yanbei.

165
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,570
Even Mr. Wu can’t match him.

166
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,020
Many soldiers

167
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,770
who lost their families in the battle

168
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,480
are following his lead.

169
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,270
It’s not easy

170
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,590
to bring him down.

171
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,890
Is it?

172
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,130
I see.

173
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,490
Cheng Yuan’s experience

174
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,960
is similar to His Highness’s.

175
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,270
He took advantage of that

176
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,750
and gained His Highness’s trust.

177
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,820
His Highness holds a grudge

178
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,820
against the Xiuli Army.

179
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,250
Without you,

180
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,560
all of us

181
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,870
would’ve been long gone.

182
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,250
And because of you,

183
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,870
His Highness gave up the chance
to take Chang’an.

184
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,930
What he did for you is rare.

185
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,290
In his heart,

186
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,780
no one can replace you.

187
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,960
Back in Chang’an,

188
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,730
I always felt
that I was familiar with Yanbei

189
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,060
and I had all kinds of imaginations

190
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,170
as if I had been here.

191
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,590
Now that I’m here,

192
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,800
I’m freezing.

193
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,620
All my passion and ambition

194
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,300
can’t stand

195
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,390
the cold wind.

196
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,850
Miss Chu.

197
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,740
Don’t give up easily.

198
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,210
To realize one’s ambition,

199
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,440
sacrifices must be made.

200
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,280
I believe you will

201
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,020
succeed someday.

202
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,400
In the future, on this plateau,

203
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,940
peace will be restored
and prosperity will be shared.

204
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:19,900
By that time,

205
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,340
the deceased

206
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,800
will finally rest in peace.

207
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,340
I hope so.

208
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,820
Trust me, everything will be fine.

209
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,870
Arrows of the Qingshan House.

210
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,520
General!

211
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,630
General!

212
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,930
General!

213
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,250
Are you alright?

214
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,090
I’m fine.

215
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,390
Your Highness.

216
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,490
- What happened?
- Your Highness.

217
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,430
I staked out the Meilin Pass at night

218
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,210
and found something important.

219
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,720
Yuwen Yue is here.

220
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,150
He is staying at the General’s Mansion

221
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,580
and he’s taken over

222
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,070
the entire force at the Meilin Pass.

223
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,520
Let’s go.

224
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,460
If I didn’t come,

225
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,180
no one else would

226
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,640
play chess with

227
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,690
a boring man like you.

228
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,360
Some always come without invitation.

229
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:37,050
So, I never feel bored.

230
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,640
All these years,

231
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,790
your skill in chess has improved a lot.

232
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,020
I’m impressed.

233
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,770
After my legs got injured,

234
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,750
I couldn’t do anything else

235
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,200
other than playing the instrument,

236
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,980
reading books

237
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,040
and playing chess.

238
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,090
My practice

239
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,270
has paid off.

240
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,470
Unlike you,

241
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:12,490
the whole world is your toy.

242
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,970
How wonderful is that!

243
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,010
Don’t portray yourself

244
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,110
as some hermit.

245
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,310
You pay for people’s lives

246
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,790
and control their fates.

247
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,150
You’re as well-known in the underworld

248
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,870
as me.

249
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,480
I’m just running a small business.

250
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,050
It’s worthless.

251
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,390
Unlike you,

252
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,790
you are dealing around the world.

253
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,390
That is because you don’t want to.

254
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,880
I’m simply doing that

255
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,790
as a hobby.

256
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,750
While you’ve been

257
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,560
looking for the Storm Token for years

258
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,640
to fulfill your ambition.

259
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,290
How ironic!

260
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:20,110
Everyone is eager to

261
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,020
obtain the Storm Token.

262
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,750
But no one knows

263
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:28,030
it is the equinox flower appeared
on the skin

264
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,610
after mastering the Ice Trick.

265
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,110
How could I have it?

266
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,990
By the way,

267
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,640
I heard Luo He’s daughter is still alive.

268
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,250
If she knows

269
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,340
you killed her mother,

270
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,610
what do you think she will do to you?

271
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,390
Are you here

272
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,500
because you’re worried about my safety?

273
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,600
I guess

274
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,920
everything in my boat

275
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,900
can’t escape from your eyes.

276
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,410
Just tell me, what do you want?

277
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,600
We studied together after all.

278
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,060
Is it strange

279
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,520
that I simply came to visit you?

280
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,450
When did we

281
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,850
become so close?

282
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,750
I always assume

283
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,720
you want me dead

284
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,680
as soon as possible.

285
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,410
Don’t think the worst of me.

286
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,860
I always believe

287
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,140
we are of the same kind.

288
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,500
I can tell you

289
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,210
where Luo He’s daughter is.

290
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,040
But I hope you can help me

291
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,490
to kindle the flames of war in Yanbei

292
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,010
to realize my dream
of assisting the Emperor.

293
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,760
How is Zhao Kuang?

294
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,410
Young Master, I think

295
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,910
he’s almost frightened to death.

296
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,590
Two nights ago,

297
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,170
he reported to His Majesty

298
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,720
that his condition is critical

299
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,990
and he needs treatment back
in the capital.

300
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,180
He asked His Majesty to

301
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,750
hand over the pass to Prince Yu

302
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,860
so that he could take a leave.

303
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,690
Then he led the crack troops

304
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,070
back to Chang’an

305
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,470
before His Majesty agreed to it.

306
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,730
Yuejiu’s medicine is too wrong.

307
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,440
After being startled like this,

308
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:21,760
he must’ve thought

309
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,730
he’s dying.

310
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,590
My medicine is to save lives.

311
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,330
That poison is made by the Death Camp.

312
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,600
It has nothing to do with me.

313
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,250
All right.

314
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,040
The priority

315
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,370
is to train the troops

316
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,470
and rebuild fortifications.

317
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,390
The last battle

318
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,750
almost ruined Meilin Pass.

319
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,150
I have already delivered the orders

320
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,320
to rebuild the wall

321
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,200
first thing tomorrow.

322
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,650
I’m counting on you.

323
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,160
Yueqi.

324
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,200
How about

325
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,090
the task I gave you?

326
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,920
Before we came to Yanbei,

327
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,020
I had contacted the spies

328
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,630
in the north.

329
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,700
Now, they are ready to take action

330
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,630
in Hongchuan.

331
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,500
Who is the leader?

332
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,590
= Barn =
Hurry up. Move!

333
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,520
Fill the bag and leave.

334
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,120
General. Please don’t empty the barn.

335
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,250
I still need some

336
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,070
to run my business.

337
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,050
Mr. Chen,

338
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,850
you own the largest grain shop

339
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:11,720
in Hongchuan.

340
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,440
Who else should I go to for grains?

341
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,100
General, soldiers need to eat,

342
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,370
and so does my family.

343
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,290
Right?

344
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:19,980
You... You...

345
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,030
How could I live
if you take everything away?

346
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:22,740
Mr. Chen,

347
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,120
you are wrong.

348
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,570
I’m not a robber.

349
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,360
We will return it to you

350
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,530
once the war is over.

351
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,230
What’s more,

352
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,560
I will ask His Highness

353
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,810
to reward you.

354
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,610
To be honest,

355
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,750
the situation is tense.

356
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,850
I’m afraid these provisions
are not enough.

357
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:40,800
Could you figure out a way

358
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,700
to get me more?

359
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:43,600
General.

360
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,560
I have let you empty my stock.

361
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,000
There’s nothing else I could do.

362
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,090
The wheat in the field

363
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,040
isn’t mature enough.

364
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,650
I can’t

365
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,220
harvest it yet.

366
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,690
Not mature enough?

367
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,460
Have you loaded them all?

368
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,190
Yes, we have.

369
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:00,840
Let’s go.

370
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:01,690
Aye.

371
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,980
- Let’s go.
- Go.

372
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,740
- Aye.
- Aye.

373
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,540
Stop.

374
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:16,970
Where are you going?

375
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:17,830
I’m going home.

376
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,530
Go ahead.

377
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,290
Stop.

378
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:22,950
Where are you going?

379
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,930
I have the order from General Ajing

380
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:25,990
to collect grains outside the city.

381
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,510
Here you go.

382
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,740
= Permit =

383
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,900
= Ajing’s Seal =

384
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,780
Thank you.

385
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,400
What is Young Master’s order?

386
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,430
You can see for yourself.

387
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,400
= Get our spies into Hongchuan. =

388
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,940
= Destroy the barn in the Yanbei Army. =

389
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,110
I understand.

390
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,770
What’s your name?

391
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,850
Meng Feng.

392
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,250
Miss Meng Feng.

393
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,390
Tomorrow morning,

394
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,830
I will wait for you at the gate.

395
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:20,950
Don’t be late.

396
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,550
Rest assured.

397
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,500
Take care.

398
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,470
You…

399
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,790
Where are you going?

400
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,360
You are not allowed to go inside.

401
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,030
Stop. Where are you going?

402
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,060
Sir,

403
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,480
we are here to deliver grains.

404
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,990
Grains?

405
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,080
I wasn’t told

406
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,700
you’d come today.

407
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,650
Do you have the permit?

408
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,380
I don’t have it with me.

409
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,620
But we are ordered

410
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,620
to deliver them.

411
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,560
You can’t go inside.

412
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,410
Without the permit, you may be a spy.

413
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,560
I have the permit.

414
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,580
I have it.

415
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,660
It’s right here.

416
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:32,910
Sir,

417
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,450
you don’t recognize me?

418
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,350
I went out through this gate yesterday.

419
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,300
The army is in need of supplies.

420
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,200
We will be punished

421
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,410
if we are late.

422
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,780
Here’s the permit.

423
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,430
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

424
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,550
Thank you, sir.

425
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,130
- Let’s go.
- Let’s go.

426
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,650
- Quickly.
- Quickly.

427
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:57,690
Hurry up.

428
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:58,560
Let’s go.

429
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,020
Buns.

430
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,960
Hot buns.

431
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:26,470
Stop.

432
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,380
Miss.

433
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,560
Where are you going?

434
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,390
We are delivering grains to the army.

435
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,030
Miss.

436
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,000
I have the permit from General Ajing.

437
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,980
= Ajing’s Seal =

438
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:46,310
Who are they?

439
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,170
They are farmers living in the suburbs.

440
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,720
They are helping me with the delivery.

441
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
What is on the cart?

442
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,090
Miss, it’s grains.

443
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,110
Let me see.

444
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,630
Aye.

445
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,200
That’s fine.

446
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,460
You can go now.

447
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,730
Thank you. Thank you.

448
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,340
Let’s go.

449
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:25,260
Let’s go.

450
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,590
Move.

451
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,210
Quickly.

452
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,880
Go.

453
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,400
Hurry up.

454
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,660
Go, go, go.

455
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,270
Quickly.

456
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,020
Quickly.

457
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,650
Quickly.

458
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:27,900
= Fuman Grain Shop =

459
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:33,950
Meng Feng.

460
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,990
It’s getting dark.

461
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,550
The gate is about to close.

462
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,930
Why don’t you

463
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:40,070
stay for the night?

464
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,530
You can rest in the shop.

465
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,470
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

466
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,430
Before I left home,

467
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,090
my father told me to listen to you.

468
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,080
Don’t worry.

469
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,760
Let’s go.

470
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,100
Let’s go.

471
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,050
There are two barns

472
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,150
in Hongchuan.

473
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,710
One belongs to the army.

474
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,790
The other belongs to the government.

475
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,510
From what I know, the stock

476
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,530
in the government’s barn

477
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,200
has been emptied by the army.

478
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,950
In addition,

479
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,490
they are imposing limits on purchase.

480
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,780
That clearly shows

481
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,580
Yan Xun is ready

482
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,330
for the war.

483
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,810
Is this

484
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,220
the army’s barn?

485
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,410
Yes.

486
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,510
It is heavily guarded.

487
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,520
They change shifts three times a day.

488
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,300
It’s almost impossible

489
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,110
to set it on fire.

490
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,010
I have an idea though.

491
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:39,900
Tomorrow,

492
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,230
when we deliver the grains to the army,

493
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,280
we can

494
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,200
take everything…

495
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,220
There is no need.

496
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,370
Just tell me when the guards

497
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,650
change shifts.

498
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,670
We will raid the place tonight.

499
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,780
You?

500
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,440
You can’t. That’s too reckless.

501
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,020
You will get killed.

502
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,980
We are trained to

503
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,270
put our lives on the line.

504
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,230
No way.

505
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,960
I am in charge of

506
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,540
the Eye of Intel’s every move

507
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,570
in Hongchuan.

508
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:09,640
Now that you’re inside the city,

509
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,830
you must follow my order.

510
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,920
You’re incompetent for the task,

511
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:15,840
so Young Master assigned me here.

512
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:16,630
You…

513
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,840
- Who is it?
- It’s me, sir.

514
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,680
Here comes a secret letter.

515
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,060
Have you made up your mind?

516
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,030
If you have,

517
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,800
just tell me the time.

518
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:43,830
No.

519
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,650
You can’t take action tonight.

520
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,630
I am not asking for your opinion.

521
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,670
Me either.

522
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,010
Read it yourself.

523
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,920
A merchant from the south will come

524
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,050
to deliver grains tonight.

525
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,660
They will go straight
to the barn at night.

526
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,790
It will be full of people.

527
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,110
How can you possibly make the move?

528
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,500
= Barn =

529
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,340
Go quickly.

530
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:17,200
Take them up there.

531
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,220
Yes, yes.

532
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,520
Hurry.

533
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,300
Yes.

534
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:23,150
Quickly. There is more.

535
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:24,240
Yes.

536
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,390
There they are.

537
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,900
Mr. Zhan.

538
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,100
General Ajing.

539
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,510
Thank you for your help.

540
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,870
We’re in dire need of supplies.

541
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,700
His Highness ordered me specially

542
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,080
that I must express our gratitude

543
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,180
to you.

544
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,760
I am a businessman.

545
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,160
I do business with everyone.

546
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,710
Can you hear what they are saying?

547
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,410
Miss Meng.

548
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,100
Not clear.

549
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,830
Mr. Zhan, you are too modest.

550
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,500
You are not only a businessman,

551
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,530
but also a hero. I admire you.

552
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,110
You’re flattering me, General Ajing.

553
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,940
Mr. Zhan,

554
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,230
I heard you suffer from leg pain.
Is it serious?

555
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,730
It is cold in Yanbei.

556
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,030
Will that make you uncomfortable?

557
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,140
It has been more than a decade.

558
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:56,780
The weather changes all the time.

559
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,370
I am perfectly fine.

560
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,550
General Ajing.

561
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,830
I told you

562
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,630
I would like to meet with

563
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,080
His Highness.

564
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,590
Have you conveyed my message?

565
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,590
Of course.

566
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,040
But unfortunately,

567
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,230
he is in Lancheng right now

568
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,570
and he won’t be back soon.

569
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,540
I’ll send someone

570
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,000
to inform him of your arrival.

571
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,950
Thank you.

572
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,240
Mr. Zhan.

573
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,730
You must be tired from the long journey.

574
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,350
Why don’t you rest in the inn first?

575
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:41,930
We have checked him out.

576
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:43,960
He is the leader of

577
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,780
the Water Transport Gang in the south

578
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,070
from Liang.

579
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,160
He often travels between borders of Wei

580
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:48,830
and Liang.

581
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,020
He owns a business in Xianyang.

582
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,600
He is wealthy.

583
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,300
With his help,

584
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,620
Yan Xun will have strong support.

585
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,910
We need to do something about it.

586
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:06,070
What is your plan?

587
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:07,500
Kill him.

588
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,530
I disagree.

589
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,130
Why?

590
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:15,460
I don’t know.

591
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,990
But I have a hunch

592
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,610
that man is extremely dangerous.

593
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:22,590
A hunch?

594
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,650
I will tell Young Master about this.

595
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,160
He’ll decide

596
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,550
what to do.

597
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,300
Let’s finish

598
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,050
out task first.

599
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,700
Now, Yan Xun has grains, right?

600
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,220
Let’s burn them all

601
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,270
into ashes.

602
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,450
Mr. Zhan, I have heard so much about you.

603
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,450
You’re the head
of the Water Transport Gang.

604
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,130
Thank you for helping us out

605
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,730
at this critical moment.

606
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,020
Yanbei soldiers and His Highness

607
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,960
are grateful to you.

608
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,860
You are welcome.

609
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,670
I met

610
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,380
Marquis

611
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,840
once before.

612
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,310
This is the least I should do.

613
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,560
It’s just that His Highness

614
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,830
was so close to Chang’an.

615
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,730
He was unstoppable,

616
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,070
but he suddenly withdrew his troops.

617
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,930
What a pity!

618
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,540
Was that because of the lack of grains?

619
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,870
It was all because of a woman.

620
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:35,750
A woman?

621
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,750
Like father like son.

622
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:39,730
When Marquis was young,

623
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:40,860
he competed against His Majesty

624
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,090
for Ms. Bai Sheng.

625
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,850
Eventually, he won

626
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,540
and his love paid off.

627
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,300
Unfortunately, Marquis’s love

628
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,380
ended his life

629
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:54,260
while His Excellency’s

630
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,150
cost us the perfect chance

631
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:57,750
to revenge.

632
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,550
He is still young.

633
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,330
It’s understandable
that he’s affectionate.

634
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,680
So is spoiling the chance to win?

635
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,840
I shouldn’t have judged.

636
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,090
Please forgive me.

637
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,040
When His Highness is back,

638
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,630
I will introduce you to him.

639
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,450
Thank you for your kindness.

640
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,040
But

641
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,310
not this time.

642
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,340
I’m getting out of town

643
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,880
tomorrow morning.

644
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,640
What’s with the rush?

645
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,060
It’s something personal.

646
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,020
Then I won’t make you stay.

647
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,570
When you come next time,

648
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,100
you can expect my hospitality.

649
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,760
Thank you, General.

650
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:38,650
Servant!

651
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:40,740
Bring me that.

652
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,010
General, that’s a little something
for you.

653
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,500
Please take it.

654
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,240
Thank you.

655
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,560
Send this to Young Master immediately.

656
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,400
Be careful.

657
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,070
You are too cautious.

658
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,210
Don’t worry.

659
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,650
Go get prepared.

660
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,080
Aye.

661
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,990
- Good!
- Great!

662
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,330
Do it again!

663
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,440
Reward us if you have coins.

664
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,000
Clap for us if you don’t.

665
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,900
Come on, thank you.

666
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,520
Well done!

667
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,950
Thank you.

668
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,660
Thank you.

669
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,800
Good!

670
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,480
Excuse me, a bun, please.

671
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,480
Sure.

672
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:22,040
Here you go.

673
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,020
Do come again.

674
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:23,900
Sure.

675
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,050
See you.

676
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,620
Aren’t you stubborn?

677
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,450
You still won’t say anything?

678
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:50,900
Will you say it or not?

679
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:52,970
Yes or no?

680
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,830
Spit it out!

681
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:55,790
Speak!

682
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,230
Speak!

683
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,660
Still no?

684
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,520
Nothing?

685
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,980
Say it!

686
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,210
Answer the question!

687
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,400
Do it!

688
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,910
Will you speak or not?

689
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,780
Yes or no?

690
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,250
Beat him. Go on.

691
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,290
Don’t stop until he confesses.

692
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,050
Still won’t say it?

693
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:32,740
Say it!

694
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,400
Speak!

695
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:35,720
Speak!

696
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,660
You won’t?

697
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:39,070
Still no?

698
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:39,800
Speak!

699
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:59,570
Miss Chu, they are so crafty.

700
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,700
You had found out about it.

701
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,160
Why didn’t you expose their scheme?

702
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,410
Under this circumstance,

703
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:11,410
why don’t we

704
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:12,490
take them all down one and for all?

705
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:14,480
Once and for all?

706
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:21,660
= Don’t worry about us. =

707
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,280
Place the bait.

708
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,350
I’m on it.

709
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,210
Young Master.

710
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:05,250
“We have successfully entered the city.

711
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,390
The fire will be on
at ten o’clock tonight.

712
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:08,910
Don’t worry about us”.

713
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,350
I’m glad it’s all going smoothly.

714
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,110
We’d better act fast.

715
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,690
I’ll go reinforce them now.

716
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:21,180
Hold on.

717
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,890
The letter is fake.

718
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,500
Inform them to retreat.

719
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,660
Aye.

720
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,220
Retreat!

721
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:32,220
= Hongchuan =

722
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,200
Retreat!

723
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,220
Shoot!

724
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,280
Miss Chu disrupted

725
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,270
Yuwen Yue’s operation,

726
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,560
captured all his people

727
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,990
and saved our barn.

728
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:42,020
That’s a huge merit.

729
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,780
It’s wonderful!

730
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:45,870
That said,

731
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,220
Yuwen Yue is sneaky.

732
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,540
He planted spies without a trace.

733
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:53,130
Luckily, Miss Chu was taught

734
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:53,940
by him,

735
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,150
and she’s familiar with his methods.

736
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,710
She saw through his scheme

737
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,900
and went with it,

738
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,120
causing him to fail.

739
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:02,390
It was exciting

740
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:03,050
simply watching it.

741
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:04,380
What’s your point?

742
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,640
My point is

743
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:07,920
their relationship…

744
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,200
Enough of your nonsense!

745
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:42,840
Young Master,

746
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,710
Meng Feng has almost recovered.

747
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,150
She’ll be fine

748
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,490
after some rest.

749
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,090
Young Master, I was so stupid

750
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,670
that I fell for their trap

751
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,030
and almost ruined our plan.

752
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,480
I wonder

753
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,190
how you saw through it.

754
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,330
Look at this Chinese character “ten”.

755
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:21,660
When I taught her to write,

756
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:23,480
she grew

757
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,340
a bad habit.

758
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,330
I did not correct her in time.

759
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:27,540
She didn’t know that herself.

760
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,090
Thanks to that,

761
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:33,040
I know the letter is fake.

762
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,350
What happened?

763
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:48,530
Ge…

764
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:49,740
General…

765
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,430
I...

766
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,790
I don’t know.

767
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:54,920
I was knocked out

768
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,200
once I came.

769
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,270
I know nothing about it.

770
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,230
General!

771
00:42:58,730 --> 00:42:59,910
Did

772
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:01,790
an insider let them go?

773
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:02,850
Was it a woman

774
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:03,950
who knocked you unconscious?

775
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,470
General!

776
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,180
General, spare me! General!

777
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:11,390
Please spare me!

778
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:12,740
Spare me, General!

779
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:17,400
General!

780
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,120
General, look.

781
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,510
These chains are untouched.

782
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:23,900
Someone must’ve used the keys

783
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,000
to open them.

784
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,720
I... I didn’t do it.

785
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,720
General!

786
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:30,690
Please spare me!

787
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:32,760
You are right.

788
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,020
An insider did it.

789
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,700
That person let them go.

790
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:38,190
