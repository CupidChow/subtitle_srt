I haven’t had enough fun.

How come...

20
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,120
There are no women left?

21
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,780
Your Majesty,
Noble Consort Wei requests an audience.

22
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,460
Tell her to come tomorrow.

23
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,270
Your Majesty,

24
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,000
I apologize for my rudeness.

25
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,650
But this is life-and-death.

26
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,120
I have to come.

27
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,770
Clearly, you’re well-informed.

28
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,030
Sorry about my abruptness.

29
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,140
I have given the edict

30
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,280
to capture Yan Xun.

31
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,870
Please think twice, Your Majesty.

32
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,760
I couldn’t bear to see...

33
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,240
Couldn’t bear?

34
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,930
Wei is on the verge of destruction.

35
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,180
The imperial family is at death’s door.

36
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,080
Could you bear to see that?

37
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,650
Your Majesty,

38
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,800
Yan Xun grew up in Chang’an.

39
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,600
He is loyal to you.

40
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,680
How can you be sure?

41
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,160
I would rather kill all

42
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,910
than let go of one.

43
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:29,370
I’ve been putting up with them for a long time.

44
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,060
Enough is enough.

45
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,850
Powerful families in Chang’an,

46
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,520
including yours,

47
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,880
have taken actions

48
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,340
to clobber those traitors.

= Arrest =

50
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,580
Uncle,

51
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,020
did you ask to see me

52
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,170
for something urgent?

53
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,060
Read it yourself.

54
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,110
It’s His Majesty’s secret imperial edict.

55
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,640
What? Arrest Yan Xun?

56
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,690
Uncle, please

57
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,090
try to stop this.

58
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,370
Listen to yourself.

59
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,080
What are you talking about?

60
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,900
Are you really a Wei?

61
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,460
I know Yan Xun well.

62
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,760
He’d never rebel.

63
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,070
Yes or no,

64
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,120
it’s not up to you.

65
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,440
This is a chance for our family

66
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,850
to gain credit.

67
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,430
If you back down,

68
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,720
your brothers

69
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,520
will take your place.

70
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,290
I don’t mean that.

71
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,140
But

72
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,390
Yan Xun is my friend.

73
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,690
There’s no way...

74
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,730
Idiot!

75
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,880
Earlier today, Song Zifu

76
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,460
was killed by His Majesty at court.

77
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,060
You must follow His Majesty’s order.

78
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,440
Marquis Dingbei is doomed.

79
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,470
Yan Shicheng and his family will die.

80
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,020
Are you going to fight against rebels

81
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,480
to make a name of yourself?

82
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,900
Or you’d rather be

83
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,370
a nameless dandy forever?

84
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,740
It is up to you.

85
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,210
Huanhuan.

86
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,820
Am I

87
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,690
a big fool?

88
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,020
I always assumed

89
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,470
Yan Xun was in love

90
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,260
with me.

91
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,480
I didn’t realize until today

92
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,530
that it was only

93
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,690
my wishful thinking.

94
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,920
Look how lucky you are.

95
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,970
I love you so much.

96
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,370
But what about me?

97
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,690
Who will love me?

98
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,600
Don’t be sad, Princess.

99
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,680
You have been crying these days.

100
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,620
It breaks my heart.

101
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,690
What should I do,

102
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,600
Huanhuan?

103
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,330
Mother.

104
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,840
Why did you call me back

105
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,840
in such haste?

106
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,970
Tonight is going to be troubled.

107
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,360
As a prince,

108
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,620
I wish you could stay out of it.

109
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,410
What do you mean by that?

110
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,620
Stay close to me.

111
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,870
Don’t run around.

112
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,740
Chun has locked herself

113
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,920
in her room for days.

114
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,190
What happened?

115
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,080
You know girls.

116
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,780
They can be sentimental sometimes.

117
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,250
Troubled?

118
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,170
What trouble can it be?

119
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,450
Yan Xun used to

120
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,290
take me to eat

121
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,110
the iced lotus seed soup.

122
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,110
He told me stories

123
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,350
and jokes.

124
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,130
And he gave me

125
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,130
tons of gifts.

126
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,160
But now...

127
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,660
Since that maid Xing’er

128
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,800
showed up,

129
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,040
Yan Xun and I

130
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,860
have become alienated.

131
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,660
Today, he said

132
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,120
he regarded me as his sister.

133
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,650
Who’d want to be his sister?

134
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,220
Princess.

135
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,660
Open the door.

136
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,600
Aye.

137
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,760
This year’s Maojian Tea

138
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,550
tastes good.

139
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,590
Song, Chun,

140
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,670
do you two

141
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,510
take your extravagant lifestyle

142
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,350
for granted?

143
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,330
You can enjoy iced food

144
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,670
in the scorching summer

145
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,050
that others can’t even imagine.

146
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,440
We are born into the imperial family.

147
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,030
So we’re indeed more blessed

148
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,170
than commoners.

149
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,780
Wait, mother,

150
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,240
don’t you have something important

151
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,780
to tell us?

152
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,680
But

153
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,210
why are you

154
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,410
going off-topic?

155
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,270
Mother,

156
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,150
what’s your point?

157
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,130
I just want to remind you two

158
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,410
that you are

159
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,440
the Prince and the Princess of Wei.

160
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,370
You own unimaginable

161
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,440
power and wealth.

162
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,240
The world

163
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,120
is your oyster.

164
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,530
That’s not true.

165
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,600
There are too many things that I don’t like,

166
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,540
but the one I really want is unavailable.

167
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,410
People always envy the imperial family,

168
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,780
but nobody understands

169
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,120
the suffering

170
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,100
we have to endure.

171
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,650
Song, Chun,

172
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,100
keep this in mind.

173
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,540
You can get hold of

174
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,150
what commoners can’t

175
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,150
except for two things

176
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,600
which are at their fingertips

177
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,320
that you must

178
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,910
put behind you.

179
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,700
What are these two things?

180
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,200
Friendship

181
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,530
and love.

182
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,100
You must discard love

183
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,160
and never get involved in it.

184
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,040
Why?

185
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,820
Love is the most complicated thing

186
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,480
in this world.

187
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,570
You can’t control it

188
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,960
no matter how powerful you are.

189
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,150
Once trapped by it,

190
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,340
you will be caught

191
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,540
between love and loyalty,

192
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,690
leading to a disastrous end.

193
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,200
It will not only hurt you,

194
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,860
but also everyone

195
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,470
around you.

196
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,740
But it’s human nature to love.

197
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,340
We aren’t made of wood.

198
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,370
How could we

199
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,850
be completely emotionless?

200
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:05,690
That’s right.

201
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,440
Without friends

202
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,780
and the loved ones,

203
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,590
there’s no fun in life.

204
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,790
I agree.

205
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,950
Fun?

206
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,080
You carry the imperial bloodline.

207
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,840
You don’t live for fun.

208
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,930
Other than love,

209
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,350
you can have anything you want.

210
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,420
Isn’t that enough?

211
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,070
You two

212
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,030
stay here and behave yourselves.

213
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,110
Do not go out.

214
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,150
Think over what I just said.

215
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,860
Take a closer look at this map.

216
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,460
= Pleasure Pavilion =

217
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:54,970
All traps

218
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,690
in the Pleasure Pavilion

219
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,500
are marked.

220
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,500
Even the exit

221
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,710
= Exit =
is clearly shown.

222
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,670
This isn’t like any other hairpins.

223
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,080
It’s not as simple as it seems.

224
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,730
When you get into the Pleasure Pavilion,

225
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,290
you cannot take any weapon with you.

226
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,670
This is all you have.

227
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,650
Move!

228
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,670
Get up!

229
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,180
Go! Move!

230
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,960
Go, go, go!

231
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,320
Move, now!

232
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,900
Go!

233
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,440
Move! Move!

234
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,190
Go! Go!

235
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,250
Please let us go!

236
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,490
I don’t want to die!

237
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,180
Move!

238
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,330
I have younger sisters and brothers

239
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:36,950
at home.

240
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,770
Hurry up!

241
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:38,380
Move!

242
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,190
Go!

243
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:39,700
Go!

244
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,790
Spare me, please.

245
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,220
No more crying!

246
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,300
Shut up,

247
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,370
or I’ll kill you!

248
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,250
Hurry up! Go!

249
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:45,920
Go!

250
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,370
Move!

251
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,640
- Hurry up!
- Please let us go.

252
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,640
Hurry up! Go!

253
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,130
Go, go, go!

254
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:54,500
Move!

255
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,930
You rabble

256
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,480
should feel honored

257
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,440
to serve our master today.

258
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,410
But whether you’ll survive or not

259
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,690
depends on

260
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,780
your luck.

261
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,720
Go! Get in!

262
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,510
- Please let us go.
- Move!

263
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,280
Get in, now!

264
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,170
Come on!

265
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,390
Hurry up!

266
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:15,020
= Qingshan House =

267
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,810
Easy, Xing’er.

268
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,520
I came with His Excellency’s message.

269
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,400
His message?

270
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,680
How did you know I’d be here?

271
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,360
His Excellency said

272
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,720
if I couldn’t get into Qingshan House,

273
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,790
just find

274
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,970
the most unnoticeable trail to the outside,

275
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,140
and that would lead me to you.

276
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,350
His Excellency

277
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,710
acts like a prophet.

278
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,880
He’s full of wits.

279
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,560
What is the message? Just tell me.

280
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,040
Tonight at ten,

281
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,570
meet him at the west gate.

282
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,510
Don’t be late.

283
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,670
Message received.

284
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,120
Xing’er,

285
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,820
will you come?

286
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,120
Please tell His Excellency,

287
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,750
if I

288
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,880
don’t make it on time,

289
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,250
then don’t wait for me.

290
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,970
I will report this back to His Excellency.

291
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,010
What a temper!

292
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,130
No wonder His Excellency likes her.

293
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,400
Xiaoliu.

294
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:42,360
Come here.

295
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,430
Listen to me.

296
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,170
I’ve finally had a chance

297
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,290
to leave.

298
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,320
What happened?

299
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,610
Tonight at ten,

300
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,950
wait for me at the west gate.

301
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:52,980
Be careful.

302
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,270
Don’t let others see you.

303
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:55,780
What?

304
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,500
Xiaoliu,

305
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,170
why aren’t you

306
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,210
going with us?

307
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,530
I...

308
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,500
I’ve got something important to do.

309
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,320
What’s going on?

310
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,960
Xiaoliu,

311
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,380
are you going to take revenge?

312
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,260
If so,

313
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,340
take me with you.

314
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,890
I can be of help.

315
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,830
Rest assured. As long as I can breathe,

316
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,000
I will go there

317
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,770
to join you.

318
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,200
If...

319
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,740
If I don’t show up on time,

320
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,950
His Excellency Yan Xun’s people

321
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:24,870
will pick you up.

322
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,370
You can go to Yanbei with them.

323
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,760
Then

324
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,250
you can stop serving others

325
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,040
and enjoy your own lives.

326
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,350
Xiaoliu,

327
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,270
you cannot die.

328
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,160
With the look I have,

329
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,160
I’m born to belong to the nobility.

330
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,700
Why is Xiaoliu so lucky?

331
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,260
Young Master adores her,

332
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,210
yet she still chooses to leave with His Excellency Yan Xun.

333
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,830
But I...

334
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,240
Young Master.

335
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,050
Xiaoba.

336
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,460
Xiaoqi.

337
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,130
What are you mumbling?

338
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,790
Who are you calling Young Master?

339
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,860
I... I meant our Young Master.

340
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,800
Who will take care of him

341
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,290
if we all leave?

342
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,310
Yuwen Yue is our enemy.

343
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,300
Why are you still thinking of him?

344
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,510
We will be free when we get to Yanbei.

345
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,420
Zhixiang left,

346
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,050
so did Linxi.

347
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,610
Xiaoliu and we

348
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,300
must look after each other.

349
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,340
Xiaoba.

350
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,620
= Guilty-slave Chamber =

351
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:27,780
Hurry up!

352
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,650
Move, move, move!

353
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,690
Hurry up! Come on!

354
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,750
Stop crying! Come on!

355
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,160
Hurry up!

356
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,210
Come on! Keep up!

357
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,400
You are here already.

358
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,480
- Stop weeping.
- Come on!

359
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,760
You should think about

360
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,920
how to please Elderly Master Xi

361
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,120
in order to survive,

362
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:43,880
and you may get a chance

363
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,030
to climb up the ladder.

364
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,880
Go inside!

365
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,760
All of you! Now!

366
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,680
Quickly!

367
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,530
Stop crying! Zip it!.

368
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:19,330
Don’t be scared.

369
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,210
Where were you?

370
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,460
What took you so long?

371
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,730
Noble Consort asked me

372
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,050
to bring pastries to the Western Palace.

373
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,050
What’s the matter, Your Highness?

374
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:54,510
Why do you

375
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,040
look preoccupied?

376
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,480
I don’t know.

377
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,070
Mother suddenly came by earlier,

378
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,950
and said something strange.

379
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,950
I’m worried

380
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,410
about Yan Xun’s safety.

381
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,070
His Excellency Yan Xun?

382
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,850
Will something bad

383
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,060
happen to him?

384
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,390
Go out and ask around

385
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,850
about what happened

386
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,170
at court today.

387
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,890
Yes. I’m going.

388
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,160
Wait.

389
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,140
Be extra careful.

390
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,540
Don’t let my mother see you.

391
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,770
I got it.

392
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,440
Marquis.

393
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,160
Why don’t you wait here first?

394
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,310
I’ll take our men

395
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,020
to enter the city and scout around.

396
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,760
Xun is always cautious,

397
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,320
and he wouldn’t ask me for help

398
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,420
unless necessary.

399
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,770
If what he said in the letter is true,

400
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,060
I will pay respects to the Emperor

401
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,770
tomorrow morning,

402
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,340
and ask him

403
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,630
what he is going to deal with me.

404
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,850
Marquis, that’s a bad idea.

405
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:32,890
Say no more.

406
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,700
We will stay the night here

407
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,440
and enter the city tomorrow morning.

408
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,570
Aye!

409
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,020
= Pleasure Pavilion =

410
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,060
Move!

411
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,080
Hurry up!

412
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,220
Go!

413
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,010
Keep up!

414
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,590
Get in!

415
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,330
Hurry up!

416
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:55,490
Come on!

417
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,390
Go inside!

418
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,760
Go inside, now!

419
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,300
Keep up!

420
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:01,890
Come on!

421
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,080
Be quiet! Move!

422
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,100
Come on!

423
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:07,880
Move!

424
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,550
Go!

425
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:11,560
Hurry up!

426
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,510
Come on! Keep up!

427
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,240
Hurry up!

428
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,020
Come on!

429
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:28,850
Come on!

430
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,010
Keep up!

431
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,400
Behave yourselves

432
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,590
and freshen up.

433
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,850
Follow the order if you want to live!

434
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,460
Just scatter around!

435
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,530
All of you! Now!

436
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,370
It’s time to change shifts.

437
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,620
Are you blind or what?

438
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,040
I... I’m sorry.

439
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,680
The blood incense

440
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,580
can make people hallucinate.

441
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,530
Luckily, I have inner force.

442
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,730
Bad news, Your Highness.

443
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:03,730
Something’s up.

444
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:04,830
What happened?

445
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,990
Yesterday, during His Majesty’s outing,

446
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,580
he passed by the city moat,

447
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,810
and saw someone fish a big stone

448
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,240
out of the river.

449
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,890
It was carved with treacherous remarks.

450
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,640
What do they say?

451
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:20,110
Wei is dying. Yan will rule the world.

452
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,240
Your Highness, are your feet alright?

453
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,460
Then what?

454
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:32,850
What happened?

455
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,800
What did father say?

456
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,500
His Majesty summoned Wei Guang, Zhao Gui,

457
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,250
and…

458
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,270
And Yuwen Huai.

459
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,190
But I couldn’t find out

460
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,540
the details about their conversation.

461
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,570
But His Majesty

462
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,840
killed General Song Zifu in the main hall.

463
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,040
Song Zifu came from Yanbei,

464
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,470
and he was a general there.

465
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,770
The north is Wei’s domain.

466
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,600
They want Marquis Dingbei to die

467
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,530
the most.

468
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,910
It’s been a while

469
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:10,870
since Zhao Dongting of warlord of Zhao
and his army

470
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:11,800
escorted Ms. Bai Sheng

471
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,780
back to Yanbei.

472
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,070
Father...

473
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,300
Father is going to kill them.

474
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,550
Your Highness, what should we do?

475
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,100
Yan Xun is in danger.

476
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,310
No wonder mother…

477
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,190
Mother said those things

478
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,130
to me and brother.

479
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:35,840
She must know

480
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,000
there is nothing we can do.

481
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:37,920
I...

482
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,120
I must tell Yan Xun.

483
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,140
Your Highness.

484
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,570
I have to save him.

485
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,560
He must leave.

486
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,530
And I’ll go with him.

487
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:45,170
Your Highness.

488
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,770
That’s his only chance of survival.

489
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:47,120
Your Highness.

490
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,370
- Please calm down.
- Back off!

491
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,050
Yan Xun’s life is on the line!

492
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,730
Don’t be a hindrance

493
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:53,330
if you can’t be of help.

494
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:07,730
Help me get changed.

495
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:08,970
Aye.

496
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,130
Young Master.

497
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,490
Have you confirmed the identity?

498
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,840
Young Master, it’s Marquis Dingbei.

499
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,970
I’m sure of it.

500
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,470
Do it.

501
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:49,500
Kill them all!

502
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,340
Kill them all!

503
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,460
Kill them all!

504
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,980
Kill them all!

505
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:21,660
Kill them all!

506
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,250
I have mustered 30 elites of Yanbei

507
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,400
to escort you to leave Chang’an overnight.

508
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,690
Thanks for the effort.

509
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,010
I’ll stop

510
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,970
at the west gate before ten

511
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,090
to pick up Xing’er and her two sisters.

512
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,410
Your Excellency,

513
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,610
will Xing’er come?

514
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,630
Rest assured. She’ll be there.

515
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,850
Your Excellency.

516
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,860
Say no more.

517
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,500
I will take them back to Yanbei

518
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,810
safe and sound.

519
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,250
Stop!

520
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:06,250
Who is it?

521
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,710
I’m sorry

522
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,320
that I didn’t recognize Your Highness.

523
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,450
I’m going out.

524
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:17,650
Move.

525
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,570
The gate has been locked.

526
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,390
Your Highness, may I ask

527
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,820
what this trip is for?

528
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:27,010
I said I’m going out.

529
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,850
Do I need to report to you?

530
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,500
Of course not.

531
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,390
Step aside!

532
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,600
But...

533
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,390
Opening the gate at night without permission

534
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,000
will get me killed.

535
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,440
If you don’t do it,

536
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,630
I’ll kill you now.

537
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:51,860
Stop!

538
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,390
Noble Consort.

539
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,380
Mother.

540
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,680
Where are you going?

541
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:15,580
I’m bored in the palace,

542
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,260
so I’d like to go out for a walk.

543
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,190
Nonsense.

544
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:26,580
Mother,

545
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,980
you knew it, right?

546
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,450
You knew that Yan Xun

547
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,320
would be in trouble.

548
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,630
So you said those things

549
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,670
to me and my brother.

550
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,160
Is that right?

551
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,090
Yes.

552
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,200
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

553
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,100
You know it now.

554
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,480
What’s your plan?

555
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,400
I’m going to tell Yan Xun.

556
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:43,710
Then what?

557
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,740
Then I’ll tell him to escape.

558
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,380
I’ll leave with him.

559
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,630
Your father has sent

560
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,730
the troops to Yanbei

561
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,710
to eliminate Marquis Dingbei and his family.

562
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:56,210
Aren’t you afraid of death?

563
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,580
Death is inevitable.

564
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,470
I’d rather

565
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,040
die with

566
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,090
Yan Xun!

567
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,560
Princess!

568
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,000
You are the Princess of Wei.

569
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,560
You have your own stance.

570
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,460
If things can be turned around,

571
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,320
you can spare no effort to help him.

572
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,260
But once the result is certain,

573
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:23,630
you should know

574
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,330
which side you should be on.

575
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,030
I told you about

576
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,520
the situation in Yanbei.

577
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,270
But you didn’t

578
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,280
take it to heart.

579
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,080
Can you use your brain for once?

580
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,750
But if I don’t go

581
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,530
and tell Yan Xun now,

582
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,770
he will die, mother.

583
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,830
Whatever you do won’t make a difference.

584
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,840
Why?

585
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,570
Why should it end up like this?

586
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,730
I don’t want this to happen!

587
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,770
Mother, I’m begging you.

588
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,460
Please let me out.

589
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,700
Let me save Yan Xun.

590
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,670
Please!

591
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,330
I swear

592
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,210
I will behave myself from now on.

593
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,360
I will obey

594
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,520
whatever you say.

595
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:13,830
I swear.

596
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,130
Yan Xun is the only love

597
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,850
of my life.

598
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,210
I cannot watch him die.

599
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,390
I can’t lose him, mother.

600
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,640
Please save him.

601
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:25,870
You will have to face this

602
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,080
sooner or later.

603
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,950
Better a small loss than a long sorrow.

604
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,660
Once you pull through this,

605
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:34,520
you’ll be fine.

606
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,390
Escort Princess back to her chamber.

607
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,000
Mother!

608
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,240
- Mother!
- Aye.

609
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:39,740
Mother.

610
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,470
Please save Yan Xun!

611
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,310
Princess!

612
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,790
He will die, mother!

613
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:44,950
Princess, please go back.

614
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,140
Princess!

615
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,540
Princess!

616
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,000
- Let me go.
- Princess!

617
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,560
Let me go! I have to go out!

618
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,950
- Let me out!
- Princess!

619
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,620
= Pleasure Pavilion =

620
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,080
Bastard!

621
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,000
How dare you!

622
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,600
Do you know...

623
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:31,740
Do you know who I am?

624
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,370
Guards!

625
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,280
Guards!

626
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,570
Kill her!

627
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,530
From now on,

628
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:46,050
we can look after each other and never part again.

629
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,370
This is for Zhixiang.

630
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,670
Watching you eat makes me happier

631
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,190
than eating it myself.

632
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,060
This braised pork

633
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,970
is the best thing I’ve ever had

634
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,370
in my life.

635
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:28,670
This is for Linxi

636
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:31,920
and all the innocent girls

637
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,440
that you harmed and killed.

638
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,570
Yuwen Xi,

639
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,440
go to hell!

640
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,700
Heaven didn’t end you,

641
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:42,750
so I’ll do it myself.

642
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,870
Help!

643
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:19,840
Help! Help!

644
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,080
I am Xing’er from Qingshan House.

645
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,100
That old bastard Yuwen Xi

646
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,360
was an animal

647
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,990
who harmed tons of innocent girls.

648
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,350
Young Master Yue sent me to kill him.

649
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:31,940
No matter what the people at Hongshan House

650
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,250
do to you,

651
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,640
you cannot leak a word.

652
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,680
Young Master Yue will get you out.

653
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,180
Got it?

654
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:41,210
Yes. Yes.

655
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,090
Master!

656
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,870
Master!

657
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,710
Master!

658
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,240
What happened?

659
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,070
Young Master Yue sent Xing’er

660
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:17,320
to kill Master.

661
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:19,470
Young Master Yue?

662
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,490
Every one of you is one in a million

663
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,470
from Yanbei.

664
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:36,310
Tonight,

665
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,490
I’m going to

666
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,470
need your help

667
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,970
to leave Chang’an and go home.

668
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,480
This journey can be dangerous.

669
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,420
You must be extra careful.

670
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,640
Once we arrive at Yanbei,

671
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,570
we can drink from dawn to dusk.

672
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:55,690
We will protect you

673
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:58,600
at all costs!

674
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,430
Fill the bowl!

675
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,120
To all of you.

676
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,050
To Your Excellency.

677
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,230
Your Excellency,

678
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,960
it is time.

679
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,970
Report!

680
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,170
Your Excellency,

681
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:46,600
something happened in the city.

682
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,850
It’s important.

683
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:49,120
Speak.

684
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,130
Yuwen Xi at Hongshan House

685
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:51,430
was assassinated.

686
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,370
The killer is

687
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:53,540
a maid, named Xing’er.

688
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,110
Your Excellency, don’t.

689
00:42:58,750 --> 00:42:59,690
Zhong Yu,

690
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,920
you and the others leave as planned.

691
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,440
I’ll meet you

692
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,240
at the west gate

693
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,310
before ten.

694
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:07,200
Your Excellency, we don’t have much time.

695
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:07,900
Enough!

696
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,610
It’s imperative.

697
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,040
I must save Xing’er.
