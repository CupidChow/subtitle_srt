Go away.

23
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,280
There’s a flaw.

24
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,600
You’re the flaw yourself.

25
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,740
People only know you’re not

26
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,710
related to your grandfather,

27
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,250
and he’s very strict with you.

28
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,650
But I know

29
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,570
he’s

30
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,030
the only one you care about.

31
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,270
If your grandfather were really dead,

32
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,900
you’d definitely spit blood,

33
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,850
no clothes changing, no bathing,

34
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:45,520
with hair dishevelled,

35
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,090
stinking all over.

36
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,070
But now,

37
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,280
you look sad in a normal way.

38
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,600
It’s too normal to be real.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,490
You can fool others,

40
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,890
but not me.

41
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,340
Trying to be smart

42
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,110
is not necessarily a good thing.

43
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,050
You know it’s a mess

44
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,600
and still get in.

45
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,300
I may get you in trouble.

46
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,390
Alright.

47
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,320
In the future,

48
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,230
be sure to tell me

49
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,520
if you need any help.

50
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,440
It’s a struggle inside the Yuwen family.

51
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,070
I’m able to handle it.

52
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,950
Honestly, I hate to

53
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,130
get involved in family infightings.

54
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,960
I also know

55
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,290
who the beast is.

56
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:33,740
I’m just reluctant

57
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,970
to join them.

58
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,090
What I want

59
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,680
is to be an eagle hovering freely

60
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,120
above the grassland in Western Regions.

61
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,830
What about you?

62
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,250
What do you want to be?

63
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,390
There’s never

64
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,040
a choice for me.

65
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,020
Well.

66
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,150
It’s said that Yuwen Xi

67
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,850
will come to visit you,

68
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,060
the grief-stricken Young Master

69
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,550
of Qingshan House.

70
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,670
Also,

71
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,900
as your elder,

72
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,250
he’ll offer you a girl bedmate.

73
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:07,780
Be careful.

74
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,420
There’ll be a girl for you,

75
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,210
yet you don’t seem

76
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,420
interested.

77
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,830
Tell me.

78
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,980
What type of girl do you like?

79
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,900
A sugar sweet

80
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,950
little girl

81
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,550
or

82
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,400
an elegant lady from a noble family?

83
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,570
Could it be

84
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,150
the hot girls in the brothel of the Western Regions?

85
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,830
As for women,

86
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,910
I have no choice either.

87
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,130
What about that Wild Kitten?

88
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,360
Mr. Cold. You’re really cold.

89
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:22,960
Isn’t this Yuwen family’s

90
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,100
secret healing medicine?

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,750
It’s mine now.

92
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,840
Your Highness. This medicine is precious.

93
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,430
Even Young Master is reluctant to use it.

94
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,110
But I am willing to use it.

95
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,240
Xiaoba. What’s this?

96
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,060
This is the item

97
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,000
Zhixiang kept for Xiaoliu. It’s very important.

98
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,490
Why haven’t you given it to Xiaoliu?

99
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,710
You know nothing.

100
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,070
This item

101
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,230
may have something to do

102
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,160
with her origin.

103
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,710
Now Linxi is dead.

104
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,210
So is Zhixiang.

105
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:14,920
Xiaoba.

106
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,120
Don’t you want Xiaoliu

107
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,690
find her family?

108
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,390
I didn’t say that.

109
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,770
Xiaoliu. You’re back.

110
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,810
Xiaoliu, your...

111
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,500
Is this where the maids live?

112
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:48,780
Yes.

113
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,580
Do you always come?

114
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,290
No.

115
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,450
Get away.

116
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:02,920
Make way.

117
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,780
Get away!

118
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,430
Get away!

119
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,280
Go!

120
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,850
Get away!

121
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,770
Take her away.

122
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:12,980
What are you doing?

123
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,780
What are you doing?

124
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,120
Why are you taking her away?

125
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,910
Why?

126
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,350
Ms. Song is missing.

127
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,490
Someone saw you fight with her

128
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,120
by the lake last night.

129
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,210
I suspect you had something to do with this.

130
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,160
I’ll take you to loosen up

131
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,650
and have a talk.

132
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,520
Jing Xiaoliu.

133
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,760
You’d better behave yourself

134
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,840
and go with me.

135
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,810
Otherwise,

136
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,720
your sisters

137
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,960
will suffer a little bit.

138
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,610
Sir Siliu.

139
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,480
What are you talking about?

140
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,450
You also said

141
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,960
we’re just little girls.

142
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,440
Ms. Song is missing.

143
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,520
It has nothing to do with us.

144
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,890
She might run away.

145
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,130
What do you want to know

146
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,050
from us?

147
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,740
Besides, you want to take us away.

148
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,050
Do you have any evidence?

149
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,110
Yes.

150
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,850
Do I need any evidence to take you away?

151
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,890
My word is the evidence.

152
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:58,970
Take her away.

153
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,120
Go.

154
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,470
Don’t you dare.

155
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,420
I’m teaching maids a lesson.

156
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,980
Sorry for disturbing you, Prince Yan Xun.

157
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,710
Not at all.

158
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,780
But your boldness

159
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,620
really impressed me.

160
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,090
Sorry. Sorry.

161
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,480
How about

162
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,270
you teach me a lesson as well?

163
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,990
No. No. I dare not.

164
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,480
Days ago,

165
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,480
someone gave me

166
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,820
a fine horse.

167
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,210
It runs as fast as a bird, with no dust caught.

168
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,660
That horse is the best of best.

169
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,520
But this morning

170
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,940
I found it was in low spirits

171
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,740
and listless.

172
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,540
Physician said

173
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,900
the weather was too hot.

174
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,220
I guess

175
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,790
it must be that

176
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,680
someone was jealous

177
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,250
of my fine horse

178
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,170
and hurt it behind my back.

179
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,390
What do you think?

180
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,440
Well, it must be

181
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,500
as you said.

182
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,830
So, it must be that

183
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,270
someone hurt my horse behind my back.

184
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,150
You’re insightful, Your Highness.

185
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,200
That’s simple then.

186
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,300
You two.

187
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,890
Take him out

188
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,460
and flog him 100 times.

189
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,280
Take him back to me

190
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,050
if he’s still alive.

191
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,370
No... Your Highness.

192
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:18,890
Your Highness.

193
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,490
Why are you punishing me?

194
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,630
Someone hurt my horse.

195
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,210
I thought it’s your doing.

196
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,330
You deserve this.

197
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,550
Your Highness.

198
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,430
I didn’t even go to your mansion.

199
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,260
How could I do that?

200
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,260
Your Highness.

201
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,900
You... You can’t do this

202
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,220
without any evidence.

203
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,610
Do I need any evidence to beat you?

204
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,590
My word is the evidence.

205
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,220
What are you waiting for?

206
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,050
Fengmian. Execute him now.

207
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,560
Your Highness! Your Highness!

208
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,950
Your Highness! Your Highness!

209
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,670
I’m begging you.

210
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,080
I dare not do this again! Your Highness!

211
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,740
Mercy, Your Highness!

212
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,910
Your Highness!

213
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,370
The Jing ladies!

214
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,770
The Jing ladies! Ladies!

215
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,050
The Jing ladies! I’m begging you.

216
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,140
Please!

217
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,410
Please put in a good word

218
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,370
for me.

219
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,140
Please! I’m begging you.

220
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,640
I was wrong, Miss Jing!

221
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,460
His Highness told you to get lost.

222
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,710
What? Won’t you get lost?

223
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,090
Fengmian.

224
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,370
- Yes!
- I’m going! I’m going!

225
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,000
I’m going now.

226
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,710
Go! Go!

227
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,170
Thanks for saving us, Your Highness.

228
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,860
That’s it?

229
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,820
That’s it.

230
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,220
Won’t you thank me?

231
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,730
I did.

232
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,770
Was that the way you thank me?

233
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,850
Not even a cup of tea for me?

234
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,570
Your Highness.

235
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,710
You may look around the room.

236
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,100
You think we can offer you tea here?

237
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,270
I don’t care. I’m thirsty.

238
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,770
You two. Go.

239
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,600
Go get some tea for me.

240
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,240
Aye.

241
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:06,960
Don’t.

242
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,310
If it’s found by the butler,

243
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,530
we’ll be scolded again.

244
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,210
Your Highness.

245
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,360
If you want some tea,

246
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,500
please go to the superior room.

247
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,240
There’s certainly good tea for you

248
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,210
to enjoy.

249
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,360
We’re just some

250
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,520
maids,

251
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,060
too humble to serve tea

252
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,250
for a Prince.

253
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,110
Alright.

254
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,230
I don’t care.

255
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,020
I...

256
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,510
I...

257
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,750
I’m waiting here.

258
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,360
Wait a moment, Your Highness.

259
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,730
I’m gonna make tea for you.

260
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,490
Come on.

261
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,910
Your little sister

262
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,070
is more attentive than you.

263
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,460
I saved you.

264
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,830
Is this how you treat me?

265
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,840
Counting this time in,

266
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,500
I’ve saved you three times.

267
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,570
I really appreciate it, Your Highness.

268
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,400
What’s wrong with you?

269
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,430
You wear a long face.

270
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,530
Seems I owe you

271
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,520
a debt.

272
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,050
My brother just passed away.

273
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,380
So did my sister.

274
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,060
Just now I almost

275
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,540
lost my life as well.

276
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,220
If you are here

277
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,040
for a joke from me,

278
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,410
please pardon me.

279
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,730
I’m not in the mood today.

280
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,910
This medicine is effective for wounds.

281
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,430
You may keep it.

282
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,080
He just saved me twice.

283
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,340
Leave it here.

284
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,130
OK.

285
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,250
Young Master. He still has nerve to come.

286
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,310
Get me that thing.

287
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:57,600
Aye.

288
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,510
Here comes Elderly Master Xi!

289
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,080
It’s been over ten years.

290
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,330
Qingshan House is still the same

291
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,190
as ten years ago.

292
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,720
Nothing changed.

293
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,790
Back then, my elder brother sat here,

294
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,560
right on this seat.

295
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,520
My second brother

296
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,560
sat there.

297
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,050
I sat there.

298
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,170
Now both of my brothers

299
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,030
have gone,

300
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,620
leaving me alone.

301
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,530
Granduncle. What brings you here

302
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,310
today?

303
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,470
To visit you.

304
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,600
Your grandfather was gone.

305
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,690
There’s no master in Qingshan House.

306
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,380
Right?

307
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,880
You’re all alone

308
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,040
in such a big mansion.

309
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,050
I’m afraid you’re bullied by others.

310
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,410
You worry too much, granduncle.

311
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,690
My grandfather was gone,

312
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,720
but I’m still here.

313
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,340
The maids in Qingshan House

314
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,410
are obedient to me.

315
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,710
Don’t bother worrying about me.

316
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,190
That doesn’t make sense.

317
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,150
Originally

318
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,550
you were the firstborn son of the Second Branch.

319
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,630
Sixteen years ago,

320
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,660
your mother went crazy,

321
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,990
and you were adopted by the First Branch.

322
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,470
But I’ve checked the family records.

323
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,700
In the inheritance papers,

324
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,980
there’s no signature

325
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,630
of your biological father, General Zhuguo.

326
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,730
Thus, your identity

327
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,920
as the firstborn grandson of the First Branch

328
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,830
isn’t valid.

329
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,870
Boy.

330
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,310
That’s why

331
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,580
you can’t take Qingshan House

332
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,690
as your own home.

333
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,550
Grandfather raised me up.

334
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,430
Qingshan House

335
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,790
will be in my charge.

336
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,250
It is not decided

337
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,330
by you alone

338
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,010
on this.

339
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,010
My words won’t count, of course.

340
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,420
But if His Majesty orders me

341
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,830
to take charge of Qingshan House,

342
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,220
then I’ll be in charge.

343
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,320
- Well...
- Here comes the imperial edict!

344
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,550
You got someone back you up,

345
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,460
and even got a secret edict specially.

346
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,740
Even an outsider cares about you so much.

347
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,470
As your elder,

348
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,850
shouldn’t I care about you?

349
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,890
Yue.

350
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,350
You’ve come of age.

351
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,380
As the master of Qingshan House,

352
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,290
you need a woman to serve you, don’t you?

353
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,770
Come on. I have a girl for you.

354
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,150
Jinxin. Come here.

355
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,770
Young Master Yue.

356
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,850
Why don’t you say anything, Yue?

357
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,990
If you don’t say anything, I will

358
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,240
make the decision for you.

359
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,800
It’d be disrespectful

360
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,040
if I refuse.

361
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,040
Not only the girl you offer me,

362
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,040
but also those from the three brothers
in the Second Branch,

363
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,330
rewarded by Concubine Zhao

364
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,670
and forcefully given by all the relatives

365
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,570
in Chang’an,

366
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,600
I’ll accept them all.

367
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,730
Qingshan House will be

368
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,850
full of beauties soon.

369
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,230
What do you think?

370
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,350
No way.

371
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,910
How can a teenager

372
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,510
indulge in debauchery?

373
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:48,030
Your health is the most important.

374
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,590
The one I give you is enough.

375
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,540
The elders are all so kind.

376
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,510
How can I refuse them?

377
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,840
How about this?

378
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,930
Rather than being picked by me,

379
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,990
they may have a contest.

380
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,710
The winner will serve me in my room.

381
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,390
It

382
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,510
neither impairs your kindness

383
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,290
nor offends others.

384
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,500
What do you think?

385
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,830
I’m good at beauty contests.

386
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,000
Besides Jinxin,

387
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,360
Copper Bell and Silver Bell from Yuwen’s Mansion

388
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,640
will also join it.

389
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,650
They’ve been serving us.

390
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,980
Don’t forget them.

391
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,670
Or they’ll feel unfair.

392
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,520
OK.

393
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,780
Every girl can join it

394
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,390
as long as she wants.

395
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,110
Are you satisfied?

396
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,390
Of course.

397
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,650
The livelier it is here,

398
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,990
the more satisfied I am.

399
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:50,690
If he weren’t

400
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,810
the elder in Yuwen family,

401
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,980
I’d definitely kill him.

402
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,210
Yueqi.

403
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:58,860
Tell people

404
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,350
I’m gonna pick a bedchamber maid.

405
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,230
Aye.

406
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,820
It’s Elderly Master Zhuo’s funeral today.

407
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,320
Servants all think

408
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,590
he was murdered by Linxi.

409
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,240
In their eyes,

410
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,770
the lives of Linxi

411
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:30,680
and Zhixiang

412
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,320
are as cheap as paper money.

413
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,160
If Ms. Song’s death

414
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,920
was found out by Young Master Huai,

415
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,550
we’d certainly die.

416
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,390
Looks like we can’t

417
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,790
stay here anymore.

418
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,040
What should we do?

419
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,190
Young Master Yue is cold-hearted.

420
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,810
Elderly Master Zhuo just died,

421
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,530
but now he gets to pick a bedchamber maid.

422
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,690
Men are all the same.

423
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:54,960
Badly, we are

424
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,530
slave maids wearing Iron Bell.

425
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,210
Otherwise, I would join the contest.

426
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,340
If I were picked,

427
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,340
I’d end him on bed

428
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,830
to avenge Linxi’s death.

429
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,200
Entering Qingshan House

430
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,060
is the only way to get away from Yuwen Huai,

431
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,090
to protect my sisters,

432
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,210
and avenge my family’s death.

433
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,850
Even the weak grass

434
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,170
can resist a strong rock.

435
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,640
Although I’m a slave with Iron Bell,

436
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,050
I’m gonna give it a shot.

437
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,850
Next.

438
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,740
What’s your name?

439
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,390
- A girl from Hongshan House
- Jinxin.

440
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,800
also comes for the contest.

441
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,650
It’s forced by Elderly Master Xi.

442
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,310
Since Elderly Master Xi made the offer,

443
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,930
Young Master couldn’t refuse.

444
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,860
Reluctantly, he agreed to let her in.

445
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:53,830
OK.

446
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,080
Such a trash

447
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,530
dreams to serve on Young Master’s bed.

448
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,350
Jinxin.

449
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,690
Just let her stay here for one day.

450
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,240
Anyway, she’ll be knocked out

451
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,820
in the contest tomorrow.

452
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,420
- How come she is here?
- Yeah.

453
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,870
She’s an Iron Bell.

454
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:12,860
Exactly.

455
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,120
How can she come here?

456
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,300
- Yeah.
- Ridiculous.

457
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,930
It’s not somewhere she can come.

458
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,260
What are you doing?

459
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,120
Young Master.

460
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,410
What’s the matter?

461
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:36,490
Young Master.

462
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,130
Linxi’s sister, Jing Xiaoliu,

463
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,870
also comes for the contest.

464
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,410
We can’t even drive her away.

465
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,800
She said she’d kneel until you

466
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,950
allow her to attend it.

467
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,040
An Iron Bell

468
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,710
dreams to attend the contest.

469
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,510
Overconfident.

470
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,950
Let her kneel

471
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,080
as long as she wants.

472
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,630

00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,210
and serve you.

521
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,640
Raise your head.

522
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,530
Give me a reason.

523
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,060
Why should I make an exception

524
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,060
for you?

525
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,260
The only way to keep my life

526
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,700
is to stay by your side.

527
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,660
That’s your reason.

528
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,330
To stay in Qingshan House,

529
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,410
there’s only one way,

530
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,990
being my bedchamber maid.

531
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,080
Aye.

532
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,420
Do you know

533
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,260
what a bedchamber maid is?

534
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,140
I don’t know, Young Master.

535
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,400
Sleeping with your master.

536
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,540
Can you do that?

537
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,300
Aye.

538
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,560
You witnessed

539
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,970
I killed your brother.

540
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,350
You still agree to serve me in my bed.

541
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,450
Do you have any dignity?

542
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,070
Tell me.

543
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,010
A maid has no right for dignity.

544
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:34,750
I only wish you could keep me alive.

545
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,340
Yueqi.

546
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,160
Pass my order.

547
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,970
Jing Xiaoliu is allowed

548
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,530
to attend this contest.

549
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:07,180
Aye.

550
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,890
Get up. Take a good rest.

551
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,270
Come to attend the contest tomorrow.

552
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,880
Come in.

553
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,500
Young Master.

554
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,250
What’s the matter?

555
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,110
I have something to tell you.

556
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,040
A little bird tells me

557
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,070
Yuwen Yue showed extra mercy

558
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,950
on that Jing Xiaoliu,

559
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,610
the girl who always

560
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,250
spoils our business,

561
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,190
to let her attend the bedchamber maid contest.

562
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,940
Jing Xiaoliu?

563
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,830
What a little girl.

564
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:02,900
Finish her,

565
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,610
lest she makes us more trouble.

566
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,810
Young Master.

567
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,060
I have another thing to report.

568
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,920
Speak.

569
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,550
Aye.

570
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,920
A cook reported to me that

571
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,970
the other night when Ms. Song missed,

572
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,510
Xiaoliu and her two sisters

573
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,960
had a fight with Ms. Song by the lake.

574
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,560
Then

575
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,500
the cook heard someone falling into water.

576
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,120
Why didn’t you tell me about it?

577
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,900
Are you up to

578
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,100
something else?

579
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,070
No. No.

580
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:25,540
Young Master.

581
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,780
I dare not! I dare not!

582
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,650
I just think

583
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:28,900
you’ve been too busy lately.

584
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,550
- I dare not.
- Cut it out.

585
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,150
I know everything

586
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,510
in your mind.

587
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:35,920
No! No! Nothing!

588
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,100
Young Master, please forgive me!

589
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,680
Mercy, Young Master!

590
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,690
Stop! Stop!

591
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,980
That lass.

592
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,510
Even Ms. Song was no match for her.

593
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,690
She’s no ordinary girl.

594
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,270
Young Master.

595
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,670
Thank you, Young Master.

596
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,700
Young Master. In my opinion,

597
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,700
if Jinzhu fails her mission

598
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,610
against Yuwen Yue,

599
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,640
we may let Jing Xiaoliu do it.

600
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,170
Take her as a pawn.

601
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,050
Also,

602
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,480
Yuwen Yue killed her brother Linxi.

603
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,510
She’ll definitely try to revenge.

604
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,580
Just wait and see the show.

605
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,420
= Qingshan House =

606
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,800
Who do you think will win the contest today?

607
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,190
It’s hard to tell.

608
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,560
Sis.

609
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,490
You’re prettier than anyone else.

610
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,890
Here comes the idiot! Here comes the idiot!

611
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:53,290
Here comes the idiot! Here comes the idiot!

612
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,730
Here comes the idiot! Here comes the idiot!

613
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,620
Who knows what she’s thinking?

614
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,670
Fool! Fool!

615
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,840
Fool! Fool!

616
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,850
- Fool!
- Who do you mean the fool?

617
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,770
Although your chain is gold,

618
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:27,830
you are still not free

619
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,670
as I am.

620
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,030
You must be upset as well.

621
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,330
Thanks, you’re so kind! Thanks, you’re so kind!

622
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,880
I’m free! I’m free!

623
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,520
She freed it!

624
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:51,430
So bold she is!

625
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:53,840
Who does she

626
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,780
think she is?

627
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,320
Right.

628
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,580
Is she crazy?

629
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,980
- Yeah.
- Ridiculous.

630
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,820
How dare you take my rope?

631
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,650
Here comes Young Master! Here comes Young Master!

632

Here comes Young Master! Here comes Young Master!

633
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,920
You’re dressed like that.

634
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,290
What a disgrace!

635
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,730
Go with me and get dressed.

636
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,460
Young Master.

637
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,370
This girl doesn’t know martial arts,

638
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,460
but she’s agile.

639
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,390
Her moves are amazing.

640
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,180
She’s made for martial arts.

Young Master.

This is a list of girls

644
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,040
from Elderly Master Xi of the Third Branch.

645
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,190
They’re skillful at music and dance,

646
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,260
as well as pleasure seeking.

647

What do you think?

648
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,810
I want

649
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,330
a bedchamber maid,

650
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,370
not a courtesan.

651
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,800
Order from Young Master.

652
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,170
The contest today

653
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:16,500
is to select someone

654
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,780
who can serve tea, write,

655
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,330
and play Chupu Chess.

656
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,210
There will be three games.

657
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,850
Those losing two games in a row
will be eliminated.

658
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,070
In the end, one extra game will be taken

659
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,640
to determine the winner.

660
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,550
White goes first.

661
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,660
Black can go first as well.

662
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:49,460
Go ahead.

663
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:28,670
Why don’t you play?

664
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,500
I’m not good at it.

665
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:33,900
Aren’t you?

666
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,080
Then you’ll lose badly.

667
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,270
There are still two games.

668
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,270
These humble maids are from the outside.

669
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,540
In terms of tea making,

670
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,330
they don’t even come close to you.

671
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,530
You’ll win for sure.

672
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,120
Absolutely.

673
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,690
I’ve learned quite a lot

674
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,180
about tea making.

675
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,540
Next team.

676
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,360
We’ll just take a look.

677
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,520
Nothing will happen to Qingshan House.

678
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,470
Please.

679
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:36,570
Go. Leave here.

680
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,230
Prince Yan Xun.

681
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,530
You two, come with me.

682
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:47,050
Please, Your Highness. Please, ladies.

683
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,410
Good.

684
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:52,000
To make tea, the water goes first.

685
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,350
Choose the water before making tea.

686
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:55,120
This girl

687
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,870
uses the fresh well water,

688
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,810
just as the hermits do.

689
00:34:59,010 --> 00:34:59,800
Impressive.

690
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,520
Mr. Cold.

691
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,270
Your cheeks look rosy.

692
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,260
You’ll have a flower-like girl today.

693
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,350
Prince.

694
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:09,590
Enjoy the flowers then.

695
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:11,850
Be seated.

696
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,930
My pleasure.

697
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,630
Who made this tea?

698
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:48,900
Me.

699
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,200
Tell me. How did you

700
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,750
make this tea?

701
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:57,950
Please look, Young Master.

702
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,570
I used the well water to make it.

703
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,870
But the water at noon

704
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,470
is full of heat.

705
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,780
So I used mentha

706
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,850
to screen it

707
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,180
to get rid of

708
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,200
the excessive heat.

709
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,090
Good.

710
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,050
She’s bold and considerate,

711
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:17,680
learning in practice.

712
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,230
Shouldn’t she win

713
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,560
this game?

714
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,530
Since you say so,

715
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,260
that’s it.

716
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:30,770
Great!

717
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,100
Those losing two games in a row leave right away.

718
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,400
What’s the next?

719
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,530
This is Sanskrit sutra.

720
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,900
You have one hour

721
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,750
to memorize it,

722
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,680
and another hour

723
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,650
to write it down from your memory.

724
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,660
Let’s see who can write it

725
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,610
from your memory without any mistake.

726
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,910
It’s so long.

727
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,580
What to do? What to do?

728
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,580
Xiaoliu can’t read.

729
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,840
Yeah.

730
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,920
It’s so hard.

731
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,690
One hour is too short.

732
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:07,780
Yeah.

733
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,480
How should we do it?

734
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,440
Time is up.

735
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,490
So soon?

736
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,030
- I didn’t memorize it.
- I didn’t memorize it.

737
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,510
- What to do?
- I didn’t memorize it.

738
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,430
What is she doing?

739
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:23,260
Young Master. Obviously she can’t write,

740
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,860
and doesn’t know how to use the brush pen.

741
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:25,810
But now

742
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,290
she gets the hang of it.

743
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,150
Young Master.

744
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,450
These two are the best.

745
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,670
Who

746
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,230
wrote this?

747
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,440
I did.

748
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:14,840
Impossible.

749
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,150
She had been peeking at others’,

750
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,430
and didn’t write until the end.

751
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,400
Presumably,

752
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,980
she copied it from others.

753
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,220
Did she copy it? From whom?

754
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,070
She didn’t make any mistake,

755
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,750
yet you all made a lot. Why?

756
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,490
Perhaps

757
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,380
she secretly saw it beforehand.

758
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,080
How bold!

759
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:32,660
It’s the Garland sutra

760
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,120
brought by Indian Zen Master Bhadra

761
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,610
who visited here yesterday.

762
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,920
This is his first trip to our state.

763
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:38,800
No one

764
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,130
has ever seen the Garland sutra before.

765
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,110
You said she cheated.

766
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:43,270
You mean we didn’t keep

767
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:44,230
the sutra well?

768
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,580
I dare not.

769
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,440
Tell me.

770
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:49,140
Why didn’t you sign your name?

771
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,200
Perhaps

772
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,860
she can’t read at all.

773
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:56,400
If she can’t read,

774
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,530
how will she serve Young Master?

775
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,260
I didn’t hear

776
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,530
a signature was required.

777
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,970
The rules said

778
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,360
one hour to memorize

779
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,950
and another hour to write it down from memory.

780
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,180
You’re twisting the rules.

781
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,090
I’m not twisting the rules.

782
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,100
I just followed the orders,

783
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,740
and did it

784
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,980
as per the rules.

785
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,660
Is there anything wrong with it?

786
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:16,990
OK.

787
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:20,270
I’ll give you another chance.

788
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,510
If you can sign your name here,

789
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:23,970
you’ll be the winner.

790
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,230
Will you keep your word?

791
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,110
Certainly.

792
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,300
= Jing Xiaoliu =

793
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,630
You’re a man

794
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:07,890
of your word.

795
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,860
The winner of the contest is Jing Xiaoliu!

796
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,030
- Great!
- Great!

797
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:19,450
Dismissed.

798
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:20,370
Aye.

799
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:22,430
- Let’s go.
- Go.

800
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:24,880
How come she won?

801
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,230
- Yes.
- It’s unfair.

802
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:36,380
= Qingshan House =

803
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,210
You don’t know any rules.

804
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:16,960
What are you standing there for?

805
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:27,510
Tell me.

806
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:29,150
Why did you

807
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,490
want to be my bedchamber maid?

808
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,370
Young Master.

809
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,650
I promised my elder sister

810
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:40,990
to take care of my younger sisters.

811
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,600
Is it worth?

812
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:44,800
Of course.

813
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:48,700
Alright. You have my word.

814
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:50,800
If you can

815
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,410
pass all my tests,

816
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,170
I will let them go.

817
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:57,110
Thank you, Young Master.

818
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,020
Come. Shave my beard.

819
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,240
