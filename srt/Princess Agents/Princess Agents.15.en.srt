16
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,610
Young Master Yuwen, you’re a noble man.

17
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,190
Why are you peeping

18
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,480
like scoundrels?

19
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,790
Don’t you feel ashamed?

20
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,700
Come in, please.

21
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,630
Young Master Huai,

22
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,630
you must come with a question.

23
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,820
If you fail

24
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,270
to ask the question,

25
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,420
shall I guess?

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,690
You hate it most that

27
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,830
you’re a son of a concubine?

28
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,510
You’re right.

29
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,810
That’s what I hate most.

30
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,030
Young Master Huai.

31
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,500
In a man’s life,

32
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,340
he suffers the most

33
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,790
when he fails to use his great talent,

34
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,770
like an awl in a bag.

35
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,720
Most hatefully,

36
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,800
such unfairness comes

37
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,770
when a man is born.

38
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,300
Continue.

39
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,920
God disposes.

40
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,590
But man proposes.

41
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,530
I just fear

42
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,450
you would yield to your fate

43
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,870
and always live in servitude.

44
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,490
Missy.

45
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,660
I’m already going this far.

46
00:03:59,250 --> 00:03:59,940
What better way

47
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,310
could you have?

48
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,200
Young Master Huai.

49
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,260
I’m afraid you’re in the wrong place.

50
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,650
This isn’t a place for fortune-telling.

51
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,180
And you’re asking the wrong guy.

52
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,830
I’m not a fortune-teller, either.

53
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,830
For my close friend,

54
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,540
I’ll bare my heart.

55
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,220
Young Master Huai,

56
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,270
could I be your close friend?

57
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,890
Adversity tries a friend.

58
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,740
Could you be a great man?

59
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,790
Time tries all.

60
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,370
The Intel Building was nearly invaded.

61
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,230
It was my fault.

62
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,050
I failed to take precautions.

63
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,230
Over so many years,

64
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,560
the Eye of Intel has been completely protected.

65
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,730
No problem has happened.

66
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,810
This time, a female spy from Liang

67
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,230
broke in alone.

68
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,160
If any secret is leaked,

69
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,390
the whole nation

70
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,720
will be stuck in despair.

71
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,290
What worries me most is that

72
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,130
the spy from Liang

73
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,540
had free access to Qingshan House.

74
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,940
Someone on the inside must have helped her.

75
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,020
This party was held

76
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,690
by Yuwen Huai with Hongshan House.

77
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,260
Seems like he invited you

78
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,120
so that you could be away.

79
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,380
At the party,

80
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,600
he didn’t seem like

81
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,160
he knew what was happening.

82
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,800
In this way,

83
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,840
he could be a mere chessman.

84
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,890
He can’t know anything

85
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,000
about the secret passage of the Intel Building.

86
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,260
So,

87
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,800
who controls everything in Hongshan House?

88
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,070
Yuwen Xi?

89
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,290
If there’s a traitor

90
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,020
in our family,

91
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,030
there’ll be a big problem.

92
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,700
Have you got a solution, Grandpa?

93
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,770
It’s serious.

94
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,720
I need to think carefully about it.

95
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,550
One more question.

96
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,220
The maid Xing’er.

97
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,280
You made her

98
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,780
a spy?

99
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,010
Grandpa, to be honest,

100
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,150
this time,

101
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,510
Xing’er helped

102
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,530
to defend the Eye of Intel.

103
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,670
Through this accident,

104
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,020
I realize that

105
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,150
she is really

106
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,310
a rough diamond.

107
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,560
Well, since you want it,

108
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,370
I’ll give her a chance.

109
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,200
Thank you, Grandpa.

110
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,280
Leave me.

111
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,630
Aye.

112
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:08,790
Master.

113
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,120
Young Master Yue had a chance

114
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,360
to catch the spy from Liang.

115
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:12,400
But,

116
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,540
he abandoned the chance,

117
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:16,800
just to protect Xing’er.

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,130
We can’t leave her alive anymore.

119
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,460
I can’t let my grandson

120
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,780
make the same mistake as I did.

121
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,080
Don’t you go and make her happy?

122
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:47,520
I won’t.

123
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,920
Who else will go, then?

124
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,910
Whoever wants it.

125
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,330
I’m not going, anyway. Go yourself.

126
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,890
You annoyed her.

127
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,110
You should be going, I guess.

128
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,120
Yuan Song.

129
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,290
We’re friends.

130
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,000
You know

131
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,240
what I want.

132
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,330
If you match her and me in a wrong way,

133
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,310
who will take responsibility?

134
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,190
I’d like to ask you.

135
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,360
What’s the problem with Chun?

136
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,060
She’s a good girl.

137
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,720
But she’s like a sister in my heart.

138
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:27,870
I don’t care.

139
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,510
We’re friends.

140
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,530
You must

141
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:33,970
make her happy

142
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:34,920
for my sake.

143
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,540
I’m leaving.

144
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:40,710
Come on!

145
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,790
Why did you throw my stone?

146
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,180
It was just a stone.

147
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,540
I can’t throw it?

148
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,430
- Fine.
- You can’t.

149
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,820
I’m leaving, then.

150
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,580
All right, Chun.

151
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,420
You’re like when you were little.

152
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,300
You just want a gift.

153
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,330
I’ll give it to you

154
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,120
some other day.

155
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,800
No. I don’t want it anymore.

156
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,310
You don’t want a gift?

157
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,360
Don’t you understand?

158
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,730
I don’t want a gift.

159
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,830
What do you want, then?

160
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,670
What do I want?

161
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,800
You told Ms. Bai Sheng about it,

162
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,630
didn’t you?

163
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,140
You’re confusing me.

164
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,300
You always pretend you’re confused.

165
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,150
Fine.

166
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,160
Shall I tell you a joke?

167
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,010
I don’t want it.

168
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,580
You don’t want a joke, either?

169
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,010
I’ll leave you alone, then.

170
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,350
Wait!

171
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,940
Why are you really leaving?

172
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,980
I’ll just listen.

173
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,200
Once upon a time,

174
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,000
there was a king

175
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,430
who loved playing the zither.

176
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,640
However,

177
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,380
all ministers

178
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,010
throughout the imperial court

179
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,120
found his music

180
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,380
intolerable to the ears.

181
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,900
The king failed to find anyone

182
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,560
who enjoyed his music.

183
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,700
It made him feel

184
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,390
scared and anxious.

185
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,920
One day,

186
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,350
he went to the imperial prison

187
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,320
and got out a condemned prisoner.

188
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,640
He told the condemned prisoner,

189
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,050
“I’ll play you a song.

190
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,500
If you like it,

191
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,060
I’ll spare you.”

192
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,990
Then, the king took out his zither.

193
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,040
After he finished,

194
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,620
the prisoner knelt,

195
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,530
shedding silent tears.

196
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,200
He said, “I’ll be executed, won’t I?

197
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,370
I know I’m wrong, Your Majesty.

198
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:31,460
Please dismember me.”

199
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,790
Was it because

200
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,270
the king played the zither so poorly?

201
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,350
No.

202
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,930
He played it beautifully.

203
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,240
Liar.

204
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,110
We’ve put our men at the city gate.

205
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,550
More guards in Chang’an state office.

206
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,630
More guards and even more secret guards.

207
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,050
The waterway has been blocked, too.

208
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,380
Our painter

209
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,460
has painted

210
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,280
the portraits for Taoye

211
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:02,960
and her mates.

212
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,780
- They’ll be sent to...
- Stop.

213
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,570
all city gates

214
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,810
- and official shops.
- Go.

215
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,340
They’ll be posted throughout the city.

216
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,820
Based on your instruction,

217
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,780
we’ve asked gangs

218
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,530
to help us.

219
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,830
Water Transport Gang, Wolf Gang,

220
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,440
Wind & Rain Alliance and Cloud Pavilion

221
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,510
are on the move.

222
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,030
Once they find out anything,

223
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,710
they’ll tell us immediately.

224
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,170
Agents in the city are taking action, too.

225
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,830
14 south and north avenues.

226
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,180
11 east and west avenues.

227
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,730
108 blocks.

228
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,310
132 hostels

229
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,350
and temples.

230
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,470
They’re all top priorities to be checked.

231
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,430
This is the information

232
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,960
about the renting and selling for all shops

233
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,190
I’ve collected for five years

234
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,480
and the cargo information

235
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,890
sent by horse shops and escort agencies.

236
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,360
After serious investigation,

237
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,470
I’ve found out

238
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,290
46 suspicious shops.

239
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,260
Master has sent spies

240
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,190
from Ying Section and Mi Section

241
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,520
to take secret investigation on them.

242
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,520
As instructed,

243
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,830
we’re following Yuwen Huai.

244
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,840
But so far,

245
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,210
we’ve found nothing.

246
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,530
Besides, the secret passages and all traps

247
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,160
in the Intel Building

248
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,810
shall be reset

249
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,310
in case strangers come in again.

250
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,340
Aye, Young Master.

251
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,370
Spies of Liang

252
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,630
are really powerful

253
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,250
with mysterious whereabouts.

254
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,180
They came to our capital,

255
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,960
and even wanted to

256
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,100
invade the Eye of Intel.

257
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,100
Since they dare to come,

258
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,500
we’ll make them never escape.

259
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,140
Young Master, we caught a dozen spies.

260
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:55,770
Such people

261
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,170
are hard bones from Liang.

262
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,520
They’ve confessed nothing.

263
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,370
Shall we torture them harder?

264
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,310
Such guys

265
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,140
came all the way

266
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,610
to our nation

267
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,510
and broke into my mansion.

268
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,500
They can’t be coming

269
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,510
only for

270
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,450
the Eye of Intel.

271
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,850
They must be keeping

272
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,170
some other secrets.

273
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,400
Go on with the investigation.

274
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,600
When we find

275
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,630
where their head is hiding,

276
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,290
we’ll solve every problem.

277
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,550
Aye.

278
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,080
My lady.

279
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,160
The Eye of Intel spies fought back fiercely.

280
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,530
We suffered heavy causalities.

281
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,000
60% to 70% agents and sentry posts

282
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,430
we’ve put in Chang’an

283
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,430
for so many years

284
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,560
have been destroyed.

285
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,680
Among the rest,

286
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,710
we lost contact with some of them

287
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,810
and the other of them hid themselves.

288
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,230
We can’t contact anyone,

289
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,930
except those who came with you.

290
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:59,750
The Eye of Intel spies

291
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,410
have been hibernating for years.

292
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,740
I didn’t know

293
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,190
they could still be powerful.

294
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,080
This time,

295
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,280
I underestimated our enemies.

296
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,030
My lady, you’d better leave.

297
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:20,630
We still have

298
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,630
one safe passage

299
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,790
to get you out of the city safely.

300
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,350
I can’t leave.

301
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,590
If I do,

302
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,940
we’ll completely fail this mission.

303
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,150
We’ve taken so many pains.

304
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,760
We can’t just give up.

305
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,270
But it’ll be dangerous if you stay.

306
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,290
Many of our men

307
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,530
have been caught.

308
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,410
They may sell us out at any time.

309
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,610
Yuwen Yue.

310
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,110
We can hardly succeed

311
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,650
before we kill him.

312
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,650
Yuwen Yue.

313
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,100
He is apparently the key figure

314
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,030
for the Eye of Intel.

315
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,720
A lot of masters are around him.

316
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,210
He himself has great martial arts, too.

317
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,340
It’s too difficult

318
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,930
to kill him.

319
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,010
If you like it,

320
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,180
I’ll give it to you.

321
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,820
Thank you.

322
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,880
I don’t think so.

323
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,260
You’ve got a plan, My lady?

324
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,390
The maid Xing’er who ruined my plan

325
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,620
could be his soft spot.

326
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,280
A maid?

327
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,190
The Yuwen family always has affectionate men.

328
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,010
In the old years,

329
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,140
Yuwen Zhuo broke his legs by himself

330
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,500
for a mere maid

331
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,690
and destroyed his bright future.

332
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,380
Yuwen Yue protected that maid a few times

333
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,630
in the secret passage.

334
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,710
If we want to kill Yuwen Yue,

335
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,650
we must use her.

336
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,470
My lady, are you sure?

337
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,650
I’ve been in the palace for years.

338
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,460
I don’t need any evidence

339
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,000
for this.

340
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,260
I can see clearly

341
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,140
through only eye contacts.

342
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:39,940
Taoye.

343
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,790
I want everything

344
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,880
about Xing’er.

345
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,930
Everything,

346
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,980
including her family background.

347
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,300
I’d like to know it all.

348
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,920
Aye. I’ll go get it.

349
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,160
Master.

350
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,810
Master, have some fruit.

351
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,140
You broke in

352
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,280
without being summoned.

353
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:26,910
What do you want?

354
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,740
To try the wine

355
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,860
in my pool?

356
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,140
Grandpa.

357
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,870
Why did you hold

358
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,730
such a party?

359
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,380
We always hold parties

360
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,260
to enjoy the wine, don’t we?

361
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,890
There must be a reason for that.

362
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,780
Why must you

363
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,220
keep it from me?

364
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,340
Who do you think you are?

365
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,080
How dare you ask me!

366
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,110
Grandpa, I’m trying to defend

367
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,800
you and our family.

368
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,440
You’re a lowly man.

369
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,350
For our family?

370
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,390
Funny.

371
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,450
You’re a loser.

372
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,580
With a humble identity,

373
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:50,020
you should learn to be modest.

374
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,950
What’s that look?

375
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,150
Unconvinced?

376
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,080
You don’t even dare to talk back.

377
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,350
Can you say you’re not a loser?

378
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,270
If I hadn’t

379
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,500
taken you to my branch,

380
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,390
you would have been cheaper than that maid.

381
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,200
Have you got the girl ready

382
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,550
who serves me tonight?

383
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,280
For your information, Master,

384
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,540
she’s ready.

385
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,470
A loser has made me

386
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,700
feel bad.

387
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,570
Tonight,

388
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,050
I’ll enjoy myself.

389
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,530
Your Excellency.

390
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,880
What brings you here again?

391
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,860
Why can’t I come?

392
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,220
I idle about every day,

393
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,430
without anything serious to do.

394
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:40,260
Oh,

395
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,300
I played the piccolo outside that day.

396
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:43,580
Did you hear me?

397
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,730
Yes. You played beautifully.

398
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,130
Then why didn’t you go and meet me?

399
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,070
Your Excellency.

400
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,500
I’m a mere maid.

401
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,470
I’ve got a lot of things to do every day.

402
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,550
I’m not free enough.

403
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,730
You know what?

404
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:06,430
You should go back to Yanbei

405
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,390
with me.

406
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,320
By then, you’ll no longer

407
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,460
be a maid.

408
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:19,850
What?

409
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,630
Does anything

410
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:22,590
make you worried?

411
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,420
Your two sisters?

412
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,810
I can handle them for you.

413
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,260
Think carefully about that.

414
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,830
When I’m sure to leave,

415
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,030
I’ll come to tell you.

416
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,190
This is for you.

417
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,320
Young Master.

418
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,650
Come in.

419
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,860
Young Master, time for the medicine.

420
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:30,640
Put it there.

421
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,370
Young Master, Yueqi said

422
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,370
the medicine only worked when it was hot.

423
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,350
He also asked me to watch you take it.

424
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,240
You always listen to Yueqi.

425
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,610
He’s considering for you.

426
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,790
I should listen to him.

427
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,400
So bitter.

428
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,110
Medicine is always bitter.

429
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,820
Young Master,

430
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,010
since I’m already a spy,

431
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,640
when can I start the training?

432
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,300
When it’s time,

433
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,360
you’ll know.

434
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,700
Well, take your time for the medicine.

435
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,260
I’ll leave you alone.

436
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,020
Stop.

437
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:48,950
What, Young Master?

438
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,190
You think it’s too bitter,

439
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,350
and want me to get you some sweetmeats?

440
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,400
Or you want to go out

441
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,540
and want me to get you a cart?

442
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,560
You don’t feel well with your eyes, huh?

443
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,050
I’ll go get you a doctor.

444
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,870
What, Young Master?

445
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,180
Fugitive slave.

446
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,630
What?

447
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,830
You must have heard

448
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,430
what His Excellency Yan Xun told me.

449
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,160
Right?

450
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,680
Without the slave-releasing certificate,

451
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,780
if you escape,

452
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:43,830
you’ll be executed

453
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,080
according to the law.

454
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,560
But I’ve never thought of

455
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,600
escaping.

456
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,070
When you go to Yanbei with Yan Xun,

457
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:57,840
you’ll no longer be a maid.

458
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,600
If he likes you

459
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,430
and marries you as his concubine,

460
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,610
you’ll live a rich life

461
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:07,480
ever after.

462
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,570
Don’t you want that?

463
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,260
Young Master.

464
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,250
Since I worked for you,

465
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,340
I’ve already been

466
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,520
living a rich life.

467
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,020
You know me.

468
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,100
I’m from a humble family.

469
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,640
But I’m not a cat

470
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,580
or a dog

471
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,300
that catches

472
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,010
whatever others give.

473
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,040
Take the medicine without concern.

474
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,940
I’ve got something else to handle.

475
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,600
I’ll leave you alone.

476
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,830
Yan Xun.

477
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,830
Prince Yu.

478
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:03,520
Where are you going

479
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,400
with a rabbit?

480
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,840
I’m giving it to my mother

481
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,590
and the Empress Dowager

482
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,450
for fun.

483
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:08,860
Don’t give it to them. Give it to me.

484
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,740
No way.

485
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,190
Yan Xun.

486
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,270
I’m giving it to...

487
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,130
Brother.

488
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,360
What are you doing

489
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,280
here?

490
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,230
What’s that?

491
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,790
A rabbit?

492
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,280
What a lovely rabbit!

493
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,350
Where did you get it?

494
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,520
Lovely, isn’t it?

495
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,590
Oh, this...

496
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,480
Yan Xun just gave it to me.

497
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,230
I’m giving it to...

498
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,050
It’s mine.

499
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,500
From now on,

500
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,780
the rabbit is mine.

501
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,750
You’re so lovely.

502
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,190
What’s your name?

503
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:53,890
You...

504
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:55,310
Do you have a name?

505
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,660
Yan Xun, what’s its name?

506
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,670
It hasn’t got a name yet.

507
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,690
So poor.

508
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,500
You don’t have a name?

509
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,900
Let me name you, then.

510
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,350
I’ll give you

511
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,660
the loveliest

512
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,110
and the most brilliant name.

513
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,070
You’ll be...

514
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,020
Yuanyuan?

515
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,730
Baibai?

516
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,270
Xiaobai?

517
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,160
Huanhuan?

518
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,720
How about Huanhuan?

519
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,570
Huanhuan...

520
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,020
How about Huanhuan?

521
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,670
As you wish, Your Highness.

522
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,510
Huanhuan.

523
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,450
What a nice name!

524
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,780
You didn’t feed it, did you?

525
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,130
Before I came, I just...

526
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,270
I’m sure you didn’t feed it.

527
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,520
Chun, Huanhuan is hungry.

528
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,080
I’ll feed it for you.

529
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,510
Don’t bother.

530
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,220
I’ll take care of it myself.

531
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:51,910
See you.

532
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,620
Caiwei, take the cage.

533
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,420
Aye.

534
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,970
Huanhuan.

535
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,090
Where’s my rabbit?

536
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,660
Seriously?

537
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,830
Where’s my rabbit?

538
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,450
What did Young Master say?

539
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,840
He has gone to the imperial palace.

540
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,460
On behalf of Elderly Master Zhuo,

541
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,320
Zhan Mou asked us to bide our time

542
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,620
and keep an eye secretly.

543
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,450
Go.

544
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:50,960
What’s going on?

545
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,890
They have rented the rooms

546
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,270
beside them.

547
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,420
We don’t have a chance

548
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,740
to eavesdrop through the walls.

549
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,140
Since they settled down,

550
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,420
they haven’t come out of the room.

551
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,740
Even the waiter

552
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,970
only puts the meals outside the door.

553
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:25,770
I just checked.

554
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,230
Red strings are all on their roof.

555
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,070
We mustn’t act rashly.

556
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,750
As expected, they’ve taken precautions.

557
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,950
Swallows fly back home.

558
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,790
Cicadas stop chirping when lonely.

559
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,680
Taoye.

560
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,030
You can’t have true love for Zhao Xifeng,

561
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,290
can you?

562
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,870
My lady.

563
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,210
At the party that day,

564
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,580
I hid myself

565
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,990
among many musicians.

566
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,590
But I did see

567
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,820
how you and Zhao Xifeng

568
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,600
cast glances of love.

569
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,670
You have my loyalty, My lady.

570
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:02,990
I don’t dare to hide anything from you.

571
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:05,100
I don’t get on with Zhao Xifeng

572
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,590
for love,

573
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,880
but for your great plan.

574
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,520
As a woman,

575
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,790
I know

576
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,900
what you want.

577
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,800
But you still remember your mission

578
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,810
as a spy, don’t you?

579
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,040
I do.

580
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,570
You warned me that

581
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,460
if the enemy used my love

582
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,560
when I was a spy,

583
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:36,820
I would be

584
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,720
beyond redemption.

585
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,340
I’m glad you remember.

586
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,830
Stand up.

587
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,470
If you still worry, My lady,

588
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,880
I’ll stop

589
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,300
contacting Zhao Xifeng.

590
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:03,410
You don’t need to.

591
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,590
Keep in touch

592
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,530
with him

593
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,350
and get intel from him.

594
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,020
After all,

595
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,200
he’s from a powerful family.

596
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:16,030
In the future,

597
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,490
he can be useful.

598
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,590
Aye.

599
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,100
I won’t let you down, My lady.

600
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,570
Oh, I see.

601
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,100
This is also why

602
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,270
you contact Yuwen Huai.

603
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,770
Everything is ready.

604
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,070
Do we need to bury bugs?

605
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:33,850
No.

606
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:35,550
They’re strictly defended.

607
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,250
We can’t hear anything

608
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,770
even with the bugs.

609
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:20,190
Is everything ready?

610
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,790
Yes.

611
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:30,230
My lady, here is the file for Xing’er.

612
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,600
Yuwen Yue’s men are out there.

613
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,530
The one we want hasn’t come.

614
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,370
Keep waiting.

615
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,070
Aye.

616
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,950
Today is the first day

617
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:46,840
you become a spy.

618
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,430
Then you’re allowed

619
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,300
to come here.

620
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,960
Is this the topographic map

621
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,120
for the whole world?

622
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:51,170
= Chang’an =
Here is Chang’an.

623
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:53,590
It is the capital of

624
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,390
our nation,

625
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:57,400
and also the center of the world.

626
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,940
The core of the Eye of Intel

627
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,200
lies in Qingshan House.

628
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,590
It means,

629
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,220
Qingshan House controls

630
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:03,980
the whole nation.

631
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,630
You’re saying that

632
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:10,830
spies collect all intel

633
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:11,500
and sent it

634
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,470
back here.

635
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,150
Based on the analysis,

636
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,620
we make use of

637
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:20,840
such intel

638
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,310
to protect our nation.

639
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,920
Meanwhile, we protect people in the world

640
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,460
from wars.

641
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,960
The Eye of Intel is the greatest weapon

642
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,750
we have.

643
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,020
A weapon doesn’t care for politics

644
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,410
or love.

645
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,630
You should make sure who is your master

646
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,520
and do your missions as far as you can

647
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:44,740
without being killed.

648
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,550
That’s enough.

649
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:51,950
Follow me.

650
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:10,170
Open it.

651
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:22,620
License?

652
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,110
Young Master, is this for me?

653
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:28,850
Does it mean

654
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:30,210
I’ll have a free access

655
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:31,400
to this mansion?

656
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:34,790
Without such an access,

657
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,440
how can you do the missions?

658
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,990
What’s in

659
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,510
those boxes?

660
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:44,900
When you should know,

661
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,680
you will.

662
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:52,720
There are more spies,

663
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,530
except us.

664
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,060
Spies from Liang

665
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,460
and unauthorized spies.

666
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,610
The one who you fought against

667
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,020
was a spy from Liang.

668
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,300
But unauthorized spies

669
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,020
are our real enemies.

670
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,120
You shall never

671
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,260
underestimate them.

672
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:11,140
They take orders from Storm Token.

673
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,900
Their master Luo He is

674
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,920
a brave and smart prodigy.

675
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,840
One year ago, Luo He was killed

676
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:20,800
in an accident.

677
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,220
What are you doing?

678
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,970
Her daughter, the young master of Storm Token,

679
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,950
was assassinated and lost.

680
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:40,910
Now,

681
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:42,330
such spies won’t make a difference.

682
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:46,470
But if Luo He’s daughter comes out again,

683
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,450
we’ll fight them desperately,

684
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,150
considering her guidance and martial arts.

685
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,360
I’d like to

686
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,230
fight Luo He’s daughter.

687
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,620
Don’t overreach yourself.

688
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,620
A spy does tough missions.

689
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:01,630
If you want to survive,

690
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:04,380
you must know very well

691
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,670
about these weapons.

692
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:07,950
Well, Young Master,

693
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,920
when can I

694
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,990
use these weapons?

695
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,920
Not until

696
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:14,660
