What?

Bastard!

19
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,490
Brother!

20
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,080
Your Excellency!

21
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,650
Your Excellency! Your Excellency!

22
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,280
- Brother!
- Your Excellency!

23

Brother!

Your Excellency! Your Excellency!

Your Excellency!

26
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,670
Let me see it.

27
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,070
Screwed. There is poison on the knife.

28
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,410
Doctor. Go get a doctor!

29
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,500

- Hurry!

30
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,190
Brother!

31
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,840
Brother, are you okay?

32
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,450
Run, Chun!

33
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,450
Brother, are you okay?

34
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:57,750
Brother!

35
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,810
Brother, wake up!

36
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,400
Brother, wake up!

37
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,250
Brother, wake up! Brother!

38
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:03,980
Get out of the way!

39
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,120
Brother, wake up!

40
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,720
Brother! Please do not scare me!

41
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,330
Wait.

42
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,510
Let them go.

43
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,340
But Your Excellency!

44
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,220
What are you waiting for?

45
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,640
Don’t worry, Your Excellency.

46
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,130
I will have them sent back.

47
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,820
Your Excellency!

48
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,070
Your Excellency! Your Excellency!

49
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,960
Somebody! Somebody!

50
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,710
Your Excellency!

51
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,730
Your Excellency, come on. Hurry.

52
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,800
Put him on my back.

53
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,030
Hurry!

54
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,140
Brother, wake up!

55
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,130
Hurry!

56
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,870
- What are you doing?
- Brother!

57
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,960
I’ll kill them

58
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,120
to avenge His Excellency!

59
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,240
You want to disobey his order?

60
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,290
Somebody!

61
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,130
Here.

62
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,710
Appoint ten soldiers

63
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,610
to send them back to Chang’an safely.

64
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:51,410
Aye!

65
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,810
Brother, wake up! Brother!

66
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,850
Brother, don’t scare me!

67
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,670
Wake up, Brother!

68
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,500
Brother!

69
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,450
Do not scare me!

70
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,950
Brother!

71
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:14,510
Doctor.

72
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,330
Miss Yu!

73
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,790
Doctor, how is he?

74
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,890
Luckily, the poison is not too serious.

75
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,640
His main organs aren’t hurt.

76
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,400
He just lost too much blood.

77
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,010
His condition is still critical, though.

78
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,180
Whatever it takes,

79
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,410
you must cure him.

80
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,560
But...

81
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,350
Look, there aren’t many herbs

82
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,620
around here.

83
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,030
We should move to another place soon.

84
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,510
Okay.

85
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,790
Let’s go get prepared.

86
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,050
Here, drink some water.

87
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:02,700
Come on.

88
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,030
Here.

89
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,920
Drink some, buddy.

90
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,350
Here.

91
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,480
Hang on.

92
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,210
Commander He, have something to eat.

93
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,090
Miss Chu, I am not hungry yet.

94
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:33,890
Keep it to yourself.

95
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,410
Commander He.

96
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,970
What’s on your mind?

97
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,600
Do you think

98
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,000
people in Yanbei will accept us?

99
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,100
Why? Don’t trust me?

100
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,240
Of course, I trust you.

101
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,580
Without you,

102
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,730
we would have disappeared

103
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,270
from this world.

104
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,210
But you don’t need to fool me

105
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,630
with such lies.

106
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,340
For example,

107
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,270
His Excellency didn’t abandon us

108
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,010
and he sent you to save us.

109
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,090
I may not be smart.

110
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,030
But,

111
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,120
I see the fact.

112
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,110
Commander He.

113
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,730
Everyone has his own scar

114
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,490
in his heart.

115
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,130
In specific time,

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,040
it may trigger them

117
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,000
to do something crazy.

118
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,380
Xiuli Army betrayed Yanbei

119
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,240
so that civilians of Hongchuan

120
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,000
and Beishuo

121
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,120
were cruelly slaughtered.

122
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,860
It may be the guilt

123
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,350
that you can never get away with.

124
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,420
You’re mistaken and bullied,

125
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,750
because what you did

126
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,700
that year

127
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,330
gave people no reason to respect you.

128
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,290
But you are different now.

129
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,490
You broke out of Chang’an,

130
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,460
fighting everywhere

131
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,500
all around Wei.

132
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,680
You defeated enemies with less forces.

133
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,330
You are an iron army.

134
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,110
Every battle you fight

135
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,480
proves your loyalty

136
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,270
to Yanbei.

137
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,240
So...

138
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,910
Believe in yourself.

139
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,350
Believe in your value of existence.

140
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,000
We are already making up for our fault.

141
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,080
I believe Yan Xun.

142
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,210
He will forgive you.

143
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,740
Don’t worry.

144
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,550
Even if

145
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,270
Yan Xun does not accept you,

146
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,500
I will protect you.

147
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,990
Time tries all.

148
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,880
I believe he will

149
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,760
accept you gradually.

150
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,030
Commander He, you!

151
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,010
I want to plead you

152
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,190
to be the leader of our army.

153
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,480
Please say yes.

154
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,020
What are you doing?

155
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,130
- Get up.
- Miss Chu.

156
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,950
Be our leader.

157
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,000
Say yes.

158
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,920
Say yes.

159
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,310
Be our leader.

160
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,110
I know you risked your life

161
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,580
to save us.

162
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,880
We want to follow you,
even if we sacrifice our lives!

163
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,270
And only when you

164
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,060
become our leader

165
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,010
can we go back to Yanbei

166
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:07,950
without concern.

167
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,590
Please do not refuse us.

168
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,940
Do not refuse us.

169
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,960
Do not refuse us.

170
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,480
We’re begging you.

171
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,680
Do not refuse us.

172
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,070
Sorry,

173
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,580
but I can’t say yes.

174
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,630
Why?

175
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,240
Why?

176
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,070
Miss.

177
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,080
Why, Miss?

178
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,180
We’re begging you.

179
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:28,890
I can’t be your leader

180
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,550
because there is only one master

181
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,190
for Yanbei.

182
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,010
You can only be loyal to him.

183
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,720
His Excellency Yan.

184
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,460
Some enemies are ahead.

185
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,880
Wu Danyu is fighting with them.

186
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,360
How many do they have?

187
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,290
About a dozen.

188
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,580
Let’s go check it out.

189
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,610
Miss Chu.

190
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,430
It’s me.

191
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:10,990
I’m Song Qian.

192
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,020
He is on our side.

193
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,990
You get it wrong.

194
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,750
Okay.

195
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,090
Wu Danyu, what were you thinking?

196
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,130
Fought with

197
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,170
the soldiers of His Excellency

198
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,620
at this time?

199
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,110
Sorry, buddies.

200
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,910
I got it wrong.

201
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:26,830
Untie them!

202
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:32,800
How could I know

203
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,820
they work for His Excellency?

204
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,310
They behave sneakily

205
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,610
without wearing the uniform of Yanbei.

206
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,310
They don’t seem like good guys at all.

207
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,710
Wait.

208
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,530
His Excellency has left,

209
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,320
hasn’t he?

210
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,680
Why are you back here?

211
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,140
Miss, we’re in a mission.

212
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,920
Oh,

213
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,170
please get to Bieya Hill soon.

214
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,490
His Excellency is still waiting for you

215
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,840
instead of leaving.

216
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,940
What mission forces you

217
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,300
back to Chang’an?

218
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,380
Miss.

219
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,340
It is a secret mission
given by His Excellency.

220
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,430
I cannot say with so many people around.

221
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,290
Why can’t you?

222
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,300
We’re fighting with Wei.

223
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,870
But you guys behave sneakily

224
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,680
towards Chang’an.

225
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,820
What the hell are you up to?

226
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,470
Tell me.

227
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:20,880
Are you the spies

228
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,400
from Chang’an?

229
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:21,990
Miss,

230
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,490
we didn’t do anything.

231
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:24,940
We are definitely not spies

232
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,030
from Chang’an.

233
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,900
Under the command of His Excellency,

234
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,210
we escort Prince Yu and Princess Chun

235
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:30,910
back to Chang’an.

236
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:33,970
What?

237
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,410
Yuan Song is here?

238
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,490
Where is he?

239
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,420
Are you done?

240
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,260
Hurry! Hurry!

241
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:48,880
Hurry!

242
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:49,850
One minute.

243
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,520
What are you doing?

244
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,090
Pull them out

245
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,460
and behead them!

246
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,640
Spare us!

247
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,490
Spare us!

248
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,620
It’s the order of His Excellency!

249
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,490
Yes, spare us, My Lady!

250
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,090
Spare us!

251
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,360
It’s the order of His Excellency!

252
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,240
Spare us!

253
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,700
We just followed the order.

254
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,540
Ms. Chu, spare us!

255
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,360
I will take you out.

256
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,700
I will send you home.

257
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,430
I’m sorry.

258
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,150
I’m sorry.

259
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,510
Why are you doing this to me?

260
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:43,990
I hate you! I hate you!

261
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,670
I hate you!

262
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,420
I will kill you!

263
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,670
Why are you doing this to me?

264
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,570
Why are you doing this to me?

265
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,280
I hate you!

266
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,560
I will kill you!

267
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,230
Why are you doing this to me?

268
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,610
- I will kill you!
- I’m sorry.

269
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,910
Why are you doing this to me?

270
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:26,710
Come on.

271
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,510
I found this

272
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,460
secret flower tree.

273
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,350
I tell you now.

274
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,000
Then it becomes

275
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
our secret garden.

276
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,780
Who cut off Yuan Song’s arm?

277
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,250
His Excellency did.

278
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,380
You’re lying!

279
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,240
I’m not!

280
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,690
Miss Chu, His Excellency did that.

281
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,990
Yuan Song tried to kill His Excellency.

282
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,420
His Excellency then cut off his arm.

283
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,650
We wanted to kill him.

284
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:56,670
But His Excellency didn’t allow us.

285
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:57,920
Instead, he let us escort them

286
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,780
back to Chang’an.

287
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,380
Why didn’t His Excellency kill him?

288
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,290
In case you get angry, I suppose.

289
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,790
Miss, His Excellency asked us

290
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,990
to escort them back to Chang’an.

291
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,400
He just wanted us to kill them on the way,

292
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,190
didn’t he?

293
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,290
He told you that?

294
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,700
Yes.

295
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,230
Bullshit!

296
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,340
I am warning you.
If you dare to talk nonsense again,

297
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,180
I will kill you now.

298
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,310
Say no more.

299
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,670
Drag them out

300
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,470
and kill all of them!

301
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,230
Miss. Miss.

302
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,750
I didn’t lie!

303
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,230
You see, every one of us

304
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,490
has a blood feud

305
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,610
with Wei!

306
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,270
Our parents, wives, children,

307
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,480
and our siblings

308
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:43,800
were all killed

309
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,210
by people from Wei three years ago!

310
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,230
If His Excellency didn’t want
to kill them,

311
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,800
why did he ask me to do the job?

312
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:49,770
Right.

313
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:50,970
Why do you arrest us?

314
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:51,480
Why?

315
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,280
What wrong have we done?

316
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:52,770
Yeah.

317
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:53,850
We just raped

318
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:54,640
the Princess of Wei.

319
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,790
My sister was raped

320
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,510
by the nobility of Wei.

321
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,660
My parents went to sue them.

322
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,520
But they were beaten to death.

323
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,960
What wrong have we done?

324
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,630
Right! Right!

325
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,990
Let me tell you

326
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,910
what wrong you’ve done!

327
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,460
Because they’re not the men

328
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,670
who killed your parents,

329
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,970
raped your sisters,

330
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,870
and persecuted you!

331
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,960
But they are the children
of the Emperor of Wei!

332
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,440
Every injustice has its perpetrator.

333
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:25,860
You say that

334
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,030
you want to revenge!

335
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,590
Does that mean

336
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,310
you will behave like your foes?

337
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:33,980
He Xiao.

338
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,170
Drag them out

339
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,610
and kill all of them!

340
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:40,710
Aye.

341
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,520
Xiuli Army, under my command,

342
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,330
drag them out

343
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,260
and kill all of them!

344
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,320
Aye!

345
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,780
We’re not convinced! We’re not convinced!

346
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,110
We’re not convinced! We’re not convinced!

347
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,130
What wrong have we done?

348
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:53,900
Commander He.

349
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,700
Go join His Excellency

350
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,350
with Xiuli Army.

351
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,280
I can’t accompany you.

352
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,490
Miss Chu, are you alright?

353
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:08,500
Because I have

354
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,870
something more important to do.

355
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,180
= Qingshan House =

356
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,630
Grandfather.

357
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,550
You let that maid run away?

358
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,650
I tried my best.

359
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,970
She ran away on her own.

360
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,140
Besides, she is already not a maid.

361
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,760
I almost forgot that.

362
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,000
She is now Yan Xun’s girl.

363
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,360
What?

364
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,280
You don’t want that?

365
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,730
You brought up a baby bird,

366
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,910
taught her how to fly and prey.

367
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,850
However, she flew away with someone else.

368
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,520
Don’t you think you suffer losses?

369
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,780
I hope you can understand.

370
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,430
You don’t belong to anyone.

371
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,050
Your efforts mean nothing.

372
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,730
You are the offspring of the Yuwen family.

373
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,300
You shouldn’t waste your energy

374
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,710
on a woman.

375
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,890
There are many more important things

376
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:10,580
waiting for you.

377
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,810
I understand.

378
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,530
Prince Xiang has been back.

379
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,180
We are arranging for a plan

380
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,610
to pursue and attack Yan Xun together.

381
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,390
You don’t understand.

382
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,070
Your father wants you out of this mess.

383
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,330
The rebellion in Chang’an is

384
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,550
what the Emperor should pay for his sin.

385
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,390
Your father alleged illness

386
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,260
and halted the troops at the front line.

387
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,260
I always think

388
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,740
as an important official,

389
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,560
he should do something for the country

390
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,430
in time of need.

391
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,040
What’s the point
even if you help His Majesty?

392
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,830
Speaking of that,

393
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,300
our families have done for many times.

394
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,970
When it is over,

395
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,780
you will be his mortal malady

396
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,240
who has too much credit!

397
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,430
This leads to two results.

398
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,880
Those who are weak,

399
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,980
will be abandoned after the crisis.

400
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,240
Those who are strong,

401
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,430
have the same ending as the previous one

402
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,210
once you let your guard down

403
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,030
and expose your weaknesses.

404
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:22,220
Yan Shicheng serves as an example!

405
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,860
I don’t do anything

406
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,740
for my personal honor.

407
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,860
I do it for people in Chang’an.

408
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,150
I can’t believe that.

409
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,340
I have devoted my life,

410
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,450
only to cultivate such a fool

411
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,230
for your father!

412
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,360
He gave me to the First Branch

413
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,010
when I was little.

414
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,820
I was no longer his son since then.

415
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,850
How dare you!

416
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,290
He gave you to me

417
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,420
twenty years ago.

418
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,060
He just put your birth document

419
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:53,940
in the temple

420
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,920
instead of my house.

421
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,730
Don’t you understand his intention?

422
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,280
I don’t.

423
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,530
I only know

424
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,730
my mother was killed

425
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:06,980
and I was abandoned.

426
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,490
For twenty years,

427
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,050
my life has been loaded with danger.

428
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,310
He never protected me once.

429
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,880
He had his own burdens.

430
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,150
What burdens did he have

431
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,400
that are more important

432
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,430
than his own wife and son?

433
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,740
He is General Zhuguo,

434
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,150
Ares of our nation

435
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,070
who is only inferior to the Emperor.

436
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,450
What is he afraid of?

437
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,720
In his heart, there is only his ambition,

438
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,630
his scheme,

439
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,760
and his trusted men.

440
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,840
Does he remember

441
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,110
he is a father

442
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,260
and a husband?

443
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,890
Sometimes, you can’t have it both.

444
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,750
When he can’t even

445
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,930
protect his own family,

446
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,040
how can he protect his country?

447
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,190
I don’t want to be a hero

448
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:57,400
like him.

449
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,050
Yue.

450
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,420
Grandfather.

451
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,660
I am grateful to you

452
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,870
for raising me.

453
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,870
I am a grown man now.

454
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,270
I can decide something

455
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,320
for myself.

456
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,770
Over the past twenty years,

457
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,370
I have never felt the love from my father.

458
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,100
I don’t want it

459
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,350
in the future.

460
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,960
Now Yuwen Huai is dead.

461
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,760
Qingshan House is quieter than before.

462
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,670
I choose some maids

463
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,150
for Qingshan House

464
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,990
who can be trusted.

465
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:30,700
You don’t need to stay

466
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,570
in the secret chamber anymore.

467
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:32,830
You can do anything as you want.

468
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:34,890
This is

469
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,250
all I can do for you.

470
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,580
As for other things,

471
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,990
I hope that you won’t interfere.

472
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,380
See you, Grandpa.

473
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,690
Don’t go!

474
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,060
Don’t go!

475
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:30,750
Brother,

476
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,450
I am here.

477
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,030
I won’t leave you.

478
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,330
Don’t go! Don’t go!

479
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,110
Don’t go with him!

480
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,410
Don’t go with him!

481
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,720
Or you’ll die!

482
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,010
I won’t go.

483
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,240
I am not going anywhere.

484
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,740
I will not leave you.

485
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,130
Silly girl. Don’t go.

486
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,160
I can protect you, Achu.

487
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,640
Achu. Achu.

488
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,190
Achu. Achu.

489
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,560
Don’t go! Don’t go!

490
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,620
Don’t go, Achu!

491
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,460
Brother, you are still thinking of her?

492
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,400
She and Yan Xun

493
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,590
did such terrible things to us.

494
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:55,240
Meteor.

495
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,570
I can only stay with you tonight.

496
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,470
Chun.

497
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:17,460
Chun.

498
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,000
Chun.

499
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,330
Chun.

500
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,650
Brother, don’t move.

501
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,700
I failed to protect you.

502
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,750
I am so incompetent.

503
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,250
Brother,

504
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,500
I am fine.

505
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,100
I am really fine.

506
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,440
I failed to protect you.

507
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,660
I should die.

508
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,540
Brother, don’t do this.

509
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,100
It is not your fault.

510
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,700
I don’t blame you.

511
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,700
It is my fault.

512
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,670
I should have listened to you.

513
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,730
I shouldn’t have run out.

514
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,120
It is my fault.

515
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,960
Your Excellency, we should set off.

516
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,820
I know you are worried about Achu.

517
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,150
He Xiao sent a message

518
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,930
that Achu will go back to Yanbei

519
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:14,930
after she sends Yuan Song and Yuan Chun

520
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,530
back to Chang’an.

521
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,590
She has no more families,

522
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,620
except her two sisters

523
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,690
who have no marital arts.

524
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,230
She has no one, but me.

525
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,550
If I don’t wait for her,

526
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,420
who will?

527
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,200
If I don’t protect her,

528
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,340
who will?

529
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,930
But, Your Excellency.

530
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,450
If Achu were here,

531
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:49,080
she wouldn’t like

532
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,970
to see you like this.

533
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,660
You are badly injured.

534
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,740
It’s lucky that you are still alive.

535
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,650
You are still suffering from poison.

536
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,690
If we waste more time,

537
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:58,530
you will be in danger!

538
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,440
If Achu comes back

539
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,330
but you are gone,

540
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,550
what’s the point of all these things?

541
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:12,190
Your Excellency, you should believe

542
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,480
she will return, safe and sound.

543
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,290
All we can do now is

544
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,950
to wait for the Xiuli Army

545
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,490
and go back to Hongchuan.

546
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,580
Wait for them?

547
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,290
They are traitors!

548
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,180
If I don’t kill them,

549
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,520
how can I face the dead

550
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,740
of Yanbei?

551
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:41,520
Betrayal is the biggest sin.

552
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,730
Just like the Emperor of Wei

553
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,280
betrayed the whole Yanbei.

554
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,630
I am going

555
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:49,410
to show my people

556
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,770
that the betrayers must die!

557
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:57,920
They must pay

558
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,810
for what they did!

559
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,220
If they go back,

560
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:05,520
dispatch them

561
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,310
to the northwest frontier

562
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,860
and incorporate them
into Vanguard Battalion.

563
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,140
Vanguard Battalion?

564
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:13,270
Your Excellency, that’s the way

565
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,840
prisoners under sentence of death
are handled in Yanbei.

566
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,000
Just do it!

567
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:25,950
Under my command,

568
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,140
let’s get back to Hongchuan.

569
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,180
Aye.

570
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:12,970
Are you awake?

571
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,750
Time to go.

572
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,390
My brother wants to see you.

573
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,780
Leave us.

574
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,620
I don’t want to see you again.

575
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,450
I will send you back.

576
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,080
There is a two days’ trip

577
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,330
from here to Chang’an.

578
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,010
I will be worried if you go by yourself.

579
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,910
It doesn’t concern you
whether we’re alive or dead.

580
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,360
After the war,

581
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,950
there are a lot of ruffians here.

582
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,810
With me around,

583
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,010
you will be safe.

584
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,410
I said,

585
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,050
it doesn’t concern you
whether we’re alive or dead!

586
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,630
Yuan Song,

587
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,130
I know you hate me.

588
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,570
I also know I can’t make it up for you,

589
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,180
no matter what I do.

590
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:38,400
However,

591
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,310
I can’t watch you die.

592
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,040
Achu.

593
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,520
Do you know

594
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,930
what I like most about you before?

595
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,800
It is what you look like now.

596
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,870
You are always so confident.

597
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,160
No matter who you are

598
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,430
or what status you are,

599
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,280
you always believe in your own ability.

600
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,530
But now I hate it most

601
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,750
to see you like this!

602
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:31,970
You’re arrogant and self-righteous.

603
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,740
What do you think you are doing?

604
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,680
Showing mercy? Redemption?

605
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,440
Or you just want to do something

606
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,120
so that you can go back to that bastard

607
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,860
without concern

608
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,820
and live your own lives!

609
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,570
I don’t!

610
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:46,040
Yuan Song.

611
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,440
I said,

612
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,230
I made a clean break

613
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,280
with you.

614
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,480
When we met again,

615
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,230
one of us would kill the other.

616
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,730
You basely betrayed our country.

617
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,390
You slaughtered common people

618
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,270
so that they couldn’t live in peace.

619
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:13,980
Get out!

620
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,580
I will leave

621
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,200
when I see you back in Chang’an.

622
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,440
Even if you hate me,

623
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,100
you should consider for the Princess

624
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,420
during this long journey.

625
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,540
You don’t want her

626
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,850
to suffer the same thing again,

627
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,180
do you?

628
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,350
Shut up!

629
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,530
She is my sister.

630
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,640
I can protect her on my own.

631
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,490
Brother.

632
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,150
Just let her...

633
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:54,890
Chun!

634
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,950
Are we really so weak

635
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,790
that we have to rely on our enemy

636
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,380
to protect us?

637
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,400
You had a fever for the whole night.

638
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,540
Now, the temperature is down.

639
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:00,990
If you die,

640
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,880
who will escort us back to Chang’an?

641
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,740
Achu.

642
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,380
You’re leaving?

643
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:31,890
Yes.

644
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,590
Going back to him?

645
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,070
Yes.

646
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,290
Will you come back?

647
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:47,470
I don’t know.

648
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,620
Maybe.

649
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,100
Maybe not.

650
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,990
See?

651
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,250
I’m such a coward.

652
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,180
Yuan Song.

653
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,590
Thank you for coming

654
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,590
and saying goodbye to me.

655
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,400
You escorted me over thousands of miles,

656
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,380
regardless of your own life.

657
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,960
How could I be too narrow-minded

658
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,990
to say a few words

659
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:24,810
with you?

660
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,040
But this will be the last time.

661
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,070
The very last time.

662
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,110
When we meet again,

663
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,290
pretend we don’t know each other.

664
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,960
Even when we meet again,

665
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,700
I will not kill you.

666
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,850
It’s your own business.

667
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,290
Whoever betrays Wei

668
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,570
will die at last.

669
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:25,700
What is Wei?

670
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,370
What is the law?

671
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:31,100
There is no right or wrong,
but only victory or defeat.

672
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:34,220
That year, your father cheated his friends

673
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,590
and slaughtered people in Yanbei.

674
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,260
He killed all Yan Xun’s families.

675
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,940
How could this

676
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,030
be counted?

677
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:46,790
In the past three years,

678
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,360
how many assassinations and plots

679
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,140
have you ever seen

680
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,370
with your own eyes?

681
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,930
The so-called wedding was

682
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,950
just your father’s deception

683
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,690
to deceive the public.

684
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:03,770
On the wedding day,

685
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,470
if Yan Xun hadn’t rebelled,

686
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,950
I wouldn’t even be alive now.

687
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:09,810
Yuan Song.

688
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,590
You have always been deceiving yourself.

689
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,170
You think when you close your eyes,

690
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,970
you will never see the tyranny of Wei.

691
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,290
When you cover your ears,

692
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,240
you will never hear people’s sad cry.

693
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,850
Why don’t you think about that?

694
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,880
Why did such a small rebellion

695
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,630
manage to make

696
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,740
such a big nation

697
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,090
fall apart?

698
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,260
Achu.

699
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,610
I have misjudged you.

700
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,670
You haven’t.

701
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,190
You just didn’t know every part of me.

702
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,230
In the past three years,

703
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,370
I have implied you and drifted apart you

704
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,190
more than once.

705
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,240
However, you were reluctant

706
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,260
to get a clear understanding of reality.

707
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,260
Everyone in Wei knew

708
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,120
your father would never

709
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,270
let Yan Xun off.

710
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:08,590
Only you

711
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,910
purely believed

712
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,030
your father would let go of Yanbei,

713
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,140
which escaped last time.

714
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,120
I had never planned

715
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,000
to cheat you.

716
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,820
However,

717
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,680
I did hurt you a lot.

718
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:34,000
You’ve taken care of me and helped me

719
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,990
over the years.

720
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,390
I’ll always remember that.

721
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:42,880
Yuan Song.

722
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,340
It’s our misery

723
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:49,970
to live in this era.

724
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,770
Three years ago,

725
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,810
when I was in the hopeless situation,

726
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:58,900
Yan Xun lent me his hands.

727
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:02,280
When I decided

728
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,740
to step on Jiuyou Platform with him,

729
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,700
we were destined

730
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,830
to be enemies.

731
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,650
You are the Prince of Wei,

732
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:17,830
and I’m the destined traitor.

733
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,140
You and I will fight at the battlefield

734
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:24,460
sooner or later.

735
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,190
I just brought all this on myself.

736
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,870
Throughout the years,

737
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:44,980
I have always refused

738
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,210
to give up winning you over.

739
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,300
I always thought

740
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,880
if I had worked a little bit harder,

741
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,210
I would keep you.

742
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,010
I had taken pains to make up the lies.

743
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:03,800
I was so deeply deceived

744
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,030
that I couldn’t get out of it.

745
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,930
Wei is going down.

746
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,600
I complained

747
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,840
about Yan Xun betraying our nation.

748
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,780
But what really hurt me was

749
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,200
that you gave up me

750
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,250
without any hesitation.

751
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,070
Chu Qiao.

752
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,050
Leave.

753
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,340
I would never like to see you again

754
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,350
for the rest of my life.

755
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,220
Yuan Song.

756
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:14,000
If he hadn’t been
in the desperate situation,

757
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,580
he wouldn’t have hurt you.

758
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,420
If he hadn’t been in a coma
because of serious wound,

759
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,510
he wouldn’t have arranged those guys

760
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:23,540
to escort you.

761
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,440
You had hurt him

762
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,840
very badly.

763
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,070
And he would die.

764
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,220
Right?

765
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:31,980
Yes!

766
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:36,390
He’s dying.

767
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,830
If you go back right now,

768
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,450
you may manage to pay the last respect.

769
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:49,550
Thank you for telling me this.

770
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,930
When we met halfway,

771
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,450
you just killed the people to cover us.

772
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:16,460
And then you escorted us
for thousands of miles

773
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:18,630
without saying anything else.

774
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:21,180
I had always thought

775
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,400
he and I mattered the same

776
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:25,630
in your heart.

777
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,370
Until now, I just realize

778
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:32,090
how badly wrong I was.

779
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,410
Achu.

780
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:36,890
How I wish

781
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:38,220
I could protect you!

782
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,530
However,

783
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:44,310
it’s impossible right now.

784
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,060
Chun.

785
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,470
Brother.

786
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:08,450
What happened to you?

787
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:13,240
It’s all because of Chu Qiao.

788
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:15,680
Without her,

789
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,490
nothing would have happened.

790
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:18,970
It’s all because of her!

791
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,720
Brother, go and catch her.

792
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,210
Go and catch her!

793
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,460
Go and catch her!

794
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:26,990
I’m going to kill her!

795
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:30,050
Chu Qiao?

796
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,030
Yes, it’s her.

797
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,090
If you catch her,
you will catch the traitor,

798
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:36,940
Yan Xun.

799
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:39,520
Just go and catch her!

800
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,030
Take revenge for Yuan Song and me.

801
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:44,140
Yuan Song.

802
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:45,810
Where did Chu Qiao go?

803
00:44:58,630 --> 00:44:59,450
