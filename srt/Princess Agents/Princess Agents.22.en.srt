= Episode 22 =

16
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,980
His Excellency asked us to wait for him here

17
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,020
while he went to

18
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,990
look for Xing’er himself.

19
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,110
Why hasn’t he come back?

20
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,870
Be patient.

21
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,540
His Excellency is skilled and smart enough

22
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,250
to handle anything

23
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,650
that may come up.

24
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,790
Xing’er is stubborn as a mule.

25
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,550
Will she come with His Excellency?

26
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,650
She will.

27
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,910
Absolute sincerity will move a heart of stone,

28
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,680
not to mention

29
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,990
it’s at the risk of his own life.

30
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,370
His Excellency!

31
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,260
His Excellency is back!

32
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:28,910
Let’s go.

33
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,090
Your Excellency! Your Excellency!

34
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:34,780
Your Excellency!

35
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,030
Your Excellency! Your Excellency! Your Excellency!

36
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,310
You are all warriors of Yanbei.

37
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,030
Thanks to your gallantry

38
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,650
that I could come this far.

39
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,360
You walk.

40
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,510
I walk.

41
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:47,930
You fight,

42
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,620
I fight.

43
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,190
Once we arrive at Yanbei,

44
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,590
let’s drink for three days and nights!

45
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:53,940
Aye!

46
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,260
But now, there’s no time to rest.

47
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,600
The pursuers

48
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,760
are right behind us.

49
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,350
The sooner

50
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,360
we reach Yanbei,

51
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,110
the quicker we can rest.

52
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,610
Hang in there, please!

53
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,970
Aye.

54
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,740
Tidy yourselves up. Dismiss.

55
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,990
Xing’er, you probably don’t know

56
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,090
when His Excellency

57
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,170
sensed that you were in danger,

58
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,260
he insisted on going back for you

59
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,390
regardless of the situation.

60
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,230
We were so worried.

61
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,360
Zhong Yu,

62
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,570
how’s everything?

63
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,710
Don’t worry.

64
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,500
Everything is fine.

65
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,000
No sign of enemies for now.

66
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,840
I still have some misgivings.

67
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:32,840
You two

68
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,560
set out to scout

69
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
and clear the way.

70
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,020
We’ll meet you

71
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,890
later.

72
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:37,520
Aye.

73
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,630
Your Excellency Yan Xun.

74
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,980
You are too impulsive

75
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,250
to be a prince.

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,300
Can you sniff like a dog?

77
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,620
How did you track me down?

78
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,930
I am a dog.

79
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,500
I can locate you by your scent.

80
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,190
You weren’t even sure

81
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,970
if I was in danger

82
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,360
before jumping into the fight.

83
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,400
What if you

84
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,070
got yourself in trouble?

85
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,560
How could that

86
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,460
be possible?

87
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,500
By the way,

88
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,050
is that how you

89
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:08,810
treat your lifesaver?

90
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,050
I didn’t ask for it.

91
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,050
How ungrateful you are!

92
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,720
I risked my life to save you.

93
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,140
But I don’t even get a thank you.

94
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,400
Alright, thank you.

95
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,790
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!

96
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,000
Thank you. Thank you!

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,740
Is that enough?

98
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,600
Thank you, too.

99
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,190
Watch out!

100
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,760
Are you alright?

101
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,790
I will go distract them.

102
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,680
Yan Xun!

103
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,640
Come on.

104
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,540
Come here

105
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,290
and stamp on your love with me.

106
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,150
Come on.

107
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:04,830
Yan Xun.

108
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:55,560
Young Master.

109
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,740
Get out of the way!

110
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:15,840
Back off!

111
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,640
Step aside!

112
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,650
Good job!

113
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,370
Fantastic!

114
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,760
Well done!

115
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,950
Nice work!

116
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,760
Yes! Yes! Yes!

117
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,190
This is great!

118
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,230
Wonderful!

119
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,840
Are you alright?

120
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,230
I’m sorry

121
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,940
about implicating you.

122
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:09,560
I’m fine.

123
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,760
Don’t worry.

124
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,990
Trust me.

125
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,890
I will protect you.

126
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,320
Let’s go.

127
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:04,930
Look,

128
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,090
those traitors have been captured.

129
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,050
Don’t you think

130
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,640
they look familiar?

131
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,940
Yes, they do.

132
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,930
Good job!

133
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:20,790
Xiaoliu!

134
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,740
Xiaoliu!

135
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,480
Xiaoqi!

136
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,340
Well done!

137
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,000
Xiaoliu!

138
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,590
Let’s go.

139
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,340
Come on.

140
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:30,900
- Xiaoliu!
- Let’s go.

141
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,760
Great!

142
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,080
Wonderful!

143
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,590
Open the door.

144
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,130
Chun!

145
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,240
Chun.

146
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,360
Are you alright?

147
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,230
Brother.

148
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:12,740
Why did mother

149
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,620
do this to us?

150
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,930
You knew already?

151
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,530
Come here.

152
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,490
Chun, get up.

153
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,490
Come on.

154
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:35,740
Chun.

155
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,080
I know you’re eager to find out

156
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,840
what happened out there.

157
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:43,870
But you have to promise me first

158
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,270
that you won’t do anything stupid.

159
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,140
Then I will tell you.

160
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,510
Yan Xun is injured

161
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,640
and locked up in prison.

162
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,000
Somehow Marquis Dingbei

163
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,100
assembled a few of his men

164
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,050
outside the city.

165
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,420
And they had been killed by Yuwen Huai.

166
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,570
Father had ordered

167
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,980
Zhao Dongting to attack Yanbei long ago.

168
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,800
Yanbei is caught unprepared.

169
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,360
And without Marquis Dingbei,

170
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,180
it will be taken easily.

171
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:24,820
I’m afraid

172
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,390
Yan Xun’s family will be crushed.

173
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,780
How did things come to this stage?

174
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,950
I will go talk to Father.

175
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:41,750
Chun!

176
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,610
Mother already tried,

177
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,400
but only got ignored.

178
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,600
How could he listen to you?

179
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,190
So we just sit and do nothing?

180
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,070
And watch Yan Xun...

181
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,040
It’s not right!

182
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,490
No!

183
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,150
I can’t.

184
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:08,780
Father will not kill

185
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,930
Ms. Bai Sheng.

186
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,790
If she’s here,

187
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,530
maybe there is a chance to save Yan Xun.

188
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,600
That’s right.

189
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,100
Where’s Ms. Bai Sheng?

190
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,840
Where is she?

191
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,150
Ms. Bai Sheng…

192
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:21,630
Right now,

193
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,030
she’s at Zhao Dongting’s camp.

194
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:25,720
I guess

195
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:26,670
she will come back

196
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,730
in no time.

197
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,710
She might have ways

198
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,740
to save Yan Xun.

199
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:33,530
And we should

200
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,580
do something, too.

201
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,820
Yes.

202
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:37,860
Five Aces of Chang’an.

203
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,010
Where are they?

204
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,100
Forget about them.

205
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,450
I…

206
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,390
I must think up a way.

207
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,240
I

208
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,770
grew up with you

209
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,230
and treated you like my own brother.

210
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,760
Do you remember

211
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,880
the spring hunting that year?

212
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,880
There was a fire

213
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,870
that trapped me inside.

214
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,730
My brother’s 200 troops

215
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,360
were right outside

216
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,150
and had the whole place besieged.

217
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,330
But you

218
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,470
came all alone despite your wounds.

219
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,690
Your abdomen

220
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,780
was badly lacerated.

221
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:16,050
You took off your top, tied it around your waist,

222
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:20,920
and fought your way through the siege.

223
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,030
I asked you

224
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,980
why you came in.

225
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,740
You said

226
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,500
if you had to die,

227
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,490
you would rather die with me.

228
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,870
I didn’t mean to kill you.

229
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,630
Why did you push me?

230
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,950
Everyone in Yanbei

231
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:07,670
only recognizes you

232
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,390
but not me.

233
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,530
I summoned you to the Palace,

234
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,830
but you excused yourself from it every time.

235
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,110
What were you up to?

236
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,940
You attempted to declare yourself king.

237
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,150
How could I allow that?

238
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,260
If

239
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,990
you were still alive,

240
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,880
I guess you would…

241
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,170
You would call me names.

242
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,440
You’d call me stupid

243
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,590
and fatuous.

244
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,560
Too bad,

245
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,060
you are dead.

246
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,750
You are caged in this little box

247
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,710
however reluctant you are.

248
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,760
You can’t say anything.

249
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,490
Look,

250
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,140
the winner takes it all,

251
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,540
and the loser has none.

252
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,660
I know

253
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,520
people out there

254
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,530
will call me

255
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,810
a tyrant,

256
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,270
or an incompetent ruler.

257
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,360
So what?

258
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,350
Who dares to stand in front of me

259
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,770
to defend you

260
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,390
or clear your name?

261
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,290
Nobody.

262
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,130
That’s the power of an emperor.

263
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,770
How many times did I tell you that?

264
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:14,890
But you never took it seriously.

265
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,360
So,

266
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,950
you are dead as a doornail.

267
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,990
Without you,

268
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,890
I can finally be relieved.

269
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,050
You told me

270
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,520
if you had to die,

271
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,790
you would rather

272
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,290
die with me.

273
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,290
I have already

274
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,730
left you a place in my mausoleum.

275
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,540
So you can just wait for me

276
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,080
down there.

277
00:23:58,910 --> 00:23:59,760
No matter

278
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,260
how wronged

279
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,520
or unfair you feel,

280
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,010
you can tell me

281
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,740
when we meet again.

282
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,600
It smells good.

283
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,060
= Grandfather Yuwen Xi =

284
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,480
So good.

285
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,610
Isn’t a corpse

286
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,930
supposed to stink?

287
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,950
But why do I

288
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,590
find it pleasant?

289
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,270
Grandfather,

290
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,360
look at you.

291
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,980
You were a powerful figure

292
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,080
throughout your life.

293
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,180
But never did you expect

294
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:47,010
that you would be killed

295
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,220
by Yuwen Yue’s maid, right?

296
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,050
Poor thing!

297
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:56,530
What a tragedy!

298
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,790
Just because I’m a concubine’s son,

299
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,080
you refused to step down

300
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,180
and let me head the Third Branch.

301
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,450
But you had to rely on me

302
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,440
to avenge your death, didn’t you?

303
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,400
Anyway,

304
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,860
we’re related by blood.

305
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,590
Rest assured.

306
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,420
I will bring that girl

307
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,770
back here

308
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,510
and finish her

309
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,610
right in front of you

310
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,840
to keep you company.

311
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:02,860
= Qingshan House =

312
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,960
Xing’er. Xing’er.

313
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,370
Xing’er.

314
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:15,980
Xing’er.

315
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,670
Xing’er. Xing’er.

316
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,640
Xing’er.

317
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,310
Why are you hesitating?

318
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,550
Don’t you know

319
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,370
I killed your brother?

320
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,300
Will you kill me?

321
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,970
Try me.

322
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:08,380
Fine.

323
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,890
What is the announcement about?

324
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:33,810
- What is it?
- Yes.

325
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:34,610
What does it say?

326
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:35,180
Read aloud. Read it.

327
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,730
Throughout history, the Yan Clan

328
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:39,880
are the most egregious traitors.

329
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,950
Marquis Dingbei was as vicious

330
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,480
as a wolf in sheep’s clothing.

331
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,830
Thus, he shall be condemned by heaven
and the public.

332
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:47,430
His son, Yan Xun, has been captured.

333
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,060
Really?

334
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,450
Why did they capture Yan Xun?

335
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:52,520
You don’t say.

336
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,320
His sins shall be known to all.

337
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,900
The Yans are the enemies of the world.

338
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,480
Their deaths by a thousand cuts

339
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,680
can’t atone for

340
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,030
a shred of their crimes.

341
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,420
The public has the right to know the truth

342
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,500
to bring our state back to normal.

343
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,840
- Yes.
- What happened?

344
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,050
Why did they rebel?

345
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:09,960
Yes.

346
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,960
His Excellency Yan has been seized.

347
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:12,850
Xiaoqi.

348
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,950
What does all that mean?

349
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,610
Marquis Dingbei committed treason.

350
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,590
Marquis Dingbei?

351
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,760
Doesn’t His Majesty

352
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,850
trust him the most?

353
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:22,850
What...

354
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,750
What will happen to our sister?

355
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,260
You two

356
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,780
don’t run around again.

357
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,750
The whole city is under lockdown.

358
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,390
Once others find out

359
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:43,700
you’re maids on the run,

360
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,300
you will die.

361
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:47,800
What about you?

362
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:49,990
Isn’t it obvious?

363
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,460
Look at him.

364
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,860
He’s going to fight to the death.

365
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:55,740
But

366
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,480
His Excellency Yan and his family

367
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,570
are charged as traitors.

368
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,040
If you go alone,

369
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,770
it will be like a moth darting into the fire.

370
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,610
Of course, I’m not alone.

371
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:23,670
Princess,

372
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,550
we’ve found Yan Xun’s people.

373
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,480
How many are they?

374
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,450
Just one.

375
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,510
Yan Xun’s guard Zhong Yu.

376
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:45,760
Zhong Yu?

377
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,790
Where did she go?

378
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,890
She went out of the city.

379
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:51,960
Out of the city?

380
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,900
The people of Yanbei

381
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,500
will retaliate.

382
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,520
Watch them closely.

383
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,270
Aye.

384
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,580
Mr. Dongfang.

385
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,860
Zhong Yu.

386
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,460
Are you aware

387
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,800
of His Excellency’s imprisonment?

388
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,020
We must get him out right now,

389
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,600
or it will be too late.

390
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,210
You’re way outnumbered.

391
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,230
Your reckless move

392
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,610
will only get you and him killed.

393
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,370
Were Mr. Wu here,

394
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:35,340
he would not be on board

395
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,240
with this plan.

396
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,510
We’re willing to

397
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,460
exchange our lives for His Excellency’s.

398
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,790
As long as he’s alive,

399
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:44,400
Yanbei will not lose.

400
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,250
The world doesn’t revolve around anyone.

401
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,760
The fate of Yanbei

402
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,340
doesn’t depend on

403
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,580
His Excellency Yan Xun alone.

404
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:00,470
Without him, the universe will go on as usual.

405
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,850
I suggest you think it over.

406
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,840
You are not the only one

407
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,360
trying to get him out.

408
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,680
Please look before you leap.

409
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,980
Maybe things will turn around.

410
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,570
But

411
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,250
I can’t be sure.

412
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:46,500
= Imperial Prison =

413
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,250
Young Master.

414
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,270
If I take the liberty

415
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,450
of giving you the female prisoner

416
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,220
without the permit from my superior,

417
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,110
I’ll be doomed.

418
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,120
I apologize for the inconvenience.

419
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,440
Take care of it.

420
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,820
If you can’t,

421
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,020
the next one

422
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:03,600
will be you.

423
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,100
Good day, Young Master.

424
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:20,890
Young Master Yue.

425
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,960
Mr. Luo, thank you for this.

426
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,160
I’m just doing my job.

427
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,650
That female prisoner

428
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:31,810
came with His Excellency Yan Xun.

429
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,650
Without the official permit,

430
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,700
nobody is allowed

431
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,750
to take her away.

432
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:36,950
But

433
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,270
if Young Master Huai is back with the document,

434
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,060
I’m afraid

435
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,120
I can’t procrastinate again.

436
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:46,610
I understand.

437
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,900
Please take care of

438
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,470
His Excellency Yan inside.

439
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,910
Of course, Young Master.

440
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,870
I could never repay Marquis’s favor to me.

441
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,730
Now that his son is in prison,

442
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,170
I’ll do my best to look after him.

443
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,670
But right now,

444
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,410
Marquis is dead and Yanbei is in chaos.

445
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,500
His Excellency Yan

446
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,550
is in grave danger.

447
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,110
Thank you for everything.

448
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,290
That’s the least I should do.

449
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,320
Yan Xun.

450
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,610
Yan Xun.

451
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,200
Yan Xun!

452
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,380
Yan Xun!

453
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,360
Are you all right?

454
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,460
Xing’er.

455
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:14,150
Xing’er.

456
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,310
Are you well?

457
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,740
How is your wound?

458
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,570
Don’t worry.

459
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,340
I am fine.

460
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:31,410
You are so smart.

461
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,650
You are too stupid.

462
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,070
Be careful. Don’t let us get caught.

463
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,490
Xing’er.

464
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,470
Trust me.

465
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,360
My father

466
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,680
would never stage a coup.

467
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,910
Other cliques

468
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,510
must’ve forsaken good for their own benefits

469
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,030
to alienate His Majesty and my father

470
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,000
in order to frame him.

471
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,020
When he finds out

472
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,310
we are imprisoned,

473
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,680
he will go to His Majesty

474
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,730
to clear things up.

475
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,950
Once the truth is out,

476
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,730
we can get out of here.

477
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:11,970
Sounds good.

478
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,090
What’s wrong?

479
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,660
You don’t trust me?

480
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,690
I wouldn’t dare.

481
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,920
Don’t worry.

482
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,620
I’ll never

483
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,880
abandon you.

484
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,570
From now on, you’re under my wing.

485
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,650
I’ll protect you.

486
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,530
Fine.

487
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,850
Once we’re out,

488
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,340
treat me to goodies.

489
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,270
I am starving right now.

490
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,310
Tell me.

491
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,200
What would you like to eat?

492
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,590
Name it,

493
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,890
and you’ll have it.

494
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,290
It’s freezing.

495
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,150
I’m craving for braised pork.

496
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,170
You are wounded

497
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,750
without eating anything.

498
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,820
You must feel cold.

499
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:19,730
Here.

500
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,100
Here.

501
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,350
What are you doing?

502
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,030
We would get caught like this.

503
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,590
So?

504
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,170
Once I’m out,

505
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:34,910
I’ll make

506
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,460
all of them pay.

507
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,990
You will see.

508
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,250
Xing’er.

509
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,470
Give me your hand.

510
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,390
What for?

511
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,630
Just do as I said.

512
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,930
What are you doing?

513
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,800
No more questions.

514
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,090
Just do it.

515
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:02,020
Stick your hand out.

516
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,220
What…

517
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,730
What are you doing?

518
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:13,850
Relax.

519
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:32,530
How do you feel?

520
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,440
Are you feeling better?

521
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,650
Is it warmer?

522
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:54,530
Xing’er.

523
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,820
That’s what Yuwen Yue calls you.

524
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,250
What’s your real name?

525
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,200
My…

526
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,050
My real name is Chu Qiao.

527
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,720
I only told you that.

528
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,490
No one else knows.

529
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,380
I see.

530
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,960
What should I call you

531
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,350
from now on?

532
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:32,290
Xiaoqiao.

533
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,250
How about Xiaoqiao?

534
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,900
I don’t like it.

535
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,320
I got another one.

536
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,440
Qiaoqiao.

537
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,020
It’s gross.

538
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,450
How about Achu?

539
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,240
Fine, you can call me that.

540
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,170
Deal.

541
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,710
Achu.

542
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,040
Achu. Achu.

543
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,980
What now?

544
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,220
Achu.

545
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:36,640
Achu.

546
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:39,840
You are annoying!

547
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:44,220
Give me the other hand, Achu.

548
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,120
What are you doing?

549
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,610
What’s that?

550
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:19,970
You are in for a treat today.

551
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,640
Are you grinning secretly?

552
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:25,280
Nonsense.

553
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,050
