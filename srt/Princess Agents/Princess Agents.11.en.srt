Is food for Yue Guards ready?

Why are you coming

19
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,510
by yourselves?

20
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:52,920
Where are the servants?

21
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,870
Hongshan House borrowed half of them,

22
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,030
saying they were short of men,

23
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,470
for removing lake mud and moving things.

24
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,710
I don’t know

25
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,830
if they can get out my hairpin

26
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,650
that dropped

27
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,540
in the lake.

28
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:05,860
Miss Jinsi.

29
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,420
In the lake,

30
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,210
your hairpin is like a needle.

31
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,510
Don’t dream to get it back.

32
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,700
Focus on your work

33
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,830
and stop dreaming about it.

34
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,190
Who said that?

35
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,830
You’ve been working

36
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,330
in the kitchen every day.

37
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,080
You don’t know what is happening out there.

38
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,390
You know what?

39
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,610
Years ago, the silk flower

40
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,900
Concubine Sun of the Second Branch

41
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,250
dropped in the lake

42
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,420
was even found out two years later.

43
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,510
Really?

44
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,250
This is the wooden bead

45
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,740
Mother left to me?

46
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,910
What do we do, Xiaoliu?

47
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,810
After the Cold Food Festival,

48
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,330
Yuwen Huai will get out the lake mud.

49
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,590
By then, Ms. Song’s dead body

50
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,390
will be exposed.

51
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,350
If anything goes wrong,

52
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,000
none of us can survive.

53
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,610
So, we’re escaping tonight.

54
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,600
Escaping?

55
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,350
Tonight, Yuwen Yue is going out for lanterns.

56
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,750
Leave with the license first.

57
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,630
Wait for me at the teahouse near the north gate.

58
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,400
Are you escaping with us?

59
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,840
I’ll be there later.

60
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,820
But what if

61
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,220
you fail to leave?

62
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,210
Don’t worry. I’ve got a plan.

63
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,970
In the package there is some solid food

64
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,310
and some silver.

65
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,950
When Yuwen Yue leaves the mansion,

66
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,090
I can steal the stamp,

67
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,420
get the slave-releasing certificate

68
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,820
and go find you.

69
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,790
If I’m not there

70
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,550
after one in the morning,

71
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,440
stop waiting for me.

72
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,180
No way.

73
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,140
We’ll be waiting.

74
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,960
If you don’t come,

75
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,200
we’ll go back to you.

76
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:50,710
No.

77
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,700
Remember.

78
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,730
If anything goes wrong,

79
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,680
you must insist that

80
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,430
you have nothing to do with

81
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,270
Ms. Song’s dead body.

82
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,070
Got it?

83
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,480
But...

84
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,280
If they really find her dead body,

85
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,450
what will you do?

86
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,080
Yeah.

87
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,720
Don’t worry.

88
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,340
I’ll find a way out.

89
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,190
I’ll send more guards

90
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,490
to go with you.

91
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,230
No.

92
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,750
When I travel light,

93
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,690
I don’t want many guards around.

94
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,980
Xing’er, you’re here, too.

95
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,530
This is the new suit

96
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,760
Young Master Yue gave you.

97
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,400
Why do I need a new dress?

98
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,560
You...

99
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,730
Get dressed up.

100
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,470
Tonight,

101
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,800
he’ll take you to enjoy the lanterns.

102
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,030
Don’t disgrace him.

103
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,000
Young Master, I’ll put on the new suit

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,390
and greet you when you come back.

105
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,790
This suit

106
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,640
was made

107
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,630
for Chang’an Lantern show.

108
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,300
Thank you, Young Master.

109
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,430
Unfortunately, the Empress Dowager was ill.

110
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,650
So,

111
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,190
His Majesty suspended the lantern show.

112
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,020
Now the Empress Dowager has recovered.

113
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,740
The Empress Dowager makes her own luck.

114
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,130
His Majesty’s birthday

115
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,230
is just before the Cold Food Festival.

116
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,520
Someone proposed to hold a lantern show

117
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,100
in the name of his birthday.

118
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,160
His Majesty approved of it.

119
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,790
Xing’er, go get changed

120
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,080
and we’re leaving right away.

121
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,150
But I’ve got much rough work to do.

122
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,860
Just go get changed.

123
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,500
When Young Master goes to Zhuque Avenue,

124
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,890
someone must be taking care of him.

125
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,470
When can we come back?

126
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,090
After I enjoy myself.

127
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,960
When you come back,

128
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,610
you’ll be thirsty and hungry.

129
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,360
I’ll get some desserts ready in the kitchen.

130
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,260
No.

131
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,350
Don’t bother.

132
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,150
Just go.

133
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,170
Aye.

134
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,420
= To Yuwen Mansion =

135
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,220
= Private Seal of Yuwen =

136
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,420
= Chang’an =

137
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,010
Your Highness, Chang’an is right ahead.

138
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,130
Why are you coming again?

139
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,870
Don’t get anyone to recognize you.

140
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,450
Aye, My lady.

141
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,510
I’ll ask the minister of the spy agent

142
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,940
to welcome you.

143
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,550
Chang’an is famous for its scenery.

144
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,370
I’ll go around the lantern show.

145
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,420
Don’t inform the spy agent.

146
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,610
Aye.

147
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,110
Yue.

148
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,190
At last, I come to your city.

149
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,780
I don’t come to meet you,

150
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,890
but to kill people.

151
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,890
We live in turbulent days,

152
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,250
working for our own nations.

153
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,860
I’d rather miss you than meet you.

154
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,070
Come and have a look.

155
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,250
Enjoy yourselves.

156
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,710
Xiaoba, do you think

157
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,650
Xiaoliu can come out to us,

158
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,920
safe and sound?

159
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,830
Xiaoqi,

160
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,050
this is not what worries me.

161
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,530
I think

162
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,550
Xiaoliu has picked up

163
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,620
the wooden bead.

164
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,030
Could she

165
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,410
already know

166
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,200
her own identity?

167
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,180
I don’t think so.

168
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,200
She hasn’t ever seen

169
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,000
the wooden bead.

170
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,010
Nor has she...

171
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,960
But what if...

172
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,670
Xiaoba, what do you think?

173
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,940
When our parents were killed,

174
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,560
they left the wooden bead to Zhixiang,

175
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,460
saying it had something to do with Xiaoliu.

176
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,830
I think,

177
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,270
there must be a big secret.

178
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,260
So, think about it.

179
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,450
If she knows

180
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,430
we’re not her real sisters...

181
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,700
If she no longer

182
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,970
protects us like this,

183
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,110
what do we do?

184
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:51,100
= Qingshan House =

185
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,950
Ride on the same horse with me.

186
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,010
I’ll take you.

187
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,660
This is against the rule, Young Master.

188
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,310
I can ride a horse myself.

189
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,690
You can ride?

190
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,630
Sure.

191
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,140
Get her a good horse.

192
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,440
Aye.

193
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,620
Solar halo?

194
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,740
It’s the omen from the heaven.

195
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,640
There will be a war.

196
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,090
Omen is always an excuse

197
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,380
for man-made calamities.

198
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,020
Man-made calamities?

199
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,720
Does that mean Rouran

200
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,880
who always wants to

201
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,600
invade us?

202
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,330
We have more enemies than Rouran.

203
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,120
Spies of Liang are better at instigation.

204
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,660
Real man-made calamities

205
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,470
are inside Wei.

206
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,450
Once spies of other nations

207
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,630
collude with

208
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,210
our own traitors,

209
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,600
the rain

210
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,870
will be red.

211
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,350
Rain of blood?

212
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:10,940
Let’s go.

213
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,110
Leave us.

214
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,130
Thank you, sir.

215
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,780
I can get on it myself.

216
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,080
Solar halo?

217
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,700
I wonder which minister

218
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,810
will suffer this time.

219
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,780
Solar halo?

220
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,110
This is solar halo?

221
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,460
Yeah.

222
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,450
There will be chaos in Chang’an.

223
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,560
What chaos?

224
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,530
I’m afraid

225
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,200
an important minister is dying, too.

226
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:16,720
Who?

227
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,210
Who? I don’t know.

228
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,400
It’s getting dark.

229
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,610
Hope Xiaoliu will come out soon.

230
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,610
The north wind blows.

231
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,210
Could it be from Yanbei?

232
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,130
Your Excellency, a letter from your father.

233
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,390
What makes you happy, Your Excellency?

234
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,860
Father said everything was fine home.

235
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,160
After suppressing the rebellion of Rouran,

236
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,930
His Majesty rewarded my clan.

237
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,360
Father also asked me

238
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,090
to stay in Chang’an

239
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,130
and not to worry about them.

240
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,200
That’s good, then.

241
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,780
Maids in Qingshan House told me that

242
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:26,910
Young Master Yue

243
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,440
took Xing’er to the lantern show tonight.

244
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,810
All right. Leave me.

245
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:32,730
Aye.

246
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,590
It looks so beautiful.

247
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,310
Get down.

248
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,770
Bravo! Bravo!

249
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,610
I have five hours left.

250
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,840
Bravo! Bravo!

251
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:30,730
Go.

252
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,360
Bravo!

253
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,360
Okay. Okay.

254
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,020
Welcome back.

255
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,640
Okay.

256
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,410
Miss.

257
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,940
Miss, have a look.

258
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,780
What a beautiful lantern!

259
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,960
It’s a rabbit shape.

260
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,240
How nice it is!

261
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,160
Sir.

262
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,620
Buy one for her.

263
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,680
May all your wishes come true.

264
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:03,570
Here you are.

265
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:07,530

So lovely.

Naive girl.

269
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,670
Isn’t it lovely?

270
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,350
If it’s not, why did you buy it?

271
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,050
I think

272
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,220
it looks like you

273
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,850
and it suits you.

274
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,980
All right. Get the horse aside.

275
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,540
And let’s keep walking.

276
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,420
Go.

Pull?

285
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,190
By which part?

286
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,320
Pull me by the sleeve.

287
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,410
What else do you want?

288
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,360
It’s so crowded.

289
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,410
If we get lost,

290
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,280
I have to look for you.

291

00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,380

Wow, this man wins.

299
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,390
Two taels of silver as the jackpot.

300
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,600
Sir, go get the reward.

301
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,290
Great.

302
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,140
Who else

303
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,660

There’s a jackpot.

00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,570
Can I have a beautiful girl?

306
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,740
A beautiful girl?

307
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,880
That’s impossible.

308
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:24,110
Only learned men can guess the riddles.

309
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:24,880
Which young man or lady

would like to have a try?

00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,740
Sir, would you like a try?

312
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,080
Young lady.

313
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,630
I’ve never seen such a beautiful girl

314
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,500
like you.

315
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,560
This is my jackpot. Take it.

316
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:45,770
Thank you.

317
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,500
Are you here alone?

318
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,320
Uh...

319
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,460
Sir.

320
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,190
It’s my gift

321
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:57,820
for this lady.

322
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,470
It’s none of your business, right?

323
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,670
I... I...

324
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,460
I won’t argue with you.

325
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,020
Make way. Make way.

326
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,030
Why is he leaving?

327
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,490
Come on.

328
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,540
If you want it,

329
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,710
let’s go buy one.

330
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:17,440
Go.

331
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,590
Where are we going?

332
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,440
Come and guess.

333
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,710
To buy a stick of sugar-coated haws.

334
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,390
I don’t want that.

335
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,060
Come and guess.

336
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,160
I want to guess the riddles.

337
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,170
Sir, which riddle do you want?

338
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,560
This one.

339
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,820
What is the longest word in this world?

340
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,460
Guess one word.

341
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,440
The longest word

342
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,140
may not be the real longest one.

343
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:03,590
It may refer to

344
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,320
another meaning.

345
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,430
Oh, I know.

346
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,960
It’s “smiles”.

347
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,400
Young lady,

348
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,180
it’s so smart of you.

349
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,350
You guess correctly.

350
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,070
Many people

351
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,560
find it an easy riddle,

352
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,560
but they fail to

353
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,540
figure out the answer.

354
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,520
Good. Good. Good.

355
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,330
In the word “smiles”,

356
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,550
there is another word “mile”

357
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,310
between the first “s” and the last “s”.

358
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,720
It must be “smiles”.

359
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,280
- Yeah. - That’s it.

360
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,970
I didn’t expect that.

361
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,220
A “mile”

362
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:40,800
between the first “s” and the last “s”.

363
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,490
It seems like an easy question.

364
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,530
But it’s not easy at all.

365
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,870
Boss, he was kidding.

366
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,050
Young lady,

367
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,400
since you guessed the riddle,

368
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,960
go to the pavilion on the right

369
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,150
to get your reward.

370
00:19:59,150 --> 00:19:59,760
Okay.

371
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,080
So many men are here

372
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,070
and they keep sweating.

373
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,340
You win the jackpot,

374
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,010
but the reward isn’t good.

375
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,380
You don’t need to get it.

376
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:13,860
Since it’s a jackpot,

377
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,920
it means good luck.

378
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,520
Please wait, Young Master.

379
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,780
I’ll go get it.

380
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,580
Stop.

381
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,110
Wait here. I’ll get it for you.

382
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,860
What a clever young man!

383
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,530
It’s an easy one.

384
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:30,800
Take your time.

385
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:31,890
Bravo. Bravo.

386
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:32,800
I got it.

387
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,950
It’s “peace”.

388
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,270
Two taels of silver as the jackpot.

389
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,280
Two taels of silver as the jackpot.

390
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,450
Sir.

391
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,620
You’re so brilliant.

392
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,150
You guessed a riddle again.

393
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:55,880
That was my luck.

394
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,870
Thank you. Thank you.

395
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,020
Bravo!

396
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,070
Please wait.

397
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,550
Excuse me.

398
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,200
The rabbit lantern in your hand

399
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,290
looks so cute.

400
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,700
I want to buy one

401
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,780
for my girl, too.

402
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,290
Could you tell me where I can get it?

403
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,360
Turn right at the third crossing

404
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,270
and see the sixth shop

405
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,050
on Zhuque Lantern Avenue.

406
00:21:59,050 --> 00:21:59,960
You can buy one there.

407
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,820
That sounds clear.

408
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,850
But we’re not local.

409
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,290
Could you please lead the way?

410
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:11,240
Sorry, I’m too busy to lead the way.

411
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:19,980
If you like it,

412
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,250
I’ll give it to you.

413
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,190
Thanks.

414
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,320
Scenery in the north

415
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,430
isn’t as good as that in our place.

416
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,330
My lady.

417
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:48,830
The girl

418
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:49,390
who held the rabbit lantern

419
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,380
isn’t a simple person.

420
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,630
Her eyes

421
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,000
look so much like

422
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,160
the Master of Storm Token one year ago.

423
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,020
You mean the one

424
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,890
who killed Yuwen Hao

425
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,080
and badly wounded you?

426
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:02,970
Are you sure?

427
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,200
That year,

428
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,120
she was all bundled up

429
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,340
when I could only see her eyes.

430
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,250
But I’ll never

431
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,910
forget her eyes.

432
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,960
When I tracked her down to the river,

433
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,060
I killed her snake maid

434
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,680
who escorted her

435
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,920
before they noticed.

436
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,340
In the cart,

437
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,670
I scratched her dress

438
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,610
and I did see the pattern of manjusaka

439
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,760
on her back.

440
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,860
I’m sure she’s Luo He’s daughter.

441
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,040
But the Ice Trick she’s using

442
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,110
reaches a very high level.

443
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,680
Though she was badly hurt

444
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,680
during the jail delivery,

445
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,360
I still failed to defeat her.

446
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,230
I didn’t know

447
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,510
what happened later.

448
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,070
But her eyes had

449
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,820
devastating charm.

450
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,840
That girl looks so much alike her.

451
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,750
Let’s go after her, then.

452
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,990
We’ll try and see if she is.

453
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,190
Aye.

454
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:22,610
Take it.

455
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,410
Who are you?

456
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:44,790
Make way!

457
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,420
Get out of the way.

458
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,190
Get out of the way.

459
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,450
My lady.

460
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,890
That girl has strong marital arts,

461
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,830
but not as strong as

462
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,180
the Master of Storm Token.

463
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,110
A partner of hers came.

464
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,880
Yan Xun, son of Marquis Dingbei.

465
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,200
Yan Xun?

466
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,510
Tonight, he bites the hook.

467
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,230
My lady, don’t worry.

468
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,020
People who come to kill Yan Xun

469
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,190
are waiting outside of the city.

470
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,390
You really are taking

471
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:36,370
such an unfathomable move.

472
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:37,580
Yinxin.

473
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,250
You should have been having
an ancestor cult tonight.

474
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,640
But now you’re coming far away with me.

475
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,470
Do you hate that?

476
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,770
It’s my duty.

477
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,530
Your Highness, you’re beautiful

478
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,190
and young.

479
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:53,970
But you’re travelling all around,

480
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:55,320
working for the imperial court.

481
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,320
I feel sorry about that.

482
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,210
I’ll go handle it.

483
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,910
In a few days, Emperor of Wei

484
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:03,450
will realize that

485
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,560
the deployment diagram of Yanbei

486
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,470
has been stolen.

487
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,940
Thank you, then.

488
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,250
Sorry to bother you

489
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,540
for my own problem.

490
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,650
If I can make you

491
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,540
feel happy,

492
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,040
I’m willing to risk any danger.

493
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,270
It’s easier to get on the horse
than getting off, isn’t it?

494
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,290
Beg me and then I’ll save you.

495
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,750
Why must I beg you?

496
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,010
Tell me your name

497
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,550
before you became a maid.

498
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,620
Then I’ll save you.

499
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:21,490
Who did you offend?

500
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,280
I was also hunted

501
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:22,940
with you.

502
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,400
Catch that girl. Hurry.

503
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,740
I don’t think so.

504
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,460
I think they are

505
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,770
coming after you.

506
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,780
But I can protect you.

507
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,160
Stop nagging. Just run.

508
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,070
How do you feel?

509
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,920
Are you alright?

510
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,160
Yes.

511
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,260
Get up.

512
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,120
See? I’m right.

513
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:09,680
We’re getting into the hunting field

514
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,550
that hunters make.

515
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,350
Hunting field?

516
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,550
Look. The walls are smooth.

517
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,910
The miasma on the ground is poisonous.

518
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,880
There’s danger if we stay for long.

519
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,010
How do we get up?

520
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,750
You’re hurt.

521
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,430
Idiot. I mean your hands.

522
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,940
Idiot.

523
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:49,290
I can’t stay here overnight.

524
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,190
I’ve got something important to do.

525
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,090
It doesn’t look high over there.

526
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,230
Let’s get up from this place.

527
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,920
Come on.

528
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,740
Step on my shoulder and get out.

529
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,250
Then ask people to pick me up.

530
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,250
Come.

531
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,250
You’re a noble man.

532
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,730
Step on your shoulder?

533
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:15,980
Can I really do that?

534
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:19,440
Sure. No problem.

535
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,050
I’m tall and you’re short.
I’m heavy and you’re light.

536
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,230
I’m a man and you’re a lady.

537
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,820
Come on me.

538
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,500
You look down on ladies?

539
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,970
I don’t. Come on.

540
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:32,550
See how I’ll step on your shoulder.

541
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,170
Come on. I’ll stay lower.

542
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,780
Are you okay?

543
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,970
Yes.

544
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,590
Can you climb up?

545
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:52,770
Yes.

546
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,630
Are you up?

547
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,530
You can’t be leaving me alone, can you?

548
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,540
Wait. I’ll get someone to save you.

549
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,640
Okay. Go.

550
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:40,870
Go. Go.

551
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,740
If I can’t meet my sisters

552
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,480
before one in the morning,

553
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,720
they’ll be in danger

554
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,310
without the slave-releasing certificate.

555
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,640
They’re my families.

556
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,780
I can’t leave them alone.

557
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:23,610
Yan Xun is a noble man.

558
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,420
No matter how nice he is to me,

559
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,410
I can’t leave my sisters alone for him.

560
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,820
Yan Xun

561
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,210
trusts me so much.

562
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,600
He’s stuck in a trap filled with miasma.

563
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,600
If I don’t save him,

564
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,340
he’ll die.

565
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:50,610
How can I let him die?

566
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,420
I have only two hours

567
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,890
before I should meet my sisters.

568
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,490
There’s still time.

569
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,220
The smashed bean bun

570
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,460
used to be

571
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,690
my favorite.

572
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,280
But now,

573
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,900
why can I hardly enjoy it?

574
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,230
Because you’re nervous.

575
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,060
There’s something on your mind.

576
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,170
You know what?

577
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,730
We should eat slowly.

578
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:47,490
Later,

579
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:49,200
we’ll hurry on with our trip with this.

580
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,040
Xiaoba,

581
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,620
I’m getting more scared.

582
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,350
Think about it.

583
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,090
If Young Master Yue really finds that

584
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,320
Xiaoliu steals his seal

585
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,530
and fakes a slave-releasing certificate,

586
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:00,420
then Xiaoliu...

587
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,510
Look.

588
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,510
The two ladies

589
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,950
look beautiful.

590
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:11,020
- These two? - Yeah.

591
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,180
One of them must be mine.

592
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,180
The one on the left is pretty.

593
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,620
- I like that one. - Wait. Wait.

594
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,270
Come. Come.

595
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,730
You know what? I wager that

596
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:19,900
these two girls

597
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:21,670
can’t be common people.

598
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,640
Why?

599
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:24,480
They may be

600
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:28,220
escaping concubines or fugitive slaves.

601
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,980
Keep your voice down.

602
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,810
I hear people at that table saying

603
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,580
we’re like fugitive slaves.

604
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:54,830
What are you doing? Killing me?

605
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,690
It took me so much trouble to save you.

606
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,260
But you’re still yelling.

607
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:00,760
Will you come up or not?

608
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,250
Come up.

609
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,600
Hurry.

610
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,120
At last.

611
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,650
I was so cold.

612
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:24,650
It’s weird.

613
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,630
When I come out,

614
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,360
I don’t feel that cold.

615
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,240
If I didn’t come to save you,

616
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,370
would you hate me?

617
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,520
Why would I hate you?

618
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,870
If you didn’t come,

619
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,140
you must have gone the wrong way

620
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,310
or found the wrong trap.

621
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,150
Maybe,

622
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,290
you were crying and yelling,

623
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:47,130
“Your Excellency, where are you?

624
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,130
It’s so dark and scary.

625
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:50,640
I’m so scared.”

626
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,340
I’ve got something urgent.

627
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:56,280
I have no time to play with you.

628
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:00,800
What?

629
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,570
Why are you crippling?

630
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,810
I really have to go.

631
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,160
Fine. Fine.

632
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,820
As the reward

633
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,290
for not leaving me alone,

634
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,590
I’ll carry you back.

635
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:16,650
Come up.

636
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,280
Are you ready?

637
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,510
What’s this?

638
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:31,720
Nothing.

639
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:34,610
You’re a girl.

640
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:35,710
Why are you so heavy?

641
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,700
Go.

642
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,500
Carry me to Zhuque Avenue hurriedly.

643
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,790
What makes you so hurried?

644
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,320
Go through the forest and we’ll arrive.

645
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,790
Your Excellency.

646
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,210
How does it feel

647
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,030
to carry someone for the first time?

648
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,480
Feels fresh.

649
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,270
Carry me steadily.

650
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,700
I’m sliding down.

651
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,850
All right. All right.

652
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,350
You know what?

653
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,780
In two more months,

654
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,130
Huolei Plain in Yanbei

655
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,340
will be full of

656
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,840
boundless wild flowers.

657
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,200
There, spring comes later

658
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,510
than that in Chang’an.

659
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,050
But it’s more beautiful than Chang’an.

660
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,630
What?

661
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,920
If you go,

662
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,190
you’ll love it.

663
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:16,920
Go back to Yanbei with me.

664
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,750
Could you say something serious?

665
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,670
I am serious.

666
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,700
Since I’m asking,

667
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,180
answer me seriously.

668
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:26,830
All right?

669
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,920
Here comes my horse.

670
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,510
What?

671
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:42,480
What?

672
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,990
Many people are coming from

673
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:45,650
your mansion?

674
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,640
And they bring strong weapons.

675
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,900
Little maid.

676
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,000
You’re good.

677
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:08,940
Let me pull you.

678
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,740
Be careful.

679
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,340
Come.

680
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,180
Watch your step.

681
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,140
Mom.

682
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,700
Take my hand.

683
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,660
Be careful.

684
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,450
They ate their words!

685
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:18,360
Yeah.

686
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,840
They promised to give us
the slave-releasing certificate

687
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,370
after repairing the great wall.

688
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:22,180
Yeah. Yeah.

689
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,280
Hurry up, guys.

690
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,790
We’re escaping to Yanbei.

691
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:25,280
Yes.

692
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,300
After we arrive,

693
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,990
we’ll be free.

694
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,340
- Yeah. - Yeah.

695
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,880
Those frauds.

696
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,550
Yeah, they’re frauds.

697
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,190
I can’t walk anymore.

698
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,430
Hurry. Hurry up.

699
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,860
You’re a fraud.

700
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,900
Shameless betrayer.

701
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,960
You’ll be punished!

702
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,580
We won’t let you go even after we die!

703
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:50,020
They don’t let us go.

704
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,430
Yeah.

705
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,090
Yeah. Yeah.

706
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,640
You’re brutes.

707
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:57,300
You’re fugitive slaves
without the slave-releasing certificate.

708
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,160
Kill them.

709
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:20,300
Are you crazy?

710
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,860
They are with the warlord of Wei.

711
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,030
Don’t act rashly.

712
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,490
They’re fugitive slaves.

713
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,450
We’re not powerful or qualified to help them.

714
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,180
I’m a hostage from Yanbei.

715
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,370
You’re a salve of the Yuwen family.

716
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,520
If you rush out,

717
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,840
have you thought about the consequence?

718
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,170
Such rabbles deserve to die.

719
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,040
More fugitive slaves are on the run.

720
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,530
Send guards throughout the city
and hunt them down.

721
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:20,290
Go.

722
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,820
If I don’t find Xiaoqi and Xiaoba in time.

723
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:40,890
they’ll also be killed

724
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:42,650
like these refugees.

725
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:51,710
Fugitive slave?

726
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:55,220
You’re a fugitive slave, too.

727
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,120
What’s wrong?

728
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,110
I’m a humble maid,

729
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,650
who isn’t as noble as you.

730
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,190
I can protect you.

731
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:17,090
Your Excellency.

732
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,540
Thank you for saving me.

733
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,640
But could you protect

734
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,880
all slaves over the world?

735
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,410
We’re people from different worlds.

736
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:26,940
Since we have different purposes,

737
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,930
we’d better go different ways sooner.

738
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,020
And...

739
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:34,740
Stop following me.

740
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,790
Boss, the bill, please.

741
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:50,110
All right. All right.

742
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:50,860
Thank you, sir.

743
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,080
Thank you, sir. See you.

744
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:00,720
Boss.

745
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:02,340
Excuse me.

746
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,980
Did you see two girls?

747
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:06,840
I know

748
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,300
who you are talking about.

749
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,340
One is in red

750
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,230
and the other is in blue?

751
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:10,570
Yes. Yes. I mean them.

752
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:11,560
Where are they?

753
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:12,680
I heard

754
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,310
they were not ordinary girls,

755
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:15,430
but humble maids

756
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:16,750
without the slave-releasing certificate.

757
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:17,360
They were

758
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,520
taken away

759
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,540
by some noble young men.

760
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:22,260
Taken away?

761
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:24,040
Where were they taken?

762
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:25,740
I guess

763
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,040
they were heading for the city wall.

764
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,060
As for what they wanted,

765
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:28,970
I can guess that

766
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:30,270
even without thinking.

767
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:31,120
Thank you.

768
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:31,910
