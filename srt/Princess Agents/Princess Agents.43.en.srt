Chun.

00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,990
Brother.

18
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,980
What happened to you?

19
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,410
It’s all because of Chu Qiao.

20
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,890
Without her,

21
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,740
nothing would have happened.

22
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,120
It’s all because of her.

23
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,010
Chu Qiao?

24
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,770
If you catch her,
you will catch the traitor,

25
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,670
Yan Xun.

26
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,960
Just go and catch her.

27
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,190
Yuan Song.

28
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,650
Where did Chu Qiao go?

29
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,310
That way.

30
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,550
Let’s go.

31
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,580
Yes.

32
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,780
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

33
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,330
Fortunately,

34
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,350
the Thirteenth Prince and Princess Chun

35
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,650
have come back safe and sound.

36
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,120
They’re not!

37
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,310
My most beloved son

38
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,190
has become disabled.

39
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,280
Pass my decree.

40
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,880
Capture that traitor Yan Xun.

41
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,840
Bring back him or his body.

42
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,860
Yes, Your Majesty.

43
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,500
Your Majesty, what about the maidservant

44
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,180
who escaped with Yan Xun?

45
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,750
Kill her as well. No exception.

46
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,340
Aye.

47
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,190
Darling,

48
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,690
you look unwell.

49
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,570
I know that you are worried about Hao.

50
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,190
But you still need to

51
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,500
take care of yourself.

52
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,720
I have already sent out
Court of Judicial Review,

53
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,760
palace guards

54
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,590
and the government of Chang’an.

55
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,700
There will be news about Hao soon.

56
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,670
Your Majesty.

57
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,750
Your Majesty.

58
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,450
Your Grace,

59
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,840
Zhu Siliu from the Hongshan House

60
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,960
of the Yuwen Household is here.

61
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,110
He must know what happened to Hao.

62
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,770
He must know it.

63
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:46,640
Send him in.

64
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,440
Aye.

65
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,820
You found Hao, didn’t you?

66
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,240
You found my son, didn’t you?

67
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,130
Your Grace, I know

68
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,580
that you are worried about Prince.

69
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,920
I have searched everywhere

70
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,720
for him.

71
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,030
But... I...

72
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,130
Where is he?

73
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,810
Your Grace, it’s all

74
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:19,700
Yuwen Huai’s fault.

75
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,960
I searched every corner.

76
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,230
By the time I found him,

77
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,940
it was already too late.

78
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,390
Prince.

79
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,440
Open it.

80
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,380
I said open it!

81
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,690
Don’t, Your Grace.

82
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,260
You can’t see it.

83
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,010
Move!

84
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,830
Your Grace.

85
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,510
Your Grace.

86
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,480
I knew

87
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,360
someone like me

88
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,890
didn’t deserve a good life.

89
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,570
Your Grace, please don’t say that.

90
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,830
But

91
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,560
I’m the sinner.

92
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,830
If you want to punish anyone,

93
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,670
please punish me.

94
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,000
Why did you

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,170
take my son away?

96
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,230
He was so young.

97
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,140
It’s you, isn’t it?

98
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,460
You couldn’t keep

99
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,360
your own kid,

100
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,780
so you just sent your daughter

101
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,350
to take mine away,

102
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,060
didn’t you?

103
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,980
Your daughter

104
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,750
has stolen everything from me.

105
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,100
She killed my son.

106
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,740
I’ll let her pay.

107
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,310
Killing you

108
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,970
would be too easy.

109
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,380
Castrate him.

110
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,440
- Aye.
- Aye.

111
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:28,560
Your Grace!

112
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,510
Your Grace!

113
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,730
Move!

114
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,030
Your Grace, please just kill me.

115
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:31,860
Your Grace!

116
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,280
Give me a quick death!

117
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,940
Kill me now!

118
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,840
Your Grace!

119
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,190
Listen,

120
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,550
from now on,

121
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,320
you’re my servant

122
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,830
because you owe me.

123
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,270
Yes, Your Grace.

124
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,660
Your Excellency,

125
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,750
our people are back.

126
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,820
There is no sign of Miss Achu.

127
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,700
It’s been days

128
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,040
but you still haven’t found anything
about her.

129
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,710
Your Excellency, we tried our best.

130
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,430
Keep looking.

131
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,620
Send in more men.

132
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,070
You must bring Achu back.

133
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,550
Understand?

134
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,330
Your Excellency,

135
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,530
right after that prince
and princess returned,

136
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,000
Miss Achu was

137
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,320
on the wanted list.

138
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,360
Right now,

139
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,760
the order for arrest

140
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,540
with Miss Achu’s portrait

141
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,880
has been spread

142
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,140
all over the state.

143
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,750
The entire state is searching for

144
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,480
Miss Chu.

145
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,410
They bite the hand that feeds.

146
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,770
Ajing.

147
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,090
Send out my order.

148
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,830
Whoever lays a finger

149
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,950
on Achu,

150
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,540
I will

151
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,420
slaughter his entire family.

152
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,500
Aye.

153
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,310
Your Highness. Young Master Wei is here.

154
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,440
Your Highness?

155
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,990
Your Highness, it’s me.

156
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,220
Your Highness.

157
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,160
Your Highness.

158
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,470
Chun.

159
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,210
Come in.

160
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,390
I am so glad that

161
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,860
you’ve returned safely.

162
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,660
I was so worried about you

163
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,340
that I couldn’t eat or sleep.

164
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,530
Thank heaven,

165
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,270
you’re safe.

166
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,590
Otherwise…

167
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,730
Wei Shuye,

168
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,330
you fancy me, right?

169
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,240
I…

170
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,130
I’ll be with you

171
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,190
only on one condition.

172
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:55,840
Chun…

173
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,740
Are you leaving now?

174
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,330
Yes.

175
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,070
Where to?

176
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,070
Before Yan Xun escaped from Chang’an,

177
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,330
we arrested a spy

178
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,250
from the Liang State

179
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,200
and managed to get a detailed confession.

180
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,810
That information

181
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,120
helped us to get rid of

182
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,700
Liang spies planted in Chang’an.

183
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,200
Then we followed this lead

184
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,890
and acquired the entire network

185
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,440
of their spies throughout the state.

186
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,480
They were involved in

187
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,230
Marquis Dingbei’s case

188
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,190
and the riot in Chang’an.

189
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,760
This time,

190
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,000
I’ll wipe them all out.

191
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,830
After I leave,

192
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,070
you need to be careful.

193
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,290
Take care.

194
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,150
I heard that maid

195
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,610
who escorted Princess
and Prince Yu back to Chang’an

196
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,650
is separated from the Xiuli Army

197
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,140
and has become a wanted criminal.

198
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,550
Yes.

199
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,820
If you come across her,

200
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,220
what will you do?

201
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,900
Grandfather,

202
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,610
what do you think I should do?

203
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,460
I am not telling you to kill her,

204
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,030
but I hope you won’t

205
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,940
get involved with her again.

206
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,290
You are disobeying my order?

207
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,300
You were just like me.

208
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:10,110
You’d rather break your legs

209
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,800
to protect

210
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,470
that woman.

211
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,110
Why are you

212
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,600
forcing me to give her up now?

213
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,710
Because I regret what I did.

214
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,030
Does that surprise you?

215
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,350
I was too young.

216
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,580
Her sweet talk fooled me

217
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,430
and clouded my judgment.

218
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,580
I risked my future

219
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,960
and ruined my life.

220
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,680
I let the entire family down,

221
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,360
and broke their hearts

222
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,300
for a woman who betrayed me

223
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,560
and my love

224
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,110
and didn’t belong to me
from the very beginning.

225
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:46,860
What’s wrong?

226
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,030
Shouldn’t I regret it?

227
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,020
If you could turn back time,

228
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,380
would you do nothing

229
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,710
and just let that woman die?

230
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,400
Maybe you’d regret

231
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,830
what you did

232
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,080
many years later.

233
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:19,090
But if I don’t do it now,
I will definitely regret it.

234
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,090
Please excuse me.

235
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,370
Those who are competent
should serve the court.

236
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,310
When the state is in peace,

237
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,360
the legislators should revise the law.

238
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,030
According to the poem,

239
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,070
even a great power will be afraid of you.

240
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,330
Don’t be nosy when you are out there.

241
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,460
Better safe than sorry.

242
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,390
Mencius says…

243
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,300
Mencius says,

244
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,220
“a gentleman should always
keep benevolence

245
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,400
and manners in mind”.

246
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,510
Always be caring and respectful.

247
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,650
But…

248
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,890
If someone is bullying the weak

249
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,270
and I walk away without doing anything,

250
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,850
won’t that be the opposite of benevolence?

251
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:06,990
Daibao,

252
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,800
we’re living in a peaceful world.

253
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,270
There won’t be any bad people, right?

254
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,330
I think

255
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,160
if I come across two farmers arguing,

256
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,780
I can stop them

257
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,370
and let them make peace with each other.

258
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,790
That will be all,

259
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,770
right?

260
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,510
You agree with me, right?

261
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,200
Daibao, am I right?

262
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,020
What…

263
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,010
Daibao,

264
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,550
are you taking the wrong path?

265
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:56,080
My name is Liang Shaoqing.

266
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,480
I accidentally

267
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,200
took the wrong path and ended up here.

268
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,420
I am leaving now.

269
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,410
Right now.

270
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:04,920
I am going.

271
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:05,720
Daibao,

272
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,210
let’s go. Why aren’t you moving?

273
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,000
Daibao,

274
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,840
let’s go.

275
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,430
Well…

276
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,330
Look,

277
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,690
you people

278
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,520
are ganging up on a girl.

279
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,770
That’s unfair.

280
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,050
There is an old saying that

281
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,630
fairness is upheld by the world,

282
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,080
while unfairness won’t survive.

283
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,160
What you’re doing is unfair.

284
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,920
I can report your case to the government.

285
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,420
Let’s go to court.

286
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,430
Your dispute

287
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,950
can be easily resolved there.

288
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,970
Other than that,

289
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,120
you can tell me

290
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,210
what happened.

291
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,370
I can help you make peace.

292
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:47,450
Shut up.

293
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,620
Well…

294
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,770
You are

295
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,350
a delicate girl.

296
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,040
How could you

297
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,130
battle those men?

298
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,290
Look, they are all

299
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,220
holding swords.

300
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,020
What if they hurt you?

301
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,910
You’d better

302
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,290
come with me.

303
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,160
If something is

304
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,560
bothering you,

305
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,420
I can be of help.

306
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,170
No more violence.

307
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,790
It is uncivil.

308
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,690
Look…

309
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,080
Why are you on my horse?

310
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,870
We shouldn’t be so close.

311
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,710
My books! My money!

312
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,570
My poems!

313
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,870
My pass!

314
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,550
Why are you doing this?

315
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,770
Stop right there!

316
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:01,890
You…

317
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,150
How could you

318
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,540
be so rude?

319
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,530
I saved you,

320
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:08,980
but you threw

321
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,020
all my money and stuff away.

322
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,420
How dare you!

323
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,110
I guess I am just in bad luck.

324
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,740
What a day!

325
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,470
Let’s go, Daibao.

326
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,630
Let’s go.

327
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,190
He was running too fast,

328
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,770
and needs some rest.

329
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:28,910
What are you doing?

330
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,300
What am I doing?

331
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,160
To get back

332
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,070
all my stuff.

333
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,920
Do you want to die?

334
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,270
I’d be dead if I lost them.

335
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,500
Without the pass,

336
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,570
how can I get into the city?

337
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,560
How can I stay in an inn?

338
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,310
Besides,

339
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,080
I have nothing to do with them.

340
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,860
What could those officials

341
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,190
possibly do to me?

342
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,170
You recognized

343
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,030
who they are.

344
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,630
Do you know who I am?

345
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:52,600
You saved me.

346
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,890
They probably think

347
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,420
you are my accomplice.

348
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,190
You are Daibao, right?

349
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,000
Thank you for saving me.

350
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,030
Miss,

351
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,460
I am the one who saved you,

352
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,810
not him.

353
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,600
Why did you thank a horse

354
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,240
instead of me?

355
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,100
Daibao,

356
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,710
I am sorry.

357
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,870
I am not speaking ill of you.

358
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,670
You saved me?

359
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,980
When did that happen?

360
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,380
Why didn’t I know?

361
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,410
I saved you,

362
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,780
but you didn’t even thank me.

363
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,010
How could you treat me like this?

364
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,350
And you even humiliated me.

365
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,910
Did you kill those officials?

366
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,410
Did you

367
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,440
carry me to escape?

368
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,180
You did nothing.

369
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,480
Why should I thank you for saving me?

370
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,080
Am I right, Daibao?

371
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,620
You…

372
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:45,970
I…

373
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,800
I went to

374
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,850
reason with them.

375
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,370
I solved the mess

376
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,390
and then…

377
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,530
Then what?

378
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:54,800
Did they put down their swords

379
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,830
and let us leave?

380
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,230
It is good
that you have a sense of justice.

381
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,390
But don’t forget to use your brain.

382
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,940
Don’t bite off more than you can chew.

383
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,080
Without your horse,

384
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,650
we would be dead by now.

385
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,350
I…

386
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,810
You won’t be able to

387
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:13,950
get your things back.

388
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,430
Take this

389
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,910
as my compensation.

390
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:17,840
I…

391
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,170
I am sorry

392
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,020
that you lost your pass.

393
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,990
You can report the loss to the government.

394
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,120
It’s not safe here.

395
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,620
I’ll escort you to the next town.

396
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,490
How about this?

397
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:29,970
I don’t want your money.

398
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,480
I am a mature

399
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,010
and honest man.

400
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,870
I won’t be safe

401
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:37,730
if I am with you.

402
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,780
Why were those officials

403
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,840
after a young girl

404
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,980
like you?

405
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,750
You are either a felon

406
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,970
or a thief.

407
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,360
Let’s go. Come on.

408
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,080
Let’s go.

409
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,480
Come.

410
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,820
Daibao, let’s go.

411
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,130
Nerd.

412
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,510
You really don’t need this money?

413
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,700
Xianyang is right ahead.

414
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,330
Without money, how could you get in?

415
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,700
I would rather die than take your money.

416
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,100
Your Excellency,

417
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,610
we are about to arrive in Hongchuan.

418
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,710
When I left Yanbei,

419
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,750
this is where my father

420
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,290
bid me farewell.

421
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,240
Back then,

422
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,950
all dukes guarding the border

423
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,300
were asked to

424
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,570
send one of their children

425
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,430
to Chang’an as a hostage.

426
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,020
No one responded.

427
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,440
Then Emperor wrote to

428
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,400
my father.

429
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,640
He read the letter,

430
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,200
turned around

431
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,870
and asked me and my two brothers,

432
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,610
“does any of you

433
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,700
volunteer to go to Chang’an?

434
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,990
You’ll only be there for a year”.

435
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,890
My eldest brother asked my father,

436
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,870
“aren’t the Emperor
and you are sworn brothers?

437
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,300
Why is he doubting you?”

438
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,420
My father responded,

439
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,500
“we’re closer than others.

440
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,510
If I don’t support him,

441
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,890
no one will”.

442
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,520
That day, I decided

443
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,850
I would go to Chang’an.

444
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,950
Because he was my father.

445
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,030
If I didn’t support him,

446
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,200
who would?

447
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,890

I’m back!

468
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,090
I’ve changed.

469
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,940
Have you?

470
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,410
Your Excellency.

471
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,660
General Cheng, where are the leaders
of all tribes?

472
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,840
Your Excellency, we went 10 kilometers

473
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,970
outside the city to check,

474
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,750
but saw no one coming.

475
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:04,980
Did you send the invitation letters

476
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,940
to them?

477
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,070
Of course.

478
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,060
And the date is said

479
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,500
to be today?

480
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,330
Yes.

481
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,730
Then why no one is here?

482
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,650
Your Excellency,

483
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,950
maybe something happened

484
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,190
on the way.

485
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,430
I’ll go and check again.

486
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:22,830
No need.

487
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,260
Your Excellency,

488
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,440
since the letters were sent out
three days ago,

489
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,230
no one has shown up.

490
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,520
The only possibility is that

491
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,520
they’ve never meant to come.

492
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,640
Why?

493
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,400
You burned Chang’an

494
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,740
fighting your way back to Yanbei.

495
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,660
Right now,

496
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,600
who doesn’t know your name?

497
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,280
The Emperor of Wei lost his dignity.

498
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,810
He won’t let it go.

499
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,660
I’m sure he will gather his troops

500
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,140
to attack Yanbei.

501
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,900
By then, the eight tribes

502
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,650
will have to battle the army of Wei.

503
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:55,290
They’re intimidated.

504
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,740
They were allies of

505
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,660
my father’s.

506
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,670
I thought they could

507
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,680
be of help.

508
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:07,230
It seems I was thinking too much.

509
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,050
I heard Huotu Tribe

510
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,150
is holding a beef feast today.

511
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,530
The leaders of all tribes

512
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:12,690
will attend.

513
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,480
Huotu Tribe?

514
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,420
Headed by Agutu

515
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,250
former leader Enge’s younger brother.

516
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:21,090
Enge is your father’s sworn brother.

517
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,730
When Beishuo was attacked,

518
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,340
Enge led his troops to help

519
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,900
but was killed

520
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,720
by Agutu on the way.

521
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:30,080
Agutu killed Enge, took his wife

522
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,650
and slaughtered

523
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:32,720
all his sons.

524
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,730
He is known as a wolf

525
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,670
on the grassland.

526
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:40,190
If you set off now,

527
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,010
you may be able to attend the feast
in time.

528
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,610
Let’s go.

529
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,850
I’ll lead the way.

530
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:53,530
Your Excellency,

531
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,040
Mr. Wu is on his way here.

532
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,080
Let him deal with

533
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,460
things here.

534
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,840
Since I am back,

535
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,740
no need to trouble him.

536
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,720
Wait for him here.

537
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,890
We’ll be back soon.

538
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:07,510
Your Excellency!

539
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,390
Your Excellency.

540
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,110
This is the new plaque.

541
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:41,740
Zhong Yu said

542
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,030
we can hang it up

543
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:43,920
after declaring war on Wei.

544
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,660
Hang it up now.

545
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,540
Are you deaf?

546
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,560
What are you waiting for?

547
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,470
His Excellency says to hang it up now.

548
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,900
= Yanbei Mansion =

549
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,750
This saber is called Phoenix.

550
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,730
It’s said to be owned by Bai Qi,

551
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:11,950
a famous general
in the Warring States period.

552
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,480
Because of the demon spirit sealed in it,

553
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,740
it needs to be fed with blood.

554
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,470
Do not waste it.

555
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,430
Thank you, Your Excellency.

556
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,260
= Yanbei Mansion =

557
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,960
Come on.

558
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,780
Here, fill your cup.

559
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,100
Let’s toast leader.

560
00:27:59,100 --> 00:27:59,840
Fill it.

561
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,720
Leader.

562
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,240
Drink up.

563
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,030
Drink up.

564
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,940
Listen,

565
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,960
that beast Yan Xun

566
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,930
intends to drag us all down

567
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,200
with him.

568
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,730
In his dreams!

569
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,020
Look at his father,

570
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,930
the Lion King of Yanbei,

571
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,090
who was invincible for 20 years

572
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:28,350
in or outside the border.

573
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,330
Still, he was beheaded

574
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:32,080
so quickly.

575
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,900
Yes.

576
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,840
That’s right.

577
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,400
Come on. Let’s drink.

578
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,630
Come on.

579
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,920
Drink up.

580
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,570
But

581
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,790
I heard on his wedding day,

582
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:47,230
he refused the marriage

583
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,620
right in front of the Emperor

584
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,930
and painted Chang’an with blood
with his men.

585
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:56,540
That’s really something.

586
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,900
That’s bluffing.

587
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,680
Yes.

588
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,500
Painted the city with blood?

589
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,110
Did you see that yourself?

590
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,250
Drink!

591
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,070
Drink up! Drink up!

592
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,910
I... I’ll drink.

593
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,060
Fill the cup.

594
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:14,940
Yes.

595
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:17,370
- Don’t bluff about him.
- Yes.

596
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,520
That kid simply

597
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,870
took a chance to

598
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,390
sneak out of Chang’an.

599
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:25,700
Then he ran all the way back to Yanbei

600
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,790
like a defeated dog.

601
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,410
He was sent to Chang’an

602
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,250
when he was a child.

603
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,360
He enjoyed a comfortable life there

604
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,770
for so long

605
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:37,950
that he no longer

606
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:40,910
has the backbone

607
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,050
to wield his saber.

608
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,060
Yes, right.

609
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,120
Once the war begins,

610
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,950
he cannot beat this girl.

611
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:50,950
That’s right.

612
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,320
Yes.

613
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:52,910
Right.

614
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:53,560
Let’s drink.

615
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,080
Here.

616
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,480
Let me fill your cup.

617
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:00,910
Come on.

618
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,150
Who are you?

619
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,750
What are you here for?

620
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,510
I am asking you.

621
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,600
Are you all deaf...

622
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,350
Sit down.

623
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,140
Let me introduce myself.

624
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:06,960
I’m Yan Xun,

625
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,220
your new king.

626
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,820
Young Master,

627
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,660
Xianyang is right ahead of us.

628
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,020
Over there.

629
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,970
This way, please.

630
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,160
Is everything done

631
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:53,890
as requested?

632
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:55,080
Yes, Young Master.

633
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,290
Upon receiving the secret message,

634
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,730
I found three hidden strongholds of

635
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,260
Liang spies in Xianyang

636
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,300
following

637
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,150
your order.

638
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,710
The biggest one is here

639
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,280
and is likely the most important one.

640
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:07,120
But we came too late.

641
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,420
When we broke in,

642
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,520
all the secret letters here

643
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,710
had been burnt into ashes.

644
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,360
The spies here

645
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,030
had killed themselves with poison.

646
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:20,600
Who are they?

647
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:21,700
She is

648
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,460
the chef here

649
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,550
to cook meals.

650
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,720
That is her son,

651
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,710
said to be a local.

652
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,780
He doesn’t know anything.

653
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,280
Please!

654
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,720
Do not kill my baby!

655
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,940
We do not know anything.

656
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,920
Please let us go!

657
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,720
Come here, kid.

658
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:51,090
No, don’t.

659
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:52,960
My baby!

660
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,900
No!

661
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,270
What are you doing? Let me go!

662
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,340
Let me go!

663
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,390
My baby!

664
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,920
Is she your mom?

665
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,060
Where is your mom?

666
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:23,960
Take her away.

667
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,000
Interrogate her.

668
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,010
Aye.

669
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:33,710
Kid,

670
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,240
do you have any other relatives?

671
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,030
From now on,

672
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,320
he’s yours.

673
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:40,970
I…

674
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:41,980
But… Young Master,

675
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,300
I am not even married.

676
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,340
How can I have a son

677
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,470
all of a sudden?

678
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,660
Young Master cares about you.

679
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,900
If you remain single forever,

680
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,450
at least, your son

681
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:52,750
can look after you when you’re old.

682
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,630
But, I...

683
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:54,960
Take him with you.

684
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:57,170
Go.

685
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,190
Call me Father.

686
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:02,910
Father.

687
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,630
Young Master,

688
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,290
that woman has confessed.

689
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:08,700
She said

690
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,350
the people from Liang

691
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,280
were close to a chamber of commerce

692
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,350
recently.

693
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,510
Most importantly,

694
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,690
the chamber isn’t clean.

695
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,160
Here’s the thing.

696
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,570
Businessmen here

697
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,350
formed several chambers of commerce.

698
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:23,950
They did businesses together

699
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:24,980
and supported each other.

700
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,150
Gradually,

701
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,910
four Grand Chambers appeared.

702
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,720
These four chambers

703
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,810
almost controlled every business

704
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:33,850
in the city.

705
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,350
But three years ago,

706
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,210
a Xianyang Chamber

707
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,380
appeared out of nowhere.

708
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,440
It developed quickly.

709
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,220
Whoever acted against it

710
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,550
ended tragically.

711
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,010
Now, in the southeast, rice

712
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:51,130
flour, grains, oil,

713
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,860
tea and silk,

714
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,840
everything, except for water transport
and salt,

715
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,070
is in their control.

716
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,240
I heard that

717
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,120
they even trade

718
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,530
war-horses and iron.

719
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,400
The one Liang contacts

720
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,230
is this Xianyang Chamber?

721
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,030
Yes, it is.

722
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,700
Who’s their leader?

723
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,930
Their leader

724
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,350
seems to be

725
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:19,360
a wealthy merchant

726
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,860
named Liu Xi, Lord Liu,

727
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:23,040
also known as the Kind-hearted Liu.

728
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,130
He used to

729
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:24,960
hold an official post,

730
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,170
but somehow

731
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:28,270
gave that up and returned home

732
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,390
to do business.

733
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,560
But rumor has it

734
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,350
that the one

735
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,690
in charge of the chamber isn’t him

736
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,250
but a gangster.

737
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,000
Who is that?

738
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:41,640
What does he look like?

739
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,860
I’ve never seen him.

740
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,060
They call him Mr. Feng.

741
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,460
You mean

742
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,970
this chamber is related to Liang?

743
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:50,810
Yes.

744
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,220
I think

745
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,500
they are all from Liang.

746
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,790
Look, in this chamber,

747
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,210
except Liu Xi,

748
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:59,300
everyone else just came out

749
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,100
all of a sudden.

750
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,280
Their identities and backgrounds

751
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,230
are mysterious.

752
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,700
About that Liu Xi you mentioned,

753
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,710
where did he serve?

754
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,710
That I don’t know.

755
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,130
But I can ask around.

756
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,180
Alright. Check him out.

757
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:14,780
Aye.

758
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:15,700
Wait.

759
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,430
Where are we

760
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,600
on the task I gave you?

761
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,870
Rest assured.

762
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:23,780
I have sent out

763
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,030
the portrait of that girl.

764
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,360
Now,

765
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,350
our people in the city are working on it.

766
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,130
Once the girl

767
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:31,010
enters the city,

768
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:32,320
we will locate her instantly.

769
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,650
Do not be too confident.

770
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,250
They are just like you.

771
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,990
They can change their looks and voices.

772
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:43,300
It won’t be easy to find her.

773
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,230
Look, guys.

774
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,480
Have a look.

775
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,440
New arrivals.

776
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:52,150
Have a look.

777
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:55,200
Best slaves

778
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,030
in Xianyang.

779
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,400
Take a look.

780
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,710
Anyone you prefer?

781
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:04,770
The price is negotiable.

782
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,850
Have a look.

783
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,340
Best slaves

784
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,960
in Xianyang.

785
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,450
All new.

786
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:11,890
You don’t recognize me?

787
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:13,990
You...

788
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,480
Be quiet.

789
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,320
Or I won’t

790
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:16,840
get you out

791
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,580
and I’ll leave on my own.

792
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,800
Tell me

793
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,130
if there’s anyone you like.

794
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,170
Sir,

795
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,510
do you want to buy a servant?

796
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,930
I’m checking to see
if there’s someone suitable.

797
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:30,790
Alright.

798
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,610
How much is this one?

799
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:33,800
Him?

800
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,060
He was just caught by the guards

801
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,620
at the city gate.

802
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,950
He was rude

803
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,980
and he cursed the judge.

804
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:45,960
You sound like a handful.

805
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:49,270
I like someone with a temper.

806
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:50,420
I’ll take him.

807
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,810
Lucky you!

808
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:00,710
Fine.

809
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,120
Hurry up!

810
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,220
Untie me.

811
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:05,950
Is this how you speak to

812
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:06,820
your master?

813
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,190
What master?

814
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,750
I am a scholar.

815
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,680
How can you buy me

816
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,520
with money?

817
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:13,920
You are insulting my dignity.

818
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,880
I end up like this

819
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,890
all because of you.

820
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,780
That is not true.

821
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,090
First, I did not ask you to save me.

822
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,360
You stepped into something

823
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,490
beyond your ability,

824
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:24,150
you know.

825
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:25,840
Now that I saved you,

826
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,110
we are even.

827
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:29,170
Second, I offered you money,

828
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:31,340
but you were too arrogant to accept it.

829
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:31,970
I...

830
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:32,620
Third,

831
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:34,520
you ending up like this

832
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,640
is all your fault.

833
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,880
You deserve it.

834
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,400
I have nothing to do with it.

835
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,810
How dare you...

836
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:41,730
Zip it.

837
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:42,820
Listen,

838
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,640
I have something

839
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,380
important to do.

840
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,810
No one will save you

841
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:46,840
if you get caught again.

842
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,070
Goodbye.

843
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:54,250
Fine.

844
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,030
A man has his own principles

845
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,840
to do or not to do certain things.

846
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,210
I’ll take my leave.

847
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,160
Your Highness,

848
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:26,800
I assume you aren’t here

849
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:32,210
simply to drink

850
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,140
or chat with me.

851
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,770
You are a boring man.

852
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,450
I wouldn’t come here

853
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,600
for drinks.

854
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,420
= Chu Qiao =

855
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,220
Chu Qiao?

856
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:07,270
She works for Yan Xun.

857
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,530
All eyes are on her lately.

858
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:14,450
A bounty of one thousand taels of silver

859
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:15,700
is put on her head by Emperor of Wei.

860
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,300
So,

861
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,060
do you also know her?

862
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,690
I met her

863
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,540
in Chang’an

864
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,700
earlier.

865
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,460
Your Highness

866
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,080
are indeed a player.

867
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:39,870
She must have seriously offended you

868
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:43,650
that you’re having no mercy

869
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,260
on her.

870
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,180
No.

871
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,920
On the contrary,

872
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:52,460
I want you to save her.

873
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,440
Your Highness,

874
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,020
I, Zhan Ziyu, live to kill people.

875
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,010
Saving lives

876
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:03,670
is new to me.

877
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:05,190
You’ll be rewarded handsomely.

878
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:11,210
I have information

879
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:12,990
which is important to you.

880
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:21,170
It’s about a person
you’ve been looking for,

881
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:22,510
Xia Chong.

882
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:31,790
You know where he is?

883
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:38,100
In the prison of Liang.

884
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,530
Let me out!

885
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:02,370
- Let me out now!
- Be quiet!

886
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,140
Let me out!

887
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,280
Let me out!

888
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,800
Let me out!

889
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,250
Let me out!

890
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,260
Miss.

891
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:17,150
Miss, are you here for me again?

892
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,960
How did you get caught again?

893
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,770
I... Well...

894
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,100
How would I know?

895
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,870
Miss, you are the only one

896
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:27,820
who can get me out of here.

897
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,510
I am a scholar.

898
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:31,010
How can I become a slave?

899
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:32,000
Also, they are always

900
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,520
picky about me.

901
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,310
This is...

902
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,360
Get me out now.

903
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,000
How?

904
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:40,030
