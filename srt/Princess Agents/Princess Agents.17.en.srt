Young Master.

21
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,400
Young Master.

22
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,090
Young Master, wake up.

Yuwen Yue!

Yuwen Yue!

Wake up!

26
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,310
Wake up, Young Master!

27
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,660
Who are you?

28
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,550
The musician Fangqin or a spy of Liang?

29
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,180
You’re a clever man.

30
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,490
You must know who I am.

31
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,790
You’re a spy of Liang?

32
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,400
A clever man like you

33
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,300
will certainly do something great.

34
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,900
What is the sudden visit for?

35
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,660
I come to visit Yuwen Xi.

36
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,830
Over so many years,

37
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,880
he’s been serving Liang.

38
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,640
Unfortunately, he’s too old

39
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,120
to remain

40
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,360
his ambition.

41
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,270
I need to find

42
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,280
a capable man

43
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,690
to replace him.

44
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,560
Young Master Huai,

45
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,270
you’re my best choice.

46
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,940
When we first met,

47
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,520
I knew we would meet again.

48
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,810
I just wonder

49
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,840
if it’ll bring good luck or bad luck.

50
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,360
Misfortune might be a blessing in disguise.

51
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,340
Luck is hard to be predicted.

52
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,400
We can’t just predict it with one word.

53
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,780
Young Master Huai, you’re a wise man.

54
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,180
You must know who to work with

55
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,650
so that you can succeed.

56
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:04,290
A beautiful woman shows appreciation for me.

57
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,700
The honor

58
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,840
is mine.

59
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,390
You really are a wise man.

60
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,890
But my grandpa...

61
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,770
Rest assured, Young Master Huai.

62
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,910
Yuwen Xi promised me that

63
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,470
you would take over Hongshan House.

64
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,670
You’ll have the final say.

65
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,460
Something happens in Qingshan House.

66
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,670
A lot of Yue Guards are coming towards us.

67
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,930
Seems like

68
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,330
they found us.

69
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,260
Yuwen Yue

70
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,700
dares to break into my place?

71
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,660
Don’t be afraid of such lackeys.

72
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,170
Only a few Yue Guards.

73
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,120
We can fight a way out.

74
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,230
Wait.

75
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,510
Don’t alert them,

76
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,970
or we’ll lose more.

77
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,280
What do you suggest, Young Master?

78
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,030
We have a secret passage.

79
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,730
You can

80
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,070
leave through it

81
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,090
without letting anyone else know.

82
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,060
Is it still the cave

83
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,250
I just left?

84
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,060
Why is it so warm now?

85
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,360
Oh, a beautiful young woman

86
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,220
has made a fire.

87
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:11,880
Clever girl.

88
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,070
I had thought

89
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,220
you wouldn’t come back.

90
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,080
You didn’t trust me again.

91
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,030
I told you we couldn’t get out.

92
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,360
Accept the reality, will you?

93
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,320
Do you think

94
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,850
we’re sharing hardships together?

95
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,160
Sure, we are. Idiot!

96
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,190
Why did you bother to ask?

97
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,690
We certainly are.

98
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,990
I think so, too.

99
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,250
Well, if so,

100
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,460
I shouldn’t leave

101
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,070
without telling you.

102
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,230
That’s ridiculous.

103
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,040
Don’t worry.

104
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,740
I’ll never

105
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,510
do anything like that.

106
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,260
Come.

107
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,890
Drink some wine to get yourself warm.

108
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,900
Have a pancake to appease your hunger.

109
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,900
They’re not poisonous!

110
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,660
You don’t trust me at all!

111
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,400
Besides, even if they are,

112
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,690
you can’t smell it.

113
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:50,530
Right?

114
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,600
How do you know I can’t?

115
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,960
I suddenly get a feeling.

116
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,150
I love it

117
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,670
when we’re locked here alone.

118
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,410
Why do I feel so?

119
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,410
It feels so good.

120
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,600
Hope we’ll be locked here

121
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,670
for the rest of our lives.

122
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,260
It’s just like our kid.

123
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:19,870
We’ll bring it up

124
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,100
in this place.

125
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,960
We’ll stay here, working hard,

126
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,060
being happy

127
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,060
and living a joyful life.

128
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,170
- We can...
- Shut up.

129
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,300
You have a mouth and everyone sees that.

130
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,250
All right.

131
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,540
I’ll shut up.

132
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,540
I won’t talk.

133
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,270
I can’t talk!

134
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,270
Hamsters, shut your mouths.

135
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,440
A lovely young woman

136
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,070
doesn’t allow us to talk.

137
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,320
You’re the noisiest.

138
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,980
Go back. Back.

139
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,900
It’s so quiet.

140
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,630
What?

141
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,650
Feeling happy now?

142
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,940
You can’t be.

143
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,500
The reason is simple.

144
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,030
There are only three of us

145
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,610
in this cave.

146
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,650
One is

147
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,590
half-dead.

148
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,000
You will not

149
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,510
talk to me willingly.

150
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,010
If I don’t talk,

151
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,070
we’ll be bored to death.

152
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,450
I don’t want to die in this cave.

153
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,740
I don’t want that.

154
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,190
Theoretically,

155
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,000
this cave is

156
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,030
your domain.

157
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,710
You should know a lot about it.

158
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:47,830
You must be worshiping me,

159
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,110
aren’t you?

160
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,450
Don’t.

161
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,830
Don’t worship me!

162
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,750
Let me tell you something secret.

163
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,020
In our industry,

164
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,130
selling news earns more money
than selling weapons.

165
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:09,710
I’m serious.

166
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,130
This is my real profession.

167
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:15,920
Do you know

168
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,680
how he got

169
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,710
the cold disease

170
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,640
and if there is a cure?

171
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,420
I don’t know.

172
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,720
There are ways

173
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,750
to get such a disease.

174
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,380
Millions.

175
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,020
How do I know how he got it?

176
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,280
But he’s been sick

177
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,800
for years.

178
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,920
I guess he got it when he was born.

179
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,290
Well, there can be an easy way.

180
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,750
Bring the brazier and drink the restoratives.

181
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,020
Don’t be exposed to cold

182
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,180
and don’t get cold.

183
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,700
I guess he’ll live

184
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,130
for ten or twenty years.

185
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,490
What? Ten or twenty years?

186
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,640
So serious?

187
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,660
The sickness when someone was born

188
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,060
is the toughest to be cured.

189
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,060
He was born in the Yuwen family.

190
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,680
If he were in another family,

191
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,620
he would have been dead many times.

192
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,080
Well, check

193
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,720
if he can be cured.

194
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,130
Don’t let him die here.

195
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,670
Are you giving an order?

196
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,000
Aye.

197
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,810
It’s my pleasure.

198
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,280
Why is his pulse

199
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,470
so strong?

200
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,920
It nearly broke

201
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,060
my newly polished nails.

202
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,190
With this,

203
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,780
he won’t die soon.

204
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,740
Don’t worry.

205
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,990
He’ll wake up

206
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,210
in a few hours at most.

207
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,400
Trust me.

208
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,040
What have you got?

209
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,110
We’ve checked.

210
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,630
There is no dead body in the ruins.

211
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,970
Young Master is still alive, I guess.

212
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,560
Send guys to

213
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,650
contact the officials secretly.

214
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,840
Don’t let anyone else know.

215
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,380
Aye.

216
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,860
Spies of Liang went out of their way.

217
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,680
They want more than

218
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,880
killing Young Master Yue.

219
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,770
They must be up to something else.

220
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,260
Yueqi, take guards

221
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,420
to where the spies stay.

222
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,400
Instead of keeping an eye on them,

223
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,350
rush in directly.

224
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,510
Catch them, alive or dead.

225
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,360
Aye.

226
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:04,720
You guys.

227
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,650
Go search the woods nearby.

228
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,600
When you find anything suspicious,

229
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,580
tell me immediately.

230
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,200
Aye.

231
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,810
Mr. Zuo.

232
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,490
You sell weapons?

233
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,590
Yeah.

234
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,900
You also sell solutions

235
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,900
to traps and magics,

236
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,230
as well as maps of

237
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,250
different rich mansions?

238
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,210
Very well.

239
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,970
You know a lot, too.

240
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,000
Come over.

241
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,710
Come.

242
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,890
What?

243
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,710
Behave yourself.

244
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,650
What?

245
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,750
Don’t be mean. I just want to pull your hand.

246
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,380
You know what?

247
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,720
Don’t be so sure.

248
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,790
I want to buy something from you.

249
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,160
I wonder if you have it.

250
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,830
I’ve got a lot of good things.

251
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,300
It depends on how much you can pay.

252
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,400
Money isn’t a problem.

253
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,320
That’s good, then.

254
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,490
You’ve seen him.

255
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,800
He’s the Young Master of

256
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,510
the Yuwen family.

257
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:06,960
When we manage to

258
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
leave here safely,

259
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,760
he’ll pay you back.

260
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,120
Did you get up too quickly

261
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,390
or you are still dizzy?

262
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,590
Why do you think you can get a credit?

263
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,080
We’re not friends.

264
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,590
Why can you get a credit?

265
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,630
No way!

266
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,060
Credit?

267
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,320
Never dream of it.

268
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:27,880
Well,

269
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,410
when I meet a gorgeous girl,

270
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,020
I’ll forget my rules.

271
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,590
I hate it myself.

272
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,310
Forget it.

273
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,880
I’ll make an exception for you.

274
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,460
I’ve got an idea.

275
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,970
You can mortgage

276
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,830
your worthless wooden bead.

277
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:52,050
I’ll lose a lot.

278
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,800
You mean this?

279
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,560
Yes.

280
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,270
I’m right.

281
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,600
It’s exactly

282
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,480
the same wooden bead

283
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,690
Luo He used to wear.

284
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,900
What are you hesitating for?

285
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,900
It’s a deal then.

286
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,670
What do you mean?

287
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,620
What... What does that mean?

288
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,120
It’s a real bargain.

289
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,450
You don’t want that?

290
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,650
This is very important to me.

291
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,380
I won’t mortgage it.

292
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,620
Whatever. Whatever.

293
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,220
As you wish.

294
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,270
You have the final say of your own thing.

295
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,630
In fact,

296
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,780
this thing doesn’t help me at all.

297
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,330
What can it do?

298
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,050
Can it be eaten or drunk?

299
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,230
It can do nothing.

300
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,260
I have something to ask you.

301
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,840
You have this bead.

302
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,530
Do you know a female spy,

303
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,970
named Luo He?

304
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,350
Who is her to you?

305
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,100
Can I be related to

306
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,700
Luo He?

307
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,200
Female spy Luo He?

308
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,350
Do you know Twelve Elites?

309
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,950
Should I know them?

310
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,210
The Storm Token.

311
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,790
You should know that, huh?

312
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,020
Storm Token...

313
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,590
Oh, I kind of remember something.

314
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,520
Great.

315
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,790
Could you tell me

316
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,030
where it is now?

317
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,750
Why must I tell you?

318
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,010
Good point.

319
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,770
Why must you tell me?

320
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:54,810
I like it

321
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:55,990
when you’re straightforward.

322
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,980
We’re not friends.

323
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,410
Why must you tell me?

324
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,700
You know what?

325
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,670
Why must you tell me?

326
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,960
Because I’m having a deal with you!

327
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,280
Missy.

328
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,950
You want a weapon, don’t you?

329
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,920
Look at these weapons.

330
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,590
Choose one you want and take it.

331
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,000
I won’t charge you.

332
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:34,810
And...

333
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,380
If you want some intel,

334
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,250
tell me.

335
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,300
I’ll give you

336
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,860
the most accurate answer.

337
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,170
He looks anxious.

338
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,040
I should ask for more intel.

339
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,420
I didn’t know

340
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,190
the Storm Token was so useful.

341
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,490
Are you serious?

342
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,820
Go ask around

343
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,840
about my credit

344
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,950
in the black market!

345
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,770
I always keep my promise!

346
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,880
What?

347
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:05,630
Now you can tell me

348
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,170
where the Storm Token is, huh?

349
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,540
Twelve Elites have it.

350
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,340
Twelve Elites have it?

351
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,450
Oh, that’s a big trouble.

352
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,410
Why do they have it?

353
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,800
The female spy Luo He

354
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,280
snatched it.

355
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,130
How was it possible?

356
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,660
The female spy Luo He...

357
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,380
You’re kidding me!

358
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,160
Is that funny?

359
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,080
Believe it or not, I’ll bite you.

360
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,360
Tell me the truth.

361
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,760
Where is the Storm Token?

362
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,790
I don’t know.

363
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,020
No way.

364
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,450
You just said you knew.

365
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,830
I said I remembered something.

366
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,290
I didn’t know where it was.

367
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,390
My lady.

368
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,470
Taoye, go without me.

369
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,460
I have somewhere else to go.

370
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,040
Then I’ll go meet you

371
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,990
at the ancient tomb.

372
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,130
Why don’t you let me...

373
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,300
No.

374
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,720
I’ll go myself.

375
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,710
Interesting.

376
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,670
I’ve been doing business

377
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,210
for so many years

378
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,650
and I’ve seen countless women.

379
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,070
But today,

380
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,750
I was tricked by a young one.

381
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,330
I didn’t trick you.

382
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,160
I was telling the truth.

383
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,570
Very well.

384
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,520
Truth or lie, I don’t care.

385
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,050
I want no more argument.

386
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,900
I’m so tired after the whole day.

387
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,810
I haven’t asked your name yet.

388
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:35,890
What is your name?

389
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,290
Xing’er.

390
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,510
Hello, Miss Xing’er.

391
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:50,530
Mr. Zuo.

392
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,930
You know what?

393
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,360
I don’t know

394
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,270
where the Storm Token is.

395
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,820
But as long as you help me,

396
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:57,840
I won’t let you

397
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,090
lose anything.

398
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,440
I’m not so sure about that.

399
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:04,170
But there’s one thing I’m sure about.

400
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,600
You will never

401
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,430
lose anything.

402
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,870
Don’t say that.

403
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,960
I don’t know

404
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,820
where the Storm Token is.

405
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,730
But I know

406
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,160
I must be related to it.

407
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,640
I promise you.

408
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,780
Once I have my memories back

409
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,290
and think of anything

410
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:23,990
about it,

411
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,110
I’ll come back and tell you.

412
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,100
Missy.

413
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,520
So, you’ve lost your memories?

414
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,150
I think so.

415
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,600
Silly girl, why didn’t you tell me earlier?

416
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,750
I can cure that.

417
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,090
I can get

418
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,520
all your lost memories

419
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,390
back to your head.

420
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,240
You know what?

421
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,750
If you let me cure you,

422
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,670
I can get your memories back

423
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,930
in no time.

424
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,660
Are you serious?

425
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,050
Come with me, please.

426
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,750
Cheers, Yan Xun.

427
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,660
So, Yan Xun,

428
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,500
don’t go back

429
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,540
to Yanbei.

430
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,800
Stay in Chang’an.

431
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,300
The climate in Yanbei isn’t good.

432
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,340
It’s windy and dusty, too.

433
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,880
I hear local women there

434
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,490
will have many wrinkles

435
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,390
after they turn thirty

436
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,330
just like

437
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,700
very old ladies.

438
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,280
Local men

439
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,310
have nothing

440
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,100
to do,

441
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,060
except riding horses and hunting.

442
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,820
Most importantly,

443
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,690
when you leave Chang’an,

444
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:37,850
how can you get

445
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,660
so much good wine

446
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,230
or such a beautiful girl like me?

447
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,320
Yes. Yes.

448
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,210
You’re right.

449
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,000
Good.

450
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,890
Let’s make a deal, then.

451
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:52,000
You’ll stay in Chang’an and keep me company.

452
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,510
It’s getting dark.

453
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:56,690
I’m leaving.

454
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,910
Yan Xun.

455
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,310
Stay with me.

456
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,900
Okay. Come on.

457
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,200
I’ll drink with you.

458
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,780
Come.

459
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,540
Let’s drink.

460
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,970
Let me fill your cup.

461
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:10,910
Come on.

462
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,830
Cheers.

463
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:13,940
Cheers.

464
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,110
Yan Xun.

465
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,260
Yan Xun, what’s wrong with you?

466
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,930
I’m drunk.

467
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:29,900
Drunk?

468
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,390
Don’t try to fool me.

469
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,320
- You know what?
- I’m not fooling you.

470
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,990
Let me tickle you.

471
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,300
You’re not drunk.

472
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,240
You’re fooling me.

473
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,470
I’ll check if you’re drunk or not.

474
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,940
See? You can still run.

475
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,540
You’re not drunk at all.

476
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,470
I’m really drunk.

477
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,400
Chun.

478
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,470
Greetings, Your Highness.

479
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:51,900
Mother.

480
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:55,800
His Excellency Yan Xun.

481
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,570
Looks like you have much spare time.

482
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,120
This is the imperial palace

483
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,890
where women of the royal family live.

484
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,100
Such a man like you

485
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,140
drink and have fun here.

486
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,510
How impolite you are!

487
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,850
Is this what

488
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,340
your parents taught you?

489
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,450
Mother.

490
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,840
I asked him to come

491
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,750
and stay with me.

492
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,670
Don’t blame him.

493
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,820
Her Highness is drunk.

494
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,220
Don’t take her words seriously.

495
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,270
I come to visit the Empress Dowager,

496
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,660
as summoned.

497
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,610
Yan Xun.

498
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:24,850
Then I met Her Highness

499
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:25,830
who was drinking in this place.

500
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,030
I sat down and asked for some wine.

501
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,530
I was too skittish.

502
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,670
Your Highness, please forgive me.

503
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,670
Since you know you’re skittish,

504
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,550
you should behave yourself.

505
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,670
Now,

506
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,770
you two have grown up.

507
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,230
You shouldn’t behave improperly

508
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,330
like kids.

509
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,710
Yan Xun, hope you’ll have more self-examination

510
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,000
and never come here again.

511
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,270
Mother!

512
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,750
I know. See you.

513
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,600
Yan Xun.

514
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,800
I’m not drunk.

515
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,570
You’re a princess.

516
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,390
But you roughhoused

517
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,710
with a male stranger

518
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,670
in the daytime.

519
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:14,870
Isn’t it ridiculous?

520
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,900
What do you mean stranger?

521
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,590
He’s Yan Xun.

522
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,440
He’s not your family member.

523
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,300
Well, he isn’t

524
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,550
a real family member.

525
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,280
But in the future,

526
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,750
he can be.

527
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:33,000
Chun, I think you understand.

528
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,580
You’re a noble princess of our nation.

529
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,350
You can’t marry a man

530
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,110
just because you love him.

531
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,990
Why can’t I?

532
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,880
Chun, how many years

533
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,700
has this world been in peace?

534
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,680
How many powerful families

535
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,810
were gone in the wars?

536
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,720
How many rich families disappear

537
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,350
in political struggles?

538
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,970
If you pick the wrong guy, see through no truth,

539
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,600
and hurt yourself,

540
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,280
what will you do?

541
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,030
I’m using

542
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,310
Spell Technique.

543
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,560
It’s ancestral.

544
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,020
Don’t worry.

545
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,940
None of your body parts

546
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,980
will be hurt.

547
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,380
This is

548
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,800
the Spell Soup.

549
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,920
After having it,

550
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,420
you’ll be in a coma.

551
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,950
By then,

552
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,470
I’ll use Spell Technique

553
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:42,680
to instruct you with spells

554
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,920
and help you get back your memories.

555
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,160
What about the other soup?

556
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,140
It’s more important.

557
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,210
It’s the Wake-up Soup.

558
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,480
If you’re in a deep coma,

559
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,370
I’ll...

560
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,450
It’s just water, I think.

561
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,970
I’ll splash it on your face

562
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:03,600
to wake you up.

563
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,780
What if I can’t wake up?

564
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,960
I’ll take such a big risk.

565
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,080
What if

566
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,400
you steal something from me

567
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,870
when I’m in a coma?

568
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,130
What are you talking about?

569
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,420
I’m not a thief.

570
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,760
Why will I steal anything from you?

571
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,760
Besides,

572
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,040
what valuable things do you have?

573
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,250
Why would I steal things from you?

574
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:26,890
Think about it.

575
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:27,960
If I steal something from you,

576
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
can I leave?

577
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,120
None of us can leave.

578
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,670
What can I steal from you?

579
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,020
Your body, at most.

580
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,730
Just kidding.

581
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:35,780
Can I steal your body?

582
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,580
If I do,

583
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,310
when he wakes up,

584
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,680
he’ll kill me.

585
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,440
Besides,

586
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,990
stop thinking this way.

587
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,520
Missy, living in this world

588
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,700
is a risk.

589
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,400
You should dare to take it.

590
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,350
Without taking any risk,

591
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,040
how can you get what you want?

592
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,210
You should be...

593
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:54,050
Well, Mr. Zuo.

594
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,310
Do me another favor.

595
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,360
I want to break into the Pleasure Pavilion.

596
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,290
Do you have the map for it?

597
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,020
Pleasure Pavilion?

598
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:05,490
No way.

599
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,880
I can’t help you.

600
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,290
A young woman like you

601
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,520
shouldn’t go there.

602
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,530
That’s a dangerous place

603
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,210
with traps.

604
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,680
Killing traps.

605
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,220
Oh, there’s also a beast.

606
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,540
An evil beast.

607
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,840
I know.

608
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:18,940
That’s why

609
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,090
I want you to do me the favor.

610
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,430
Tell me if you have the map.

611
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,190
I do.

612
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,920
As long as you promise

613
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,090
to get back your memories

614
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,720
with my help,

615
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,410
I’ll give it to you right away.

616
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,040
You really have the map for

617
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,940
the Pleasure Pavilion?

618
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,070
Sure.

619
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:10,320
I’ve got all maps

620
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,930
for any place,

621
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,400
except

622
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,060
the Eye of Intel.

623
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:15,760
Missy.

624
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,020
= Pleasure Pavilion =
Look at the map carefully.

625
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,120
This is not

626
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,580
an ordinary map.

627
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,390
On it,

628
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,100
all traps in the Pleasure Pavilion

629
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:23,940
are marked.

630
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,970
Most importantly,

631
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,580
= Way Out =
it even has

632
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,650
the way out.

633
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,550
Great, isn’t it?

634
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:34,460
You...

635
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,050
Since I have the map,

636
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:37,720
I won’t have the Spell Soup.

637
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,610
Silly girl.

638
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,180
Don’t you want to know

639
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,340
who you really are?

640
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,840
Silly girl.

641
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,690
Think about it.

642
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,580
Everything that happened to you.

643
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:50,870
I can make you recall it

644
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:51,870
with my own way.

645
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,540
I swear.

646
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,840
After you take the soup,

647
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:57,770
I can

648
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:59,290
get back

649
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,320
all your lost memories.

650
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,720
I swear.

651
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,830
Come on. Drink it.

652
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,380
Come on. Drink it.

653
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,750
Chaos is

654
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:44,270
everywhere.

655
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:50,060
Stop wandering

656
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:55,150
and go back home.

657
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,330
Chaos is

658
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:07,090
everywhere.

659
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:13,090
Stop wandering...

660
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,390
Go.

661
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,340
Go get back

662
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,260
all your lost memories.

663
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,960
I don’t want you to experience this.

664
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,830
But you’re my daughter.

665
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,710
You’ll face it sooner or later.

666
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,960
I don’t want you

667
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,000
to fail to protect yourself

668
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,020
when the day comes.

669
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,500
The Ice Trick I taught you

670
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,110
is too powerful.

671
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,200
You can’t control it for the moment.

672
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,220
You must practice it

673
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,150
more frequently

674
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,530
with the inner-force law I taught you.

675
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,290
I’m leaving tomorrow.

676
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:03,400
I’ll come back in a month or six months at most.

677
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,180
During this period,

678
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,610
Lan’er will take care of you.

679
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,450
If I fail to come back

680
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,870
in six months,

681
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,800
go to this place

682
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,420
and find a man named Jing.

683
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,730
When you accomplish the Ice Trick,

684
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,750
open the wooden bead

685
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,060
and it will tell you

686
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,470
what to do next.

687
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,750
Remember.

688
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,090
No matter how hard it is,

689
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,880
you must survive

690
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,610
even if you’re treated like dirt.

691
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:34,830
You can’t have unlimited possibilities

692
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,690
unless you survive.

693
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,030
Mom!

694
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:43,540
Mom!

695
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,780
Live bravely!

696
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,460
Mom!

697
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:52,860
No.

698
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,720
Stop thinking of that.

699
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,010
Think of something

700
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,680
about the Storm Token.

701
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,510
Go.

702
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,750
Daughter.

703
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,140
Jing Xiaoliu will be your name.

704
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,100
You’re one of my daughters.

705
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,640
Do remember that.

706
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:17,710
Jing Xiaoliu?

707
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,120
Good girl.

708
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,080
Xiaoliu, what are you in a daze?

709
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,370
Xiaoliu, come over.

710
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,470
Play with us.

711
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:49,100
Yeah. Let’s have fun together.

712
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,150
Yeah. It’s fun.

713
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,530
Xiaoliu, come.

714
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,190
Stop thinking of that.

715
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:02,710
That doesn’t help at all.

716
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,440
Xiaoliu. Xiaoliu.

717
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,580
Bad news.

718
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,630
Your mom is going to be beheaded.

719
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,380
What do we do?

720
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,100
= Behead =

721
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,510
Uncle Jing.

722
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,880
Sorry for leaving without telling you.

723
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:21,050
My mom is dying.

724
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,460
I must go save her,

725
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:25,340
even if I have to die, too.

726
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,120
Think of something

727
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,830
about the Storm Token.

728
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,390
Go.

729
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,760
Go.

730
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:43,870
Who’s there?

731
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,520
Why is there a horse?

732
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,150
Go.

733
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:59,620
Go find the Storm Token.

734
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,520
You must find it.

735
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:38,720
Yes.

736
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,770
Here it is.

737
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,600
Push the door open.

738
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,070
Walk in.

739
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,020
Push the door open.

740
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,570
Mom.

741
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:51,390
Mom.

742
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,790
Push it open.

743
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,070
There must be news

744
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:57,820
about the Storm Token.

745
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,710
Mom! Mom!

746
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,190
Go. Go ahead.

747
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,480
Push that door open.

748
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,940
Mom! Mom!

749
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:15,970
Mom!

750
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,080
Who are you? Where’s my mom?

751
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,920
Go find her in the hell.

752
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:27,160
She fell into the trap.

753
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,220
Catch her.

754
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,010
Catch her alive!

755
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,180
You’re Luo He’s daughter?

756
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,530
What did you do to my mother?

757
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:39,930
Want to see her?

758
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,120
Pity.

759
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,670
She is dead.

760
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,430
You killed her?

761
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:46,190
Luo He has great martial arts

762
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,960
and the power to order so many people.

763
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,730
But she wants to release slaves and stop wars.

764
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,910
A fool’s talk.

765
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,460
If I say you killed Luo He,

766
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,330
do you think people will believe that?

767
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:58,940
Then,

768
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,150
I’m killing you!

769
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,420
You’re not getting away today.

770
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,580
Catch her!

771
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,620
Young Master.

772
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,790
Go after her.

773
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,970
Young Master, you’re awake?

774
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:46,890
What are you doing?

775
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,580
Are you crazy?

776
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,600
That was so close.

777
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:53,380
You’ve ruined my plan!

778
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,940
He woke up.

779
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,470
Stop talking nonsense.

780
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:57,830
I nearly

781
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:58,360
lost my life here.

782
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,670
Why am I talking nonsense?

783
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,050
Can’t I say it?

784
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,560
He’ll ruin us.

785
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,580
- We...
- Damn old man.

786
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,540
But I...

787
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,530
He woke up.

788
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:07,890
Stop talking nonsense.

789
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,000
Got it?

790
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,160
Yes.

791
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,510
After such a long time,

792
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,020
those guys have gone.

793
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,180
You should let us go, huh?

794
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,180
Let you go? Where can you go?

795
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,010
I’ve told you.

796
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,180
No one manages to get out.

797
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,840
Without air or wind,

798
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,390
how is the candle flame swaying?

799
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,330
Candle flame...

800
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,080
It always sways.

801
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,270
When you walk... Look.

802
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:06,830
Walk.

803
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:08,710
See?

804
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,150
When you walk, it sways.

805
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,570
See? It sways, too.

806
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,400
We’ve been staying here

807
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,940
for such a long time.

808
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,440
The air is still fresh.

809
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,490
Why?

810
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:21,330
The shop up there

811
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:22,550
has been destroyed.

812
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:23,990
Do you want this place

813
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,380
to be destroyed, too?

814
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,370
You... You...

815
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,310
Who do you think you are?

816
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,680
You live here,

817
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,750
eating and drinking with my help.

818
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,190
What’s wrong with me?

819
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,820
Do you think I want to keep you?

820
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,150
Go, both of you.

821
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,750
When you leave, never come back.

822
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,230
Hamsters.

823
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,650
Walk along this passage

824
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,470
for about half an hour

825
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,960
and then

826
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,460
you can get out.

827
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,020
Thank you.

828
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:22,750
Hamsters, lead the way.

829
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,980
I’ll come back.

830
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:31,770
You know what?

831
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:32,730
Never come back.

832
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:33,470
