16

Linxi!

17
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,470
Brother!

18
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,870
The vicious slave Linxi

19
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,530
is a spy from the enemy.

20
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,410
Killing him isn’t enough to ease my pain.

21
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,050
I’m gonna burn him into ashes.

22
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,240
No way is my brother a spy.

23
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,700
He’s been here for one year.

24
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,620
He didn’t have to wait until now to do that.

25
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,650
You wronged an innocent.

26
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,440
Where did you get this license?

27
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,800
It’s given by my brother.

28
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,060
I didn’t think

29
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,790
it’d get him killed.

30
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,130
Do you know how we punish

31
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,880
fugitive slaves?

32
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,740
Whip them to death and show their heads in public.

33
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,740
Hang my head

34
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,330
on the gateway then.

35
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,090
But my brother was wronged.

36
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,910
You killed an innocent.

37
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,100
So what?

38
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:31,400
It’s the time

39
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,890
dominated by the strong.

40
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,540
The weak

41
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,560
are meant to be trampled on.

42
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,450
If I can survive,

43
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,240
I swear

44
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,390
I will be strong.

45
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,460
You’re weak. Don’t overestimate yourself.

46
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,040
This is the punishment you deserve.

Xiaoliu. How come you’re back?

Xiaoliu!

50
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,370
Linxi

51
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,670
is dead.

52
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,800
What?

53
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:29,720
Xiaoliu!

54
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,370
Xiaoliu!

55
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,520
Xiaoliu!

56
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,880
Just cry if you want.

57
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,450
We have to

58
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,730
get up early tomorrow morning.

59
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,770
Do your own work well.

60
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,220
Don’t get caught in the wrong place.

61
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:03,750
Cry?

62
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,070
Crying is useless, isn’t it?

63
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,710
Linxi will never be back.

64
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:14,890
What else can we do

65
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,130
other than crying?

66
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,150
We can’t even

67
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,130
get his body back.

68
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,330
You can,

69
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,050
but you don’t dare to do that!

70
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,020
You keep telling us to endure it.

71
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,560
But now

72
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,070
Linxi is dead!

73
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,290
It’s all your fault!

74
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,270
Since you came to our family,

75
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,160
we’ve always been

76
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,600
in trouble.

77
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,690
Xiaoba!

78
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,400
You’re a jinx!

79
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,040
Because of you,

80
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,770
mother and father died.

81
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,810
Now Linxi died, too.

82
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,330
Who will be the next to die?

83
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,880
- Zhixiang or me?
- You...

84
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,530
Shut up!

85
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,640
You slapped me.

86
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,380
What did you slap me for?

87
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,100
Did I say anything wrong?

88
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,170
- She is...
- Shut your mouth!

89
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,670
Linxi is dead.

90
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,510
We’re all

91
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,750
as sad as you are.

92
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,450
But Xiaoliu

93
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,930
has nothing to do with it.

94
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,180
It’s our destiny

95
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,440
that should be blamed.

96
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,920
We live in a world

97
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,110
where lives are cheaper than grass.

98
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,300
And we were born

99
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,840
to be weak slaves,

100
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,500
beaten or slain as they please.

101
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,190
Fate is unchangeable.

102
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,380
Alright.

103
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,830
The dead are long gone,

104
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,670
yet we’re still alive.

105
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,400
We must live on

106
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,120
however hard the life is.

107
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,480
Young Master.

108
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,930
Is Yuwen Zhuo dead?

109
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,850
Just as you wished.

110
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,500
Did you witness it yourself?

111
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,790
Young Master.

112
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,260
Jinzhu should have seen it.

113
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,720
What do you mean she should have?

114
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,740
You must confirm it!

115
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,490
You must see his corpse yourself!

116
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,330
Corpse...

117
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,590
Young Master.

118
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,740
I did not see his corpse...

119
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,720
You bastard!

120
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,730
A bunch of idiots!

121
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,130
You can’t even do this, can you?

122
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,810
That old fox is cunning.

123
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,970
I gotta go there myself.

124
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,340
= Mourn =

125
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:15,380
= Grandfather Yuwen Zhuo’s Tablet =

126
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,720
Young Master.

127
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,760
It’s about the time.

128
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,690
Aye.

129
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,710
Cover the coffin!

130
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,050
Wait.

131
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,350
What brings you here?

132
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,470
You dog.

133
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,650
Get away.

134
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,770
Get over my body if you want to go in.

135
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,200
Qingshan House is doomed.

136
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,930
The slaves trained by Yuwen Yue

137
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,470
are all so rude.

138
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:15,950
Yueqi.

139
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,790
He’s a guest.

140
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,340
Let them in.

141
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,310
I’m here to offer my condolences.

142
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,470
I haven’t seen my grandfather for the last time.

143
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,040
Are you covering his coffin?

144
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,510
You know

145
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,760
who my grandfather hated the most,

146
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:48,980
don’t you?

147
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,800
Obviously you are

148
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,830
implying our Third Branch.

149
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,530
I haven’t killed you yet.

150
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:56,930
I’ve already

151
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,510
shown my great respect

152
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,300
to the elders of the Third Branch.

153
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,350
I understand what you’re saying.

154
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,480
But I suspect grandfather was

155
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,580
murdered.

156
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,430
So, I wanna open the coffin

157
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,390
and check it out.

158
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,530
Do you dare?

159
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,460
Let’s see.

160
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,760
I guess you’re the murderer

161
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,140
who prevents me from checking it out.

162
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,010
You’re an adopted grandson.

163
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,170
To get the Eye of Intel

164
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,910
and become the master of Qingshan House soon,

165
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,880
you must have been

166
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,090
scheming something.

167
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,440
Grandfather was handicapped,

168
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,220
but he was

169
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,120
the head of the Yuwen Family.

170
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,890
Now he died out of no reason.

171
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,740
As a descendant of the Third Branch,

172
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,580
I must figure out how he died.

173
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,750
Open the coffin!

174
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,490
Take the sword, Young Master!

175
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,960
This is Qingshan House.

176
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,920
You’re not allowed

177
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,760
to make a scene here.

178
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,000
Qingshan House has lost everything.

179
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,780
I showed you respect

180
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,690
when grandfather was alive.

181
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,110
Now he’s dead.

182
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,050
How dare you be so arrogant to me?

183
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:04,860
You were abandoned

184
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,620
by the Second Branch,

185
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,990
yet grandfather adopted you.

186
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,970
If you have some self-knowledge,

187
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,500
go back to the Second Branch,

188
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,830
think about what your mother

189
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,180
had done back then,

190
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,830
and then make a grave

191
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,900
and bury yourself in.

192
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,650
Don’t make a fool of yourself.

193
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,390
Don’t you talk about my mother!

194
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,590
Yuwen Yue’s moves are so weird.

195
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,020
I gotta end him quickly.

196
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,140
Guards!

197
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,540
Here comes Her Highness!

198
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,800
Who dares to be rude?

199
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,410
Yuwen Yue is so cunning.

200
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,910
Greetings, Your Highness.

201
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:44,910
Rise.

202
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,510
Yes, Your Highness.

203
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,260
Yuwen Huai.

204
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,410
How dare you

205
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,140
make trouble here

206
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,860
and even try to kill?

207
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,140
Your Highness.

208
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,000
Yuwen Yue meant to cover the coffin,

209
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,950
and tried to kill me.

210
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,810
He arouse the fight.

211
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,020
Your Highness.

212
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,370
Grandfather died of a strange poison
from Western Regions.

213
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,530
I was afraid the poison could hurt more people.

214
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,820
So I burned suspicious items,

215
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,490
then put the body in coffin and sealed it.

216
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,780
You did it decisively.

217
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,200
Well done.

218
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,450
Have you figured out the poisoner?

219
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,520
Not yet.

220
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,710
But the answer is clear.

221
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,600
What do you mean?

222
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,930
Enough.

223
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,400
Yuwen Zhuo just died,

224
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,480
yet you fought in front of him

225
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,550
disrespectfully.

226
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,810
Don’t you know the rules?

227
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,710
Strange poison from Western Regions?

228
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,440
I remember

229
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,820
the Third Branch of Yuwen Family

230
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,730
has purchased imperial tributes

231
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,480
along the Silk Road for years.

232
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,440
On Empress Dowager’s birthday last year,

233
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,410
they offered

234
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,080
a two-color-pupil cat.

235
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,310
The tributes purchaser on the Silk Road

236
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:08,840
is exactly Yuwen Huai.

237
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,270
Yuwen Yue, you’re framing me!

238
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,050
How bold!

239
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,270
You dare to fight in front of Her Highness!

240
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,070
Yuwen Huai.

241
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,170
It’s just that

242
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,300
I thought of something related

243
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,700
and mentioned it casually.

244
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,200
I didn’t mean to frame you.

245
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,820
Yuwen Yue just

246
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,550
added some details based on the fact.

247
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,120
Yet you meant to kill him.

248
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,050
I’m wondering

249
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,010
what you will do

250
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,930
to your cousin

251
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,210
with your soldiers

252
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,320
after I leave here.

253
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,930
I don’t dare.

254
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,220
Please uphold justice, Your Highness.

255
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,600
Alright.

256
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,670
To keep the Second Branch

257
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,010
and the Third Branch in peace,

258
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,060
I decide to

259
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,670
check the corpse in person.

260
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,120
Your Highness, your safety is the top priority.

261
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,790
Please take care of yourself.

262
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,740
It’s fine.

263
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,140
I’ve checked it out in person.

264
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,600
Yuwen Zhuo did die of poison.

265
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,540
He ever helped me.

266
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,060
I must help him

267
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,260
settle these issues.

268
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,870
Pass my order.

269
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,150
Unless being invited by the host,

270
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,380
Yuwen Huai

271
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,960
shall never trespass

272
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,890
Qingshan House.

273
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:06,440
Your Highness.

274
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,040
You’re prejudiced against me.

275
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,300
But I think

276
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,960
you’re too impulsive

277
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,730
and have forgotten who you are.

278
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,800
Your Highness...

279
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,190
Stop explaining. You may leave.

280
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,050
Your Highness, thanks for helping me.

281
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,410
I am willing to die

282
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,540
to repay your kindness.

283
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,420
Your grandfather and I were friends for years.

284
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,250
I watched you grow up.

285
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:52,670
At the time,

286
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,170
how could I stand by?

287
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,210
I’m so sorry for getting you

288
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,840
in the mess.

289
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,870
It’s OK for me.

290
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,430
It’s just that

291
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,800
your future situation

292
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,520
will be even more dangerous.

293
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,850
Have you ever thought about

294
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,880
your future path?

295
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,710
I know your grandfather hoped

296
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,990
you could marry Chun.

297
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,340
If you can earn

298
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,590
His Majesty’s trust

299
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,870
and reactivate the Eye of Intel,

300
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,540
I’ll help you with the marriage.

301
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,360
I’m an ordinary man,

302
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,030
while Chun is a noble princess.

303
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,790
I’m not a match for her.

304
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,120
Yuwen Yue.

305
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,040
You’re smart.

306
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,350
The Eye of Intel is so valuable

307
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,810
that His Majesty

308
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,580
will never allow it

309
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,410
to get into others’ hands,

310
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,750
either using it himself

311
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,660
or destroying it.

312
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,430
You should know you’re not

313
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,200
the only choice for His Majesty.

314
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,100
Yuwen Yue.

315
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,960
You must be aware of it.

316
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,950
Understand?

317
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:07,900
Yes, Your Highness.

318
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,220
= Pleasure Pavilion =

319
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,580
Grandfather.

320
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,690
The old fart Yuwen Zhuo

321
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,940
is dead.

322
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,490
I’ve checked it out myself.

323
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,520
Your plan was brilliant.

324
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,300
Jinzhu didn’t expose herself as well.

325
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,870
Jinzhu.

326
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,500
She’s beautiful.

327
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,900
I still remember

328
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,110
she refused to sleep with you

329
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,740
because she wished to save her virgin

330
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,600
to Yuwen Yue.

331
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,090
Also,

332
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,120
Noble Consort Wei ordered me

333
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,080
not to go to Qingshan House.

334
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,450
Grandfather, what should we do

335
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,490
next?

336
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,630
You should do it in person.

337
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,320
Yuwen Zhuo is dead.

338
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,230
Now we only have Yuwen Yue

339
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,880
to deal with.

340
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,640
To get the Eye of Intel

341
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,770
soon,

342
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,410
we’d better offer him a girl

343
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,070
as our pawn.

344
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,790
As for these things,

345
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,390
you can play by ear.

346
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,580
Get me more maids.

347
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,010
Stop bothering me here.

348
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,640
It’s too important for me

349
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,370
to make decisions on my own.

350
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,430
Your decisions are useless.

351
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,120
Only if you were born

352
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,270
to be the heir of our Third Branch.

353
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:58,080
A singer’s son

354
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,830
only deserves

355
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,550
to do some dirty business.

356
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,370
Xiaoliu. You wake up.

357
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:52,330
Here. Xiaoliu.

358
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,360
Take the medicine.

359
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,410
It’s for your energy.

360
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,830
Drink it

361
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,360
and you’ll recover soon.

362
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:00,230
Here.

363
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,350
Xiaoliu. You think

364
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,980
you got Linxi killed, right?

365
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,350
Xiaoliu.

366
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,790
We live in a chaotic time.

367
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,320
Human lives are as cheap as grass.

368
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,470
Our life and death

369
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,860
are no longer in our own control.

370
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,640
Not like that.

371
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,220
I won’t let Linxi

372
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,620
die for nothing.

373
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,010
Give me the medicine.

374
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,080
My life

375
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,770
was exchanged by my brother’s.

376
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,260
I must live on.

377
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,590
You see? That’s Jinlan.

378
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,770
She offended Young Master Huai

379
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,610
and was sent to Pleasure Pavilion last night.

380
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,870
Seems that Elderly Master Xi didn’t like her

381
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,290
and tortured her to death.

382
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,710
So horrible.

383
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,010
That’s what happens if you disobey.

384
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,570
Cut it out.

385
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:04,120
Go.

386
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,000
Let’s go.

387
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:07,950
You.

388
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:12,960
You.

389
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,040
You.

390
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,010
And you guys.

391
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,310
You’ll all be sent to Pleasure Pavilion.

392
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,400
Ms. Song, please!

393
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,900
Don’t send me to Pleasure Pavilion!

394
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,890
I’m begging you!

395
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:29,900
- Ms. Song!
- Ms. Song!

396
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,270
Don’t send me to Pleasure Pavilion!

397
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:31,930
Ms. Song!

398
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,360
Serving Elderly Master Xi

399
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,120
is a bliss

400
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,370
for you guys.

401
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,210
Take them all away.

402
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,790
- Ms. Song!
- Move!

403
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,160
- Don’t send me to Pleasure Pavilion!
- Move!

404
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,050
Please!

405
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,210
- Ms. Song!
- No!

406
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,600
- Please don’t!
- Move!

407
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,730
- Ms. Song!
- Ms. Song!

408
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,130
Take Jing Xiaoliu in the woodshed

409
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,540
to Pleasure Pavilion as well.

410
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:00,940
What?

411
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,450
Ms. Song!

412
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,270
I beg you! Let go of my sister!

413
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,470
Please!

414
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,970
Don’t you think Butler Zhu

415
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:09,890
falls for you

416
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,520
and then you can disrespect me.

417
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,180
I’m still

418
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,610
the boss here.

419
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,200
What are you waiting for?

420
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,080
Send Jing Xiaoliu

421
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,470
to Pleasure Pavilion now.

422
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,920
Ms. Song. Please show mercy.

423
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,260
I can do anything

424
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,940
as long as you won’t send her there.

425
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,420
Please! I’m begging you!

426
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,010
Please!

427
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,530
Anything?

428
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,720
Yes. Anything.

429
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,500
Sister. Look who is here.

430
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,310
Zhixiang!

431
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,430
Xiaoqi!

432
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,210
Zhixiang!

433
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:58,760
I miss you so much.

434
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,380
Here. Give me this.

435
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,250
Let me look at you.

436
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,390
Sister, I miss you so much.

437
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,160
Linxi really got Xiaoqi

438
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,570
into Yuwen’s Mansion as well.

439
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,380
Badly, Linxi died.

440
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,000
Now Xiaoliu is like this.

441
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,680
Alright.

442
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,910
Don’t be sad.

443
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:23,640
Xiaoba.

444
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,760
Keep this for Xiaoliu.

445
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,010
Don’t get this lost.

446
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,660
Keep it in mind.

447
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,500
It’s very important to Xiaoliu.

448
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,670
Hope Xiaoliu

449
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,170
can get through this.

450
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,370
Xiaoliu!

451
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,690
Xiaoliu!

452
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,060
Xiaoliu!

453
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,790
- Xiaoliu!
- Xiaoliu!

454
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,490
- Xiaoliu, you wake up!
- Xiaoqi!

455
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,980
- You’re back.
- Are you alright?

456
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,600
I’m so happy to see you safe.

457
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,350
Xiaoliu.

458
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,060
I have some business to do.

459
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,500
I’ll leave Yuwen’s Mansion

460
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,300
for some time.

461
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,850
After I leave,

462
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,020
you may take care of

463
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,110
Xiaoqi and Xiaoba.

464
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,810
Where are you going?

465
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,040
Is it because of Zhu Shun?

466
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,910
No. Don’t worry.

467
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,490
Zhixiang, where are you going?

468
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,810
We’re going with you.

469
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:30,540
Yes.

470
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,050
I can handle it alone.

471
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,920
I’ll be back soon.

472
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,210
Remember.

473
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,640
Listen to Xiaoliu

474
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,170
after I leave.

475
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:41,970
Got it?

476
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:46,690
Xiaoliu.

477
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,040
Take care of

478
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,880
Xiaoqi and Xiaoba.

479
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,560
Also, no matter what happens,

480
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,630
just bear with it.

481
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:18,900
= Pleasure Pavilion =

482
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:19,970
Move.

483
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,280
- Hurry up!
- Get in!

484
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,980
- Get in!
- Move!

485
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,600
- No!
- No!

486
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,800
Let go of us!

487
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:31,900
Let us go!

488
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,750
Look at this.

489
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,580
So beautiful!

490
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,410
So beautiful!

491
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,520
This is wonderful!

492
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,690
So beautiful!

493
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,940
It looks beautiful.

494
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,860
I want this one.

495
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,060
- I want this.
- I want this.

496
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:11,650
Try it on.

497
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:12,630
These clothes are beautiful!

498
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,560
Let’s dress up!

499
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,500
Dress up!

500
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,220
- Put this on.
- So beautiful!

501
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:19,780
In case that we are favored

502
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,690
- by Elderly Master Xi,
- So beautiful.

503
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:21,940
we won’t be enslaved anymore.

504
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,300
- Yes.
- Exactly.

505
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,660
Am I pretty?

506
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,390
Why are you crying?

507
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,330
Xiaoliu.

508
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,740
Xiaoliu. What should we do?

509
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,270
What’s wrong?

510
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,970
Zhixiang has been sent to Pleasure Pavilion!

511
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,500
Pleasure Pavilion?

512
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,760
The residence of the Elderly Master Xi
of the Third Branch.

513
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,180
Zhixiang!

514
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:49,600
- Zhixiang!
- Xiaoqi!

515
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,380
Xiaoqi!

516
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:52,910
Keep quiet!

517
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:54,670
Keep quiet!

518
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,930
Zhixiang.

519
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,210
Zhixiang.

520
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,910
- Zhixiang.
- Zhixiang.

521
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,490
Xiaoqi. Xiaoba.

522
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,150
Come.

523
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,040
Kneel. Kowtow to our sister.

524
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,670
Do you hate this place?

525
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,050
Do you want to leave?

526
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,250
Yes.

527
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:25,940
Yes.

528
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:29,230
Sister.

529
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,050
Rest assured.

530
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,250
I’ll take good care of Xiaoqi and Xiaoba.

531
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,400
Sister.

532
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,090
You told me

533
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,010
to endure

534
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,340
so as to survive.

535
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,960
I promised you,

536
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,030
though I didn’t know why.

537
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,340
Now

538
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,170
I see you were

539
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,030
thrown here

540
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:58,990
like some

541
00:36:58,990 --> 00:36:59,990
cheap vegetables.

542
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,610
I see.

543
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:05,560
So,

544
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,450
I won’t endure anymore.

545
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:13,430
Young Master.

546
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,090
The old man is indulged in wine and women.

547
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:18,020
Why should I always clear his mess?

548
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,190
How come I have a grandfather like him?

549
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,200
Why was I born in the Third Branch?

550
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,340
Why was I born

551
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,780
inferior to others?

552
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,680
Why am I not

553
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,050
one of the Five Aces of Chang’an?

554
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,620
Why do I have to compete with Yuwen Yue?

555
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,190
Why? Why? Why?

556
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:34,740
Why? Why?

557
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,520
Calm down, Young Master!

558
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,730
I heard that

559
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:39,890
it’s Ms. Song

560
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:42,190
who exposed the tributes procurement

561
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,120
by our Third Branch in Western Regions.

562
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,210
She talked too much.

563
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:48,380
And that woman is disobedient.

564
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,850
Then send her

565
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:51,930
to the coldest place

566
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,490
to freeze her mouth!

567
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,470
Aye. Aye.

568
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,780
I’ll see to it.

569
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,460
Pack your stuff up

570
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,970
and get lost tonight.

571
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,100
Otherwise,

572
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,600
I’m gonna kill you.

573
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,260
Zhu Shun.

574
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,330
You’re good.

575
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,900
These maids are sneaking around.

576
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,970
I’m gonna catch you for rewards.

577
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:01,500
Young Master Huai

578
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,810
may change his mind.

579
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,830
Look. This is Zhixiang’s tablet.

580
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,280
Brother. Sister.

581
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,370
You may take care of each other.

582
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,090
Don’t get bullied

583
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:35,540
after your death.

584
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:37,630
Linxi.

585
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,530
Zhixiang.

586
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,080
Instead of living like a coward

587
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:44,410
and keeping our lives

588
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:45,610
in others’ hand,

589
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:47,880
I’d rather live freely

590
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,990
even if

591
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,210
I’ll have to die.

592
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,190
How dare you!

593
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:00,150
Aren’t you aware of it?

594
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,370
Burning paper money here without permission,

595
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:03,460
you’ll be beaten to death.

596
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,390
Ms. Song.

597
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,410
Our brother and sister died.

598
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,340
We’re just burning some paper money

599
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,370
to pay our respects.

600
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,070
It’s not that serious, is it?

601
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:18,130
It’s not serous?

602
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,310
Go to Young Master Huai with me

603
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,710
and plead with him.

604
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,260
Xiaoliu. You haven’t recovered.

605
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:27,960
Don’t be stubborn.

606
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,880
Ms. Song.

607
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,790
Please forgive us.

608
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:32,580
I’ll take all the blames

609
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,120
if there's any problem.

610
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:39,030
Who do you think you are?
Who are you taking blames for?

611
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,100
All because of this humble slave,

612
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,900
I have to suffer in that cold village.

613
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,450
You make me suffer.

614
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:47,910
So will you!

615
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,650
Go to hell!

616
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:54,650
Xiaoqi!

617
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:55,890
Xiaoqi!

618
00:41:58,610 --> 00:41:59,960
You dare to hit me?

619
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,650
Run!

620
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:04,770
What to do?

621
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:05,790
Go help Xiaoqi!

622
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,330
Stop!

623
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,500
Stop there!

624
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,920
You humble slave!

625
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,650
Go with me!

626
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:17,830
Let me go!

627
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:18,530
Let’s see how Young Master Huai

628
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,400
- will punish you!
- Xiaoqi!

629
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,700
Xiaoqi!

630
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,290
Xiaoqi! Xiaoqi!

631
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,040
You humble slave! Stop there!

632
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,340
- Xiaoqi!
- I’ll kill you!

633
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,300
Help!

634
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:50,600
Help me!

635
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,230
Help me!

636
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,170
Pull her up!

637
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,370
Help me!

638
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,860
Xiaoliu. We killed her!

639
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,810
It’s fine. She hurt us first.

640
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,690
She deserved this.

641
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,050
We’ve got our revenge, anyway.

642
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,080
It’s fine even if we die.

643
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,170
Ms. Song was still alive just now.

644
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:36,350
She died

645
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:38,050
all of a sudden.

646
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:39,020
They’ll...

647
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,050
They’ll come to us.

648
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:42,910
So what?

649
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:44,210
Who knows she’s dead?

650
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:45,690
Who knows she died here?

651
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,430
Don’t be afraid.

652
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:54,160
If it’s found out,

653
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:56,090
just say I killed her.
