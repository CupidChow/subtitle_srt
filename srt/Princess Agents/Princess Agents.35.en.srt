This is our distribution for now.

17
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,460
Mr. Wu is still working on

18
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,150
gathering more helpers

19
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,200
and expenses.

20
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,420
There may be thirty percent more of them.

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,770
Everyone is well-proportioned

22
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,900
and they take up their position

23
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,010
along the traffic center.

24
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,450
Thank you for your hard work.

25
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,440
You flatter me, Your Excellency.

26
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,170
The kerosene is dangerous.

27
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,550
It must be preserved carefully.

28
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,510
Don’t worry, Miss.

29
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,280
We have a kerosene shop

30
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,240
under our name.

31
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,590
We can use it as cover.

32
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,510
Good.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,120
Get back to your business.

34
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,900
The royal family, powerful families,
and official departments

35
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,690
affect each other.

36
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,450
The situation is complicated.

37
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,540
We will have a hard time leaving Chang’an.

38
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,100
Now everything is ready.

39
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,390
When the opportunity arises,

40
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,770
we’ll start our plan.

41
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,580
Even if they must all die

42
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,900
to get you out of Chang’an,

43
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,250
loyal people won’t hesitate.

44
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,570
As long as you can sneak out of Chang’an

45
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,830
and reach Yanbei safely.

46
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,250
It’s been days. Mother, you look thinner.

47
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,250
I can’t sleep

48
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,540
after this tragedy of our family.

49
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,320
What’s done is done.

50
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,080
Mother,

51
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,550
please take care of yourself.

52
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,730
I lost my own mother in childhood.

53
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,430
You raised me up.

54
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,780
You are my real mother.

55
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,510
Minister Wei can be

56
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,760
my own uncle.

57
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,720
That’s why Father ordered Yuwen Yue

58
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,360
not to tell me about that.

59
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,750
If I had known this earlier,

60
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:16,990
it may not have ended up

61
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,030
like that.

62
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,510
He deserves that.

63
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,560
No one else shall be blamed.

64
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,370
Luckily, Yuwen Yue saved Shuye.

65
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,100
Otherwise,

66
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,510
my maternal family will have no offspring.

67
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,990
I’m glad you don’t blame me.

68
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,010
I hear recently,

69
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,960
the Crown Prince of Liang, Xiao Ce,
is coming.

70
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,690
Father wants

71
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,350
to marry Chun to him.

72
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:48,810
Yes.

73
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,510
This is what worried me now.

74
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,960
I hear he has a bad reputation

75
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,240
and numerous concubines.

76
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,760
If she marries him,

77
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,640
I’m afraid she’ll be hurt.

78
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,390
I will never marry her

79
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,050
to someone like him.

80
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,280
Do you have any idea, Mother?

81
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,290
I’ve got one.

82
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,350
I call you here

83
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,430
for some advice.

84
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,030
What is it, Mother?

85
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,150
I want Chun to get engaged in advance.

86
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,140
Mother.

87
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,110
Which young man have you picked?

88
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,230
Hold it tight.

89
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,080
Your Highness, be careful with your hands.

90
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,570
Mother said

91
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,950
a girl like me should learn more.

92
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,360
Look. What do you think?

93
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,000
Your Highness,

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,450
you always do a good job.

95
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,080
Yes, you are.

96
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,080
Brother.

97
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,770
Chun.

98
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,240
Brother,

99
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,150
you’re free today.

100
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,990
Come to meet my mother?

101
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,100
Yes.

102
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,640
But you seldom come to

103
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,060
see me.

104
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,950
That’s because you are too busy.

105
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,470
I don’t want to disturb you.

106
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,450
I have nothing to be busy with.

107
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,970
I only take a walk

108
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:25,730
in the garden

109
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,440
or do some sewing every day.

110
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,490
Chun, I promise you.

111
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,170
You will get busy soon.

112
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,170
Be patient.

113
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,880
Busy? With what?

114
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,560
With your wedding.

115
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,750
Chun, you’re no longer young.

116
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,830
Time to get married.

117
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,060
Brother, don’t laugh at me.

118
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,670
I am not laughing at you.

119
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,310
Everyone gets married at a proper age.

120
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,460
It is natural.

121
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,600
Besides,

122
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,240
when I was at your age,

123
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,270
my son learnt to walk.

124
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,720
But who will like me?

125
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,730
Who will marry me?

126
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,290
You are

127
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,430
such a beautiful girl.

128
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,470
A lot of men

129
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,660
like you.

130
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,750
Brother, did my mother

131
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,130
tell you anything?

132
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,330
Did she pick someone already?

133
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,190
Tell me secretly.

134
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,200
Chun, wait

135
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,320
until Mother tells you personally.

136
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,080
But I promise you.

137
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,630
You know this man very well,

138
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,300
and he isn’t an ordinary guy.

139
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,440
You will be satisfied.

140
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,230
Is everything fine with Achu

141
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,370
at Cavalry Battalion?

142
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,850
Everything goes smoothly.

143
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,590
Prince Xiang sent her

144
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,710
to Xiuli Army.

145
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,200
Those people are

146
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,630
just losers.

147
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,470
It’s easier for Achu

148
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,300
to deal with them.

149
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,220
Xiuli Army?

150
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,450
Who leads them

151
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,300
after Liu Ziye died?

152
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,850
Xue Zhileng is the commander in chief.

153
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:06,950
He’s the son of Xue Lu,

154
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:07,970
Deputy Commander of Defense Battalion.

155
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,750
I hear

156
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,410
he bullied them a lot.

157
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,870
The original general of Xiuli Army,

158
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,570
He Xiao,

159
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,290
is now the Deputy Commander

160
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,490
and their backbone.

161
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,420
Let’s go visit Achu.

162
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,300
What are you looking at?

163
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:33,830
Nothing.

164
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,930
Waiting for someone?

165
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,790
I thought

166
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,690
you were an ice cube.

167
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,600
Never imagined you would also

168
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,080
have someone in your heart.

169
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,430
I am full.

170
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:55,960
I gotta go.

171
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,390
Be generous, could you?

172
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,550
You’re a general.

173
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,650
A prince like you

174
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,940
loves gossiping so much.

175
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,220
Are you generous?

176
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,910
Princes are also human beings.

177
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,570
We have emotions.

178
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,620
To be honest, this girl is good.

179
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,870
She’s brave and wise.

180
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,270
And she fights as strongly as men.

181
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,470
Girls like her

182
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,500
are rare to be seen.

183
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,410
However,

184
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,810
she doesn’t like you.

185
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,030
When Yan Xun suffered so much

186
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,230
on Jiuyou Platform,

187
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,250
she stayed around him

188
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,780
and protected him from others.

189
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,580
Three years as prisoners

190
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,430
didn’t separate them apart.

191
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,720
Can you compare with him?

192
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,580
However beautiful the flower is,

193
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,410
it’s useless when it’s not yours.

194
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,570
I’ll just watch.

195
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,550
Watch?

196
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,790
Watching her blooming

197
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,040
in someone else’s yard?

198
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,050
Yuwen Yue, you’re a powerful man.

199
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,860
Is it worthy to condescend yourself

200
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,030
for a girl like her?

201
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,550
Condescend myself?

202
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,020
I don’t think so.

203
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,330
I am full. Please help yourself.

204
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,750
Why are you here?

205
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,150
People may see you.

206
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,590
I just want to see you

207
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,350
and check if you’re doing fine.

208
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,840
What? You don’t want me?

209
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,490
I sent you a letter.

210
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,250
Didn’t you receive it?

211
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,900
A letter won’t relieve me.

212
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,790
I want to see you in person.

213
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,640
Do you sleep regularly?
Do you enjoy the food?

214
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,430
Does anyone bully you?

215
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,270
Bully me?

216
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,490
When have I ever been bullied?

217
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,670
They’re lucky

218
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,390
when I don’t bully them.

219
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,680
Looks like

220
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,640
you’re energetic.

221
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,060
What’s this? For me?

222
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,190
Rouge?

223
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,700
But I never use any.

224
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,050
All girls like

225
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,350
the rouge.

226
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,400
Besides,

227
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,520
this is not rouge. It’s gel.

228
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,570
It’s getting cold now.

229
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,320
Your hands and feet
may get frozen at night.

230
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,700
With this,

231
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,250
they can be protected.

232
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,990
Fine. Fine.

233
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,800
I can do it myself.

234
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,300
Be accurate when you draw the bow
and be stabilized when you shoot.

235
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,140
Keep your shoulders balanced.

236
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,400
Keep stabilized.

237
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,550
Shoot decisively.

238
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,720
Do not aim for a second time.

239
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,240
Do not hesitate.

240
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,750
Stand properly
and use your strength parallelly.

241
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,030
You will hit the target
if you use the bow in the right way.

242
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,340
Let me show you.

243
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,980
Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!

244
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,530
Awesome!

245
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:13,490
She’s great!

246
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,170
- General Yuwen.
- General Yuwen.

247
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,320
- General Yuwen.
- General Yuwen.

248
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,850
Who shot it?

249
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,920
I did.

250
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,420
Give me your bow.

251
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,660
Awesome! Awesome!

252
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,660
Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!

253
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,720
General Yuwen is great.

254
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,860
Awesome!

255
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,520
Great!

256
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,350
You did a good job.

257
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,240
General,

258
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,480
you did a better job.

259
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,740
You tell me!

260
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,440
Where is He Xiao?

261
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:00,630
He’s gone to the Ministry of War.

262
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,000
Today is the salary day.

263
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,840
I noticed

264
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,760
your bows are aged.

265
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,900
Have someone

266
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,070
get some new bows

267
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,030
with my written order.

268
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,190
Aye.

269
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,430
Let her do it.

270
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,150
Ms. Chu, go.

271
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,130
Yeah, just go.

272
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,080
Hurry, go!

273
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,840
Go!

274
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,890
You should give a written order, right?

275
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,200
Write it.

276
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,940
Not before you rub the ink stick.

277
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:33,440
You!

278
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,320
I remember last time at my house,

279
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,300
you said

280
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,490
you would serve me for the last time.

281
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,470
Seems like it’s fate.

282
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,810
After only a few days,

283
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,590
here we meet again.

284
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:57,700
Why do you stop?

285
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,610
I’m too tired to continue.

286
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,260
Are you accustomed to life

287
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,170
in this place?

288
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,770
None of your business.

289
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,730
Is that

290
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,180
how you talk to your superior?

291
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,260
A superior should have said

292
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,240
what he ought to say.

293
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,260
He wouldn’t have made trouble

294
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,300
and asked his subordinate

295
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,200
to rub the ink stick.

296
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,520
Obviously, you’ve never lived

297
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,220
in a battalion.

298
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,980
If your superior wants to make trouble,

299
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,560
he will have a lot of ways.

300
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,320
Rubbing ink is too simple.

301
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,070
Start it.

302
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,670
It’s enough for even writing a book.

303
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,620
By the way, Xue Zhileng is

304
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,020
Xue Lu’s son.

305
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,180
Xue Lu is the Deputy Commander
of Defense Battalion.

306
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,830
Without a reason,

307
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,430
don’t mess up with him.

308
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,520
It’s not inconvenient for a girl like you

309
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,520
to stay here.

310
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,190
Once there is a chance,

311
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:00,970
I will transfer you.

312
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,930
So, keep a low profile.

313
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,610
Do not always want

314
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,220
to do something for Yan Xun.

315
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,850
Remember.

316
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,660
I rule this place.

317
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,800
I will always know

318
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,890
what you do.

319
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,930
Why did you help me?

320
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,120
What do you mean?

321
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,180
It wasn’t a coincidence

322
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,460
when I joined Xiuli Army.

323
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,510
Clever girl.

324
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:29,900
If I were stupid,

325
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,130
I would have been dead.

326
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,920
Since you are clever,

327
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,130
try to stay out of this.

328
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,100
I have helped you

329
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,590
get rid of Wei Guang.

330
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,460
Remember, for just this once.

331
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,350
Your master wants so much.

332
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,340
I’m afraid you’ll get yourself ruined.

333
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,200
Then should we just await our doom?

334
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,200
There are different ways

335
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,370
to achieve something.

336
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,430
But you know what has happened.

337
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,720
There may be a chance to survive

338
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,550
if we go ahead.

339
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,930
If we stop

340
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:02,970
or just await our doom,

341
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,660
we’ll end up dead

342
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,660
and be dashed to pieces.

343
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,570
Maybe you can’t survive

344
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,460
even if you go ahead.

345
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,080
I won’t let you

346
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,050
do what you want.

347
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,150
We don’t know that until we try.

348
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,630
You’d better not be so stubborn.

349
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,040
I’m not stubborn. I’m persistent.

350
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,790
Your Highness.

351
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,950
Madam Wenshan.

352
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,030
My mother wanted to see me?

353
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,320
Yes, Your Highness.

354
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,590
Please get in.

355
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,580
The guest has already arrived.

356
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,660
They’re waiting for you to have dinner.

357
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,840
Who else was invited?

358
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,350
Don’t you remember, Your Highness.

359
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,530
A few days ago,

360
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,160
Her Grace wanted to find you

361
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,790
a perfect husband.

362
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,450
All right. Just get in.

363
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,320
Yuwen Yue?

364
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:03,900
Your Highness.

365
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,100
Mother.

366
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,230
Why is he here?

367
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,070
I invited him, of course.

368
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,360
Sit down.

369
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,660
Mother, I am not hungry.

370
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,630
Enjoy dinner without me.

371
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,110
I gotta go.

372
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,220
Chun!

373
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,290
Don’t be so wayward.

374
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,790
These are

375
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,480
your favorite dishes.

376
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,280
That depends on whom I enjoy them with!

377
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,460
Your Grace, I’ve got something else to do.

378
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,490
Sorry, but I have to go.

379
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,240
Sit down, both of you!

380
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,040
Is it so hard to have dinner with me?

381
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:49,910
Aye.

382
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,310
We must have chrysanthemum wine
on the Double Ninth festival.

383
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,990
It comes in a few days.

384
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,130
I still remember

385
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,670
the Emperor of Liang
had the wine sent last year.

386
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,940
It is made by mashed dried petal

387
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,750
from white chrysanthemum.

388
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,430
How does it taste?

389
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,400
Great.

390
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,230
No idea.

391
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,190
The Emperor of Liang is humorous.

392
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,250
With the wine,

393
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,960
he wrote a poem.

394
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,030
Take bamboo basket to collect the dewdrop
of the chrysanthemum.

395
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,130
The drops on the flower
in the early morning wet their dresses.

396
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,380
Mother.

397
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,510
I’d like to make a toast
for your prolonging life.

398
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,980
Wish you longevity

399
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,180
and good luck.

400
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,940
Make a toast for General Yuwen as well.

401
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,200
Hurry.

402
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,160
Young Master Yue.

403
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,940
A toast to you, too.

404
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:22,440
Thank you, Your Highness.

405
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,070
I am sorry.

406
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,710
I lost hold of it.

407
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,020
Seems like

408
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,360
we can’t drink with each other.

409
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,430
What bad luck!

410
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,720
I have a headache.

411
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,800
Help yourselves.

412
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,910
See you, Your Grace.

413
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,860
See you, Mother.

414
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,040
Have some rest, Mother.

415
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,010
What do you think, Cold Ice?

416
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,410
Say thank you to me.

417
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,370
I let you get rid of it early.

418
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,430
You know what?

419
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,550
I’ll never like you!

420
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,190
Thank you, then.

421
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,920
What’s your attitude?

422
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,260
Although I will

423
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,180
never like you,

424
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,330
there is no need for you

425
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,010
to be so happy about it.

426
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,210
What attitude should I have, then?

427
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,190
I’m so sad and painful.

428
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,520
I fail to make such a beautiful princess

429
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,860
fall in love with me.

430
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,000
What a pity!

431
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,800
It is a pity.

432
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:14,480
Cold Ice, I just realize

433
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,310
you can also be a bit cute.

434
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,370
Cheers.

435
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,180
Please stay, Your Highness.

436
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,020
I am in good mood today.

437
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,830
I’ll walk you out.

438
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,670
Since you don’t want

439
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,630
to get involved with me,

440
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,120
you’d better not do anything

441
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,550
that may make Her Grace misunderstand.

442
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,560
Especially following me

443
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,120
when you’re on your way out of the palace.

444
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,460
If Her Grace thinks

445
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,630
we get along well,

446
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,040
and asks His Majesty to marry you to me,

447
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,670
we will be in trouble, won’t we?

448
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,750
Smart guy.

449
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,920
Why can you

450
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,790
figure out everything?

451
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,660
Fine. There you go.

452
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,800
Without your help,

453
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,760
I can also get out of the palace.

454
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,310
You are back?

455
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:40,260
How was it going?

456
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,270
Did you see Chun?

457
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,120
How do you know?

458
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,520
I don’t know anything.

459
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,390
You and Her Grace made the decision

460
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,250
to marry Chun to me?

461
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,060
Yes.

462
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:04,870
I did.

463
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,670
It’s none of your business.

464
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,070
What? You don’t like her?

465
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,640
She is a smart girl

466
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,660
from the imperial family.

467
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,060
Why don’t you like her?

468
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,680
No reason.
I’m just not good enough for her.

469
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,270
For Chu Qiao, right?

470
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,110
Yuwen Yue,

471
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,260
let alone

472
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:46,680
whether she is fond of you.

473
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,820
Even if she wants to be with you,

474
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,060
you two are not of equal social rank.

475
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,270
You are General Zhuguo’s son,

476
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,260
and the legitimate grandson
of the First Branch.

477
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,970
How will your families allow you

478
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,790
to marry a girl who was a slave?

479
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,150
What does it concern you?

480
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,040
Even if you can persuade your father,

481
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,140
you should remember

482
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,130
who she is.

483
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,230
She lives in the Oriole Courtyard

484
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,240
with Yan Xun alone

485
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,150
for three years.

486
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,120
They could have done

487
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,180
what they wanted.

488
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,520
Why can a girl like her

489
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:20,680
make you sacrifice

490
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,320
for her?

491
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,350
Stop!

492
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,760
To tell you the truth,

493
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,960
Yan Xun must die.

494
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,790
I won’t allow Yan Xun

495
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,660
to leave Chang’an alive.

496
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,670
If she gets involved in it,

497
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,970
she will end up dead, too.

498
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:45,220
When His Majesty wanted
to kill Marquis Dingbei,

499
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,640
you were the only one

500
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,790
who wrote to object it.

501
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,550
But things are different now.

502
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,090
Marquis Dingbei was an important minister.

503
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,490
Father wanted to kill him,

504
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:54,560
only because of his own suspicion.

505
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,790
I would never agree.

506
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,750
But now,

507
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,910
Yan Xun is full of hatred and rage.

508
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,650
If he succeeds in

509
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:02,800
leaving Chang’an,

510
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,690
a war is about to start.

511
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,280
The North will never be in peace.

512
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,930
As a prince and general,

513
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:10,760
I will never allow it

514
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,890
to happen.

515
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,000
Yuwen Yue,

516
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,000
don’t forget who you are.

517
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,620
= Pine Hall =

518
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,860
The three-year period is due.

519
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,980
We have

520
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,890
very little time.

521
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,800
So, we must make sure

522
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,710
everything is ready.

523
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,380
Problem may happen

524
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,560
where we least expect it.

525
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,300
We need to prepare for everything

526
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,910
that may happen.

527
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,810
We have put up a plucky defense

528
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:53,870
on Zhuque Avenue

529
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,430
and planted people
in different ministries of Chang’an.

530
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,510
I don’t think we’ll be stopped.

531
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,360
If we can’t go out of the gate,

532
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:01,750
no plan

533
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,460
will work.

534
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,550
Seems like we can only succeed
through disturbances.

535
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,230
By then,

536
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,140
we’ll make some disturbances

537
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:13,700
to draw the attention of guards

538
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,610
who defend the city walls.

539
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,570
Then we’ll seize the opportunity
and leave in disguise.

540
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,590
I am afraid it’s all that we can do.

541
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,970
His Majesty asked me
to welcome the Crown Prince of Liang

542
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,430
with our soldiers.

543
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,900
Everybody, get prepared

544
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,300
and go with me.

545
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:37,200
Your Highness,

546
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,070
it’s not an easy job.

547
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,360
I hear

548
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,760
the Crown Prince of Liang

549
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,460
hasn’t used anything

550
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,410
that has been touched by men

551
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,500
since he was born.

552
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,740
To raise a freak man like him,

553
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,450
his poor father

554
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,670
has never stopped worrying.

555
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,120
There is

556
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,600
even a land

557
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,350
in his palace

558
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,030
where some young girls

559
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,600
plant rice, fruit, and vegetables

560
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,650
so that he will eat

561
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,330
such things.

562
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,690
It takes only one month

563
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,080
to ride from Jiankang to Chang’an.

564
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,630
It takes two months

565
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,440
to take a slow carriage.

566
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,680
However, the Crown Prince of Liang

567
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,610
spent four months for preparation

568
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:14,750
before he set off.

569
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,940
So far, he hasn’t arrived yet.

570
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,570
It must be a rumor.

571
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,210
He is the Crown Prince, after all.

572
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,910
He can’t be that ridiculous.

573
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,070
There’s more ridiculous news.

574
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,080
Our princes,

575
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,590
Your Highness, for example,

576
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,210
mostly have some experience
in defending the frontier.

577
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,030
They follow the troops

578
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,070
to meadow, wasteland,

579
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,300
river, mountain stream

580
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,620
and nearly everywhere else.

581
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,460
But the Crown Prince of Liang
builds a bridge

582
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,830
before crossing the river,

583
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,750
and opens up the wasteland
before going across.

584
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,040
He doesn’t travel
through mountains or deserts.

585
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,510
He doesn’t travel to places
far from the cities.

586
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,270
Your Highness,

587
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,180
he is a hot potato

588
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,390
that we can hardly please.

589
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,560
Your Highness.

590
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,830
Message came that

591
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,860
the Crown Prince of Liang got a cold

592
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,890
for kicking the quilt last night

593
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,340
and he returned.

594
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,480
What a finicky prince!

595
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:19,630
Never mind.

596
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,230
Now that we get the sign of him,

597
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,960
we should greet him, anyway.

598
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,180
He doesn’t want to see you, Your Highness.

599
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,000
He said you were just back
from the frontier

600
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:31,950
and had a killing aura,

601
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,630
which would make him worse.

602
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,990
Also,

603
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,370
his maids

604
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,320
told me this.

605
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,890
What... What a freak man!

606
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,240
He doesn’t

607
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:42,850
speak to men?

608
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,790
How do we deal with him?

609
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,610
Fu, some people are in our way.

610
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,640
Who are they?

611
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,280
Men or women?

612
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,490
Four men and one woman.

613
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,910
Is that woman pretty?

614
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,200
How old is she?

615
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,370
Not bad.

616
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,310
Looks seventeen or eighteen years old.

617
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,510
She’s not much prettier than me,

618
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,120
let alone you,

619
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,210
Er,

620
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,670
or Qing.

621
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:29,200
You know what?

622
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,190
Master says

623
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,310
she must be a gorgeous girl

624
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,280
considering how you described her.

625
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,230
Let go of the men

626
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,510
and keep the girl.

627
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,960
His Highness wants to question her.

628
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:42,190
Didn’t you hear her?

629
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,390
Men can leave and the girl shall stay.

630
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,500
Can’t you hear me?

631
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,050
Idiots!

632
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,250
There isn’t a pass around your waist.

633
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,670
It means you’re not from a clan.

634
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,290
A humble girl like you

635
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,260
should feel grateful.

636
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,580
And the men, leave!

637
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,250
Who the hell are you!

638
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,780
You bastard!

639
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,390
Who do you think you are?

640
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,810
Just a mere soldier.

641
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,940
Hurry! Hurry!

642
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:26,510
Let’s go.

643
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,470
How...

644
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:11,020
How cruel you are!

645
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,570
Chu Qiao, what are you doing?

646
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:26,190
Your Highness!

647
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,550
Your Highness! Your Highness!

648
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,560
Your Highness, are you alright?

649
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,580
Your Highness! Your Highness!

650
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,710
Your Highness, I’m sorry

651
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,660
that my subordinate offended you.

652
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,660
Are you crazy?

653
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,300
How dare you beat him!

654
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,710
You’ve got the nerve!

655
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:46,060
She made such a big trouble!

656
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,180
Your Highness,

657
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,470
do punish her severely!

658
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:49,750
Your Highness.

659
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:52,030
She offended His Highness
and she must be up to something!

660
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,120
Are you finished?

661
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,480
If you are, go away.

662
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,050
You!

663
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,430
Don’t be rude to His Highness.

664
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,300
Well,

665
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,530
we won’t let this go.

666
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,310
We’ll send an envoy to Chang’an

667
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,390
to investigate it.

668
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,850
As for this woman,

669
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,580
if you don’t give her to us,

670
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,960
we can do nothing about it.

671
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,050
Please lock her up

672
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,390
for us.

673
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,400
We’ll deal with her later.

674
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,380
Your Highness.

675
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,480
Your Highness, be careful!

676
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,590
Your Highness, be careful!

677
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,860
Slowly. Slowly.

678
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:27,880
Protect His Highness.

679
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,620
If anything goes wrong again,

680
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,820
you’ll be punished.

681
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,430
Aye.

682
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,230
Go back.

683
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,340
Aye.

684
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,210
Your Highness.

685
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,580
I know that I made a big trouble.

686
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,220
Please punish me.

687
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,850
I know what I have done

688
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,380
and there is no way to correct it.

689
00:32:58,450 --> 00:32:59,930
But this is my own fault.

690
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,960
Don’t get anyone involved.

691
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,860
You did a good job.

692
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:13,490
Well done! Well done!

693
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,180
We should have

694
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,630
taught Xiao Ce a lesson long ago!

695
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,180
The Crown Prince of Liang?

696
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,580
He’s just like a woman

697
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:22,390
who always wears colorful clothes.

698
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,010
I’m so sick with him!

699
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,220
And he’s so fastidious.

700
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,390
He should have been killed.

701
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,990
Well done, Chu Qiao!

702
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,080
If they want to harm you,

703
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,580
we will deal with them first!

704
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:40,170
Your Highness, ignorance can be forgiven.

705
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:41,810
However,

706
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:42,600
I did beat

707
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,960
the Crown Prince of Liang.

708
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,040
He’s even coming for his marriage.

709
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,800
Anyway,

710
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,710
I should apologize to him.

711
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,150
You beat him? How?

712
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,410
I didn’t see that.

713
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,210
Did anyone of you see that?

714
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,060
No.

715
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,060
We didn’t see that.

716
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,740
But you were quite clumsy.

717
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,710
If you wanted to beat him,

718
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,720
you should have beaten him

719
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,340
when no one else was around.

720
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,520
Yeah.

721
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:16,950
His Highness and we discussed it.

722
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,660
As long as he came,

723
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,160
we would find a quiet place,

724
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,140
put him in a bag and beat him.

725
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,590
Unexpectedly,

726
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,440
you did that earlier.

727
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:26,800
In fact,

728
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,090
we had been there for a long time.

729
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,550
We just didn’t show up.

730
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,560
Don’t worry.

731
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,200
You are one of us now.

732
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,630
And you did that
to protect your subordinate.

733
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,630
I won’t let them hurt you.

734
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:38,950
Take my command,

735
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,630
no one shall

736
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,570
leave here today.

737
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,520
If people know it,

738
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,830
I will show no mercy.

739
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:47,530
Aye.

740
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:51,390
Brother.

741
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,590
I’ve suffered so much!

742
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:00,520
The Crown Prince Xiao Ce

743
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,820
can be a real trouble.

744
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,220
I am a prince, after all.

745
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,040
What am I, compared with him?

746
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,550
He kept torturing me.

747
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,230
In the middle of night,

748
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,190
he told me his room was stuffy

749
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,190
and he felt uncomfortable.

750
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:11,970
Fine.

751
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,860
I tried every possible way

752
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,040
to make it airy.

753
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,340
Did you know

754
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,340
what he said after that?

755
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,460
He said that

756
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,390
he was too cold.

757
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,210
When he woke up in the morning,

758
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,030
he said that the maids were ugly.

759
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,000
I said, well,
they can’t be as pretty as yours.

760
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,660
Then,

761
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,390
I found him

762
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,790
some pretty maids.

763
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,230
He complained about them

764
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,330
for not making poems.

765
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:36,770
He was fastidious

766
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,230
about every meal.

767
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,490
He only drank fresh tea
picked within three days.

768
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,190
You know what the funniest is?

769
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:43,600
Guards at his door

770
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,280
didn’t stand on a cotton shoe-pad.

771
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,560
He said it was too noisy.

772
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,520
Seriously, he never stopped complaining!

773
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:53,230
Did he tell you

774
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,900
Chu Qiao beat him?

775
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,470
Achu beat him?

776
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,740
So, Achu gave him the bruises

777
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,900
all over him?

778
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,230
Cool! So cool!

779
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,630
He didn’t tell you about that?

780
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,980
He didn’t even say a single word.

781
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,050
If I were him,
I wouldn’t say it, either.

782
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,350
A man like him

783
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:19,620
was beat by a young girl.

784
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,730
How shameful it was!

785
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,370
I thought

786
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,890
he pretended to be harmless.

787
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,690
I didn’t expect him

788
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,260
to be such a freak.

789
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,530
Unbelievable!

790
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,870
Brother.

791
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,040
Do you smell that?

792
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:49,610
What?

793
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,910
The smell of the freak.

794
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,920
He’s coming again?

795
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,470
Yes.

796
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,970
Does it smell good?

797
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,900
I look gorgeous today,

798
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,550
don’t I?

799
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:14,780
Great. Wonderful.

800
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:16,930
Hasn’t she come yet?

801
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,980
Did you not tell her?

802
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,910
She’ll be right here.

803
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,030
Right here?

804
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,110
Greetings, Your Highnesses.

805
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,550
It’s so rude of you.

806
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,150
It’s me.

807
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:51,790
Don’t you remember me?

808
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:54,580
Your... Your Highness?

809
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:55,760
How dare you!

810
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,550
Get off your hands.

811
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,430
Look where you are.

812
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,290
Why are you yelling?

813
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,520
Do you know who she is?

814
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,290
She is the special guard I chose.

815
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,060
Your Highness.

816
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,890
Haven’t you had enough beating?

817
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,500
I’m very satisfied with her.

818
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,480
Miss, what’s your name?

819
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,830
Be my personal bodyguard,

820
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,880
will you?

821
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:36,020
Brother, what’s wrong with him?

822
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:36,840
It’s hard to tell.

823
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,640
A man like him

824
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,710
can be the Crown Prince of Liang?

825
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,370
Let’s just wait to see.

826
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,690
But, brother.

827
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,450
I’m just afraid Achu will suffer losses

828
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:49,870
if he continues.

829
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,650
Your Highness.

830
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,860
I, Chu Qiao, offended you that day.

831
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,820
Please

832
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,580
show some mercy

833
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:06,320
and don’t blame me.

834
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,050
You’re Chu Qiao?

835
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,450
May I call you Qiao?

836
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,710
Or Xiaoqiao?

837
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,350
I’m a humble girl.

838
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,660
You don’t need to call me...

839
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,620
Qiaoqiao could be better.

840
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:26,610
It sounds more intimate.

841
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,750
Your Highness, what on earth do you want?

842
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:30,630
Please get to the point.

843
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,890
What families do you have?

844
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,240
Are your parents still alive?

845
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:35,750
Do you have siblings?

846
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,110
Which month were you born in?

847
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,230
How old are you?

848
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,010
I was born in July,

849
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,500
and I’m 21 years old.

850
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,170
I’m old enough to get married.

851
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,600
Your Highness.

852
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,170
If you’re doing this,

853
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,720
only because

854
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,390
I beat you

855
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:53,610
that day,

856
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:55,530
punish me as you wish.

857
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:58,860
By the way,

858
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,410
where is your ancestral home?

859
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,960
You look so pretty

860
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,560
and you have such smooth skin.

861
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,750
You don’t look like a local girl,

862
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,620
but a girl from our nation.

863
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,730
Your Highness!

864
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,050
Behave normally, could you?

865
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,430
You’re angry?

866
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,010
You even look cute when you’re angry.

867
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:18,800
I really have a good taste.

868
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,860
Your Highness.

869
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,020
What makes you have a crush on me?

870
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,020
Everything.

871
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,620
I like everything of you.

872
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:32,190
Or,

873
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,020
what do you want from me?

874
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,680
If you want to kill me,

875
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,990
you can find many reasons.

876
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,700
I’m a mere archery coach

877
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,250
at Cavalry Battalion

878
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,840
who is of little use.

879
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:43,790
Qiaoqiao.

880
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,470
I fell in love with you at first sight.

881
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,050
I feel hurt

882
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:49,670
when you get me wrong like this.

883
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,700
Qiaoqiao, my hands are so cold.

884
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,630
Could you warm them for me?

885
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,530
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

886
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:24,930
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

887
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,060
Your Highness!

888
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,560
Are you alright, Your highness?

889
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,840
Are you alright, Your highness?

890
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,980
Are you alright, Your highness?

891
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,230
I’m fine.

892
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,270
I’m fine.

893
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,010
I’m fine.

894
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:42,900
Come on. Come on.

895
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,030
I’m fine.

896
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:47,080
I’m fine. I’m really fine.

897
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,650
I’m really fine.

898
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,870
That’s fine, then. That’s fine, then.

899
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:57,430
The carriage marches more slowly
than walking.

900
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:59,470
But the Crown Prince still flew out of it.

901
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:00,440
Amazing!

902
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,400
Achu is amazing.

903
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:04,890
Let’s go.

904
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,590
Qiaoqiao.

905
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:20,090
It’s so heartless of you.

906
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:22,070
Is this how you treat the man
you should protect?

907
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:25,670
You’re a man and I’m a girl.
Please behave yourself.

908
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,610
Qiaoqiao.

909
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:37,510
Could you apply the ointment for me?

910
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:41,130
It’s for your own good.

911
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,210
Think about it.

912
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:44,040
If someone knows I’m hurt,

913
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,540
it will bring trouble on you.

914
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:47,480
This ointment works greatly

915
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,270
in subsiding swelling.

916
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:51,090
Apply some to me and I’ll be fine.

917
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:52,670
Have you made up your mind?

918
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,280
Do you really want me to apply it for you?
