16

Jinzhu!

17
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,010
It’s not me.

18
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,320
She jumped herself.

19
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,300
She’s over there.

20
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,950
Jinzhu, you’re caught in the act.

21
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,500
I’ll see what you’re going to explain.

22
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,390
It’s not me.

23
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,540
It’s Xing’er.

24
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,360
But she jumped off the cliff.

25
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,770
No.

26
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,280
I saw Jinzhu

27
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,740
sneak into the flower shed

28
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,200
with the pot in her hands.

29
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,950
She must have been destroying the evidence

30
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:19,970
after trying to killing Young Master.

31
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,470
Now she wants to frame my sister up.

32
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,420
Nonsense.

33
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,480
Yueqi, they’re sisters.

34
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,280
They must have colluded each other

35
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,050
to frame me up.

36
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,140
Don’t trust them.

37
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:27,920
Fine.

38
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,670
I’ll trust you for the moment.

39
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,390
Then where’s Xing’er?

40
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,540
Where is she?

41
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,910
She jumped off the cliff.

42
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,880
Your Excellency Yan Xun?

43
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,190
Why are you here?

44
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,550
That’s my question, too.

45
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:54,800
Why are you here?

46
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,750
Jumped off the cliff?

47
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,290
Jinzhu, say it again.

48
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,900
It’s true.

49
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,520
I saw her

50
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,800
jump off the cliff.

51
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,830
And snakes on the ground.

52
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,480
She brought them here.

53
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,160
I swear.

54
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,940
Jinzhu.

55
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,870
Do you think I’m an idiot?

56
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,130
You mean she jumped off the cliff

57
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,980
just to frame you up?

58
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,680
Butler Zhu.

59
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,270
Young Master Yue was hurt by snakes.

60
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,250
Now we catch her in the act.

61
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,340
You see that, too.

62
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,800
I don’t think I have to argue more.

63
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,380
Butler Zhu.

64
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,920
You must trust me.

65
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,550
You must trust me.

66
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,650
It’s not true.

67
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,740
You deserve it.

68
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,170
Somebody.

69
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,170
Take Jinzhu to Guilty-slave Chamber.

70
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:44,990
Aye.

71
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,010
Xiaoba doesn’t look sad at all.

72
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,010
Is she pretending?

73
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,080
If you don’t want to be found,

74
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,250
you’d better behave yourself.

75
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,800
Don’t try to play tricks.

76
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,490
Since she fell off the cliff,

77
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,030
we should find her, alive or dead.

78
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,350
Butler Zhu.

79
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,910
She would certainly die

80
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,280
after falling off such a cliff.

81
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,270
Shall we bet

82
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,890
if she’s alive or dead?

83
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah.

84
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,100
You’re right.

85
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,060
Whoever falls off the cliff

86
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,150
will be smashed to pieces.

87
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,220
You’re a royal highness.

88
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,310
While you’re hiding in a cave,

89
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,080
you must be up to something evil,

90
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,010
aren’t you?

91
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,010
I’m cooling myself here.

92
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:58,890
What’s the problem?

93
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,870
None of your business.

94
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,740
I don’t care.

95
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,830
You ungrateful Wild Kitten.

96
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,090
I just saved you

97
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,250
instead of exposing you.

98
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,860
How will you thank me?

99
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,770
Ungrateful Wild Kitten.

100
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,870
You’re just leaving?

101
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,090
What, Your Excellency?

102
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,370
I don’t want to owe you.

103
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,240
I’ll repay you later.

104
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,070
I’ve got something to attend to. See you.

105
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,330
Your Excellency.

106
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,950
At the command of Young Master Yue,

107
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,890
we come to seal the cave

108
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:13,800
on the cliff wall.

109
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,360
If you’ve left something important in it,

110
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,540
please take it away soon.

111
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,420
Cave?

112
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,830
What cave?

113
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,560
Why do I care?

114
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,690
That’s better then.

115
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,090
But Young Master Yue said

116
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:24,990
you often hid in the cave,

117
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,170
crying and missing your hometown

118
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,620
over the past two years.

119
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,250
When the cave is sealed,

120
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,510
you’ll try to go back home earlier.

121
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,240
Sorry for that.

122
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:44,850
Young Master.

123
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,150
Xing’er jumped off the cliff.

124
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,960
But I find it fishy.

125
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,920
I knew

126
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,330
what would happen.

127
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,330
Xing’er has been

128
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,230
elaborately taught by Yuwen Yue.

129
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,130
She can’t be underestimated.

130
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,760
What... What should I do then?

131
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,590
Catch her sister.

132
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,000
What do I do?

133
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,800
Xiaoliu. Xiaoliu.

134
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,520
Bad news.

135
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,970
Xiaoba was caught.

136
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,660
What happened?

137
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,050
I have no idea.

138
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,500
Could...

139
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:26,980
Could Young Master Yue

140
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,300
find out

141
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,740
we framed Jinzhu up?

142
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,290
Calm down.

143
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,680
It may not be Yuwen Yue.

144
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,550
Where were they going?

145
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,940
To the Guilty-slave Chamber.

146
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:37,910
I’ll go and check.

147
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,110
Xiaoliu.

148
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,240
Come back early. I’m scared.

149
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,670
Don’t be scared. Wait for me.

150
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,160
Oh, Miss Xing’er.

151
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,960
We’ve been waiting for you.

152
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,460
Come, please.

153
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,890
Young Master.

154
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,420
Your eyes have recovered.

155
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,140
But lately,

156
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,920
you must be very careful

157
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,370
not to get a cold again

158
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,960
in case you’ll be blind again

159
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,200
with the cold disease.

160
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,880
Okay.

161
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,450
Young Master.

162
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,980
Miss Xing’er jumped off the cliff.

163
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,480
Don’t worry.

164
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,560
She won’t die.

165
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,460
She’s not the only cat

166
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:57,860
who covers its poo.

167
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,080
Young Master, Master woke up.

168
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:09,840
Vixen, kneel!

169
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,240
Young Master, this way.

170
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,290
Young Master Huai.

171
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,330
Here she is.

172
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,130
Aye.

173
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,150
You’re a mere maid.

174
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,770
How dare you

175
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,990
always go against me!

176
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,480
You’ve got some nerve.

177
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:33,670
Young Master Huai.

178
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:34,710
Could you be

179
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,690
more specific?

180
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,510
I’m a mere maid.

181
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,040
What you said is too complicated

182
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,280
for me to understand.

183
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,400
Fine. You don’t understand.

184
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,260
Zhu Shun.

185
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,230
Young Master.

186
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,440
Make her understand.

187
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,130
Aye.

188
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,670
Go.

189
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,980
I’m the personal maid

190
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,840
for Young Master Yue of the First Branch.

191
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:05,820
I don’t dare to

192
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,790
bother you to teach me a lesson.

193
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,720
Funny.

194
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,030
You’re a mere maid.

195
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,640
Why do you keep taking nonsense?

196
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,330
You’re a mere minion

197
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,820
for Yuwen Yue.

198
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,100
Even if I kill you today,

199
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,990
will he defend you?

200
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,930
Even if I’m a maid,

201
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,400
I’m Young Master Yue’s maid.

202
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,450
No one else

203
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,140
is qualified

204
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,310
to kill me.

205
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,800
Qualified?

206
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,850
Today, I’ll show you

207
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,330
who is qualified.

208
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,080
Zhu Shun.

209
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,870
Young Master.

210
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,620
Make her “happy”

211
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,270
with your men.

212
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,260
Aye.

213
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,080
Did you hear that?

214
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,950
I’m asked to

215
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,270
make you “happy”.

216
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,020
Believe it or not, I’ll kill you.

217
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,800
How dare you!

218
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,880
See if I dare.

219
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,510
Young Master, kill her!

220
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,560
Idiot.

221
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,070
If Young Master Huai really wanted to kill me,

222
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,450
he didn’t need to do it himself

223
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,710
or take the trouble.

224
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,900
Am I right, Young Master Huai?

225
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,930
Interesting.

226
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,000
No wonder

227
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,960
Yuwen Yue pays special regard to you.

228
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,360
Young Master Huai.

229
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,190
I’m a mere maid.

230
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,090
All I want is to live a life

231
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,040
without making trouble.

232
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,030
I know

233
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,130
Jinzhu works for you,

234
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,120
But I never mean to

235
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,120
go against you.

236
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,250
For what happened today,

237
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,530
I had no other choice.

238
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:22,540
She’s jealous of me

239
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,740
when I’m favored by Yuwen Yue

240
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,370
and she wanted to kill me a few times.

241
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,130
I bore with her a few times.

242
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,140
But she was so desperate to kill me.

243
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,500
If I didn’t fight back,

244
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,710
I would have been dead.

245
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,040
I did frame up Jinzhu.

246
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,720
But I never mean to disrespect you,

247
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,470
Young Master Huai.

248
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,870
Please kindly understand.

249
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,810
You mean

250
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,650
Jinzhu is jealous of you

251
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,710
when you’re favored by Yuwen Yue?

252
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,390
Young Maser Huai, don’t you know?

253
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,030
Jinzhu is always

254
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,020
dreaming to be

255
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,380
Yuwen Yue’s bedchamber maid.

256
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,920
She is crazy about him.

257
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,710
She always wants to kill me

258
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,700
and asks for trouble.

259
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:56,640
It’s no longer a secret

260
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,970
in Qingshan House.

261
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,440
How did you know

262
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,650
Jinzhu worked for me?

263
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,260
Do you really know

264
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,900
or do you pretend to know?

265
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,940
Or are you keeping any secret

266
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,470
for Yuwen Yue?

267
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,400
You’re his personal maid.

268
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,470
I’m sure you can recognize this.

269
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,980
Yes.

270
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,330
He issued an order,

271
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,460
expelling you from Qingshan House

272
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,800
leaving you to my disposal.

273
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,850
And...

274
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,210
Your sister Xiaoba

275
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,670
confessed

276
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,080
what you did on the cliff.

277
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,410
Feeling bad, aren’t you?

278
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,200
You’re as good as dead.

279
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,670
To die without being tortured

280
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,330
can even be a dream

281
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,040
for you.

282
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,290
What?

283
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,740
Feeling bad

284
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,220
when you’re betrayed, huh?

285
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,370
The point is

286
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,620
what people want you to see

287
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,480
and how much you can see

288
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,740
with your ability.

289
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,060
But I still want to know

290
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,300
how you figured out

291
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,880
Jinzhu worked for me.

292
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:29,740
Well, I want to

293
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,060
meet Jinzhu, then.

294
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,110
Why?

295
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,100
Young Master Huai,

296
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,670
you may not believe what I say.

297
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,480
When I see her,

298
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,870
you’ll know the truth.

299
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,350
Bring Jinzhu to me!

300
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:43,930
Aye.

301
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,630
Young Master.

302
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,820
Grandpa.

303
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,300
You’re awake?

304
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,510
Here is the elixir, Young Master.

305
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,190
Here it is.

306
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,980
- Give it to me.
- This is the last one.

307
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,220
Yue.

308
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,270
Thank you for feeding me

309
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,110
the Resuscitation Elixir in time

310
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,040
so that I survived.

311
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,760
Have you got anything lately?

312
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:31,990
I failed to

313
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,080
win the trust of His Majesty

314
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,600
or restart the Eye of Intel.

315
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,950
I let you down.

316
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,750
I deserve to be punished.

317
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,230
It’s not your fault.

318
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,440
The Eye of Intel declined for years.

319
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,400
I won’t be anxious about it.

320
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,490
But the maid Xing’er

321
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,920
has martial arts

322
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,100
and we don’t know who she really is.

323
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,100
Why do you still keep her with you?

324
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,810
If she assassinates you...

325
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:01,630
She won’t.

326
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,390
Man’s mind is unpredictable.

327
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,140
Why do you trust her?

328
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,850
I gave her the chance

329
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,720
to kill her enemy.

330
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,190
But she didn’t want it.

331
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,200
At the critical moment,

332
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,510
she remained kind.

333
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,940
So, I trust her.

334
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,180
Kind?

335
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,300
It means

336
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,320
she can’t be a good spy.

337
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,880
Why do we need her then?

338
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,420
Spies seem to be cold.

339
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,970
But they’re cold only because

340
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:33,910
they’re going to sacrifice themselves

341
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,650
for righteous cause.

342
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,620
Without kindness,

343
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,780
how can they be loyal to their master?

344
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,450
Besides,

345
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:44,430
Xing’er has many potentials

346
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,120
to be an excellent spy.

347
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,170
She’s decisive in action,

348
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,200
and she has strong insight and memory.

349
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,090
Also, she has super vitality

350
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,020
like a beast.

351
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,550
Ridiculous!

352
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,790
Don’t you remember

353
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,400
our noble blood?

354
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,090
Don’t you remember you promised

355
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,510
not to

356
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,460
fall in love with a maid?

357
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,980
I don’t love her.

358
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,780
I only want to

359
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,200
use her

360
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,210
from the very beginning.

361
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,560
My good boy.

362
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,280
To save me,

363
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,310
you got yourself in trouble.

364
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,270
I know

365
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,390
you care for me.

366
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,650
But the Eye of Intel

367
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,200
hasn’t been fully restarted yet.

368
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:34,140
We’re still disadvantaged.

369
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,840
You should have

370
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,230
killed Xing’er earlier.

371
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,190
Now, Yuwen Huai

372
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,990
has her.

373
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,150
But I think

374
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,370
Xing’er will be

375
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,410
an excellent spy.

376
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,410
She has potentials

377
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,420
ordinary spies don’t have.

378
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,570
She can fulfill the task

379
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,740
that ordinary Yue Guards fail to do.

380
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,120
I think

381
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,040
we should get her out.

382
00:17:59,070 --> 00:17:59,750
You like her potentials,

383
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,710
don’t you?

384
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,600
If she can’t come back alive

385
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,180
from the Guilty-slave Chamber,

386
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,660
why do we still need her?

387
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:11,700
No one in Qingshan House shall save her!

388
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,460
Aye.

389
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,040
I see, Grandpa.

390
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,200
Young Master.

391
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,710
Here she is.

392
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,490
What do you want to say?

393
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,780
I want a private talk

394
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,440
with her.

395
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,140
Okay.

396
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,590
You can.

397
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,810
What are you your last words?

398
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,560
Tell me.

399
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,540
Was it your trick

400
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,190
to get me expelled from Qingshan House?

401
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,580
You were expelled from Qingshan House?

402
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,900
What?

403
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,400
Do you feel sad

404
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:51,730
when you’re abandoned?

405
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,460
Does your heart hurt?

406
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:56,580
Seems like

407
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,610
Young Master Yue will no longer keep me.

408
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,800
You’re a mere maid.

409
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,980
But you want to be his girl?

410
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,210
In your dream!

411
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,400
Don’t be too arrogant.

412
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,050
Do you think

413
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,450
you can stay with Young Master Yue

414
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,360
just after I’m expelled?

415
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:17,640
You know what?

416
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,480
You’d better not sit on the fence,

417
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,130
be double-faced

418
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,740
or play a double game.

419
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,600
What did you say?

420
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:26,840
Stop pretending.

421
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,240
We’re both maids.

422
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,450
Why must we

423
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,160
hate each other like that

424
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,710
and must you kill me?

425
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:32,980
You hate me,

426
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,600
only because

427
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,790
you love Young Master Yue.

428
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,800
Stop talking nonsense!

429
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,870
Jinzhu.

430
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,740
I heard what you said

431
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,830
to Young Master Yue

432
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,980
in the secret chamber.

433
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,750
You’re dying,

434
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,960
but you still try to frame me up?

435
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:46,380
Yeah.

436
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,590
Young Master Yue abandoned me.

437
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,130
In this place,

438
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,560
I can no longer stay.

439
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:52,400
I know

440
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,800
I’m dying today.

441
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,860
So, I’m begging you.

442
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,020
For the sake that

443
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,610
I never messed with you willingly,

444
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,010
please let go of my sisters.

445
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,050
Okay.

446
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,530
I will.

447
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,980
Fine. I’ll kill you

448
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,140
before killing your sisters too!

449
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,180
Stop!

450
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,040
Young Master.

451
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,150
Let me kill her.

452
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,290
She kept talking nonsense.

453
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,140
You don’t need to teach me if I should trust her.

454
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,590
You’re so anxious to kill her.

455
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,010
So that

456
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:31,390
she’ll say nothing against you?

457
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,010
I...

458
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,030
Put the sword down.

459
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,930
You can go on.

460
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,180
Young Master, I can.

461
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:56,760
But I have one request.

462
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,560
Hope you can

463
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,640
let go of my sisters,

464
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,980
give them the slave-releasing certificate

465
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,020
and give them a bit money.

466
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,840
When they’re safe,

467
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,120
punish me as you wish.

468
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,340
You’re a prisoner.

469
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,950
How dare you negotiate with me?

470
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,960
You’re a noble man

471
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,110
with many subordinates.

472
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,770
You may not see clearly

473
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,230
who is loyal and who is evil.

474
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,640
Once any of your subordinates

475
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,280
help others,

476
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,100
there will be trouble, huh?

477
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,020
Stop talking nonsense!

478
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,570
Shut up.

479
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,800
Young Master, she’s very crafty.

480
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,970
Don’t trust her.

481
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,340
Say one more word,

482
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,770
and you’ll die earlier than her!

483
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:37,980
Go on.

484
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,280
I shall see my sister first.

485
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,510
Okay.

486
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:43,820
Bring Xiaoba to us.

487
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,540
Xiaoliu.

488
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,440
Xiaoliu.

489
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,550
Xiaoliu.

490
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,280
Here she is.

491
00:22:59,250 --> 00:22:59,960
You may continue.

492
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:06,830
As I became a bedchamber maid

493
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,280
for Young Master Yue,

494
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,090
he taught me to read.

495
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,680
Sometimes, he also taught me

496
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,660
some martial arts for self-defense.

497
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,060
Once,

498
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:14,910
I sneaked into

499
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,280
his secret chamber for some reading.

500
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,280
Just then, Young Master came back.

501
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,290
In fear,

502
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:20,470
I hid myself.

503
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,650
Then,

504
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:24,800
I heard

505
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,890
what Jinzhu said to Young Master.

506
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:29,640
She said she killed Elderly Master Zhuo,

507
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,150
under Young Master Huai’s instigation.

508
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,550
She was too guilty to fall asleep.

509
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,680
She loved Young Master Yue,

510
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,470
but killed his grandpa.

511
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,780
She couldn’t forgive herself.

512
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,810
Stop talking nonsense!

513
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,550
I never said anything like that.

514
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,490
You must be

515
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,810
framing me up.

516
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,900
Framing you up?

517
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,010
Why?

518
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,100
Jinzhu, you’re framing me up, aren’t you?

519
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,860
I’m Young Master Yue’s bedchamber maid.

520
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,540
I slept

521
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,770
with him already.

522
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:53,480
If Young Master Yue

523
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,590
hadn’t believed your slanderous talk

524
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,380
and trusted you,

525
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,120
why would he expel me

526
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,200
from Qingshan House?

527
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,330
I didn’t!

528
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,390
You didn’t?

529
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,230
Could Young Master trust you

530
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,590
only because of your charm?

531
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,290
Did he trust you so much

532
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,710
that he expelled me?

533
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,070
He didn’t expel you!

534
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,450
Nor did he trust me!

535
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,170
Young Master Huai

536
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:09,650
faked the order.

537
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:14,700
So,

538
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,600
Young Master Huai faked it?

539
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,090
- You idiot.
- I...

540
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,630
Young Master, I’m sorry.

541
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,020
Let’s kill her.

542
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,160
Kill her.

543
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,340
Sell her to the brothel.

544
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,360
Take her away.

545
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:35,870
- No.
- Hurry.

546
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:36,620
Young Master.

547
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:36,930
Go.

548
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:37,520
Young Master.

549
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,540
Go. Go.

550
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,190
Jing Xiaoliu!

551
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,650
Wait and see.

552
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,240
Make way.

553
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:46,760
Your Excellency.

554
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,590
You can’t get in.

555
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,370
Your Excellency.

556
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,400
You can’t get in.

557
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,910
Who is that? So noisy.

558
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:52,500
I...

559
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,560
Your Excellency.

560
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,500
I’m going in for someone.

561
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,060
But, Your Excellency,

562
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,330
there are only humble maids in there.

563
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,240
Who are you

564
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,550
looking for?

565
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,390
It’s smart of you.

566
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:16,920
I’m not smart.

567
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,150
She’s too stupid.

568
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,340
You’re still calm after hurting people.

569
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,510
I hurt no one.

570
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,680
I was telling the truth.

571
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:28,770
Young Master Huai.

572
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:29,970
She’s a stupid

573
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,460
and treacherous maid.

574
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,680
Do you like to use her?

575
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,660
I don’t.

576
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,600
Would you like

577
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,480
a clever and trustworthy maid?

578
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,430
What’s your condition?

579
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,560
I hope you can show some mercy

580
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,900
and let go of my sisters.

581
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,160
How can I trust a crafty maid

582
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,150
like you?

583
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,890
Before you try,

584
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,480
how do you know if you should trust me?

585
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,950
I don’t like to try.

586
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,370
I’d like to kill you instead.

587
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:03,930
What if

588
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,310
you become my enemy someday?

589
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,010
Xiaoliu.

590
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,360
So much fun.

591
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,920
Your Excellency, you’ve come to my home

592
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,380
too frequently lately.

593
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:31,920
You can’t be loving this girl,

594
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,940
can you?

595
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,060
If we fight

596
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,150
for a mere woman,

597
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,160
people will laugh at us.

598
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,770
I don’t love her.

599
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,260
But I’m a bit interested in her.

600
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,110
You know me.

601
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,710
I’m the biggest idler in the capital city.

602
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,830
Finally, I meet an interesting girl.

603
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,270
I can’t help looking after her.

604
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,190
She’s just a maid.

605
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,460
Don’t you mind your own business?

606
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,930
Young Master Huai.

607
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:02,820
We’re friends.

608
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,390
When I want some maids from you,

609
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,410
I’m minding my own business, aren’t I?

610
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,750
Yes.

611
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,730
You are.

612
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:18,710
I know

613
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,440
you’re a reasonable man.

614
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,420
Thank you for sparing me, Young Master Huai.

615
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:32,840
I’m leaving then.

616
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,170
See you.

617
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,730
Xiaoliu.

618
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,950
I’ll do it myself.

619
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,040
Give me the powder.

620
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,910
Does it still hurt?

621
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,120
It’s okay.

622
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,620
What?

623
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,910
Forget me so soon?

624
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,530
Your Excellency, thank you for saving us.

625
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,990
Thank you, Your Excellency.

626
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,790
Shall I

627
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,920
go to Qingshan House

628
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,530
and tell Yuwen Yue about it?

629
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,260
You’re a noble man, Your Excellency.

630
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:40,960
But this is

631
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,230
family business of the Yuwen family.

632
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,370
When I go back,

633
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,750
I’ll report to Young Master Yue myself.

634
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,000
Fine.

635
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,300
If he bullies you,

636
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,690
come to my mansion.

637
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:54,950
Thank you, Your Excellency.

638
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,950
Take this.

639
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,650
It’s good medicine for wounds.

640
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:10,800
Thank you, Your Excellency.

641
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:13,700
You can go back together,

642
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,730
can’t you?

643
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:16,780
Yes.

644
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:19,830
Let’s go,

645
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,060
Fengmian.

646
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:30,230
Oh, don’t forget.

647
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,980
You owe me again.

648
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,850
Remember to repay me.

649
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:47,890
Xiaoliu.

650
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,530
Xiaoliu.

651
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,090
Butler Zhu.

652
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,870
What else do you want?

653
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,850
Young Master Huai wants to remind you that

654
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:09,680
as long as

655
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,270
you keep your promise to him,

656
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,100
he won’t punish you or your sisters

657
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,580
for what you’ve done.

658
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,320
What do you mean?

659
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,190
I don’t understand.

660
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,890
You don’t admit your promise?

661
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,530
I promised nothing. What should I admit?

662
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,220
Young Master Huai overestimated me.

663
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,420
Butler Zhu.

664
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,560
If you have nothing important,

665
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,280
we’ll leave you alone.

666
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:45,300
= Qingshan House =

667
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,360
You asked me

668
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,380
to tell His Excellency Yan Xun about it.

669
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,140
So far,

670
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,020
he has saved

671
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,900
Miss Xing’er.

672
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,220
What is she doing now?

673
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,040
She’s back to her own bedroom.

674
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,610
I asked her to take care of you.

675
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,060
But she ignored me.

676
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:01,990
Enough.

677
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,270
Enough. Enough. Enough.

678
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:06,850
Enough. Enough.

679
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,740
= Guilty-slave Chamber =

680
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,660
Jinzhu.

681
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,670
What do you come for?

682
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,740
I come to check on you.

683
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,300
What?

684
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,640
Does it feel good

685
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,590
to be wronged?

686
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,640
No.

687
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,260
I don’t want to

688
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,990
live a gloomy life.

689
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,880

690
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,000
Xing’er.

691

Xing’er.

692
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,280
Help me!

693
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:30,740
I know

694
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,350
you and your families are the kindest.

695
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,540
Kind?

696
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,370
Linxi was dead unjustly

697
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,860
only because he was kind?

698
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,430
Right?

699
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,190
But he would die sooner or later.

00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:45,230
Why?

701
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:48,830
Because he’s always loyal to Young Master Yue.

702
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,480
So, Young Master Huai said

703
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,730
he would certainly die.

704
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,370
Jinzhu.

705
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,290
I think you should die.

706
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,070
You gave the poisonous counting rod

707
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,140
to Linxi

708
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,330
so that he took the blame for you.

709
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:08,460
No. I was just ordered.

710
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,520
You know that.

711
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,300
Yuwen Huai was behind all this.

712
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,410
I’m a mere maid.

713
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,980
I was forced.

714
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,900
I didn’t have a choice!

715
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,350
I didn’t mean to kill anyone!

716
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,880
I don’t want to be sold to the brothel.

717
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,540
A guilty maid like me

718
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,510
will live miserably when we’re sold!

719
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,860
You know that!

720
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,270
I’m begging you!

721
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,090
I’m begging you! Help me!

722
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,560
Help me!

723
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,690
Help you?

724
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,080
Do you think

725
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,820
Linxi will agree to help you?

726
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,270
He will.

727
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,430
He will.

728
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,260
Linxi is the kindest man.

729
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,410
He will help me.

730
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,930
I alreay regret it.

731
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,340
I worked for Yuwen Huai,

732
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,510
but he kicked me away.

733
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,550
I know I’m wrong.

734
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,210
Fine.

735
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,960
Since you regret it sincerely,

736
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,660
I’ll let you go.

737
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,610
Guards won’t wake up

738
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:14,100
until one hour later.

739
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,850
Get changed

740
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,400
and leave here.

741
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,320
Wait.

742
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,530
Jinzhu.

743
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,430
Will you tell on me

744
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:29,600
after you leave?

745
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,010
Xing’er, I’ll never forget

746
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,230
how you helped me.

747
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,360
If I betray you,

748
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,050
I’ll die an ignominious death.

749
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,440
I swear.

750
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,540
Fine.

751
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:46,390
You’d better keep your promise.

752
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,530
Clothes of a lowest slave?

753
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,220
Xing’er.

754
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,510
You’re the reason

755
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,480
why I’m suffering this.

756
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:37,690
Wait and see.

757
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,870
Young Master Huai.

758
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:47,740
Stop.

759
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,710
Young Master Huai.

760
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,510
Young Master Huai.

761
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,910
Young Master Huai,

762
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,410
you were fooled by Xing’er.

763
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:06,910
I’ve been always loyal

764
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,420
to you.

765
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,630
I never betrayed you.

766
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,430
Xing’er, the bitch...

767
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,590
She made you

768
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,220
suspect me deliberately.

769
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:15,600
Young Master.

770
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,160
Don’t trust her.

771
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,290
Tell me.

772
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,930
Why are you here?

773
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,800
It was Xing’er

774
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,020
who released me.

775
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,860
She wanted me to leave you.

776
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,820
Young Master Huai.

777
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,710
She gave me this.

778
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,380
She gave me the license.

779
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,980
Please trust me.

780
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,880
I don’t think Xing’er saved you.

781
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:50,250
Instead,

782
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,160
her master saved you.

783
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,180
= Pass =

784
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,820
Pass?

785
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,430
I don’t know what this is.

786
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:11,840
I really don’t know.

787
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,090
It’s not mine.

788
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,160
I don’t know what it is.

789
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,180
I don’t know what it is.

790
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,140
Yuwen Yue gave you the license

791
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,920
and the pass.

792
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,590
He asked people at the pass to take care of you.

793
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,240
No.

794
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,670
He cares for you.

795
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,860
Tell me.

796
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,000
What did Yuwen Yue

797
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,750
give you?

798
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:44,780
This?

799
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,740
= Slave-releasing Certificate =

800
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,910
Slave-releasing certificate?

801
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:50,940
No.

802
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,160
Not this.

803
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,180
For the Jade Dog problem,

804
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,770
Yuwen Yue only flogged you

805
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,060
for twenty times.

806
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,850
That made us suspect you already.

807
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:04,850
I only want to stay with you,

808
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:06,180
Young Master Huai.

809
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:07,740
Please trust me.

810
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:12,120
Young Master, I can sleep with you.

811
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,720
I can do it tonight.

812
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:19,690
Come.

813
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:21,980
Be seated.

814
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,850
Send a message to Qingshan House that

815
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,920
Xing’er killer Jinzhu.

816
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:50,930
Go.

817
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:51,720
Aye. Aye.

818
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,420
Jinzhu.

819
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,710
I gave you a chance.

820
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,930
Now you’re abandoned.

821
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,760
But you deserve it.

822
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,630
So, this is the slave-releasing certificate.

823
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,160
Young Master.

824
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,740
Where’s Xing’er?

825
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,410
Did you see her?

826
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:34,080
After coming back from
the Guilty-slave Chamber,

827
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,370
she went to bed early

828
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:36,620
because she didn’t feel well.

829
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:40,560
Aluo, take Young Master to her room.

830
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,520
Leave us.

831
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,150
Aye.

832
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,900
Young Master.

833
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:27,520
What did I do wrong again?

834
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:31,380
They said you didn’t feel well

835
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,860
after coming back from
the Guilty-slave Chamber.

836
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,110
So, I come to check on you.

837
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,740
I’m fine.

838
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,540
You may leave, Young Master.

839
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,290
Xing’er.

840
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,440
Get me a cup of tea.

841
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:53,690
Young Master.

842
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:56,060
Could you leave for a moment?

843
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,100
I will

844
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:01,010
make you some tea soon.

845
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,720
I want it right now!

846
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,990
If you don’t feel well,

847
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,460
lie in bed.

848
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,030
Xiaoliu.

849
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,470
There you are.

850
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,050
Xiaoliu.

851
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:08,750
Come.

852
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,440
Jinzhu is dead.

853
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,860
Jinzhu was powerful.

854
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,650
She had martial arts and a backstage supporter.

855
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,970
Xiaoliu, when you planned to kill her,

856
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:24,880
I was worried if she would survive.

857
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,430
But Xiaoliu still defeated her.

858
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:30,920
I didn’t mean to hurt her.

859
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,060
But she meant to kill me.

860
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:33,530
I hadn’t planned to kill her.

861
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:36,180
She’s dead

862
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,650
and she totally deserves it.

863
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:40,450
What about Yuwen Yue?

864
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,420
Will you also make him

865
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,580
pay the price?

866
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,780
In the Guilty-slave Chamber,
I heard the conversation

867
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,670
between Young Master Huai and Butler Zhu.

868
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:02,380
I think

869
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:05,050
they were talking about Ms. Song.

870
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,910
Make the dead woman talk.

871
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:14,380
We must expose

872
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,100
what the Jing sisters have done.

873
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,580

Jinzhu is dead.

875
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,370

what happened to Ms. Song.

877
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:37,700

00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:39,560
why don’t we turn their trick to our own use?

879
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:41,940
Xiaoliu.

880
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,420

881
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:47,850
