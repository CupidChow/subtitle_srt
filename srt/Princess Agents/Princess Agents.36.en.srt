Qiaoqiao.

17
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,740
Could you apply the ointment for me?

18
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,350
It’s for your own good.

19
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,480
Think about it.

20
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,310
If someone knows I’m hurt,

21
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,970
it will bring trouble on you.

22
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,660
This ointment works greatly

23
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,900
in subsiding swelling.

24
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,250
Apply some to me and I’ll be fine.

25
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,980
Have you made up your mind?

26
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,610
Do you really want me to apply it for you?

27
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,440
You deserve that!

28
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,020
It feels great!

29
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,480
Feels great!

30
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,990
Feels... Feels great.

31
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,440
Do you always play dumb

32
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,030
and treat all things indecorously

33
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,390
to protect yourself, don’t you?

34
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,330
You are right.

35
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,540
In fact, I’m wise, powerful,

36
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,130
and profoundly learned.

37
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,780
What? Admire me, don’t you?

38
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,770
How could I put it?

39
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,450
When someone keeps

40
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,890
playing dumb,

41
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,590
he will become a real idiot.

42
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,360
Qiaoqiao, a girl like you

43
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,680
should have been more adorable.

44
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,030
Why are you so aggressive?

45
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,170
I have already got myself controlled.

46
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,620
What would happen if you hadn’t?

47
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,800
You could try it.

48
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,030
Welcome, Your Highness.

49
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,440
His Majesty is waiting in the main hall.

50
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,470
Qiaoqiao, come on.

51
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,560
Let me help you.

52
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:39,750
No, thanks, Your Highness.

53
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,640
I will walk on my own.

54
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,650
Qiaoqiao, look at my eyes.

55
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,810
They look better, don’t they?

56
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,740
I told you the ointment was efficient.

57
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,020
It was great.

58
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,260
Let’s go.

59
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,500
Let me show you something greater.

60
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,260
Go.

61
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,560
Your Highness, after you.

62
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,440
Fine. Fine. Follow me.

63
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,260
Qiaoqiao, is this

64
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,060
how your people welcome a guest

65
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,640
coming all the way?

66
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,780
Such beautiful girls

67
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,960
in colorful dresses

68
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,600
go well with you, Your Highness.

69
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,120
There’s a beautiful lass
with clear eyes and fine forehead.

70
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,540
When I meet the clear-eyed,
my desire’s satisfied.

71
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,830
But look at them.

72
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,020
They’re merely ordinary girls.

73
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,180
How could they compare with you?

74
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,030
Your Highness.

75
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,030
Your eyes have just recovered.

76
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,180
Let’s go.

77
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,550
I’m Xiao Ce, the Crown Prince of Liang.

78
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,870
Greetings, Your Majesty.

79
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,300
Greetings, Your Majesty.

80
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,630
You may rise.

81
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,410
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

82
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,170
Why are you here, Ms. Chu?

83
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,370
Your Majesty, I was ordered

84
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,080
to protect His Highness.

85
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,070
Precisely.

86
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,060
She protects me.

87
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,140
But there is something dissatisfactory.

88
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,250
What is that?

89
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,730
Ms. Chu serves me

90
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,900
so well

91
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,850
that I won’t get used to the life

92
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,400
without her.

93
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,410
You have a fine sense of humor.

94
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,020
Do you not want to go back home

95
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,060
when you enjoy yourself here?

96
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,290
I really have a good time.

97
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,380
I feel better when staying here

98
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,220
than staying at home.

99
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,340
That’s not all right.

100
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,950
If your father knows that,

101
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,630
he will make trouble for me.

102
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,580
I’ve paid great attention

103
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,530
to the peace-making marriage

104
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,190
between your nation and ours.

105
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,960
When you entered the Palace,

106
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,300
you must have seen those girls.

107
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,230
Those girls with the fine clothes are

108
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,330
daughters of noble families.

109
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,060
Choose whoever you want.

110
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,040
Your Majesty.

111
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,690
My father decides

112
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,270
who I should marry.

113
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,410
Besides, my marriage concerns

114
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,030
the peace between our nations.

115
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,640
I don’t dare to make the decision alone.

116
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,260
But Your Majesty, I want someone.

117
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,680
May I ask you

118
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,080
for a personal bodyguard?

119
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,890
Hope you can fulfill my wish.

120
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,690
Who do you mean?

121
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,990
It’s her, Chu Qiao,

122
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,640
a coach of Cavalry Battalion.

123
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,020
What are you doing?

124
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,240
I’m asking for you.

125
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,810
Are you out of your mind?

126
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,980
Ms. Chu is the female coach
His Majesty selected,

127
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,950
regardless of old rules.

128
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,820
If she is given to you,

129
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,610
it will make our people

130
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,890
question our thirst for talents.

131
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,660
Your Highness, please understand.

132
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,880
Stop!

133
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,430
Me?

134
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:38,910
Of course.

135
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,990
Is this how you should talk to me?

136
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,960
Deputy Commander Yuwen.

137
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,740
Did I let you go?

138
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,310
Are you picking up a fight?

139
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,550
How dare you

140
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,080
talk with me like this?

141
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,700
Do you have a bad memory?

142
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,880
I nearly killed you for several times.

143
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,970
Is it strange to talk to you like that?

144
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,050
Well, you’ve changed.

145
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,630
When you play up to the Crown Prince,

146
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,300
you no longer show any respect

147
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,810
to me?

148
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,410
I have never respected you.

149
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,530
It has nothing to do with that idiot.

150
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,990
When I play up to him,

151
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,970
are you jealous?

152
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,020
If you are, go find him.

153
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,210
You look pretty, too.

154
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,760
Maybe, he will like you.

155
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,270
Luo He.

156
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,820
I saw your daughter

157
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,060
today.

158
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:46,310
I didn’t expect

159
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,520
to meet her again

160
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,190
like that.

161
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,090
But she didn’t recognize me.

162
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,140
Did she not dare to recognize me?

163
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,540
I really want to see her again.

164
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,320
However,

165
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,010
I’m afraid

166
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,400
she would expose my identity

167
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,310
and hurt my baby.

168
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,690
Luo He.

169
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,720
I will always remember

170
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,710
how you helped me.

171
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,340
But now I’ve married His Majesty

172
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,820
and I’m having my own baby.

173
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:28,980
A mother

174
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,020
could do everything

175
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,020
for her baby.

176
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,640
Luo He.

177
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,080
Should I meet your daughter again?

178
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,090
Your Highness, what do you mean?

179
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,600
You really have a crush on Chu Qiao?

180
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,860
What do you think?

181
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,670
It doesn’t make any sense.

182
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,550
You usually like busty girls

183
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,550
with sexy figures.

184
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:05,910
But Chu Qiao...

185
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,670
She is too skinny

186
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,000
just like a skeleton.

187
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,400
Will you really like her?

188
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,320
Is she really that poor?

189
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,600
Far more than this.

190
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,820
I feel she will be blown away

191
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,920
even when I sneeze to her.

192
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,550
I find her a good girl. Really good.

193
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,580
Your Highness,
a letter from Princess Xiao Yu.

194
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,380
She wrote me a letter?

195
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,130
Let’s go.

196
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,940
Where are we going, Your Highness?

197
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,780
Let’s go meet my sister.

198
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,760
- Brother.
- Sister.

199
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,880
When did you come to Chang’an?

200
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,380
I’ve just arrived.

201
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,920
Earlier, Father told me

202
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,910
you were not very well.

203
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,700
I thought you had gone to Ya Mountain
for recuperation.

204
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,110
I didn’t expect to meet you here.

205
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,530
Yeah.

206
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,880
Anyway, it feels the same to me

207
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,900
wherever I stay.

208
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,360
I have to do my job.

209
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,240
But look at you.

210
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,640
You must have a hard trip,

211
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,740
coming all the way.

212
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,870
You have a harder time

213
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,670
running the Secret Service.

214
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,920
Sister,

215
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,910
what brought you to Chang’an?

216
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,420
For some chores. Never mind.

217
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,820
What about you?

218
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,300
How is your visit?

219
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,080
What have you got?

220
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,590
How could local people

221
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,740
compare themselves

222
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,410
to our people?

223
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,860
They are too vulgar and coarse

224
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,850
to be looked at.

225
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,670
This nation is

226
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,010
quite different from ours.

227
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,840
Just take your time. Don’t rush.

228
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,850
Fine. If there is something
I can’t understand,

229
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,600
I will ask for your advice.

230
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:08,420
Your Highness,
when Princess Xiao Yu is here,

231
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,880
will there be any problem?

232
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,190
She’s such a cruel woman,

233
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,450
with countless evil tricks.

234
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,610
When she’s here,

235
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,130
she must be up to something.

236
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:21,400
But maybe,

237
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,230
she shares the same goal as mine.

238
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,890
Your Highness, why do I feel

239
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,740
you are also scolding yourself?

240
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,210
Tell everyone

241
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,890
to be cautious and careful.

242
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,780
Chang’an is her territory.

243
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,120
Since I’ve arrived,

244
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,610
she would feel sorry for herself

245
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,330
if she didn’t do anything evil on me.

246
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,140
Aye.

247
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,320
But we live in the Palace.

248
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,980
I don’t think she dares to act rashly.

249
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,930
You’re wrong.

250
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,190
After all the trouble,

251
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:50,890
we got out of Jiankang.

252
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,150
Without the restraint of my father,

253
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,810
I must teach her a lesson

254
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,940
in case my trip is wasted.

255
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,450
Your Highness, should we hide

256
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,690
or fight?

257
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,910
Guess.

258
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,500
Fight?

259
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,480
My Lady.

260
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,320
Does the Crown Prince really
come here for a visit?

261
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,630
The three-year period is due soon.

262
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,900
It’s over if Yan Xun dies.

263
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,340
If he gets out of Chang’an alive,

264
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,080
there must be a war

265
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,080
between the Wei and Yanbei.

266
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,310
How obvious it is!

267
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,630
Since I can see that,

268
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,920
so can Xiao Ce.

269
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,210
Either he or I

270
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,890
who can push this

271
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,340
will be praised and awarded by Father.

272
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,190
He has been trying

273
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,020
to take over the Secret Service

274
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,300
for a long time.

275
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:47,820
How will he miss

276
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,090
such a great opportunity?

277
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,760
The Crown Prince

278
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,580
also wants to make alliance with Yan Xun?

279
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:57,890
Almost.

280
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,910
Then why did he

281
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,890
want a maid

282
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:04,820
named Chu Qiao?

283
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,850
Everyone knows

284
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,350
Chu Qiao works for Yan Xun.

285
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,360
What he did today

286
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,780
exposed Chu Qiao

287
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,260
in front of everyone.

288
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,950
It means Yan Xun lost an assistant.

289
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,180
Doesn’t he fear Yan Xun will hate him?

290
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,440
He must have a backup plan, I guess.

291
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,780
Tell our men

292
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,650
to wait

293
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,220
for my order.

294
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,820
You’re going to...

295
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,870
Since he is here,

296
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,440
I’ll take some action against him.

297
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,520
If we manage

298
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,870
to get rid of Xiao Ce this time,

299
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,020
my brother will have the chance

300
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,510
to be the Crown Prince.

301
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,690
That would be perfect.

302
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,390
Your Majesty,

303
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,910
who is Chu Qiao

304
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,640
that came yesterday?

305
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,320
She is Yan Xun’s maid.

306
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,720
In early years,

307
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,150
she worked for the Yuwen family.

308
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,860
You stood up for her yesterday.

309
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,870
What?

310
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,220
You’re interested in her?

311
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,610
I just find her amazing

312
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,540
when she works in the army

313
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,680
as a girl.

314
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,840
Besides, the Crown Prince of Liang

315
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,490
looks like a real playboy.

316
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,840
I’m sure

317
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,190
he doesn’t like Chu Qiao with true heart.

318
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,180
I think

319
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,110
he asked for trouble deliberately.

320
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,250
Whatever.

321
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,760
Chu Qiao is

322
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,130
a useful girl.

323
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,740
Unfortunately,

324
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,870
she is only loyal to Yan Xun.

325
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,740
Otherwise, I could make her

326
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,360
your personal guard

327
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,870
for the sake that you helped her.

328
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,640
I don’t need anyone else to protect me.

329
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,680
Your Majesty,

330
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,810
all I need is your love.

331
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:21,890
By the way,

332
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,040
have you decided

333
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,960
who to marry the Crown Prince of Liang?

334
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,150
Only my daughter Yuan Chun

335
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,830
is of the right age.

336
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,810
But the Crown Prince of Liang

337
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,200
looks so frivolous.

338
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,680
Do you really want Princess Chun

339
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,900
to marry him?

340
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,440
The Emperor of Liang

341
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,680
only has two sons.

342
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,390
The other one has a humble mother

343
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,750
and he’s weak.

344
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,340
Therefore,

345
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,640
Xiao Ce is his father’s treasure.

346
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,360
Becoming the Crown Prince
at the age of six

347
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,120
makes him a noble man.

348
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,430
He is a playboy,

349
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,560
but that’s not big problem.

350
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,840
After marrying him,

351
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,510
Chun will be his legal wife.

352
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,930
When Xiao Ce becomes the Emperor,

353
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,870
she will be the Empress.

354
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,900
It brings no disgrace to her.

355
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,560
You’re right, Your Majesty.

356
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,090
Your Highness.

357
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,300
His Majesty told Concubine Lan

358
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,330
he would marry you

359
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,990
to the Crown Prince of Liang.

360
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,530
What?

361
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,240
Are you sure?

362
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,220
Yes.

363
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,840
Father will marry me

364
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,540
to Xiao Ce,

365
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,520
the playboy?

366
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,840
Yes.

367
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:00,940
Your Majesty,

368
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,840
the three-year period is almost due.

369
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,790
As you promised,

370
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,370
Yan Xun can go back to Yanbei.

371
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,780
In the past two years,

372
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,040
Yan Xun has been very careful

373
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,180
and respectful.

374
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,670
However, Your Majesty,

375
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,720
he is still a threat.

376
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,620
The more carefully he acts,

377
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,310
the more ambitious he is.

378
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,870
If we let him go,

379
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,920
there’ll be great trouble.

380
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,590
He is Yan Shicheng’s son, anyway.

381
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:32,330
I have spared him.

382
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,460
My people keep an eye on me.

383
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,010
Also, the Crown Prince of Liang has come.

384
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,240
Are you asking me

385
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,490
to go back on my words?

386
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,290
We can kill him in many ways,

387
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,970
for example, assassination or poisoning.

388
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,190
Anyway,

389
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,110
we mustn’t let him leave Chang’an, alive.

390
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,900
You and Wei Guang

391
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,820
tried many times.

392
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,830
Have you ever succeeded?

393
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,180
I am trying to help you, Your Majesty.

394
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,120
The problem is

395
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,260
even if he dies in an accident,

396
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,280
people will assume

397
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,000
I have him killed.

398
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,400
We must care for people’s gossip.

399
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,260
I don’t want to be an emperor

400
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,360
who can’t keep his words.

401
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,860
Shall we find an excuse

402
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,980
to arrest him?

403
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,130
An excuse?

404
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,300
He has been very careful these years.

405
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,820
If I could find an excuse,

406
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,490
I would have killed him a long time ago.

407
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,260
Then we need a plan

408
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,110
to make everyone think

409
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,120
Your Majesty have forgiven him

410
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,550
and will let him go back to Yanbei.

411
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:37,720
Then,

412
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,540
we’ll find a way to get rid of him.

413
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,450
A plan?

414
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,570
Your Majesty,
Princess Chun asked to see you.

415
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,180
Don’t you see

416
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,790
we’re in the middle of something?

417
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,030
Tell her to leave.

418
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,040
Her Highness insisted

419
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,070
she should see you today.

420
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:09,890
Otherwise,

421
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,840
she would keep kneeling outside the door.

422
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,660
What does she want?

423
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,290
Bring her in.

424
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:18,690
Aye.

425
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,760
I shall excuse myself.

426
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,730
There is no need.

427
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,690
I still have something

428
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,830
to discuss with you.

429
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,750
Thank you, Your Majesty.

430
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,920
Greeting, Father.

431
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,150
What do you come for?

432
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,610
Father, I don’t want

433
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:57,990
to marry the Crown Prince of Liang.

434
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,410
Who told you that?

435
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,870
Don’t be childish. Go back now.

436
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,050
Father.

437
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,250
If you never

438
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,260
had such a plan,

439
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,670
I would say thank you.

440
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,350
However,

441
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,020
if you do,

442
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,070
I’m telling you

443
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,210
I will never marry

444
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,770
the Crown Prince of Liang!

445
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,130
I won’t marry him

446
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,180
or anyone else!

447
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,460
I will

448
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,730
marry no one,

449
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,510
but Yan Xun!

450
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,150
Your Excellency,

451
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,840
we will leave here soon.

452
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,290
Recently, guards for us

453
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,350
have changed.

454
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,000
They are no longer those

455
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,710
who work for Prince Yuan Song.

456
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,330
The Emperor is going to kill me.

457
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,670
He is a hypocritical man

458
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,800
who values fame and wealth.

459
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,430
Envoys of Liang are still here.

460
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,150
In recent years,

461
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,970
we’ve spread the news to everyone

462
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,700
that you were spared

463
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,320
and will go back to Yanbei.

464
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,050
Even if the Emperor wants to kill you,

465
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,470
he doesn’t dare to do it in the public.

466
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,650
Looks like we are about to have the chance

467
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,510
to leave Chang’an.

468
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,720
So, be careful with food

469
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,220
and watch out for assassinators lately

470
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,910
in case the Emperor
takes desperate action.

471
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,450
But I think

472
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:55,990
the Emperor

473
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,500
will probably

474
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,790
show kindness to you

475
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,000
in order

476
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:02,060
to convince people

477
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,010
that he has kept his promise

478
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,200
and will let you live.

479
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,650
Then he will kill you by surprise

480
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,240
so that he can get away with it.

481
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,160
Show kindness to me?

482
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:11,600
The only way he can show the world

483
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,760
that he has kept his words

484
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,770
would be letting me go back to Yanbei.

485
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,820
Yet this is exactly the last thing
he would do.

486
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,480
Your Excellency.

487
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,430
Your Excellency,
someone came from the Palace,

488
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,450
saying His Majesty wanted to see you.

489
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,740
Greetings, Your Majesty.

490
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:45,600
Long live Your Majesty.

491
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,120
You may rise.

492
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,910
Thank you, Your Majesty.

493
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:59,500
Yan Xun, how are you doing lately?

494
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,310
Thanks to you, Your Majesty,
everything is fine.

495
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,030
You have focused on studying these years

496
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,660
and barely gone out.

497
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,200
You have become calmer.

498
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,660
Good.

499
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,770
You are going to govern a land

500
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,370
for me.

501
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,440
A general like you

502
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,960
should be calm.

503
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,310
Thank you, Your Majesty.

504
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:27,090
This year,

505
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,880
you’re twenty-two, aren’t you?

506
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,380
I’m twenty-three.

507
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,600
It’s an age to get married then.

508
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,330
Do you have anyone in mind?

509
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,130
No.

510
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,920
Before having achieved anything,

511
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,660
I don’t dare to get married.

512
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,080
People make up a family before work.

513
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,460
They usually get married first.

514
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,660
Your parents are gone.

515
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,180
I ought to take care of you.

516
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,020
Even if you don’t want to get married,

517
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,460
I still need to handle that.

518
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,950
Your Majesty, I…

519
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,190
Right.

520
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,100
I have someone suitable for you.

521
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,730
You and my daughter

522
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:11,050
grew up together.

523
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,210
You make a perfect couple.

524
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:17,420
She has a bad temper.

525
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,140
But she is kind

526
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,470
and polite.

527
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,970
I would be worried

528
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,480
if she married anyone else.

529
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,540
I watched it

530
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,480
when you grew up.

531
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,700
I can’t be relieved

532
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,370
unless I marry her to you.

533
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:42,660
Your Majesty, I am the son of a traitor.

534
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,750
It is your mercy

535
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,820
to let me live.

536
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,930
How can I expect to marry Her Highness?

537
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,430
Your Majesty, please take it back.

538
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,260
You don’t want that?

539
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,170
I’m not good enough for Her Highness.

540
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,810
I hear

541
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,590
you are

542
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:02,100
very close to your maid,

543
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,090
Chu Qiao.

544
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,670
Are you refusing to marry my daughter

545
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,180
because of her?

546
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,420
She not only

547
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,620
bewitches the Crown Prince of Liang

548
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,420
but also steals my future son-in-law.

549
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,000
How dare she!

550
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,980
Concubine Lan wanted to see me?

551
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,650
That’s right, Ms. Chu.

552
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:39,450
Please come to the Palace with me.

553
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:41,230
Her Grace is waiting for you.

554
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:42,800
Okay.

555
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:43,700
Please.

556
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,930
Your Majesty, that’s not true.

557
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,910
When my father committed the crime

558
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,150
and got my families killed,

559
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,550
I lost everything overnight.

560
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,190
It is because of your mercy

561
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,670
that I survived.

562
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,540
Over the past three years,

563
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,780
I have felt ashamed of

564
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,960
what my father did

565
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,140
and I have been depressed.

566
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,250
But she

567
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,280
kept me company

568
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,280
and encouraged me to cheer up.

569
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,280
To me,

570
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,770
she is not just a maid,

571
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,400
but more like a family.

572
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,020
Yet we don’t love

573
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:22,530
each other.

574
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,460
Father.

575
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,090
Your assumption is not true.

576
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,580
Don’t imagine things.

577
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,890
Yan Xun and I

578
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,190
have already engaged secretly.

579
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,420
Then why did he refuse

580
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,030
to marry you?

581
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,980
Because…

582
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,670
He’s just pretending.

583
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,440
He is just too shy.

584
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,170
Right, Yan Xun?

585
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,760
Oh, I see.

586
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,060
Good.

587
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,540
This is settled, then.

588
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,310
I’ll choose a day to get you married.

589
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,890
Thank you, Your Majesty.

590
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,460
You are Chu Qiao?

591
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,890
I didn’t see you clearly that day.

592
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,290
Raise your head.

593
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,790
Let me take a better look at you.

594
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:36,020
Chu Qiao, your mother is not coming.

595
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,590
Go to the Jing family.

596
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,020
We are surrounded right now.

597
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:39,920
Do what I tell you to

598
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,450
so that you can survive, got it?

599
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,560
Promise me.

600
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,310
No matter

601
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,340
what happens,

602
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,890
don’t come out, got it?

603
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:54,750
Take this beautiful girl back

604
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,010
to the camp

605
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,520
as a prostitute

606
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,970
so that we can enjoy her.

607
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,240
Let go of me!

608
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,460
Let go of me!

609
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,950
Let go of me!

610
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,330
Let go of me! Let go of me!

611
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,810
Let go of me!

612
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,850
Come over! Come!

613
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:14,720
Let go of me! Let go of me!

614
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,190
Let go of me!

615
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,630
Come on!

616
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,430
You look familiar to me.

617
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,460
You look like an old friend.

618
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,610
Many people look similar.

619
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,810
I’m afraid you get the wrong person.

620
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,540
Do you know Luo He?

621
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,630
No.

622
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,430
I like such stories

623
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,580
about the outside world.

624
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,440
I hear Luo He is a woman,

625
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,360
as tough as any man can be.

626
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,820
She is a wonderful woman, full of talents.

627
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,160
I know

628
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,060
you are a very impressive girl

629
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:05,880
as well.

630
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,400
I think you two are similar.

631
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,440
You flatter me, Your Grace.

632
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,550
Where are you from?

633
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,270
I am from the Jing family in Jingzhou.

634
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,570
Since you are from there,

635
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,780
why is your name Chu Qiao?

636
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,530
Because

637
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,130
I was a child

638
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:25,750
adopted by the Jing family.

639
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,650
As for my name,

640
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,150
I lost my memory

641
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,140
and I’ve forgotten a lot

642
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,130
about the past.

643
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,660
After I followed His Excellency Yan Xun,

644
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,700
I decided to throw away the past

645
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,510
and start everything again.

646
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,310
Who taught you martial arts?

647
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,660
Speaking of that,

648
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,460
Young Master Yuwen Yue

649
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,090
could be my instructor.

650
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,440
You little girl.

651
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,820
You’re so special.

652
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:00,570
I find you cordial.

653
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,120
Come and visit me often

654
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,720
so that you can talk to me.

655
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,010
Come on, stand up.

656
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,170
Thank you, Your Grace.

657
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,140
Achu?

658
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,750
Achu, why are you here?

659
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,870
Concubine Lan summoned me.

660
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,150
Concubine Lan?

661
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,830
You know her?

662
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:42,910
No.

663
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:45,710
Leave us.

664
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:46,440
Aye.

665
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:49,470
Achu.

666
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,790
I felt it strange

667
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,070
when she defended you last time.

668
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,350
She is a scheming woman

669
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,000
and inhospitable.

670
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,360
She became

671
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:01,300
my father’s favorite concubine

672
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,650
in just three years

673
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,820
and gave birth to a prince.

674
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,140
You know what?

675
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,350
I hear she works for Yuwen Huai.

676
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:11,810
She’s a daughter of the Yuwen family

677
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,500
born of a concubine,

678
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,820
but unwritten on the genealogy.

679
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,220
Yuwen Huai?

680
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,520
Yuwen Huai hates you so much.

681
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,780
How could his subordinate help you?

682
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,600
Achu, are you leaving?

683
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,450
Let me walk you out.

684
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,830
No, thanks.

685
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,010
I’m free, anyway.

686
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:42,810
I’ll walk you out.

687
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,530
Achu,

688
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,280
does anyone bully you?

689
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:48,680
No.

690
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,180
If anyone hurts you,

691
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:50,920
tell me.

692
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,830
Do not keep it to yourself.

693
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,980
I will find justice for you.

694
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,400
You will?

695
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,890
Sure.

696
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:00,890
Brother.

697
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:02,590
Chu Qiao?

698
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,980
Why are you here?

699
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,920
For your information, Your Highness,

700
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,100
Concubine Lan asked to see me.

701
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,260
Chun, why did Father

702
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,590
ask to see Yan Xun?

703
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:14,740
Brother.

704
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,460
Good news.

705
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:17,720
Today,

706
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,900
Father asked Yan Xun to get married.

707
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,940
Get married?

708
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,700
With whom?

709
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,660
Guess.

710
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,240
You look so happy.

711
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,520
Could it be you?

712
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,140
Yes, me.

713
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,390
In ten days,

714
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,490
I will

715
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,160
marry Yan Xun.

716
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,490
Ten days?

717
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,550
Why so hurry?

718
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,290
Because he is going

719
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,860
back to Yanbei soon.

720
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,370
Father wants us

721
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,900
to get married

722
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,850
before that.

723
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,670
Brother.

724
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:49,650
I am leaving for Yanbei, soon.

725
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,880
You won’t see me anymore.

726
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:53,820
Will you miss me?

727
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,620
Don’t sound like

728
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,820
you won’t ever come back.

729
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,130
Besides,

730
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,630
I can visit you in Yanbei.

731
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,050
You make sense.

732
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,580
Yan Xun told me

733
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,640
Yanbei was a beautiful place

734
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,120
with the bright blue sky
and endless grassland.

735
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,700
I will treat you nicely

736
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,050
when you come to Yanbei.

737
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,370
You haven’t gone there.

738
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,300
But you sound like

739
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,180
you’re a master.

740
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:20,300
Okay, I’d like to thank you now.

741
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,290
By the way, Chu Qiao.

742
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,170
The wedding is coming.

743
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,560
Time is running out.

744
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,520
I’ve got so many things

745
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,410
to do.

746
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:30,760
You’ve stayed around Yan Xun

747
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,930
for so many years.

748
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:33,300
You must know him very well.

749
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,390
What does he like or hate?

750
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:37,060
Tell me everything you know.

751
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,190
How about this?

752
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,730
I’ll ask Che

753
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,360
to send you here lately

754
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,850
so that you can help with my wedding.

755
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,510
She knows nothing about the wedding.

756
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,420
She can’t help you.

757
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,050
Why can’t she help me?

758
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,440
We are both girls.

759
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,320
Also, she’s capable.

760
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,550
She’ll do it very well.

761
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,220
Chun.

762
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,830
You have so many experienced maids

763
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:01,480
in your palace.

764
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,830
Why do you need her?

765
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:05,110
Well, I’ll give you

766
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,710
all my maids, all right?

767
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,190
- Wait, but...
- Just go

768
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,550
and stay with Yan Xun

769
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,670
for a chat.

770
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:12,820
We’ll leave you alone.

771
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,620
Your Excellency. Your Highness.

772
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,020
I’m leaving.

773
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,640
See you.

774
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:33,880
Achu.

775
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,320
If you feel terrible,

776
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,680
cry out.

777
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,640
What for?

778
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,970
Yan Xun is getting married.

779
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,700
You must be feeling sad.

780
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,560
He gets married sooner or later.

781
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,560
I am just a little bit surprised

782
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,680
to see him get married at this time.

783
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,740
You like him, don’t you?

784
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,890
He is the son of Marquis Dingbei.

785
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,760
I am just a civilian.

786
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,570
There is no relationship between us.

787
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,480
You mean you don’t like him?

788
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,990
Well, maybe,

789
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,750
you don’t like him.

790
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,580
But he likes you for sure.

791
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,190
Saw his face just now?

792
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,760
He even wanted to swallow my sister.

793
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,850
My sister is a little fool.

794
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:21,790
She doesn’t understand the situation

795
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:22,740
and insists on marrying him.

796
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,580
Well, anyway,

797
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,040
if you don’t like him,

798
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,320
why do you stay around,

799
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,010
take care of him and help him?

800
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,240
It doesn’t make any sense.

801
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,410
Because...

802
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,820
Because we’re the same kind of person.

803
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:46,810
Forget it.

804
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,140
You won’t understand, anyway.

805
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,300
Sound mystifying.

806
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,440
But,

807
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,070
when you don’t like him,

808
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,630
I’ll have a chance, won’t I?

809
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:07,750
A...

810
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,820
Achu.

811
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:14,280
Do you like me?

812
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:20,930
What? You like me?

813
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,360
Then tell me

814
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:27,880
how it feels

815
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,950
to like someone?

816
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,330
Like...

817
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,950
When I see you...

818
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,020
When...

819
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,950
When I see the girl I like,

820
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,890
my heart...

821
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:45,300
My heartbeat races

822
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,600
and my face flushes.

823
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,580
I want to talk to her,

824
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,910
but do not know what to say

825
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,110
to make her happy.

826
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:51,840
And...

827
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:54,020
When I can’t see her,

828
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,950
I miss her so much

829
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,930
that I can’t eat

830
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:59,360
or fall asleep.

831
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,040
I even think about her in my dreams.

832
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,500
Do you have such feelings?

833
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:06,890
Why do you sound

834
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,220
you’re badly sick?

835
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,280
That’s true.

836
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,190
It feels like I got sick.

837
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,890
I think...

838
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,460
This is the lovesickness.

839
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,760
I know you would run away.

840
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,940
I won’t let you run.

841
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,360
Answer me, first.

842
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,920
Let go of me!

843
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:29,710
No!

844
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,440
Let go of me!

845
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,270
Angry again? Don’t always be angry.

846
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,190
There she goes again.

847
00:38:55,620 --> 00:39:03,700
= Weipin Pavilion =

848
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,750
Xianwan. Xianwan.

849
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,140
Ajing has come again.

850
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,430
What a poor taste he has!

851
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,150
I wonder why he likes you.

852
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,870
I’m so beautiful.

853
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,700
He would like

854
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,820
every part of me.

855
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,430
He is a helpful hand

856
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,260
of His Excellency.

857
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,510
Look at that in his hands.

858
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,140
It’s a present for you, isn’t it?

859
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,890
I think he is good.

860
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:24,920
Do you like him?

861
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,480
He looks ugly and naive.

862
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,080
No one will like him.

863
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,150
Don’t you ever laugh at a man

864
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,290
that loves you.

865
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,530
When he no longer loves you,

866
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:36,810
he will be more mature than your father.

867
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,070
Incredible, Sixuan!

868
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:40,860
You sound so reasonable

869
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,390
these days!

870
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,020
= Weipin Pavilion =

871
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:54,800
He is gone.

872
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,670
Won’t you give her the present?

873
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,820
Seems like he isn’t too stupid.

874
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:02,510
He has straightened his thinking.

875
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,460
Why would he love

876
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,690
someone like you?

877
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,400
Just be jealous.

878
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,290
I’m not jealous at all.

879
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,740
What? They’ll get married.

880
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,210
Yes, it will be announced soon.

881
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,880
But time is running out.

882
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,050
Ministers of Rites

883
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,650
have started to prepare for the wedding.

884
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:25,750
How could His Majesty

885
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:26,790
marry Her Highness to Yan Xun?

886
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:27,800
He killed

887
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,270
Yan Xun’s whole family.

888
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:30,490
Yan Xun also saw his mother

889
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:31,610
kill herself

890
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:32,540
on Jiuyou Platform.

891
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:34,300
How can a wedding

892
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,290
relieve him

893
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,470
from such hatred?

894
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,010
If Her Highness marries Yan Xun,

895
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,560
she’ll never be happy!

896
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,330
Young Master Wei.

897
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,680
No, he can’t agree.

898
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,740
I’ll go see His Majesty.

899
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,730
He can’t do that.

900
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:48,590
Young Master Wei.

901
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,890
- Don’t be impulsive.
- Let go of me!

902
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:50,790
Do you want Her Highness

903
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,010
to hate you all her whole life?

904
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,840
I am just a little maid

905
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,000
who knows nothing.

906
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:56,840
But I have served Her Highness

907
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,160
since I was little.

908
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,170
I know

909
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:00,240
she always likes

910
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,180
His Excellency Yan Xun.

911
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:02,720
She wants to marry him.

912
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,380
That is her biggest dream.

913
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:07,250
Now her dream will

914
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:08,740
come true.

915
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,280
Young Master Wei.

916
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:11,490
Are you going

917
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:13,500
to break her dream?

918
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,550
But...

919
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:19,180
Yan Xun doesn’t like her!

920
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,780
Why are you so sure?

921
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,820
Even if that’s true,

922
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,650
she will still marry him.

923
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,220
No. No way!

924
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,040
Even if she hates me,

925
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,070
hits me, curses me,

926
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,030
or blames me,

927
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,810
I cannot see her

928
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:33,890
jumping into fire!

929
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,680
I must stop her!

930
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:37,850
Can you?

931
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,830
Young Master Wei.

932
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,900
Minister Wei Guang has passed away.

933
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,860
Your family is no longer as powerful.

934
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,600
Even Her Grace fails

935
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,820
to stop that,

936
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,190
do you think

937
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,220
you can stop them?

938
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:53,530
Young Master Wei.

939
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:55,870
I know you are nice to Her Highness.

940
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,230
But I also want you

941
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,310
to be nice to yourself.

942
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,320
If you really stop her,

943
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,020
I’m afraid

944
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,410
Her Highness will never

945
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:05,530
talk to you again.

946
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:07,800
It doesn’t matter.

947
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,860
Even if she never talks to me again,

948
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:12,820
it doesn’t matter.

949
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,270
I just want her

950
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,670
to be happy

951
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:19,530
and live a good life.

952
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,280
Even if I die for her,

953
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:25,090
I will feel relieved.

954
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:30,330
Young Master Wei, Her Highness understands

955
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,140
what you just said

956
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,320
and what you worry about.

957
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,210
But she still wants

958
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:37,940
to have a try.

959
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,210
She has loved him for so many years.

960
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:41,710
She can’t just let it go.

961
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,360
What if His Excellency Yan Xun

962
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,330
could let go of all hatred

963
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:46,370
and accept her?

964
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:38,150
You want to see me when it’s so late.

965
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,420
What happened?

966
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,870
I just want to see you.

967
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:43,920
Achu.

968
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,430
About the wedding
between Her Highness and me...

969
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:47,290
