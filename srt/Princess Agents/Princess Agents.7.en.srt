Tell me what happened.

Junior generals.

21
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,050
Your Majesty wanted to see you immediately.

22
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,310
What for?

23
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,980
For Rouran’s invasion.

24
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,510
Let’s go back.

25
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,320
Go.

26
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,870
Greetings, Prince Yu.

27
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,610
You may rise.

28
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,100
We, clansmen from Chang’an

29
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,930
come to ask His Majesty

30
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,500
to let us go to the boarder,

31
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,930
defending our country

32
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,140
and sacrificing ourselves for it.

33
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,400
What kind of clansman are you?

34
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,120
You don’t have any estate property in Chang’an.

35
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,540
Your Excellency Yan Xun.

36
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,170
You’d better leave.

37
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,630
Or others may suspect

38
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,470
you want to flee back to Yanbei.

39
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,690
Yan Xun grew up with us in Chang’an,

40
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,750
caring for our nation.

41
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,350
He’s our close friend.

42
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:32,990
Xifeng.

43
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,560
I think you’re thinking too much.

44
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,920
I’m a hostage.

45
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,860
But people in my hometown pledge
to be loyal to Wei.

46
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,280
We’re intimate friends

47
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,430
and closely related.

48
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,310
My families are loyal.

49
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,550
Today, I pledge to

50
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,730
bare my heart and serve my country.

51
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,570
If I have any wild fancy, I’ll be killed.

52
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,690
Junior generals.

53
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,600
We just got news from Yanbei.

54
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,950
Marquis Dingbei, Yan Shicheng

55
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,830
had fierce battles on the border for three days

56
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,540
before he finally defeated Rouran soldiers.

57
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,060
He promised to help with its snow disaster.

58
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,810
Chieftain of Rouran was convinced.

59
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,450
He said he would never invade the boarder

60
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,360
when the Yan family was around.

61
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,810
Your father Marquis Dingbei

62
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,390
is extraordinarily brave.

63
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,300
Young Master Yue, His Majesty summoned you.

64
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,090
Him alone?

65
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:20,770
Precisely.

66
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,920
Young Master Yue, please come.

67
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,700
Young Master Huai.

68
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,510
Yuwen Yue.

69
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,370
Noble Consort Wei

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,850
speaks very highly of you.

71
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,560
Oh, today,

72
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,870
I want to ask you personally

73
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,420
about the condition of

74
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,040
the Eye of Intel in your house?

75
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,190
For your information,

76
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,900
sixteen years ago,

77
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,560
the Eye of Intel

78
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,430
was decisively abandoned

79
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,830
because it failed to detect a spy.

80
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,980
Up to now,

81
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,340
it’s mostly hibernating.

82
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,150
Only some spies in the capital city

83
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,400
are used for the imperial palace.

84
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,930
But my master Mr. Ouyang

85
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,330
has been training recruits.

86
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,730
Once you need it,

87
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,020
the Eye of Intel

88
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,240
can fully restart

89
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,600
within three months.

90
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,490
Good.

91
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,480
Recently, I got a report that

92
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,360
Marquis Dingbei

93
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,340
opened the granary and relieved refugees

94
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,300
to win popular support.

95
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,180
All refugees

96
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,410
went to Yanbei,

97
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,760
reclaimed wasteland and settled down.

98
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,340
All this land belongs to you, Your Majesty.

99
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,630
When Marquis Dingbei rules wisely,

100
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,580
your kindness spreads all over the world.

101
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,550
I also hear...

102
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,570
I also hear that

103
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,840
Rouran retreated

104
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,830
because Chieftain of Rouran had secret dealings

105
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,310
with Marquis Dingbei

106
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,950
and Rouran followed Marquis Dingbei’s lead.

107
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,190
I want you to check if it is true

108
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,270
with the Eye of Intel.

109
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,260
I don’t want anyone

110
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,520
to usurp my power.

111
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,630
But I don’t think

112
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,890
the Yan family has evil ambitions.

113
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,950
You don’t think?

114
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:01,920
If we can distinguish traitors

115
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,040
by thinking,

116
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,960
why do I still need

117
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,830
the Eye of Intel?

118
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,620
Here come the imperial edicts.

119
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,040
For Yuwen Huai and Yuwen Yue.

120
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,170
Yuwen Yue shall take the commander’s tally

121
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,580
and lead the vanguard of imperial guards.

122
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,790
Thank you, Your Majesty.

123
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,660
Here is the imperial edict for Yuwen Huai.

124
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,360
This is a secret imperial edict for you.

125
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,030
I won’t announce it.

126
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,410
Thank you, Your Majesty.

127
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,230
Young Master Yue.

128
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,790
Imperial Concubine Wei asked to talk to you.

129
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,920
Greetings, Your Highness.

130
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,330
You may rise.

131
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,790
Thank you, Your Highness.

132
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,540
His Majesty told you exactly what he wanted.

133
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,190
Think carefully about it.

134
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,090
If you still don’t take action,

135
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,430
as far as I know,

136
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,150
the Eye of Intel

137
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,770
might belong to someone else.

138
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,280
Thank you for the instruction, Your Highness.

139
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,220
Let’s go.

140
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,950
His Majesty gave me a secret imperial edict,

141
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,180
asking me to get the evidence that

142
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,310
Marquis Dingbei wants to plot a rebellion.

143
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,010
This should be a rare chance.

144
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,650
But we can’t use the Eye of Intel.

145
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,630
How can we do

146
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,720
what His Majesty wants us to do?

147
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,480
Today, His Majesty gave the commander’s tally

148
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,000
to Yuwen Yue in front of me.

149
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,870
He also has the Eye of Intel.

150
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,170
We’ll be losing power,

151
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,390
visible or invisible,

152
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,090
won’t we?

153
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,350
Yuwen Zhuo was killed.

154
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,400
But nothing seemed to go wrong.

155
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,610
His Majesty wants to see

156
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,440
how loyal and capable we can be.

157
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,790
Our priority

158
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,220
is to get rid of

159
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,530
Yuwen Yue.

160
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,020
He has congenital cold disease.

161
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,460
In early spring every year,

162
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,310
he locks himself up for three days.

163
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,540
That will be the best timing

164
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,220
to kill him.

165
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,710
I have the bane for him, Jade Dog.

166
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,100
He’ll die.

167
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,950
The Jade Dog

168
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,780
won’t come and tell you

169
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,710
your enemy has been dead.

170
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,740
You should keep an eye.

171
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,430
You mean?

172
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:53,360
We can’t guarantee complete success

173
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,860
unless we have someone do it personally.

174
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,100
You make sense.

175
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,440
We need a secret killer

176
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,730
who does great martial arts

177
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,860
but has nothing to do with us.

178
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,590
In old years

179
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,760
when I could work for

180
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,740
the Eye of Intel,

181
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,900
I heard of a secret place,

182
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,380
Death Camp.

183
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,590
It specially trains cold-blooded assassins

184
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,950
with heartless

185
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,510
and brutal methods.

186
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,600
Many pending criminal cases

187
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,950
were done by assassins from Death Camp.

188
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,880
Because of its rule that

189
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,850
assassins succeed or die,

190
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,380
few people know about it.

191
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,690
How can we find it then?

192
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,190
Pay the highest price.

193
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,700
I see. Double kill.

194
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,670
Too mild.

195
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,130
Too strong.

196
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,350
Too hot.

197
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,880
Can’t you even make the tea?

198
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,200
Here are ten cups of tea.

199
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,070
Choose the cup you love most

200
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,080
and I’ll make it for you in the future.

201
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:25,200
Life is like a fleeting show

202
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,040
when you don’t have time

203
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,020
to choose it.

204
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,470
In danger,

205
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,320
you have only seconds

206
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,220
to judge right from wrong.

207
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,340
I think we must see

208
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,030
before we judge right from wrong.

209
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,350
A beautiful girl from the Western Regions?

210
00:13:58,930 --> 00:13:59,450
Oh, it turns out to be

211
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,820
an old man with a long beard.

212
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,110
When looked upside down,

213
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,250
even the gender changed.

214
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,630
What can you see?

215
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,330
The woman

216
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,550
seems to be in danger.

217
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,090
Are you sure?

218
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,100
Oh, someone is saving her.

219
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,360
But I don’t think

220
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,210
there are so many coincidences

221
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,320
in real life.

222
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,810
Once upon a time,

223
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,700
a master had three disciples,

224
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,850
Zong, Heng and Jian.

225
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,220
Who has the strongest martial arts

226
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,090
can inherit their master’s real power.

227
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,790
So, they competed.

228
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,260
Zong has a much stronger martial arts than Jian.

229
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,130
So, Jian had the intention to kill.

230
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,420
He brandished towards Zong.

231
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,950
The master was angry.

232
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,600
= Sun-blocking Sword Book =
This is the 72-Move Sun-blocking Sword

233
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,990
Jian used at that time.

234
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,850
Later,

235
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:27,030
Jian was expelled by his master.

236
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,590
Only Zong and Heng

237
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,140
stayed there?

238
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,180
I don’t know why,

239
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,780
but I feel a bit gloomy.

240
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,720
It makes no sense

241
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,710
when you feel gloomy.

242
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,290
But you’re right.

243
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,690
It’s your intuition,

244
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,030
I guess.

245
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,260
When Heng walked into Zong’s room,

246
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,590
he found Zong bathed in blood.

247
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,970
Was Zong dead?

248
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,510
Jian was expelled.

249
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,560
When Zong was dead,

250
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,650
only Heng had the motive to kill him.

251
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,430
Did Heng kill Zong

252
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:20,750
just because

253
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,570
he wanted his master’s power?

254
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,890
Are you sure?

255
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,360
Look again with this.

256
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,420
Oh, when Jian brandished his sword,

257
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,540
he hid a silver needle below it.

258
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,550
He hurt Zong with the needle.

259
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,670
The silver needle pricked Zong’s waist

260
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,270
inside his red belt.

261
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,510
The tight red belt

262
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,960
stopped him from bleeding.

263
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,970
Zong felt the pain.

264
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,080
But he thought it was a scratch

265
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,370
and thought nothing of it.

266
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,240
After getting back to his bedroom,

267
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,870
he took off his coat

268
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,790
and blood splattered.

269
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,750
When Heng walked in,

270
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,310
Zong had been dead.

271
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,610
Do you think this was a coincidence?

272
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,540
It wasn’t.

273
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,260
It was Jian’s arrangement.

274
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,350
He wanted to get rid of Zong and Heng.

275
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,000
The point is

276
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,110
what people want you to see

277
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,010
and how much you can see

278
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,290
with your ability.

279
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,070
You must understand.

280
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,000
The critical moment is always

281
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,250
between right and wrong or life and death.

282
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,990
Having an insightful mind

283
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,150
matters more than eyes.

284
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,150
So, it was really Yuwen Yue.

285
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,350
Young Master, were you also

286
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,560
at the human hunting ground that day?

287
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,260
= Qingshan House =

288
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,790
Xiaoqi.

289
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,330
Xiaoliu, you freaked me out.

290
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,470
Come with me.

291
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,050
What are you doing?

292
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,310
Don’t you know

293
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,390
where we are?

294
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,500
What were you doing there?

295
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,330
I...

296
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,320
I wasn’t doing anything.

297
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,760
I’m on duty today.

298
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,750
And I come here to prune trees

299
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,400
and take out weeds.

300
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,630
Tell the truth.

301
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,050
How long have you been

302
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,360
digging a crack on the wall?

303
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,240
I only dig it

304
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,790
when no one else is around.

305
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,650
I do it in no more than half an hour

306
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,180
every time.

307
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,030
Oh, Xiaoliu.

308
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,320
I hear

309
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,620
Yuwen Yue locks himself up for three days

310
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,010
on the third solar term every year.

311
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:34,760
He’ll be the weakest

312
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,820
in the three days,

313
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,590
right?

314
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,590
Why do you ask?

315
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,020
Nothing.

316
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:44,000
I just want to dig a hole and let the wind in

317
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,940
so that he’ll get colder

318
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,710
when he’s sick.

319
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,530
Don’t you know

320
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,750
Yuwen Yue sees through everything?

321
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,440
If he finds it, you’ll be certainly punished.

322
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,390
Stop risking your life.

323
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,780
Xiaoliu, you’ve changed.

324
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,020
How?

325
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,200
In your eyes,

326
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,490
there used to be light of revenge.

327
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,690
But now there’s nothing.

328
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,070
Does he puzzle you

329
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,310
and do you no longer want to kill him?

330
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,340
I want that.

331
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,510
But we shouldn’t act rashly

332
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,910
before we find out the truth.

333
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,310
You saw him kill Linxi,

334
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,660
didn’t you?

335
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,300
Seeing is believing.

336
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,730
Why do you still hesitate?

337
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:15,960
Xiaoqi.

338
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,200
What we see with our eyes

339
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,350
may not be the truth.

340
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,870
Don’t worry. I’ll find it out soon.

341
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,180
But before that,

342
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,750
we mustn’t alert the enemy.

343
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,200
Stop acting wildly.

344
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,160
Otherwise we would be dead

345
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,730
if anyone found that, got it?

346
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,940
Go.

347
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,500
Liar.

348
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:52,810
Everything is settled.

349
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:53,800
Okay. Go.

350
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,390
Aye.

351
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,430
Young Master.

352
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,090
Is everything as usual in Qingshan House?

353
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,740
Just like every period this year,

354
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,820
it’s heavily guarded

355
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,680
by Yue Guards.

356
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,170
Rest assured to lock yourself up.

357
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,230
Leave me.

358
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,570
Aye.

359
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,320
Death Camp?

360
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,840
Who is the target?

361
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,540
One hour later,

362
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:56,670
someone will pass by.

363
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,860
A Swift Spy?

364
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,590
You really have well-informed source.

365
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,330
Only the master of the Eye of Intel

366
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,010
can open the intel

367
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,040
from Phosphorescent Arrow.

368
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,520
Aren’t you making futile efforts?

369
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,910
Who told you I wanted the intel?

370
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,340
This is a rare treasure.

371
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,700
It’ll certainly bring out

372
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,530
Yuwen Yue’s cold disease.

373
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:28,920
Remember.

374
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,300
Use the same old way.

375
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,150
Use someone else.

376
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,530
Aye.

377
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,470
What are you coming for?

378
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,290
According to Young Master,

379
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:17,000
whoever breaks in without being summoned

380
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,020
will be killed.

381
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,680
Why are you so rude?

382
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:20,920
Do you think

383
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,650
I want to see your cold face?

384
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,880
Lady Dowager from the Third Branch

385
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,460
knew Young Master was in recuperation

386
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,990
and she asked me to bring this to him.

387
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:29,600
She said it would help with his recuperation.

388
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,360
Lady Dowager from the Third Branch?

389
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:37,220
Well, I don’t want to embarrass you.

390
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,640
Why don’t you

391
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,390
give it to Young Master Yue?

392
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,630
Has it been checked?

393
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,860
It’s such a valuable thing.

394
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,520
How can I get it in

395
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,810
before it’s checked?

396
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,250
All right. Give it to me.

397
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,970
If someone holds the Jade Dog

398
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,530
when she has no inner force,

399
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:08,210
cold air will go into her internal organs

400
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,210
and she’ll die suddenly.

401
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:10,820
Xing’er.

402
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,580
Hope you’ll hold it for longer.

403
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:13,900
I’ll kill Yuwen Yue

404
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,470
with your help.

405
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,750
And then, you can also die.

406
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:28,920
Miss Xing’er.

407
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,360
What do you come for?

408
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,470
It’s a gift

409
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,650
from Lady Dowager of the Third Branch.

410
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,550
Young Master is locking himself up.

411
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,330
No one is allowed in for the moment.

412
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,290
Stay and wait.

413
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,190
Okay.

414
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:55,630
Xiaoba.

415
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,040
Yueshisan.

416
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,850
I bring you the wormwood to drive away mosquitoes.

417
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,420
Thank you.

418
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:03,920
May I

419
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,500
have a word with my sister?

420
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,180
Go ahead.

421
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:12,670
Xiaoliu.

422
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,750
Why do you have pale lips?

423
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,820
Maybe the Jade Dog is too cold.

424
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,750
But...

425
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,180
it’s a great thing to relieve summer heat.

426
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,480
Where did you get it?

427
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,040
From Jinzhu.

428
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,230
Go back.

429
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,900
You can’t stay here for long.

430
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,220
Fine, then.

431
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,540
Why do I feel so cold?

432
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,520
But I also feel my internal organs

433
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,650
burning like fire.

434
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,960
Report. Obsidian Signal Arrow showed up

435
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,280
2.5 kilometers away from us.

436
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,880
We must go and help.

437
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:28,830
Yueshisan!

438
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:29,510
Here.

439
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,370
Protect Young Master.

440
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:30,960
Aye.

441
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,670
Gather our men and go with me.

442
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,580
You guys, come.

443
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,330
Aye.

444
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,880
What are you doing here?

445
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,510
I...

446
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,990
You come to the forbidden zone stealthily.

447
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,010
Lock her up.

448
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:10,750
Aye.

449
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:11,730
Go.

450
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:12,580
Let go of me!

451
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,340
Go.

452
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,620
Why do you catch me?

453
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,020
Doomed. We’re trapped.

454
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:56,780
Handle the dead body.

455
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,680
Aye.

456
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,480
There’s noise. Let’s go and see.

457
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,860
Stop.

458
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,330
Who sent you?

459
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,830
Xing’er! Xing’er! Xing’er!

460
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,640
Xing’er! Xing’er!

461
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,370
Xing’er! Xing’er!

462
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,560
Xing’er! Xing’er!

463
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:44,490
Xing’er! Xing’er!

464
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,810
Young Master.

465
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,510
Young Master, are you alright?

466
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,050
Sorry, I was so reckless

467
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,910
that I made Qingshan House defenseless.

468
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:23,870
Young Master.

469
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,720
Young Master? Yueqi.

470
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,800
Death Camp?

471
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,420
Death Camp?

472
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,330
Yueshisan! Check throughout Qingshan House!

473
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,010
Aye.

474
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:09,610
Young Master.

475
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,240
You were hurt

476
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,240
by seven-step-death snakes.

477
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,210
Luckily, you’re cured in time

478
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,830
and you have inner force.

479
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,390
That was just close.

480
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,690
This is panacea for venin.

481
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,150
Take it

482
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,800
and you’ll recover.

483
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,280
Thank you.

484
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:00,730
All of them are suspicious

485
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:02,260
and must be interrogated one by one.

486
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,120
I know nothing.

487
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:04,920
Let me go.

488
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,520
We have nothing to do with that.

489
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,280
It must be Xing’er.

490
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:10,400
She’s the personal maid for Young Master.

491
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,100
Only she takes care of him

492
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,180
and only she can

493
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,720
get into his bedroom.

494
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,500
Who said that?

495
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,250
Maybe you sneaked

496
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,730
into Young Master’s bedroom.

497
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,130
Jing Xiaoba.

498
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,080
How dare you to get me wrong

499
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,010
without evidence

500
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:23,840
in front of so many people?

501
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:25,300
Fine.

502
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,700
Let me say something

503
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,800
that everybody knows

504
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,870
in Qingshan House.

505
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,390
Linxi poisoned Elderly Master

506
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:34,620
and was executed by Young Master in public.

507
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,320
Young Master was kind enough

508
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,400
to let you go.

509
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,500
Unexpectedly, your families

510
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,730
are all ungrateful guys!

511
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,600
Nonsense!

512
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,280
My sister was holding the Jade Dog

513
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,070
for you.

514
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,550
How could she

515
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,750
release the snakes?

516
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,490
Well, but you could help her,

517
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,310
couldn’t you?

518
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:59,170
Yueqi, they must be chief instigators

519
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,930
to hurt Young Master.

520
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,080
Catch them.

521
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:02,910
Nonsense!

522
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:03,700
Shut up!

523
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,780
Jing Xiaoqi was sneaky.

524
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,790
She was the most probable suspect.

525
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:09,860
Keep a close eye on her.

526
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,910
I’ll go check the Jade Dog.

527
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:12,450
Aye.

528
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,600
Xiaoqi.

529
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,810
Physician, please check it.

530
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,040
There is extreme coldness

531
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,390
in this jade dog.

532
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:31,590
People will be hurt

533
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,500
unless they have

534
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,510
inner force.

535
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,010
When a normal guy holds it,

536
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,000
the cold toxin will get into

537
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,170
his internal organs.

538
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:38,630
Hurry.

539
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,790
Take it away.

540
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,220
Young Master has cold disease.

541
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,450
If he gets close to it,

542
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:44,790
he’ll die.

543
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,200
Come and take it away.

544
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:46,890
Aye.

545
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:53,460
Sneak attack, snakes, and Jade Dog.

546
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,240
Chains of traps.

547
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,180
How about this?

548
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,650
I’ll write out ten more prescriptions

549
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,580
to remove the coldness from you

550
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,060
so that you’ll be safe.

551
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,060
Thank you.

552
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,390
Physician.

553
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,490
I’d like you to

554
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,290
check on someone else.

555
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,160
Young Master Yue.

556
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:47,760
I’m a clansman at least.

557
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,980
My clan degenerated.

558
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,230
But I shouldn’t be

559
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,930
curing a maid.

560
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,660
Young Master Yue.

561
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,290
Why do you humiliate me like this?

562
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,080
See you.

563
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:58,690
Wait.

564
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,850
Clansman?

565
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,650
Today, I can make you

566
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,180
no longer a clansman,

567
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,020
but a slave.

568
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:13,280
You... You’re overwhelming me with your power.

569
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,120
Precisely.

570
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:50,660
This maid seems to have a normal physique.

571
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:52,130
But inside her body,

572
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:54,630
there’s terrible inner force.

573
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,380
Do you know what kind of inner force?

574
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,210
It’s so strong that I’ve never heard of it.

575
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:03,350
I’m afraid she was badly hurt

576
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:05,180
years ago

577
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,880
so that the terrible inner force

578
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,300
was sealed in her body

579
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,430
and she can’t use it.

580
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:12,410
But once she uses it,

581
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:14,460
she can’t control it.

582
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:16,220
Just like now.

583
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:17,930
Her face

584
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,600
looks like burning in fire.

585
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:21,270
In less than half a day,

586
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:23,240
she’ll die of heart burning.
