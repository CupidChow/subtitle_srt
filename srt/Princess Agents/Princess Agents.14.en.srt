= Episode 14 =

16
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,240
He had Empress Dowager make the imperial edict

17
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,910
to ask Yan Xun to go back to Yanbei in advance.

18
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,560
My intention was known.

19
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,940
Summon

20
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,050
warlord of Zhao and warlord of Wei.

21
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,510
I have important matters to discuss with them.

22
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,400
Aye.

23
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,150
Wait.

24
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,870
Yuwen Xi is clueless.

25
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,040
Most likely he won’t understand my words.

26
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,550
Don’t summon him.

27
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,690
Your Majesty, should I summon Yuwen Huai

28
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,980
or Yuwen Yue?

29
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,780
Yuwen Huai.

30
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,720
Aye.

31
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,100
Your Majesty.

32
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,660
People from Yanbei are here to pick up Yan Xun.

33
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,060
Guess who it is?

34
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,950
Who is it?

35
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,540
Marquise Dingbei comes here in person.

36
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,590
Bai Sheng.

37
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,470
Bai Sheng is in poor health.

38
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,560
I’m sure you know it, Your Majesty.

39
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,130
She has traveled thousands of miles
here to see her son.

40
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,030
Your Majesty,

41
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,270
you won’t let her down, right?

42
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,820
Bai Sheng

43
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,590
is the adopted daughter of Empress Dowager.

44
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,890
You can accompany her

45
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,500
on behalf of me.

46
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,970
Yes, Your Majesty.

47
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,650
Bai Sheng.

48
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,920
Guess who I am.

49
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:04,780
Where’s your brother?

50
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:05,960
Tell him to meet me.

51
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,540
I’m the one who wants to meet you.

52
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,750
Hadn’t I claimed that

53
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,860
my brother wanted to see you,

54
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,390
would you have come to see me?

55
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,340
I don’t know what you are

56
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,420
busy with every day.

57
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,720
By the way,

58
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,640
Yan Xun,

59
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,690
look at my outfit.

60
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,520
It’s my new dress.

61
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,210
What do you think? Do I look pretty?

62
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,380
Pretty! Really pretty!

63
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,360
Your glamor

64
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,630
dazzles me.

65
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,730
You keep being narcissistic.

66
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,540
I’m going to see the doctor.

67
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,520
Yan Xun!

68
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
I have something important

69
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,640
to tell you.

70
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,710
Sit down!

71
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,950
Take it easy.

72
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,740
It’ll be my Coming-of-age Ceremony

73
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,080
one month later.

74
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,540
Then?

75
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,780
Then.

76
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,900
Then I have a lot of things

77
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,660
to do.

78
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,540
Like...

79
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,190
I need to prepare ceremonial robe,

80
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,420
my hair decorations,

81
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,710
rites and music.

82
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,670
And I need to confirm

83
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,410
the list of guests.

84
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:02,820
And...

85
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,040
Their food and drink.

86
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,890
I need to personally

87
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,470
go through every detail.

88
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,440
Also,

89
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,290
my crown.

90
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,000
The crown is the most significant thing.

91
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,360
Anyway,

92
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,120
I’m going to hold

93
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,960
a most interesting

94
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,760
and elegant Adult Ceremony

95
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,980
that will go down in history.

96
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,970
You should.

97
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:23,970
You deserve it.

98
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,170
But Yan Xun,

99
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,930
I can’t finish all those things

100
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,620
by myself.

101
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,670
So you need to stay with me,

102
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,240
and help me make plans.

103
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,450
Yes,

104
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,430
I should do these things.

105
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:37,890
But,

106
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:38,750
Empress Dowager

107
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,900
has promised my mother

108
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,910
that I must return to Yanbei as soon as possible.

109
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,440
You are leaving Chang’an?

110
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,880
In ten days.

111
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,250
Ten...

112
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,930
All good things must come to an end.

113
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,280
I don’t want you to leave me.

114
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,400
We can meet again in the future.

115
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,820
Meet again?

116
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,900
How many years later?

117
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,400
One year? Two years?

118
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,210
Or longer?

119
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,110
Why are you crying?

120
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,630
I don’t want you to leave.

121
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,820
Yan Xun, please don’t leave me.

122
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,080
Why are you crying harder?

123
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,000
Don’t cry.

124
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,180
I hate to part with you.

125
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,110
Look at yourself.

126
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,590
What are you doing?

127
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,190
You are making fun of me.

128
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,670
I’m not.

129
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,700
Crying is a remarkable skill.

130
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,740
I admire you.

131
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,820
I admire you.

132
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,530
I admire you.

133
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,950
You are making fun of me!

134
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,220
Look how sad I am.

135
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,030
Fine.

136
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,800
I will come back some day.

137
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,050
I don’t care about that.

138
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,720
You mustn’t leave.

139
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,650
Let’s go.

140
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:10,620
Where are we going?

141
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,950
You’ll see.

142
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,700
Did His Majesty really say that

143
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,350
with Marquis Dingbei guarding the north,

144
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,750
he felt reassured?

145
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,670
He did.

146
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,400
His Majesty also said that

147
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,690
he was lucky to have
Marquis Dingbei defeat the enemy

148
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:27,310
when Rouran invaded our territory a while back.

149
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,030
His Majesty thinks highly of Marquis Dingbei.

150
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,010
It’s Shicheng’s duty

151
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,900
as a courtier and brother.

152
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,060
Marquis Dingbei is always on expeditions.

153
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,670
Your life must have been hard.

154
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,230
It’s my destiny.

155
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,250
Luckily, Empress Dowager pities me,

156
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,720
and has promised that I can take Yan Xun with me.

157
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,780
Yes.

158
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,430
Empress Dowager is very fond of Yan Xun.

159
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,980
By the grace of His Majesty and Her Grace,

160
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,030
Yan Xun is taken good care of.

161
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,460
In his letter,

162
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,400
he talks a lot about

163
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,910
how joyful he is here.

164
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,000
If this place brings him so much joy,

165
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,610
why does he want to leave?

166
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,120
Your Majesty.

167
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,940
I don’t know Your Majesty is here.

168
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,070
Sorry for my rudeness.

169
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,340
Bai Sheng,

170
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,000
after so many years,

171
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,140
you are still you.

172
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,980
You haven’t changed a bit.

173
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,630
You’re making fun of me.

174
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,770
We grew up together.

175
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:34,940
Now,

176
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,310
our children are grown-ups.

177
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,770
How can I stay the same?

178
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,920
I’m old.

179
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,250
But you

180
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,980
still look young

181
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,090
and graceful.

182
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,490
Sit.

183
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,360
Aye.

184
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,000
Aye.

185
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:00,090
Your Majesty, you age fast
because you attend to numerous affairs every day,

186
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,450
and care about the nation.

187
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,310
You know that I care about the nation,

188
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,670
but you still have to take Yan Xun away.

189
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,550
You’re putting me
in a difficult position, aren’t you?

190
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,240
Your Majesty,

191
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,470
Shicheng is on years of expeditions.

192
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,810
He’s really tired.

193
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,700
And in recent years,
he suffers from recurrence of old injuries.

194
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,940
His ability falls short of his wishes.

195
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,480
And he misses Yan Xun very much.

196
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,970
I’m thankful for Marquis Dingbei’s hard work.

197
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,880
Yan Xun is a grown-up now.

198
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,720
He’d better come home for education

199
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,230
sooner than later

200
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,200
so that he can better guard the border

201
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,490
for you, Your Majesty,

202
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,240
and solve your problems.

203
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,600
I know that you Yan Household is loyal.

204
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,880
However,

205
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,150
there are many hostages in Chang’an City.

206
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,120
If Yan Xun goes back,

207
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,640
then other hostages

208
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,220
also plead me for leaving.

209
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,240
What should I say to them?

210
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,050
Yes,

211
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,480
the hardest thing is to

212
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,800
silence the gossip among common people.

213
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,720
Bai Sheng,

214
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,640
please understand His Majesty.

215
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,830
Don’t worry.

216
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,380
I won’t make things difficult for His Majesty.

217
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,680
His Majesty,

218
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,530
please allow me

219
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,720
to stay in Chang’an.

220
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,690
You... You want to stay in Chang’an?

221
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,190
Yes.

222
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,090
Arise.

223
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,890
I’m happy to hear that

224
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,660
you are going to stay here.

225
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,670
However...

226
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,920
Father.

227
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,270
Father.

228
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,190
Father.

229
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,040
Father. Mother.

230
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,740
Your Majesty.

231
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,790
Your Highness.

232
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,750
Mother.

233
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,190
Chun, you are a big girl now.

234
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,190
It’s mannerless of you

235
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,170
to run around like this.

236
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,280
OK, get up.

237
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,390
Aye.

238
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,610
Mother,

239
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,680
I have something important

240
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,670
to tell you.

241
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,370
Ms. Bai Sheng,

242
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,730
please let Yan Xun

243
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:34,900
stay in Chang’an for one more month.

244
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,760
How about he attends my Coming-of-age Ceremony

245
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,200
before he goes back?

246
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,800
Good idea.

247
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,210
That’s what we are going to do.

248
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,270
Your Majesty, you just said that...

249
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,100
You two

250
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,380
can both stay in Chang’an.

251
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,200
You can stay in

252
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,170
Empress Dowager’s palace, Bai Sheng.

253
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,550
After Yan Xun attends

254
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,060
Chun’s Coming-of-age Ceremony,

255
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,940
he shall return to Yanbei at once.

256
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,300
Thank you, Father.

257
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,480
Mother.

258
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,350
Did I ruin

259
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,800
your plan just now?

260
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,320
If His Majesty doesn’t want you to leave,

261
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,030
he will find some other excuses anyway.

262
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,310
Luckily,

263
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,450
it’s only one month.

264
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,390
After the princess’s Coming-of-age Ceremony,

265
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,930
you set off for Yanbei immediately.

266
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,570
You will leave soon.

267
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,480
Do you have any attachment for this place?

268
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,190
What are you trying to say, Mother?

269
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,050
I mean, someone?

270
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:54,930
Do you have any

271
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,580
attachment for someone here?

272
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,350
It seems

273
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,480
Chun likes you a lot.

274
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:02,730
She?

275
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,370
She’s just like my sister.

276
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,610
She’s too young,

277
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,620
and knows nothing.

278
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,770
Her Coming-of-age Ceremony is one month away.

279
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:10,840
She’s not that young.

280
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,870
Speaking of attachment,

281
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,550
there is someone

282
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,570
that I can’t let go of.

283
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,920
To be a hero, you should aim high

284
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,410
and go for it.

285
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,990
Drink the wine and be outspoken.

286
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,290
You are right.

287
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,910
I do aim high.

288
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,700
But judging from the look on your face

289
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,360
when you speak,

290
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,060
you are not talking about a friend.

291
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,710
Is it possible that my son

292
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,340
has fallen in love with someone?

293
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,160
No. No.

294
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,710
My son is a big boy now.

295
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,430
You are being shy.

296
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,600
Don’t make fun of me, please.

297
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,470
If you really like her,

298
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,740
you can tell me.

299
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,180
I’ll see what I can do.

300
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:15,950
Mother.

301
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:17,850
If...

302
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,790
If...

303
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,870
I mean if...

304
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,890
There’s this girl,

305
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,750
whose status

306
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,870
is different from ours.

307
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,620
Then, I...

308
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,770
Silly boy, you must be into her

309
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,420
instead of her status.

310
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,190
Mother, you see right through me.

311
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,620
I’m going to wait for her

312
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,620
to say yes.

313
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,160
And then we’ll go back to Yanbei together.

314
00:14:58,890 --> 00:14:59,960
Princess.

315
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,920
Princess, what’s wrong?

316
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,180
You looked alright just now.

317
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,460
Who upsets you?

318
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,860
What are you talking about?

319
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,780
I’m not upset.

320
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,310
I’m happy.

321
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,650
I’m delighted.

322
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,300
You… You cried.

323
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,580
= Qingshan House =

324
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,150
It was supposed to be a smart move that
Bai Sheng went to rescue her son,

325
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,450
but Yan Xun has squandered

326
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,530
his mother’s painstaking effort.

327
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,750
Man proposes, God disposes.

328
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,860
The one who disposes is not God,

329
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,990
but a girl.

330
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,040
Yan Xun chose to stay not because of the Princess,

331
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,050
but for the maid.

332
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,560
How could a wise man like you

333
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,090
not know that?

334
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,070
When a chess piece is useful,

335
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,980
you keep it.

336
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,280
When it’s not, you throw it away.

337
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:13,440
Aye.

338
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,790
The latest intelligence from Yue Guards is

339
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,980
that the spies of Liang

340
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,980
have already known

341
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,500
that the Emperor is scheming against Yanbei

342
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,730
and has sent their top

343
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,560
female spy

344
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,760
to infiltrate Wei.

345
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,770
So you want her to pry for it, don't you?

346
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:27,810
Yes, I do.

347
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,150
It’s very important,

348
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,910
and she is just a maid.

349
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,010
Are you sure that she is qualified for this?

350
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,640
She’s gifted

351
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,420
and was trained by me personally,

352
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,440
so I am sure she can do this.

353
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,760
Ridiculous.

354
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,120
Does that lowborn maid of Yuwen Yue’s

355
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,080
deserve the hard work of

356
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,740
Death Camp soldiers?

357
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,200
Sorry, my bad.

358
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,340
Have you got

359
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,610
the banquet that I asked for ready?

360
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,600
I have invited two beautiful musicians

361
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,630
to liven things up for you.

362
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,600
Preparations are under way.

363
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,550
Why haven’t you got everything done yet?

364
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:11,740
Useless.

365
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:13,990
Remember to invite every Young Master

366
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,990
of all the powerful warlords.

367
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,680
The most important thing is

368
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,910
you have to invite Yuwen Yue.

369
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,620
Do you hear what I am saying?

370
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,700
I don’t understand why he must be invited.

371
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,320
Cut the crap.

372
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,440
Leave us.

373
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,420
Can’t you see I’m in the middle of something?

374
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,410
Five steps northeastward.

375
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,590
I smell the clove.

376
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,290
Three steps northwest.

377
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,280
Logwood.

378
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,000
It’s pointless no matter

379
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,810
how good a nose you have.

380
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,770
If you are blind, you just can’t see.

381
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,070
In Qingshan House,

382
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,800
a useless chess piece is a basket case.

383
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,270
When I get my eyesight back,

384
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,490
you will be the basket case.

385
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,920
Young Master.

386
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,070
How do you know it’s me?

387
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,760
I smelled the fragrance on you,

388
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,700
Young Master.

389
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,820
Did you hate me

390
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,160
for hurting your eyes?

391
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,360
I just don’t believe

392
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,590
that Young Master would hurt me.

393
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,380
But being blind has a good side.

394
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,000
Now that I’m blind,

395
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,430
the bad guy that I don’t want to see

396
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,690
can’t see me as well.

397
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:19,620
Out of sight, out of mind.
Out of sight, out of mind.

398
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,180
Then you’ll be disappointed.

399
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,610
Am I right?

400
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:45,350
Young Master is the worst.
Young Master is the worst.

401
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,520
Xing’er likes him. Xing’er likes him.

402
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,430
Cangwu Bird.

403
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,290
Where did you get the pearl in your mouth?

404
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,290
My...

405
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,720
My... My eyes

406
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,630
seem like...

407
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,400
Now, you can see everything

408
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,350
very clearly

409
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,540
no matter how small it is.

410
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,900
Thanks to Huatuo Water.

411
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,860
Huatuo Water?

412
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,610
The water

413
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,470
has fixed and improved your eyes.

414
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:19,740
Now you can see the things

415
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,990
that ordinary people can’t see.

416
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,680
To you, the dark night is as bright as

417
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,080
the day.

418
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,620
= Qingshan House =

419
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,430
The Huatuo Water I used on you

420
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,260
is to prevent the shadow from covering the light.

421
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:56,240
What kind of shadow it would be?

422
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,920
The person who disturbs your mind

423
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,550
or obstructs you from your target

424
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,260
is the shadow.

425
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,360
There is a banquet tomorrow.

426
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,700
At that time, your eyes,

427
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,730
your ears and brain

428
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,110
will be functioning at full capacity.

429
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,430
You need to remember everything

430
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,550
and everyone

431
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,870
including all the details and sound.

432
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,650
Don’t waste my Huatuo Water.

433
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,500
Please trust me, Young Master.

434
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:16,510
Your Excellency.

435
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:17,910
Do you really think

436
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,390
that Xing’er will go with you?

437
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:22,290
In spite of the long journey
and all the diversities,

438
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,710
I will take Xing’er

439
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:24,690
back to Yanbei.

440
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,060
Your Highness.

441
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,930
Only you two?

442
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:47,980
The others

443
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,540
are waiting for you inside.

444
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,430
Chun, what’s matter with you?

445
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,350
You are the star of the banquet,

446
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,630
yet you are the last one to come.

447
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,780
- I’m the last one to come
- Stop.

448
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,220
just because I am the star...

449
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,180
Your Highness.

450
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,560
How is that?

451
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,350
What’s the point of coming early?

452
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,910
The one who is supposed to be here hasn’t come.

453
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,830
You’re talking about Yuwen Yue, right?

454
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:24,830
It’s alright.

455
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,290
The Qingshan House is just across the road.

456
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,990
Who cares about that Cold Ice?

457
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:29,920
Who are you talking about then?

458
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:30,900
You...

459
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,360
Your Highness.

460
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,190
Behave yourself.

461
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,030
I have some precious gifts

462
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,800
for your Coming-of-age Ceremony

463
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,770
one month later.

464
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,610
Are you satisfied with them?

465
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,440
Such precious gifts.

466
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,900
My eyes are

467
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,040
dazzled by them.

468
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,420
Even the maids use better

469
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,440
jewelry than these.

470
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,190
What’s with the smirk on your face, Zhao Xifeng?

471
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,720
Your smile is as hypocritical

472
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,310
as you are.

473
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,310
Chun, it’s too much.

474
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,150
Am I hypocritical?

475
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,620
I am so honest.

476
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,610
How could you say I am hypocritical?

477
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,260
Honest?

478
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,450
On the surface,

479
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,830
you call all the Young Masters
around Chang’an your mates.

480
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,910
But behind their backs,

481
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,210
you always speak something bad and evil

482
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,010
of them.

483
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:26,850
And you often tell

484
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:28,800
your aunt, Countess Concubine Zhao, about them.

485
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,200
You just want her

486
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,800
to let my father snub

487
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,090
and dislike them.

488
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,830
Is it true?

489
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:40,570
Your Highness, please stop talking.

490
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,560
You are about to be adult soon

491
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,640
after your Coming-of-age Ceremony.

492
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,610
You should learn to be magnanimous

493
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:45,800
and restrained.

494
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,130
Restrained?

495
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,910
What does it mean?

496
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,080
Cousin,

497
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,590
why did you say

498
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,760
that you never wanted to be the royal son-in-law

499
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,780
in front of Zhao Xifeng,

500
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,020
while behind his back,

501
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,830
you keep having my aunt

502
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,810
send gifts to me secretly?

503
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,480
What does this mean?

504
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,270
Uh...

505
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,300
Chun.

506
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,390
You’ve gone too far.

507
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,780
What you are doing will hurt the friendship

508
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,540
among the Five Handsome.

509
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,720
I’m the Princess of Wei.

510
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,940
If there’s anything that I’m not happy with,

511
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,310
I have every right to point it out.

512
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,150
And you, as the Prince,

513
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,530
ought to do better than me.

514
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,260
You...

515
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,710
Okay. Fine, fine.

516
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:24,150
So why are you

517
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,060
keen on following us to

518
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,750
every gathering of ours.

519
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,970
Because...

520
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,810
Of what?

521
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,060
Me?

522
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,490
Because of you.

523
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,650
Because of you, my brother.

524
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:36,980
That’s why I must tag along.

525
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,810
You’re glib-tongued, aren’t you?

526
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,510
This sounds good.

527
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,180
I’m just joking around.

528
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,350
But to be serious, brother.

529
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,330
I have something to get off my chest
and if I don’t do it today,

530
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,060
I will never get another chance.

531
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,420
Why?

532
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,410
I won’t tell you.

533
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,380
You…

534
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,960
Don’t be embarrassed.

535
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,220
I know your sister.

536
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,330
She is just frank and outspoken.

537
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,090
So don’t feel awkward.

538
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,560
You know my sister?

539
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,680
Are you kidding me?

540
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,810
Don’t take it to your heart.

541
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:09,830
Don’t take it to your heart.

542
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:15,820
= Qingshan House =

543
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,180
Young Master Yue, it’s been a long time.

544
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,860
Wouldn’t you mind

545
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,970
if I talk with the Wild Kitten for a while?

546
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,180
Wild Kitten.

547
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,310
May I help you, Your Excellency.

548
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,670
Let me tell you some good news.

549
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,150
I’m about to go back to Yanbei soon.

550
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,520
Aren’t you a hostage?

551
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,110
How could you just go back at your will?

552
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,300
Go back at my will?

553
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,340
His Majesty has given his permission.

554
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,050
But,

555
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,380
it’ll be a relatively long journey

556
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,630
back to Yanbei.

557
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,790
If you need anything during the journey,

558
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,310
like something you wanna eat or use,

559
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,980
just let me know so that I can prepare in advance.

560
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,130
Thank you for your concern, Your Excellency.

561
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,840
Xing’er needs nothing.

562
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,920
It’s about time for us to leave.

563
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:10,150
Aye.

564
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,390
Your Excellency, excuse us.

565
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,190
Young Master Yue.

566
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:21,850
Have a good trip.

567
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,710
What a coincidence. I’m heading that way, too.

568
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,670
Good trip for us all.

569
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,760
Your Highness, shall we begin?

570
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,500
It’s on.

571
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,520
Begin.

572
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,130
Everyone’s eyes

573
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:53,090
are almost out.

574
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,060
What is Yan Xun doing?

575
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,240
He’s still not here.

576
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,630
Taoye

577
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,270
is very famous in Luoyang City.

578
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:13,710
Xifeng.

579
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:17,030
Did you ever get a chance with her?

580
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,200
Here.

581
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,720
What’s wrong with your Young Master?

582
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,230
Is he frozen?

583
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,470
Stop. Everyone, just stop!

584
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,750
They’re doing a good show. What now?

585
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,050
This banquet is held

586
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,150
in honor of me.

587
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,710
Then it should be elegant and dignified.

588
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,720
What kind of obscene music

589
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,940
they are playing?

590
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,210
Is someone trying to

591
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,020
be seductive or what?

592
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,750
Just wait outside.

593
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,410
How could this be obscene music?

594
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:56,810
I think it sounds great.

595
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,720
You... How dare you?

596
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,710
It’s all because of you!

597
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:02,990
Can’t believe you say something like that.

598
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,850
Stand down. All of you.

599
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,230
I don’t want to watch the show.

600
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,850
Please calm your anger, Your Highness.

601
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,350
Could you please allow me to speak?

602
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,650
The music we were playing

603
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:15,640
is not meant to be obscene.

604
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,850
Who are you?

605
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,440
Get out and answer my question.

606
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:20,810
Aye.

607
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,600
Your Highness, I’m Fangqin.

608
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,380
I’m the private tutor of Taoye,

609
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,250
I teach her music and poetry.

610
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,810
What we were playing just then is

611
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,710
Picking the Lotus From the River.

612
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,130
It derives from the Yuefu Poetry in the past,

613
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,960
which was how people used to
kill time in the Palace.

614
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,790
So it’s not obscene music

615
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,110
that you claimed to be, Your Highness.

616
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:00,770
So what do you mean?

617
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,650
Are you saying that I’m so ignorant

618
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,830
that I blame you wrongly?

619
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:05,840
No.

620
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:08,170
What I just said

621
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,760
is to explain the music.

622
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,330
- Fangqin
- Music?

623
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,520
is very good at music

624
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,390
and very skillful.

625
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,390
Just now, I saw your

626
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:20,060
nimble moves and graceful footwork.

627
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,490
And it seems like you have practiced Light Foot

628
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,890
and are quite proficient at it.

629
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,270
You overpraised me, Young Master.

630
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:33,550
I have practiced some skills,

631
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,930
but I was just dancing.

632
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,070
Maybe it’s similar to

633
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,870
the Light Foot that you talked about.

634
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,650
Come on, Your Highness.

635
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,720
She is just a musician.

636
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,140
If you don’t like her,

637
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,440
just send her away.

638
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:52,820
There is no need to be angry.

639
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,850
Just beg me.

640
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,500
Forget it.

641
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,550
You just get out of here.

642
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:03,650
To be honest,

643
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,570
it’s not your problem.

644
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,090
Thank you, Your Highness.

645
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,860
Why does her fragrance

646
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:45,560
smell so familiar?

647
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,870
If you like it,

648
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,130
you can have it.

649
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:52,160
Thank you.

650
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,360
Young Master, come here.

651
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:30,850
Taste it.

652
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,190
Young Master Huai.

653
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,370
My master

654
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,480
has a message for you.

655
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,520
He’s not feeling well.

656
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,930
So he has gone home for some rest.

657
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,580
Don’t chase after her.

658
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:58,820
Excellent!

659
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,450
This is the best dance I’ve ever seen.

660
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:15,760
It’s weird.

661
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,280
Where is Yuwen Yue?

662
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:21,730
He’s not feeling well, so he went home.

663
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,770
We...

664
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:24,770
We are so absorbed in the wonderful show

665
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,230
that we didn’t even notice that

666
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,450
Yuwen Yue was gone.

667
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,550
Right.

668
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,730
Your eyes were fixated on them.

669
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:36,380
Be quiet.

670
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,580
Young Master, what’s on your mind?

671
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:55,970
I’m thinking

672
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:58,130
if I should kill you.

673
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,100
Young Master,

674
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:03,300
what… What did you say?

675
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,150
Here

676
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,000
is core of

677
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,790
the Eye of Intel.

678
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,400
If intruders break in,

679
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:14,590
we must kill them,

680
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,360
in case that our secret is given away.

681
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,640
Young Master,

682
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,030
you are the one that asks me

683
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,110
to follow Fangqin.

684
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,240
I’m just obeying your order.

685
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,410
Why must you kill me?

686
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:46,780
Only the spies of Qingshan House

687
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,410
are qualified to come here.

688
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:52,920
There are two options for you.

689
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,890
Be a spy of the Eye of Intel,

690
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,200
