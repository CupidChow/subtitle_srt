this flag represents

the greatest stigma of your entire army.

Cheng Yuan.

You better

give that flag back!

Kill!

26
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,440
Your Highness.

27
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,420
What’s the matter?

28
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,510
What did Mr. Wu do wrong?

29
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,010
Why is he arrested?

30
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,900
Wu Daoya?

31
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,520
Yes.

32
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,660
He misled the public

33
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,370
and hindered the troop
from collecting grains.

34
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,280
Are they felonies?

35
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,120
After the flood in Lancheng,

36
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,240
those grains

37
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,020
are everything they have to eat.

38
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,260
He didn’t check with me

39
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,790
and incited people to rebel.

40
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,440
How could I still keep him around?

41
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:03,550
Your Highness,

42
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,420
Mr. Wu made a great contribution
to Yanbei.

43
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,870
He is a close friend to your father.

44
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,510
When your family was falling apart,

45
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,180
and those rich lords in Wei State

46
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,770
were coveting Yanbei,

47
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,510
it was Mr. Wu

48
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,870
who kept Yanbei intact.

49
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,650
When you were imprisoned in Chang’an,

50
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,300
it was Mr. Wu who helped you get out.

51
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,940
He set up Xianyang Chamber of Commerce

52
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,100
to raise money for Yanbei.

53
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,850
Without him,

54
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,930
Yanbei would’ve already been ruined.

55
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,040
Your Highness.

56
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,640
Wu Daoya did all that.

57
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,980
Your Highness.

58
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,880
Please forgive him this time.

59
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,050
Your father

60
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:34,900
would be disappointed

61
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,200
if you killed his close friend.

62
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,880
Get him out of Yanbei.

63
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,830
Thank you, Your Highness.

64
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,230
I’ve made an exception,

65
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,310
but not again.

66
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,290
Aye.

67
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,270
Your Highness!

68
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,670
They are rebels now!

69
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,450
Your Highness.

70
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,920
Xiuli Army betrayed us again.

71
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,140
I went to them

72
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,330
to pass your order

73
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,350
and told them to

74
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,290
guard Xiuli Mountain.

75
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,300
But they were disobedient

76
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,330
and refused to follow your order.

77
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,010
They demanded to see Chu Qiao,

78
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,930
claiming they’d only obey her order.

79
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,220
I reasoned with them

80
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,600
that you are in charge of Yanbei.

81
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,230
As soldiers in your army,

82
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,020
they ought to obey your order.

83
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,200
Even Chu Qiao

84
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,430
must follow your lead, too.

85
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,350
They attacked us.

86
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,400
I have arrested

87
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,320
all of them.

88
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,120
Your Highness, how should we punish them?

89
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,550
I gave them a chance,

90
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,680
but they pushed their luck.

91
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,830
Kill them all.

92
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,430
Aye.

93
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,770
Miss. Miss.

94
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,920
Miss.

95
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,550
A lady gave me

96
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,770
a letter.

97
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,810
She said it was from

98
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,090
a man.

99
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,490
Here it is.

100
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,360
Xing’er, Xiuli Army is in trouble.

101
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,700
They need your help now.

102
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:12,760
Miss.

103
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,560
What’s going on?

104
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,450
You are quite an impressive troop indeed.

105
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,970
Are you plotting another rebellion?

106
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:25,980
Your Highness.

107
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,220
We are not rebels.

108
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,300
We offended General Cheng

109
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,760
only to protect our flag.

110
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,710
Please forgive us.

111
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,390
I can’t.

112
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,480
The moment you

113
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,110
betrayed Yanbei,

114
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,300
Xiuli Army

115
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,750
no longer existed.

116
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,790
Why do you still need the flag?

117
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,840
Right now,

118
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,290
you battled

119
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,970
His Highness’s personal guards

120
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:53,810
for a piece of cheap fabric.

121
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,470
Punishment must be given

122
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,480
to uphold the military law.

123
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,570
Your Highness,

124
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,120
it’s not like

125
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,270
what General Cheng said.

126
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,420
There’s more to it.

127
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,720
Please don’t jump to conclusions.

128
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,200
Pass my order.

129
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,600
All those who attacked

130
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,740
the Black Eagle Army

131
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,240
shall be executed.

132
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,510
Whoever disobeys my order

133
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,230
will be punished the same.

134
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,250
Your Highness!

135
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,270
Your Highness.

136
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,400
If you insist on punishing us,

137
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,870
just punish me alone.

138
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,690
Please.

139
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,390
Commander He.

140
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,610
You’re a decorated general,

141
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,820
unlike those traitors

142
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,960
of course.

143
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,230
Your Highness.

144
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,840
I know

145
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,560
Xiuli Army

146
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,940
made a huge mistake before.

147
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,840
But after the battles in Chang’an,

148
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,870
and Hongchuan,

149
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,690
we have proven

150
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,650
our loyalty with blood.

151
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,770
Heaven and earth are the witnesses.

152
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,020
Your Highness.

153
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,650
Why are you still

154
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,600
doubting us?

155
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,740
How dare you!

156
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,960
Who do you think you are?

157
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,900
Is that how you talk to His Highness?

158
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,930
You failed to discipline
your soldiers properly.

159
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,390
His Highness didn’t punish you for that.

160
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,510
Now, you’re challenging His Highness.

161
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,500
That’s unbearable!

162
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,050
Your Highness. If you punish us,

163
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,400
aren’t you afraid of

164
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,880
losing our loyalty

165
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,550
as well as all the others’?

166
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,770
Take him away.

167
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,500
General.

168
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,270
Your Highness.

169
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,550
Even those Wei soldiers who surrendered

170
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,980
have a place here.

171
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:58,740
Why do you keep

172
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,440
coming at us?

173
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,880
Why must you get rid of us?

174
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,570
Your Highness,

175
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,450
this is unfair!

176
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,250
This is unfair!

177
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,370
See?

178
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,280
Aren’t you rebels?

179
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,470
Stop.

180
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,350
He Xiao.

181
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,600
I’m only punishing those

182
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,290
who betrayed me.

183
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,600
It has nothing to do with

184
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,640
others in the Xiuli Army.

185
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,250
I suggest

186
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,830
you stay out of this.

187
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,380
Otherwise,

188
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,090
I will punish you

189
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,610
for disruption.

190
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,310
We are not rebels.

191
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,410
We were only protecting the flag.

192
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:45,650
Your Highness,

193
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,350
I can vouch for them with my own life

194
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,490
that each and every one of them

195
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:50,940
is loyal.

196
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,840
Hadn’t Cheng Yuan crossed the line,

197
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,710
we would’ve never acted like that.

198
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,220
You must follow orders.

199
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,310
No excuses.

200
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,500
Only the result matters.

201
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,160
If everyone makes excuses,

202
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,670
how am I supposed to lead this army?

203
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,140
Your Highness.

204
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,720
Pass my order.

205
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,470
All those who attacked

206
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,690
the Black Eagle Army

207
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,000
shall be executed.

208
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,630
Whoever disobeys my order

209
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,150
will be punished the same!

210
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,760
Your Highness.

211
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,720
Stop!

212
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,280
Miss Chu.

213
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,930
Miss Chu.

214
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,410
Is this how you lead the army?

215
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,400
The flag and the designation

216
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,070
stand for our honor and lives.

217
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,540
As long as the flag stands,

218
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,880
the troop will never die.

219
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,940
I did order you

220
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,930
to keep the flag and the designation.

221
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:57,760
But did I ask you to

222
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,150
attack our own people?

223
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,590
Not only didn’t you admit your mistake,

224
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,170
but you also offended

225
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,290
His Highness.

226
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,860
What were you thinking?

227
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,610
Aye.

228
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,620
I was wrong.

229
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,670
I wasn’t

230
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,120
strict enough with my people.

231
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,670
Can’t you be flexible?

232
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,030
Your Highness.

233
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,630
What happened today is all my fault.

234
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,390
I gave them that order.

235
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,410
He Xiao and the others

236
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,790
were simply following it.

237
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,390
I am not well enough recently

238
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,150
to watch over them

239
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,080
so that they made

240
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,190
such a huge mistake.

241
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,840
I shall be punished.

242
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,830
If I remember correctly,

243
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,640
you hold no official post in the army.

244
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,820
Since when does the Xiuli Army

245
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,900
answer to you?

246
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,700
Shut up!

247
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,300
I am talking to His Highness.

248
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,960
Who are you to interrupt us?

249
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,200
Your Highness.

250
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,520
Xiuli Army is lawless.

251
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,980
They ought to be punished.

252
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,580
But as the general guarding Hongchuan,

253
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,880
they reported directly to me.

254
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,950
They didn’t dare to disobey my order.

255
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,350
Please

256
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,620
punish me for my negligence

257
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,920
and be lenient with them

258
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,180
as they guarded Hongchuan

259
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,660
with their lives.

260
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,760
I’ll take full responsibility

261
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,600
for Xiuli Army’s mistakes.

262
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,420
Xiuli Army?

263
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,780
There’s no longer such an army.

264
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,830
That designation

265
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,660
has been abolished.

266
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,450
No traitors are allowed in Yanbei!

267
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,620
The return of Xiuli Army

268
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,060
was approved by Your Highness.

269
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,500
The King of Yanbei

270
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,870
always keeps his words.

271
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:48,660
The past

272
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,010
is the past.

273
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,080
Yet you still

274
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,260
call them traitors.

275
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,770
Aren’t you making His Highness

276
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,210
contradict himself?

277
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,630
Your words show your evil intentions.

278
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,000
You are more like the spy of Wei.

279
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,560
Miss Chu,

280
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,120
you’re sharp-tongued.

281
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,280
The flag and the designation

282
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,150
concern the honor of the whole troop.

283
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,170
Xiuli Army was established

284
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,300
by the late Marquis.

285
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,070
How could it be abandoned so easily?

286
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,070
General He and his troops

287
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,630
followed Your Highness all the way

288
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,230
from Chang’an to Yanbei.

289
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,360
They have survived numerous battles

290
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,510
and made incredible achievements.

291
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,050
At the gate of Hongchuan,

292
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,600
they routed the enemies more than once

293
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,940
and killed Yuan Qi.

294
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,070
How could you

295
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,100
cancel their designation

296
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,350
and destroy their flag?

297
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,100
His Highness is busy.

298
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,670
The crooked must’ve

299
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,700
taken this chance

300
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,280
to sow discord among us.

301
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:47,140
That’s despicable and unforgivable!

302
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,080
You are slandering me!

303
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:53,460
Cheng Yuan.

304
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,390
One more step,

305
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,410
I will make you pay with my life!

306
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,070
You bastard!

307
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,830
I will kill you!

308
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,110
Take him down!

309
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,740
How dare you wield your sword
in front of His Highness!

310
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,660
Is this your so-called loyalty?

311
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,870
Let me go!

312
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,590
Achu.

313
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,610
Who called you here?

314
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,200
No one.

315
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,740
I came here myself.

316
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,840
Go back.

317
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,650
This isn’t your business.

318
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,520
Yanbei’s business is also mine.

319
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,910
I am a member of the army

320
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,630
and the general of Xiuli Army.

321
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,390
I should be responsible
for my men’s mistakes.

322
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,660
Do you know what you are doing?

323
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,740
Of course I do.

324
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,050
Are you acting against me?

325
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:53,990
I wouldn’t dare.

326
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,410
I am just

327
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,690
taking responsibility for my troop.

328
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,470
Your troop?

329
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,090
Miss Chu has been removed
from her post for sickness.

330
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,470
She’s not the general
of Xiuli Army anymore.

331
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,120
The crime Xiuli Army committed

332
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,440
has nothing to do with others.

333
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,600
Execute them!

334
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,590
Your Highness!

335
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,390
Get up, Miss Chu.

336
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,170
Don’t bother yourself

337
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,450
about our business.

338
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,470
Go back.

339
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,520
Death penalty is too much.

340
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,780
They followed you everywhere.

341
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,320
Their loyalty is beyond doubt!

342
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,460
Achu.

343
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,570
Be honest with me.

344
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,920
Who does the Xiuli Army

345
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,080
pay allegiance to?

346
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,540
I can vouch for them with my life

347
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,380
that everyone in the Xiuli Army

348
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,240
is completely loyal to you.

349
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,120
If they have even the slightest intention

350
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,300
of rebellion,

351
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,740
I, Chu Qiao,

352
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,800
shall be shot

353
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,220
into pieces and die.

354
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,240
Are you betting your life on it?

355
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,980
Yes, I am.

356
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,350
Except for you,

357
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,660
who else is willing to do the same?

358
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,490
No one believes them

359
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,130
other than you.

360
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,070
Please take back your order.

361
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,910
Go back, Miss Chu.

362
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,950
We should take responsibility
for what we did.

363
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,900
Death isn’t my concern for years.

364
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Your Highness!

365
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:01,910
Do it!

366
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,440
No!

367
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,170
No, Yan Xun!

368
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,590
No!

369
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,560
No!

370
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:21,990
No!

371
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,350
He Xiao was loose with his men.

372
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,850
Take him away. Flog him eighty times!

373
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,020
She must be heartbroken.

374
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,080
I suppose.

375
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,450
But she is strong.

376
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,350
She left without hesitation.

377
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,380
Young Master, if you feel sorry for her,

378
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,020
why didn’t you help her?

379
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,380
If I showed up,

380
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,640
things would only

381
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,840
become worse.

382
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,410
You could’ve taken her away.

383
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,500
She might not go with me.

384
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,870
Why?

385
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,670
She is so unhappy there.

386
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:46,830
Yes.

387
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,870
As unhappy as she is,

388
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,160
why hasn’t she left?

389
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,320
Achu.

390
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,840
Are you still awake?

391
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,930
Ever since you came back,

392
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,310
we haven’t had a chance to

393
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,740
sit down and chat.

394
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,360
Lately,

395
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,010
I’ve suddenly begun to miss

396
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,620
those days in Chang’an.

397
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,570
How ironic!

398
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,370
I hated that place

399
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,410
so much,

400
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,750
but now, I think of it

401
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,950
all the time.

402
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,520
I think of the first time we met.

403
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,290
I think of how you protected me
with your life

404
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,010
on the Jiuyou Platform.

405
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,360
I think of our time together

406
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,720
in prison

407
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,780
and in the Oriole Courtyard.

408
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,630
Achu.

409
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,500
I’m sorry.

410
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,410
I broke your heart.

411
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,260
But I had no choice.

412
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,500
I’ve sworn

413
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,770
that I’ll give you the best life.

414
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,600
I’m going to make Chang’an

415
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,250
and the whole world yours.

416
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,270
Maybe that’s not what you want,

417
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,280
but it is the best

418
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,610
that I can give you.

419
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,970
As for the Xiuli Army,

420
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,130
I was being lenient enough

421
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,830
to let them leave.

422
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,470
But they...

423
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,850
Achu,

424
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,960
the last thing I want to see is

425
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,560
that you get hurt.

426
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,820
Yet I did it anyway.

427
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,500
But

428
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,670
others can leave me,

429
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,900
but you can’t.

430
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,090
Others can betray me,

431
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,460
but you can’t.

432
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:48,650
Achu, all I have is you.

433
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,250
Yan Xun.

434
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,030
Too bad, we’ve been on separate paths.

435
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,320
General.

436
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:24,620
You aren’t allowed to drink

437
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,870
after taking the medicine.

438
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,720
In the past,

439
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,250
I could keep fighting for two days

440
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,740
even if my stomach was cut open.

441
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,340
Now, I can’t drink

442
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,970
because of a scratch?

443
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,250
We’re getting fragile!

444
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,560
After knowing

445
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,240
we set

446
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,140
the Xiuli Army up,

447
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,410
she rushed back to

448
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,690
save those rats.

449
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,880
Luckily, His Highness supported us.

450
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,220
But

451
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,690
as long as that woman is alive,

452
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,850
we will be

453
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:56,600
on the chopping block

454
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,880
sooner or later.

455
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,980
Given that His Highness stopped her

456
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,170
from harming General Cheng,

457
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,820
His Highness is still

458
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,110
on our side.

459
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,810
Not at all!

460
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,160
He hated the Xiuli Army, too.

461
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,720
Or would he still help us?

462
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,080
Men can never resist beauties.

463
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,720
Once they make up,

464
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,660
if she has a chance,

465
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:19,030
she’ll kill us all.

466
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,900
Still we are all on the same side.

467
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,300
If we can talk things out,

468
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,820
maybe we can turn things around.

469
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,300
Miss Chu

470
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,900
is not unreasonable.

471
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,780
Right.

472
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,860
Enough of the bullcrap!

473
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,870
Don’t belittle ourselves

474
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,750
to massage her ego.

475
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,800
Who does she think she is?

476
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,540
As a woman,

477
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,380
her job is to reproduce

478
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,970
instead of coming out

479
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,110
to battle.

480
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,660
How noble

481
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,990
His Highness is!

482
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:50,840
What exactly does he see

483
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,020
in that shrew?

484
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,180
Watch your language.

485
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,990
If that gets out,

486
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,770
you will be the first one

487
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:57,890
His Highness kills.

488
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,590
I won’t live long anyway.

489
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,160
I don’t care.

490
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,390
If I die,

491
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,200
I will be able to

492
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,610
reunite with Sun He

493
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:07,270
in hell.

494
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,040
Shut up!

495
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:09,720
Get out, all of you!

496
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,310
Your Highness.

497
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,720
Rise.

498
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,120
Thank you, Your Highness.

499
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,570
Cheng Yuan,

500
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,070
I took your side earlier,

501
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,150
but

502
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,670
that does not mean

503
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,040
I know nothing about

504
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,130
what you did.

505
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,990
I’m warning you again.

506
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,410
The conflict between me and Achu

507
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,430
is our

508
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,440
own business.

509
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,650
Do not interfere.

510
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,230
Understand?

511
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,370
Yes.

512
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:10,730
Go back to rest.

513
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,430
Your Highness.

514
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,280
Do you know

515
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,750
what our soldiers said about you?

516
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,490
They said you ignored the big picture

517
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,510
for a woman

518
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,350
and handed the world on a plate to others

519
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,630
that was right at your fingertips.

520
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,840
Sooner or later,

521
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,040
you’d end up like your father

522
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,310
and die a miserable death.

523
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,930
Being alive isn’t that joyous

524
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,900
and death may not be that bad.

525
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,700
I hope we can end the war soon

526
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,860
for the sake of the public.

527
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,390
I have suggested that to Father.

528
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,090
Father.

529
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,820
I’ve made

530
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,050
tons of mistakes in my life.

531
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,080
If you think a truce

532
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,830
is the best choice,

533
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,420
then go for it.

534
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:10,130
Aye.

535
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,600
Father has agreed to the truce.

536
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,850
As for Yanbei,

537
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,470
please see to it.

538
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,560
Other than that,

539
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,470
there’s something else you should know.

540
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,190
Yuan Chun

541
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,990
committed the capital crime.

542
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,110
But she’s still my little sister.

543
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,370
I don’t want her to die.

544
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,620
= Imperial Cosmetics Manufacturer =

545
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,700
Princess, people from the palace

546
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,030
are outside.

547
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:42,850
How dare you!

548
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,040
On your knees!

549
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,230
As a princess,

550
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,500
I shall die with dignity.

551
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,090
My maid has

552
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,070
nothing to do with what I did.

553
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,960
After I die,

554
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,170
just let her go.

555
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,570
Princess!

556
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,330
Caiwei!

557
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,510
Caiwei!

558
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:25,640
You must live on!

559
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,840
Go!

560
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,710
Princess!

561
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,920
Let’s go, Princess!

562
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,760
Leave!

563
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,100
Go!

564
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,900
Let’s go. We’re running out of time,
Princess!

565
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,260
Let’s go!

566
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,650
Come!

567
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,210
Why did you save me?

568
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,160
Why did you people

569
00:30:59,160 --> 00:30:59,820
save me again and again?

570
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,510
I’m the one who should die.

571
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,520
Whoever close to me

572
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,420
won’t end up well.

573
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,670
Don’t you know that?

574
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,490
Chun.

575
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:11,400
Chun.

576
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,790
Chun.

577
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,490
Are you alright?

578
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:21,050
When did you get shot?

579
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:21,910
Don’t worry about me.

580
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,010
Wait here.

581
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,470
Don’t move.

582
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,790
I will get you a physician.

583
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,450
Chun.

584
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:37,600
Don’t. Listen to me.

585
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,470
I am afraid

586
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,290
that I can’t escort you myself.

587
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,540
Those guards

588
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,960
are loyal

589
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,880
to me.

590
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,510
From now on,

591
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,620
they’ll protect you.

592
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,830
Don’t say that.

593
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,390
You won’t die.

594
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,550
Listen.

595
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,290
Wait here.

596
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,000
I will get someone to treat you.

597
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,550
Listen to me, Chun.

598
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:05,350
This place is close to the dock.

599
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,340
I have prepared a boat.

600
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,060
Just go with them.

601
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,980
Once you get on that boat,

602
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,040
you can

603
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,440
get out of here.

604
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,840
Understand?

605
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,960
I won’t.

606
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,160
Why should I leave?

607
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:24,660
Chun.

608
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,960
I beg you.

609
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,580
Listen to me for once, please?

610
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,260
Just... Just this once.

611
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,490
Why should I listen to you?

612
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,080
Who are you to me?

613
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,120
Why should I listen to you?

614
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,680
Whether I die or not

615
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,330
doesn’t have anything to do with you.

616
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,710
It does!

617
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,670
Don’t cry.

618
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,740
You know

619
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,400
I can’t stand seeing you cry.

620
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,370
You are most beautiful when you smile.

621
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,280
Will you smile for me

622
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,830
so that I’ll rest in peace?

623
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,190
Will you?

624
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,600
Don’t die!

625
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,960
You cannot die, Wei Shuye!

626
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,830
You cannot die!

627
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,440
Hang in there, Wei Shuye!

628
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,770
You cannot die. Do you hear me?

629
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:25,710
Listen to me,

630
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,200
I have always loved you since I was young.

631
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,890
At that time,

632
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,940
I was too timid.

633
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,880
I didn’t have the courage to tell you.

634
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,740
If I had said it sooner,

635
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,180
if I had been braver,

636
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,480
you and I,

637
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,950
we wouldn’t have ended up

638
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,100
like this.

639
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,340
Chun.

640
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,930
Now, I finally

641
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,330
have the chance to

642
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:04,650
brace myself to tell you

643
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,820
that I love you.

644
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,210
Promise me

645
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,510
to live...

646
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,010
Live well.

647
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:26,980
Wei Shuye.

648
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,690
Wei Shuye.

649
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:30,440
Wei Shuye!

650
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,760
Wei Shuye!

651
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,240
Why are you doing this to me?

652
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,300
Why people who loved me

653
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,770
left one by one?

654
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,670
Why?

655
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,440
Why?

656
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:30,910
Kill them.

657
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:35,110
Yuan Chun

658
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,950
and Wei Shuye were desperate,

659
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,310
and drowned themselves.

660
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,270
They are dead.

661
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,830
Do you understand?

662
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,170
But...

663
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,160
Do you understand?

664
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,490
Aye.

665
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,260
Let’s go.

666
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,870
Your Highness,

667
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:24,710
you have been here alone

668
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,740
for a while.

669
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:30,990
What...

670
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,780
What is wrong with you?

671
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,090
Is it the headache again?

672
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,500
Are you alright?

673
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,550
My headache is on and off

674
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,710
since the war of Hongchuan.

675
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,740
Your Highness,

676
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,750
it may be a serious illness.

677
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,350
You’d better see a physician.

678
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,820
It doesn’t matter.

679
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:52,930
The longer you wait,

680
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:53,680
the harder you recover.

681
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,900
You should be treated soon.

682
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,630
By the way,

683
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,930
I heard there’s a skilled female physician

684
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,240
in the southern suburbs.

685
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,890
She’s one of the best.

686
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,610
I can invite her over.

687
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:05,300
Don’t bother.

688
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,840
Maybe some other time.

689
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,660
Where is Achu?

690
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,150
I don’t know.

691
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,820
I haven’t seen her these days.

692
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,350
She should be in the mansion.

693
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,670
I haven’t seen her for days.

694
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,450
I don’t know if she is

695
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,950
still mad at me.

696
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:25,800
Your Highness,

697
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,680
honestly,

698
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,020
with all due respect,

699
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,620
it’ll take a while

700
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,170
for her to forgive you this time.

701
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,940
Well, I am going to

702
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:38,940
get that physician.

703
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,720
In my opinion, General Cheng

704
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,210
just wanted them dead.

705
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:21,540
Nothing happened.

706
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,980
He tricked them

707
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,320
into the woods to kill them.

708
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,550
That’s right.

709
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,970
Since they are not loyal to His Highness,

710
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,850
what’s the point of keeping them?

711
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:31,560
Shut up!

712
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,200
Stop spewing nonsense!

713
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,580
Miss Chu.

714
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:52,690
Mr. Jiang.

715
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,390
Where are those members

716
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,400
of the Xiuli Army?

717
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,500
Where is He Xiao?

718
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,900
Miss Chu,

719
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,390
you’re no longer their general.

720
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,540
So I can’t

721
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,430
disclose that information.

722
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,650
Do you think

723
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:07,680
you can keep that from me?

724
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,450
Tell them to sit back.

725
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,770
Sit.

726
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:20,680
Sit down.

727
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,500
Let me ask you again.

728
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:26,700
Where is the Xiuli Army?

729
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,180
He...

730
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:32,020
He Xiao took them out.

731
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,420
Out?

732
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,270
For what?

733
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,850
Enemies were spotted near the Icy Lake.

734
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,250
General Cheng Yuan assigned

735
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,490
the Xiuli Army to fight outside the city.

736
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:48,790
General.

737
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:51,550
General.

738
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,600
I had done

739
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,940
what you told me to do.

740
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,380
She bought it?

741
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,000
Yes.

742
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,630
She’s left to catch up
with the Xiuli Army.

743
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,490
Well done.

744
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,520
When they arrive at the Icy Lake,

745
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,920
those at the Meilin Pass

746
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,210
will get rid of them for us.

747
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:11,570
General.

748
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,760
There is one thing I don’t understand.

749
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,120
You don’t understand

750
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,790
why I did this, right?

751
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,770
I know you and Chu Qiao

752
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:21,260
don’t see eye to eye,

753
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:22,620
but...

754
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,080
but His Highness adores her.

755
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,240
Will we enrage

756
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,350
His Highness by doing this?

757
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,920
I don’t care

758
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,230
about how he feels.

759
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,970
With her around,

760
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:38,090
His Highness can’t

761
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,270
take revenge for the deceased.

762
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,200
Why is that?

763
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,020
As a commander,

764
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,870
Chu Qiao is not suitable for Yanbei.

765
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,720
She can only

766
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,300
soften His Highness,

767
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,510
and stop him from conquering the world.

768
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,460
As a woman,

769
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:58,540
her heart

770
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,990
doesn’t belong to His Highness.

771
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,720
What if he finds out?

772
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,270
Whatever.

773
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,410
The worst case scenario is death.

774
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,870
As long as we get rid of Chu Qiao,

775
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,350
His Highness

776
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,940
will be on the right track.

777
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,310
I understand.

778
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,100
You may leave.

779
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,270
Aye.

780
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,500
Miss Chu!

781
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,180
- Miss Chu. Miss Chu.
- Miss Chu.

782
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,190
Are you alright?

783
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:00,940
Yes.

784
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,430
We are sent here to patrol.

785
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,440
Why are you here?

786
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,430
I...

787
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,180
I was worried about you.

788
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,380
It seems that I mistook the situation.

789
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:09,170
How so?

790
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,320
I am worried that you would be ambushed.

791
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:15,390
Yes.

792
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:17,430
We were ambushed.

793
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:38,570
I didn’t expect

794
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:39,310
to see you here.

795
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,030
How have you been?

796
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,430
Who are you asking?

797
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,310
Me?

798
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,300
I’m good. Couldn’t be better.

799
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:50,590
I eat and sleep well.

800
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:52,170
And my skills have improved a lot.

801
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,530
Really? Congratulations!

802
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:57,680
Yueqi.

803
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,550
Go and get Meng Feng back.

804
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:02,530
There are many traps here.

805
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,840
Don’t let her get injured.

806
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,240
Young Master.

807
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,220
Meng Feng is a beast.

808
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,250
Instead of worrying about her,

809
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,600
you should worry about

810
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,820
if I’ll get caught by wolves

811
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:11,700
on my way.

812
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:16,470
Fine.

813
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:18,520
Xing’er.

814
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:19,600
I’m leaving.

815
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:31,820
Your people

816
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,050
provoked us at the Pass

817
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:36,970
and led me here.

818
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:39,960
This place is steep.

819
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,640
It seems that someone led us

820
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,840
here on purpose

821
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:46,940
