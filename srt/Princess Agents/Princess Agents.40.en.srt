Your Highness, here I am.

17
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,380
I knew you would come

18
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,150
to see me off.

19
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,200
I have been observing the stars recently.

20
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,920
I notice the Star of Ziwei is dim and dark

21
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,190
and the Big Dipper is moving
towards the south.

22
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,040
The north-west is surrounded by miasma.

23
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,620
It means something horrible will happen,

24
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,960
especially a war.

25
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,960
Chang’an will

26
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,440
no longer be safe.

27
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,800
Qiaoqiao,

28
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,790
why don’t you leave with me?

29
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,690
We can get

30
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:20,960
to know each other better

31
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,120
along the way.

32
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,830
Although I can’t see you through,

33
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,770
I know you are not as bad

34
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:30,950
as you appear to be.

35
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,620
I am a noble man.

36
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,210
I look decent, and I’m a great man inside.

37
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,420
How can I be seen through

38
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,620
so easily?

39
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,760
Or I would be disgraced.

40
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,270
The Emperor of Wei had wanted
to marry a princess to you.

41
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,450
Did he agree

42
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,410
to let you go?

43
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,040
He wants me gone as soon as possible.

44
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,440
When I told him,

45
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,810
he immediately sent me away

46
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,080
as if I would bring bad luck.

47
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,460
Besides,

48
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,000
look at his daughters

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,780
and other princesses.

50
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,130
They are too ugly

51
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,360
to marry me.

52
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,400
Throughout Chang’an,

53
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,680
only you caught

54
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,390
my eyes.

55
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,170
However, you chose the wrong person.

56
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,260
You prefer risking your life

57
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,290
for Yan Xun,

58
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,110
to enjoying wealth and happiness with me.

59
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,290
You broke my heart.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,800
Xiao Ce, I have a question for you.

61
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,670
If Wei starts a war with Yanbei,

62
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,910
will you help it

63
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,850
fight against Yanbei?

64
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,180
I won’t.

65
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,810
Will you help Yanbei

66
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:28,780
fight against Wei?

67
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,730
I won’t, either.

68
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,350
I won’t help either of them

69
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,750
if they are at war.

70
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,210
Don’t worry.

71
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,820
Even if the Emperor of Wei

72
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,520
married his mother to me,

73
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,570
I still wouldn’t help him,

74
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,750
let alone his daughter.

75
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,830
Good. If so,

76
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,500
I’ll treat you as my friend

77
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,390
for now.

78
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,680
I should go.

79
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,190
No matter what you do later on,

80
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,080
I wish you good luck

81
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,090
and success.

82
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,540
And...

83
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,340
If you go to Yanbei

84
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,500
but feel too cold there,

85
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,710
come to Liang to find me.

86
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,060
I’m noble and wealthy

87
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,530
with many concubines.

88
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,270
I can support you easily.

89
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,390
Xiao Ce, if one day,

90
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,790
you are bored of the scene in the south,

91
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,820
you may come to me

92
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,810
to experience riding
on the snowy grassland.

93
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,530
Beauties in Yanbei

94
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,060
will also surprise you

95
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,520
and attract you.

96
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,960
You really know me well.

97
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,590
You always

98
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,000
consider for me.

99
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,960
We are both puppets

100
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,590
of our destiny.

101
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,190
On many occasions,

102
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,830
we see the beginning

103
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,230
but cannot see the ending.

104
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,900
Qiaoqiao, hope you can escape.

105
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,540
See you if there is a chance.

106
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,810
We promised to drink it

107
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,790
before we leave.

108
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,610
Smell it. Tasty, isn’t it?

109
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,190
It is.

110
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,450
Drink it.

111
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,340
I almost forgot

112
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,500
what the wine tasted like.

113
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,480
Drink it slowly.

114
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,200
Don’t get drunk.

115
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,590
I won’t.

116
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,780
Achu.

117
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,260
Are you afraid?

118
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,970
Are you afraid?

119
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,450
Here.

120
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,600
How could I be afraid?

121
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,700
I’ve never been afraid.

working for all kinds of gangs

127

in the palace and all the departments.

On the wedding day,

131

they will assist us in creating chaos,

according to our move.

133
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,460
Chang’an has been keeping peace

134

But Your Excellency...

139
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,470
It will be too dangerous.

140
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,140
I’m afraid

141
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,270
I’ll be too busy to protect her.

142

you shall leave the city first.

Ajing needs to follow His Excellency.

155

Yujiang and his men are careless.

156
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,730
I can’t let them do that.

157
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,640
You are the only choice.

158

159

He does.

160
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,640
Don’t worry.

161
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,320
We have prepared for such a long time.

162
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,040
We will win

163
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,210
and escape from Chang’an.

164
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,080
Fine, then.

00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,480
Caiwei, tell me.

166
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,910
Will Yan Xun like

167
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,060
how I’m dressed today?

168
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,910
Your Highness, you are gorgeous.

169
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,440
In this dress,

170
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,830
you look greater.

171
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,230
Nothing can change this fact.

172
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,020
Don’t worry.

173
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:45,880
This is a unique dress

174
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,850
of Yanbei style

175
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,680
sold in Weipin Pavilion.

176
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,400
I had it bought for you

177
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,660
when it was first sold

178
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,820
at nine o’clock.

179
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,860
When you wear this,

180
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,700
His Excellency Yan will know

181
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,180
how much you care about him.

182
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,190
Cold Ice, why are you here?

183
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,550
May I ask for a favor, Your Highness?

184
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,970
Even you need help

185
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:12,850
from someone else?

186
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,020
I’m ordered to guard Cuiwei Palace.

187
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,750
But all palace guards work for me.

188
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,870
I’m familiar with no one.

189
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,390
Your Highness,

190
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,430
could you get someone for me?

191
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,440
I am in a good mood today.

192
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,450
Tell me who you want.

193
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:31,900
Chu Qiao.

194
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,910
Chu Qiao?

195
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,560
Fine. I’ll ask my mother for her.

196
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,370
Thank you, Your Highness.

197
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,450
Your Excellency.

198
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,670
Where is Achu?

199
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,140
She was summoned to the palace.

200
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,710
What is she doing there?

201
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,510
Someone from the palace picked her up.

202
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,340
When you were away,
we couldn’t refuse that.

203
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,920
Achu said

204
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,720
if she didn’t

205
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,420
come back tonight,

206
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,520
she would find a chance to escape

207
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,780
in the chaos tomorrow.

208
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,040
She told you not to worry.

209
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,880
How can I not worry?

210
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,280
I’ll let our people in the palace

211
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,390
watch out for her.

212
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,710
She’ll be safe.

= Chang’an =

214
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,200
What?

215
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,460
You’re being naughty, huh?

216
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,190
You’ll stop crying soon.

217
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,470
Come on.

218
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,480
Let me put you there.

Young Master Huai.

222
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,580
What brings you here?

223
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,060
I asked to see you a few times.

224
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,280
But you ignored me.

225
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,640
You have my son.

226
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,660
How can I not come?

227
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,880
Look what day

228
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,890
it is today.

229
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,690
Go back.

230
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,590
I can’t come out

231
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,520
unless I come on such a day.

232
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Yuwen Huai.

233
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,720
Give me my son.

234
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,070
Worried?

235
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,410
When I asked to talk to you,

236
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,560
what was your attitude?

237
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,860
I know what you are eager to know.

238
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,390
You want to know who Chu Qiao is,

239
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,260
don’t you?

240
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,340
Let me tell you.

241
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,880
She’s Luo He’s daughter.

242
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,220
The successor of Storm Token!

243
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,600
Why should I trust you?

244
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,290
Because I was once

245
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,000
Luo He’s maid.

246
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,340
Fine. I’ll talk with you

247
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,640
when I’m free.

248
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,390
You!

249
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,550
Come back!

= UNIFON =

251
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,940
This mineral skin care mud is great.

252
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,810
Your skin now feels

253
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,250
extremely smooth

254
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,620
and glossy.

255
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,110
Really?

256
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,770
Will Yan Xun like it?

257
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,250
He surely will.

258
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,700
Oh, Caiwei,

259
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,870
how long do I have to wait

260
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,660
before he comes?

261
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,610
Pretty a long time.

262
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,100
It’s only five a.m. now.

263
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,590
He has just set out.

264
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,070
After he visited
the Imperial Ancestral Temple

265
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,190
at seven,

266
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,360
he will arrive here

267
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,620
before noon.

268
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,680
Then help tidy me up.

269
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,290
Okay.

270
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,370
Don’t you run now?

271
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,950
Aren’t you afraid
Yan Xun will leave you behind?

272
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,860
Achu?

273
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,350
Achu.

274
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,960
What are you doing here?

275
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,820
Her Grace ordered me

276
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,820
to guard Princess Yuan Chun.

277
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,790
Chun must be behind it.

278
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,730
Don’t take it to heart.

279
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,100
If you feel bad,

280
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,750
go back.

281
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,700
I’ll take the blame for you.

282
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,240
How could she feel bad?

283
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,010
She’s heartless.

284
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,930
By the way, my mother wants me

285
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,600
to be the man to accompany the bride.

286
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,720
I can go to Yanbei

287
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,620
with you.

288
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,540
= Oriole Courtyard =

289
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,440
Your Excellency, please.

290
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,310
The husband of princess is going
for sacrifices to ancestors.

291
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,750
Today is the wedding day of my daughter.

292
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,610
Yuan Chun is the daughter

293
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,640
I care about the most.

294
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:30,530
I watched Yan Xun grow up.

295
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,320
I feel it reliable

296
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,170
to marry my daughter to him.

297
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,810
His father rebelled that year.

298
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,310
Since I’ve forgiven Yan Xun,

299
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,270
I won’t punish him anymore.

300
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,170
In the past three years,

301
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,950
Yan Xun has behaved himself

302
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,910
and kept humble.

303
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,930
I believe

304
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,980
he has learned about his mistake.

305
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,350
Today he and my daughter

306
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,290
will return to Yanbei.

307
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,620
From now on,

308
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,930
Yan Xun is new master of Yanbei.

309
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,600
I hope all of you here

310
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,790
will not blame him

311
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,420
for what his father did.

312
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,800
Be united and loyal to our nation!

313
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,740
It’s so kind of you, Your Majesty.

314
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,640
His Excellency will be grateful

315
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,410
to you

316
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,120
and be loyal to you.

317
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,850
Right. With such a kind emperor,

318
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,180
our nation will prosper.

319
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,610
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

320

= Four & Two Hall =

321
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,900
Your Highness.

322
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,710
The wedding starts momentarily.

323
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,050
Minister Song and Minister Li
with Ministry of Rites

324
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:54,920
have arrived.

325
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,130
Several ladies are

326
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,720
still kneeling in the hall.

327
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,000
They are all waiting for you.

328
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,350
It’s been such a long time.

329
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,860
But Yan Xun hasn’t come yet.

330
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,080
Tell me.

331
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,000
Will there be something wrong?

332
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,650
Your Highness.

333
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,270
It’s astir out there.

334
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,920
He may just be late.

335
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:13,610
Well,

336
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,880
do not worry.

337
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,840
The time is fixed

338
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,290
for each procedure.

339
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,880
Besides, no civilians dare

340
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,910
to stop the royal carriage fleet.

341
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,840
I just worry

342
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,710
if anything went wrong

343
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,740
during his trip.

344
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,510
Today, we either sink or swim.

345
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,530
After today,

346
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,450
we will know

347
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,620
if we will win and survive.

348
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:57,670
Move!

349
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,540
- Aye.
- Aye.

350
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,570
You!

351
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,980
= Jiuyou Platform =

352
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,840
Ajing.

353
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,930
Where are we now?

354
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,700
Close to Jiuyou Platform.

355
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,900
= Jiuyou Platform =

356
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,900
= Jiuyou Platform =

357
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,050
Say hello.

358
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,340
Even if you struggle to live,

359
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,760
you can’t give up.

360
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,360
Don’t forget.

361
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,560
Yanbei is waiting for you.

362
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,110
Why isn’t anyone welcoming us?

363
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,590
I don’t know, either.

364
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,610
Who are you?

365
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,490
How dare you stop us!

366
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,780
Get out of the way!

367
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,350
Are you asking for your doom?

368
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:15,030
You sound arrogant, Minister Huo.

369
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,650
Minister Zhao?

370
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,080
Get out of the way, all of you!

371
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:22,920
We found

372
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,370
lots of banned weapons

373
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,640
hidden in Oriole Courtyard.

374
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,640
Yan Xun is suspected to rebel.

375
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,080
Now I come to arrest him,

376
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,230
with His Majesty’s decree.

377
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:35,290
Whoever resists

378
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,870
will be killed!

379
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,410
Where is the decree?

380
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,840
Step away, Minister Huo.

381
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,930
Or do you want to defend the traitors?

382
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,690
You are with Cavalry Battalion?

383
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,050
Are you rebelling?

384
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,140
We’re Xiuli Army of Yanbei!

385
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,210
Dudes, kill them!

386
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,790
Kill!

387
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,630
I told my father

388
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,380
to kill you,

389
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,890
at whatever cost!

390
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,290
You no longer have the chance.

391
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,810
It’s been three years!

392
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,070
Since Yanbei was invaded,

393
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,470
people in Beishuo and Hongchuan
were slaughtered

394
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,870
when twenty thousand soldiers and people
died in fire,

395
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,630
their spirits have been

396
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,670
waiting for us in the heaven

397
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,020
for three years!

398
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,360
Over the past years,

399
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,530
my father guarded the frontier,

400
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,310
and he protected the nation

401
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,480
with weapons and his body!

402
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,900
However, the Emperor is fatuous.

403
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,300
He couldn’t distinguish from good and bad!

404
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,170
He forgot those soldiers

405
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,470
who died outside Beishuo!

406
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,660
He also forgot the vow

407
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,600
between him and my father

408
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,000
over the years!

409
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,890
He betrayed my father and killed him!

410
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,820
My whole family were killed for no reason!

411
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:52,350
People in Yanbei all suffered!

412
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,510
He has become

413
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,820
my deadly enemy!

414
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:05,250
Today, I swear!

415
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,970
Even if mountains collapse

416
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,520
and blood is shed like ashes,

417
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,460
I will take revenge!

418
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,510
Go!

419
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,980
Go fight!

420
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,550
Kill the damn emperor

421
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,000
to sacrifice the dead people in Yanbei!

422
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,190
Fight the damn emperor

423
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,580
and let him know

424
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:32,990
I’m rebelling toady!

425
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:36,290
- We swear to follow you, Your Excellency!
- We swear to follow you, Your Excellency!

426
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,910
- We swear to follow you, Your Excellency!
- We swear to follow you, Your Excellency!

427
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,390
- We swear to follow you, Your Excellency!
- We swear to follow you, Your Excellency!

428
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,180
Screwed!

429
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,290
Your Highness!

430
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,830
What’s the fuss about? What happened?

431
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:56,980
Bad news! Yan Xun...

432
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,180
Yan Xun?

433
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,880
What happened?

434
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,300
Yan Xun is rebelling!

435
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:05,150
Your Highness.

436
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,810
We should report it to His Majesty

437
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,160
and make early preparations!

438
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,140
Your Highness, what happened?

439
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,270
A man just ran away.

440
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,710
Your Highness?

441
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:33,730
Your Highness?

442
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,840
I... I killed him!

443
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,980
I killed him!

444
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:38,670
- I killed him!
- Your Highness.

445
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,820
I killed him!

446
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,720
- I killed him!
- Your Highness.

447
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,860
He is dead.

448
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:44,880
Caiwei.

449
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,560
Is he dead?

450
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,480
He is not.

451
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:49,960
He just passed out.

452
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,460
That’s good, then.

453
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,530
That’s good, then.

454
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,040
Go!

455
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,850
Go tell Yan Xun...

456
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,100
What are you talking about, Your Highness?

457
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,860
Go tell him that I will not force him...

458
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,780
I will not force him to marry me.

459
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,000
I’m going, Your Highness.

460
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,080
I’m going to plead to Father!

461
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,860
I shall not marry him!

462
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,990
- Go!
- Your Highness.

463
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:09,400
Do you hear me? Go!

464
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,760
Get out of the way! Let me in!

465
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,740
Who is shouting outside?

466
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,190
Father, I have something to tell you!

467
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,630
Her Highness must be impatient.

468
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,620
Your Majesty, I’ll go have a look

469
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,220
and take her back.

470
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:37,710
Let her in.

471
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,860
Father,

472
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,850
I don’t want to marry Yan Xun!

473
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,650
Please retract your order.

474
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,160
Ridiculous!

475
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,480
Father,

476
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,170
I am unwilling to

477
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,220
marry him, seriously!

478
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,270
Please retract your order!

479
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,120
The escort troop of Yan Xun

480
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,430
is arriving soon.

481
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,880
You ask your father

482
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,180
to marry you to him.

483
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,410
It was announced to the world

484
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,560
ten days ago.

485
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,950
Now you don’t want to marry him?

486
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:22,340
Is this

487
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,930
how your mother teaches you?

488
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,390
Chun.

489
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,480
Is it because

490
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,560
you don’t want to leave
your father and me?

491
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,990
It’s okay.

492
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,330
Even if you go there,

493
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,350
you can come back and visit us
anytime you want.

494
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:36,630
All ministers are here today.

495
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,310
Stop showing

496
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,630
your bad temper.

497
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,910
Be a good girl and go back to your palace.

498
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,770
Mother, I am not

499
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:45,070
showing bad temper.

500
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,390
You always don’t want me to marry Yan Xun,

501
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,040
do you?

502
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,900
Please beg Father.

503
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,450
Beg him

504
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,640
not to marry me to Yan Xun.

505
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,300
Please beg him, Mother!

506
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,000
Enough!

507
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,830
Take her away

508
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,790
and dress her up

509
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,460
until the wedding chariot comes.

510
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,550
- Father!
- Aye.

511
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,650
Father.

512
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:03,890
Your Highness.

513
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,840
I really don’t want to marry him!

514
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,350
I don’t want to marry him!

515
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,480
- Father.
- Your Highness.

516
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:09,360
Your Highness!

517
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,970
Let me go! Let me go!

518
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,190
Let me go!

519
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,380
Your Highness! Your Highness!

520
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,940
Your Highness!

521
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,710
Father.

522
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,060
It is not until today that I realize

523
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,770
I don’t like Yan Xun.

524
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,670
I hate him. I hate him!

525
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:26,600
I am really unwilling to

526
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,070
marry him!

527
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,280
Father, please show mercy to me

528
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,550
for one last time

529
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,310
and retract your order.

530
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,510
I beg you!

531
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:37,900
Song!

532
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,520
Take your sister away.

533
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,790
Father!

534
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,360
Father!

535
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:47,790
Father! Father!

536
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,370
- I am willing to
- Chun.

537
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:49,530
marry the Crown Prince of Liang!

538
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,300
Or you can marry me to the North!

539
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,240
I can do anything

540
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,810
as long as I don’t marry Yan Xun!

541
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,820
Please retract your order!

542
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,990
I am really unwilling to marry him!

543
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,890
Father!

544
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,570
Father!

545
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,550
Chun.

546
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,420
Chun.

547
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,240
Brother!

548
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,520
Brother.

549
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,630
I can’t marry him!

550
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:16,840
I really can’t marry him!

551
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,320
Please beg Father

552
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,130
so that he’ll stop it.

553
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,960
I really can’t

554
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,740
marry Yan Xun!

555
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,830
Please beg Father!

556
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,800
Father! Father!

557
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:31,440
Father, I beg you!

558
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,680
Father!

559
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,890
Father!

560
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,400
Song.

561
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,250
Father!

562
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,610
Chun, go with me.

563
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:52,920
Your Highness.

564
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,440
- Chun.
- Father!

565
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,090
- Father!
- Go.

566
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,250
I beg you!

567
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,000
Father!

568
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:05,980
Father!

569
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,900
I beg you, Father!

570
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:14,100
Father!

571
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:19,380
Father, I beg you!

572
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,200
Father!

573
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:26,010
Her Highness is really
showing her filial piety.

574
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:27,930
There is an old saying of crying marriage.

575
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:30,860
Her action is for the national cause.

576
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,010
It’s kind of you, Your Majesty,

577
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,830
when you care for your children.

578
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,810
When they leave home,

579
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,700
they can no longer listen

580
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,200
to your instructions.

581
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:44,030
They must be sad.

582
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,950
Yes, you must be right about that.

583
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,240
Escaping?

584
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,640
Stop looking. No one else is here.

585
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:42,860
Yan Xun has gone mad.

586
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,550
Fight or leave.

587
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,300
Don’t talk rubbish.

588
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:48,740
How stubborn you are!

589
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:50,310
I’m better than you,

590
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:51,400
the stupidly loyal and merciless guy.

591
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:54,980
I am not loyal to the Yuwen family,

592
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,140
but our nation.

593
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:57,600
The Emperor is brutal.

594
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,540
He killed the whole family of Yan Xun.

595
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,200
He can even

596
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,300
use his own daughter as a bait

597
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,120
to kill Yan Xun.

598
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,050
Why should a man like this

599
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,400
be the Emperor?

600
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,080
Why can he make decisions for all people?

601
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:11,520
When you can’t tell black from white
and help the evil,

602
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,680
you’re the same

603
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,650
as Wei Shuyou and Zhao Xifeng.

604
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:19,390
Yuwen Yue, if you insist on stopping me,

605
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:21,150
don’t blame me for showing no mercy.

606
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,490
Can you?

607
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,810
Try me.

608
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,390
You will die if you follow him.

609
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:39,290
Don’t bother.

610
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,430
Mind your own business!

611
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,650
Could you stop that?

612
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,670
No.

613
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,310
Who is over there?

614
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,580
Still fight? Wanna die?

615
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,760
Why are you following me?

616
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:12,790
Who is that?

617
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,420
Hurry!

618
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,730
Boss, you may have misheard.

619
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,030
No way!

620
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,570
It may be a cat.

621
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:27,930
There are a lot of cats in this garden.

622
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,080
Search this place.

623
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:30,880
Today is the wedding day of Princess Chun.

624
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,270
Nothing can go wrong!

625
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,110
- Aye!
- Aye!

626
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,800
Reckless mad woman!

627
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,630
Dogged mean man!

628
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,620
If you leave Chang’an now,

629
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:45,530
you’ll be dead.

630
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,630
Really?

631
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,950
I don’t think so.

632
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,460
Do you want to take a bet?

633
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,800
On what?

634
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,970
You want to bet

635
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,560
on whether there will be fewer dead people

636
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,020
than those in Yanbei three years ago.

637
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,340
Or you want to bet

638
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,280
on how many innocent people

639
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,460
will lose their lives

640
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,530
by what you have done

641
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:06,480
when the war
between Wei and Yanbei starts?

642
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,180
Yan Xun is no longer

643
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,170
what he was then.

644
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,560
You have no idea

645
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,690
how mad his plan is.

646
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,670
He is a wolf,

647
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,550
a wolf raised by you,

648
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,060
who will rip off all of us.

649
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,390
Even if he is,

650
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,900
you’ve made him that way.

651
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,220
Every one of you has

652
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,880
his family’s blood in your hands.

653
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:33,360
You should take this responsibility.

654
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,880
You will regret.

655
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,880
I will not!

656
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,270
How is it going

657
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,070
with Zhao Dongting and Yuwen Huai?

658
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,990
How come

659
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,860
no word has come about Yan Xun’s death?

660
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,660
Report!

661
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,120
Your Majesty, Princess Chun...

662
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,050
She...

663
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:34,860
What happened to her?

664
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,750
She is gone!

665
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,640
Report!

666
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,300
What is it again?

667
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:42,130
Your Majesty, Your Grace,

668
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,060
and all ministers,

669
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,260
please go to the safe zone.

670
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,120
The palace is on a big fire.

671
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,760
It burns all the way
from the imperial sedan.

672
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,940
We can’t stop the fire.

673
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:51,610
Fire? How is that possible?

674
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,180
What is the Fire Department doing?

675
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,970
Why aren’t they putting out the fire?

676
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:56,340
I don’t know about that!

677
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,200
But wherever I go,

678
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,740
there is fire.

679
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:00,490
How dare him!

680
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,560
Does Sun Yunpu want to lose his job

681
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,010
as the chief of Fire Department?

682
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,350
Your Majesty, please don’t leave the hall!

683
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,410
It is not safe out there!

684
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,870
A lot of assassins sneaked in!

685
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,430
Sixty-five people have been dead.

686
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,650
My palace is heavily guarded.

687
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:15,080
How can there be assassins?

688
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,220
They all come from inside!

689
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,460
Maids, eunuchs

690
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,360
and guards!

691
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,050
They are all unimportant people

692
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:22,560
who go crazy

693
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,940
and kill everyone they see.

694
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:26,130
Even General Song of Palace Guards
was killed.

695
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:27,400
Now, General Yuwen Yue

696
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,410
with Cavalry Battalion

697
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:29,580
has been fighting assassins

698
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,040
with Palace Guards.

699
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,220
However, we don’t know

700
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:32,830
how many of them are escaping!

701
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,230
So, it is not safe out there!

702
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,070
Your Majesty,

703
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,550
please don’t leave the hall for now!

704
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,820
General Yuwen Yue says

705
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,560
there are more assassins
outside the palace!

706
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,780
Men in Chang’an Office

707
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,770
delivered a letter here!

708
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:42,730
But he was killed

709
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:43,740
as soon as he arrived at the gate!

710
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,630
The situation is serious!

711
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,330
Your Majesty, please make early decisions!

712
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,850
Who was killed?

713
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,810
General He of Palace Guards.

714
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:52,420
Chief Commander Lu of the West Gate.

715
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,980
Chief Commander Yu of the South Gate.

716
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,240
Sentries in every signal office.

717
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,120
Minister Sun Yunpu with Fire Department.

718
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,770
Soldiers on watch at the Southwest Gate.

719
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:02,100
Very well! Very well!

720
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:08,370
What a perfect plan!

721
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,970
Your Majesty, in my opinion,

722
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,000
- this is...
- Report!

723
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,810
What is it?

724
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:15,410
What is it again?

725
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:16,100
Report!

726
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:17,250
Your Majesty!

727
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,370
Yan Xun rises in rebellion!

728
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,870
Xiuli Army broke through the East Gate.

729
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:23,080
Green Battalion,

730
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,980
Cavalry Battalion,

731
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:24,940
Defense Battalion,

732
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,750
Capital Battalion and Chang’an Office

733
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:27,890
are all closed

734
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,630
and there comes no news.

735
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,120
No news?

736
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,690
How is that possible?

737
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,890
More than a hundred thousand soldiers
are in those battalions.

738
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:41,090
Are they all killed by assassins?

739
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,480
General Yuwen Yue says

740
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,440
generals of these battalions have no power
to dispatch soldiers

741
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,000
so that no one can fight!

742
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,420
Your Majesty, please send a messenger

743
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,550
so that generals of these battalions

744
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,000
can lead troops to kill the rebels!

745
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,790
Your Majesty, the situation is serious!

746
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:56,910
We can no longer procrastinate it!

747
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,560
The rebels have broken through

748
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,190
the imperial prison
and the prison of Central Judicial Office!

749
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,890
The city is in a mess now!

750
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:02,810
Besides the rebel army,

751
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:03,780
some prisoners

752
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,090
have broken out of prison,

753
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,670
some people with martial arts

754
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,940
and even some gangsters

755
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,000
have been sacking people on the streets.

756
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,280
General Yuwen Yue

757
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,780
has gone to Zhuque Avenue

758
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,710
with Palace Guards!

759
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:16,930
Your Majesty,

760
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,310
give the order, or it’ll be late!

761
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:23,430
Yan Xun is going too far!

762
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,200
Under my command,

763
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,700
whoever kills Yan Xun will be rewarded
with ten thousand taels of gold,

764
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,990
and the status of marquis!

765
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:32,250
Aye, Your Majesty!

766
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:35,900
= East Gate =

767
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,390
Hold the gate and wait for His Excellency!

768
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:42,590
Hold on!

769
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,290
We must hold on!

770
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,120
Your Excellency, leave quickly!

771
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,890
We are losing the East Gate!

772
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:07,600
I must find Achu!

773
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,190
Mother.

774
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:42,600
Mother.

775
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:46,050
Mother.

776
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:49,950
Mother.

777
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:56,320
Give it to me!

778
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,150
Give it to me!

779
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:58,070
Let go!

780
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:58,820
Give me!

781
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,870
Give it to me!

782
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:01,620
Let go!

783
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:07,760
Father!

784
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,530
Father!

785
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,850
Father!

786
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:05,680
Achu, get on the horse!

787
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:06,790
Let’s go!

788
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,270
Yan Xun!

789
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,990
