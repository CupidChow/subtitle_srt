Do you have any cure for her?

17
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,190
She can’t survive

18
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,020
unless someone restrains the burning fire

19
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,900
inside her

20
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,620
with strong cold inner force.

21
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,420
I don’t have enough medical skills

22
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,120
to cure her.

23
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,120
See you.

We allow no one

25
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,430
to gossip about Qingshan House.

26
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,590
Do you understand?

27
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,210
I... I swear.

28
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,310
Today, I only treated

29
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,650
Young Master Yuwen Yue.

30
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,650
He’s as healthy as before.

31
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:05,710
I didn’t see

32
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,310
anything else

33
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,920
or hear anything.

34
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,150
Break your promise and you’ll die. Remember?

35
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,530
Aye.

36
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,740
Yue Guard, walk him out!

37
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,020
Don’t… Don’t leave me alone.

38
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,870
Don’t leave me alone.

39
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,850
Yueqi, take Xing’er to the secret chamber.

40
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,880
Young Master.

41
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,090
She’s too badly hurt.

42
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,970
She can’t be saved.

43
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,720
I decide if she can be saved.

44
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,050
Aye.

45
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,840
Young Master,

46
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,290
even if I have to turn the House upside down,

47
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,750
I’ll find out who released the snakes.

48
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,000
I can just refuse to lead the imperial guards

49
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,470
with this excuse.

50
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,740
Get me the Jade Dog.

51
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,030
Young Master.

52
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,760
Jade Dog is a bane to you.

53
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,690
It has extreme coldness.

54
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:28,670
You mustn’t get close to it.

55
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,540
Go get it.

56
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:32,320
Since I was little,

57
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,140
my duty was to protect the Eye of Intel.

58
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:35,640
Your safety is

59
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,100
the safety of the Eye of Intel.

60
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,940
I can’t watch you do that.

61
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,550
She’s a girl

62
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,990
who struggles to live in desperation.

63
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,120
She deserves a second chance.

64
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,860
But she can no longer

65
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,900
be your weapon.

66
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,500
Just take my order.

67
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:54,840
Aye.

68
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,920
Tell us!

69
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,770
I promised Young Master Yue

70
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,870
I wouldn’t tell anyone else how he was.

71
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,090
Otherwise,

72
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,380
he wouldn’t spare me.

73
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,630
Fine. I’ll tell you.

74
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,340
I will.

75
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,670
Young Master Yue was bitten by vipers.

76
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,030
I left him a few prescriptions

77
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,640
before I left.

78
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,770
I knew nothing else.

79
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,730
Are you telling the truth?

80
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,710
Yes. It’s totally the truth.

81
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,910
You are

82
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,610
worthless.

83
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,690
Sometimes,

84
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,000
killing makes people

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,410
forget the injustice and pain for the moment.

86
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,580
The Ice Trick I taught you

87
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,010
is too powerful.

88
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,790
You can’t control it for the moment.

89
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,320
You must practice it

90
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,450
more frequently

91
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,800
with the inner-force law I taught you.

92
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,580
Young Master, how do you feel?

93
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,210
Young Master.

94
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,200
I can’t see things.

95
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,060
Young Master, why did you do this?

96
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,940
I just can’t see for the moment.

97
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,830
She’s a mere maid.

98
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,430
Do you still think

99
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,110
she’s a mere maid?

100
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,970
She is an excellent girl.

101
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,370
She has many potentials

102
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,280
that other spies don’t have.

103
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,990
She also has super

104
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,180
insight and adaptability.

105
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,110
Just because of this,

106
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,400
she’s the main suspect,

107
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,480
like Jinzhu.

108
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,480
As for Xiaoqi...

109
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,120
She can’t be the chief plotter.

110
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,270
Seems like I was thinking too much.

111
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,830
You save Xing’er,

112
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,930
just to solve the case.

113
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,790
Give them the biggest pressure

114
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,980
so that she and Jinzhu will confront each other.

115
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,380
We’ll see which of them

116
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,460
can get the goods on the other one.

117
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:21,600
Aye.

118
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:43,830
Xiaoba.

119
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,950
Did you release the snakes?

120
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,100
Why were you so stupid?

121
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,290
Why?

122
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,010
We must avenge Linxi.

123
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,200
You and Xiaoliu forgot that.

124
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,830
But I didn’t.

125
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,470
Listen.

126
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,340
There’s only one option for you.

127
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,080
Shift all the blame

128
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,640
to Xiaoliu.

129
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,570
I can’t.

130
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,130
Why should I?

131
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,650
She said she would take revenge.

132
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,940
But you had to take action.

133
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,360
Why do you think?

134
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,180
I should answer for what I’ve done.

135
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,060
I can’t get Xiaoliu involved again.

136
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,590
Listen to me, Xiaoqi.

137
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,480
She’s not

138
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,370
our real sister.

139
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:27,930
Only you and I

140
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,250
are real daughters

141
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,000
in our family

142
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,720
who are still alive.

143
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,660
Do you understand?

144
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,200
I don’t want you to experience this.

145
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,030
But you’re my daughter.

146
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,740
You’ll face it sooner or later.

147
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,990
I don’t want you

148
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,970
to fail to protect yourself

149
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,000
when the day comes.

150
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,820
Remember. No matter how hard it is,

151
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,290
you must survive,

152
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,610
even if you’re treated like dirt.

153
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,160
You can’t have unlimited possibilities

154
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,960
unless you survive.

155
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,290
Young Master.

156
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:42,760
I just saw you

157
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,350
bitten by snakes.

158
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,400
I was so worried that

159
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,080
I stabbed you with the sword.

160
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,720
Young Master,

161
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,120
please forgive me for that.

162
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,330
But I think you tried to kill me.

163
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,550
You changed your mind

164
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,860
when Yueqi came

165
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,140
and then you saved me, right?

166
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:04,850
Young Master.

167
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,530
I truly wanted to save you.

168
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,600
Please don’t

169
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,820
get me wrong.

170
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,940
You’re just not capable enough, I guess.

171
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,520
When you’re capable enough,

172
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,290
by then,

173
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,150
will you kill me

174
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,920
to avenge your brother?

175
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,990
Will you?

176
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,050
Of course not, Young Master.

177
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,050
I know I can’t hide anything

178
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,180
from you.

179
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,730
Please trust me.

180
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,420
I can’t see you through.

181
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,690
Somebody!

182
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,350
Take her away for interrogation.

183
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:46,630
Aye.

184
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,860
What’s wrong with his eyes?

185
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,860
= Qingshan House =

186
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:09,060
Tell us. Who released the snakes?

187
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,220
Young Master.

188
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,120
I knew who did that.

189
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,310
Xing’er did.

190
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,970
Why could you say that?

191
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:20,860
Because you know very well

192
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,170
how to repel snakes with candle flame.

193
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,300
And only you can remain calm

194
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,020
among snakes.

195
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,550
Who else could the murderer be?

196
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,940
That’s funny.

197
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,340
Jinzhu.

198
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,000
You mean

199
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,640
I was the murderer

200
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,220
only because I saved Young Master?

201
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,620
Well, I’d like to ask you.

202
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,390
Did I want to save Young Master

203
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,640
or kill him?

204
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,030
Shut up!

205
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,900
Ordinary girls are afraid of snakes.

206
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,610
Why aren’t you?

207
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,910
Young Master, I’m not a princess.

208
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,230
I’m a maid.

209
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,810
Young Master.

210
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,370
I served as a maid on the meadow

211
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,350
for years.

212
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,450
When I was starving, I even ate mice,

213
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,730
not to mention snakes.

214
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,260
You mean

215
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,610
your sisters are also not afraid of snakes?

216
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,100
Take Xiaoqi and Xiaoba to us.

217
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,970
Xiaoliu.

218
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,670
My sisters have nothing to do

219
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,800
with this.

220
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,010
Why are they tied up?

221
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,250
Jing Xiaoqi.

222
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,200
You were sneaky outside Young Master’s house.

223
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,560
Did you release the snakes?

224
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,470
She didn’t do that.

225
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,440
It was...

226
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,550
It was me.

227
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,880
I did that alone.

228
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,470
It has nothing to do with Xiaoliu.

229
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:49,430
Xing’er.

230
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,740
Your sister confessed it.

231
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,050
Young Master.

232
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,000
Xiaoqi has been acting stealthily.

233
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,320
I found her weird.

234
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,870
So, she released snakes to hurt you.

235
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,100
Xiaoqi.

236
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,670
How stupid you are!

237
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,650
Why did you admit your guilt under torture

238
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,090
and admit something you haven’t done?

239
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,760
Xiaoqi isn’t even qualified

240
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,630
to get into Young Master’s bedroom.

241
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,840
However powerful she can do,

242
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,660
she can’t

243
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,710
release so many snakes

244
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,540
around Young Master

245
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,680
like doing magic.

246
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,210
She can’t get into the bedroom.

247
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,740
But she has a sister

248
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,490
who serves as a personal maid.

249
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,750
You have free access to the bedroom.

250
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,520
If I wanted to release the snakes,

251
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,680
did I need to use Xiaoqi?

252
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,970
Jinzhu.

253
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,670
I’m curious.

254
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,220
Why can you always see

255
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,950
Xiaoqi walking stealthily?

256
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:28,770
You...

257
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,550
Xiaoqi, explain.

258
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:35,870
I...

259
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,090
I was looking for something.

260
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:37,930
Xing’er.

261
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,600
You must know

262
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,000
what she was looking for.

263
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,530
Sure, I know.

264
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,780
Young Master, I was just

265
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,030
looking for a handkerchief.

266
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,080
I left it in your study the other day.

267
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,940
My sisters and I

268
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,460
have lost our family.

269
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,450
The handkerchief

270
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,540
was the only thing

271
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,620
from my mother.

272
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,010
Silly girl.

273
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,880
It doesn’t matter

274
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,190
when you can’t get back what is lost.

275
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,080
It’s enough

276
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,000
when we still remember our families

277
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,100
in our heart

278
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,730
and we’re still together.

279
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,020
Xiaoliu.

280
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,310
Stop being stupid, all right?

281
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,120
She moves others with emotions.

282
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,270
This trick always works.

283
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,430
But it only confuses mediocrities.

284
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:20,280
But Jinzhu,

285
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,770
I’d like to ask you.

286
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,770
In Young Master’s bedroom

287
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,780
are always orchids and pipal pots.

288
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,490
Why are there burning vines lately

289
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,230
without a reason?

290
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,990
So what?

291
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,520
Qingshan House is at a special location,

292
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,640
next to hot springs.

293
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,310
There are many injurious insects and snakes.

294
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,180
We usually

295
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,870
use the vermifuge

296
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,200
in case insects get into the room

297
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,270
and alert Young Master.

298
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,400
Burning vine is from Southern Xinjiang.

299
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,730
With a special smell,

300
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,110
it attracts snakes and insects

301
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,990
in a worse way than mentha,

302
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,880
willow herb and champion vine.

303
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,020
Even if

304
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,890
burning vine has a special smell,

305
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,640
it wouldn’t have attracted so many snakes.

306
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:00,670
So, Jinzhu,

307
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,830
you know

308
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,850
burning vine attracts snakes and insects?

309
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,080
Then Jinzhu,

310
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,200
what did you want

311
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,490
when you bought four pots of burning vine?

312
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,430
What could I want?

313
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,420
Young Master.

314
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,880
I’m always loyal to you

315
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,150
and will never betray you.

316
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,020
Young Master.

317
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,150
Since I began

318
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,100
to work for you,

319
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,570
I’ve been receiving bribery

320
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,300
from all branches.

321
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,390
I always decline them.

322
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,770
But they said

323
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,860
when Jinzhu worked there,

324
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,890
she took the bribery.

325
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,660
Ten taels from the Kitchen every month.

326
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,050
Ten taels from the Garden House.

327
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,500
Five taels from the Laundry House.

328
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,910
Five taels from the Needlework House.

329
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,680
Excluding other houses,

330
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,620
she managed to receive

331
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,440
thirty taels of silver every month

332
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,390
from these four places.

333
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,670
Nonsense!

334
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,470
Young Master, you’re born noble

335
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,240
and never care about money.

336
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,920
I guess you don’t know

337
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,940
the meaning of thirty tales of silver.

338
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,690
Let me

339
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,780
calculate it for you.

340
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,510
A maid like me

341
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,940
who is from a poor family

342
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,290
would be lucky

343
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,750
if she can be sold for ten taels of silver.

344
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,830
In this way,

345
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,120
Jinzhu could have

346
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,560
bought herself back

347
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,620
for three times

348
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,600
with the bribery every month.

349
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,630
Nonsense!

350
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,580
I didn’t take bribery

351
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,760
for buying the burning vine.

352
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,620
So,

353
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,210
you did take bribery for something else?

354
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,640
When someone takes bribery,

355
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,280
he’ll certainly do it again.

356
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,550
Young Master, I’m sorry.

357
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,940
I did receive a little silver

358
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,520
to buy jewels.

359
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,430
But I just want to look different

360
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,040
in front of you.

361
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,980
I was stupid and ignorant.

362
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,590
I didn’t mean harm.

363
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,790
Even if Jinzhu is greedy for money,

364
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,950
it doesn’t mean

365
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,290
she wanted to kill me.

366
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,600
A greedy girl has desire without doubt.

367
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,590
Once she has desire,

368
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,710
she’s easily bought.

369
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,880
Otherwise,

370
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,320
why was she instigated

371
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,670
and asked me to bring a Jade Dog

372
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,240
to Young Master’s room?

373
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,690
Anyways, the Jade Dog is broken.

374
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:47,530
When I deny it,

375
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:48,630
what can they do with me?

376
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,140
What Jade Dog?

377
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,080
Young Master.

378
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,700
I don’t know what she’s talking about.

379
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,450
Young Master, be careful!

380
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:07,610
Xing’er.

381
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,150
Young Master is already blind.

382
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,720
Why do you still try to hurt him with the Jade Dog?

383
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,880
How wicked you are!

384
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,380
Now, you’re exposed.

385
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,980
Yueqi, lock her up.

386
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,510
Somebody. Handcuff Jinzhu.

387
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,910
You should catch her.

388
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,970
You didn’t know what the Jade Dog was,

389
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,460
did you?

390
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,380
Then why did you know

391
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,670
it would hurt Young Master.

392
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,290
Where did you get the Jade Dog?

393
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,130
From Lady Dowager of the Third Branch.

394
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,150
Lady Dowager of the Third Branch?

395
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,650
She’s paralyzed in bed

396
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,730
and can’t do anything.

397
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,280
If you keep lying,

398
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,510
I’ll turn you

399
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,020
into her.

400
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,650
Don’t.

401
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,810
Young Master, I’ll confess.

402
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,260
It was... Butler Zhu.

403
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,960
He told me

404
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,260
the Jade Dog was a rare thing

405
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,600
from Northern Xinjiang

406
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,230
and it could help you with practice

407
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,310
when you locked yourself up.

408
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,470
And...

409
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,230
And Young Master Huai keeps one, too.

410
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,210
I didn’t know

411
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,160
you had cold disease.

412
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,460
I didn’t expect that.

413
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,670
I know I’m wrong.

414
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,540
Xing’er.

415
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,120
Punish Jinzhu yourself.

416
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,660
Young Master.

417
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,840
Don’t. Don’t.

418
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,180
I’m her enemy.

419
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,220
You all know that.

420
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,260
She’ll kill me.

421
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,570
Young Master, no.

422
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,100
Xing’er.

423
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,300
Young Master.

424
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:40,960
Young Master.

425
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,050
What?

426
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,110
It’s too brutal

427
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,830
if we beat her to death.

428
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,010
If Jinzhu has the chance to beat you,

429
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,060
she wouldn’t find it brutal

430
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,910
to do so.

431
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,730
I’m different from her.

432
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,820
Somebody! Take Jinzhu away

433
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,240
and flog her heavily for twenty times.

434
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:03,960
Aye.

435
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:16,330
Xing’er, you saved me. You’ll be rewarded.

436
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,770
Thank you, Young Master.

437
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,420
But Young Master,

438
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,200
the best reward for me

439
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,570
is to

440
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,470
have my sisters released

441
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,960
and let them live with me.

442
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,630
Okay, they will.

443
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,180
Young Master.

444
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,640
Why didn’t you kill Jinzhu

445
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,700
with this chance?

446
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,510
We don’t need to worry about her.

447
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,010
Mostly importantly,

448
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,280
I must make His Majesty believe that

449
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:03,450
my blindness was caused by the Jade Dog

450
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,610
from Yuwen Huai

451
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,960
and I couldn’t do the task

452
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,880
to frame Marquis Dingbei up.

453
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,060
What if

454
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,120
Yuwen Huai does it for you?

455
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,030
What do we do then?

456
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,490
Even if His Majesty wanted that,

457
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,880
he wouldn’t do it now.

458
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,790
As for Jinzhu,

459
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,390
I’ll see

460
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,200
how Xing’er can conquer her.

461
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,600
I see.

462
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,880
The mourning period is over.

463
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,230
Ask everyone in the House

464
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,550
to take off the mourning apparel.

465
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,090
You no longer need to pretend to be mourning?

466
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,520
Then isn’t it time to

467
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,380
take Xing’er as your concubine?

468
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,550
Young Master,

469
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,410
you’ve turned twenty.

470
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,440
You should...

471
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,230
Stop.

472
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,020
You mean

473
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,190
Yuwen Huai used the Jade Dog,

474
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,730
trying to

475
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,660
kill Yuwen Yue?

476
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,290
Precisely.

477
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:10,080
Yuwen Yue then had a relapse of cold disease

478
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,160
and turned blind.

479
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,990
How mean Yuwen Huai is!

480
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,360
To get the Eye of Intel,

481
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,090
he even tried to kill

482
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:18,910
his cousin of the same clan.

483
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,170
It’s said that

484
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,420
even the best judge becomes hopeless
at family matters.

485
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:29,190
The strive for power within big families

486
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,720
could be as cruel as

487
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,280
the wars

488
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,310
between countries.

489
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,200
It could be even more ruthless

490
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,520
and bloody.

491
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,660
If we want to

492
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,870
solve them openly,

493
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,310
we’ll be raking up our own faults.

494
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,830
The imperial court will be discredited

495
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,850
and I’ll be disgraced.

496
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,950
Will we just

497
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,810
let it go?

498
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,220
We can’t.

499
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,480
But the priority is

500
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,230
to pick a wise man

501
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,510
to restart the Eye of Intel

502
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,700
so that it will work for me.

503
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,270
Do you have a candidate,

504
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,050
Your Majesty?

505
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,790
I had thought

506
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,730
Yuwen Yue was the best person

507
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,330
to take over the Eye of Intel,

508
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,950
considering his great ability.

509
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,340
But when I asked him

510
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,270
to collect the evidence of rebellion in Yanbei,

511
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,290
he dared to disobey me.

512
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:42,120
How can I not worry

513
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:45,270
when he controls the Eye of Intel?

514
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:49,520
That’s right. It’s wise of you, Your Majesty.

515
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,910
Seems like

516
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,410
Yuwen Yue also pretends to be loyal

517
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,000
and filial

518
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,090
just like Yuwen Zhuo.

519
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,350
Besides, he doesn’t have many soldiers

520
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,870
or friends.

521
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,830
Yuwen Huai, however, is vicious.

522
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,640
He doesn’t even care for his families.

523
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,040
He also has many local soldiers

524
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,660
under his own command.

525
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,800
With a lot of friends,

526
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,870
he should be the perfect choice.

527
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,860
Would you like to summon him right now?

528
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,750
No. No.

529
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,720
Let me think about it carefully.

530
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:38,070
Fine. I’ll leave you alone, Your Majesty.

531
00:26:54,540 --> 00:27:00,110
Here comes the imperial edict.
Yuwen Yue, come and get it.

532
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,940
According to destiny and trend of times,

533
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,850
His Majesty gives an order.

534
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,780
General Yuwen, you’re too sick for the mission.

535
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,450
What a pity! With the concern for you,

536
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,050
the imperial envoy will take back
your commander’s tally.

537
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:26,520
Hope you’ll recover soon.

538
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,730
Respect this.

539
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,350
Okay. Thank you, Your Majesty.

540
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:36,450
Yuwen Huai, you hurt your cousin Yuwen Yue

541
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,620
with the Jade Dog.

542
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,200
You weren’t deliberate.

543
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,180
But you shouldn’t have done that.

544
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,280
You’ll be grounded to reflect on yourself.

545
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,100
= Imperial Edict =

546
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,110
Come and get it.

547
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,170
This is the good news

548
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,150
you said we could have in three days?

549
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,500
You’re disgracing our branch

550
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,460
just like your dead father.

551
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,330
What do you want me to do, Butler Zhu?

552
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,310
Young Master Huai is very unsatisfied with you.

553
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,380
He ordered you

554
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:47,100
not to mess with Jing Xiaoliu

555
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,050
for the moment.

556
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:49,000
Got it?

557
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,240
What? But...

558
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:56,380
You even want to disobey Young Master Huai?

559
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,770
I don’t dare to.

560
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:04,150
That’s fine, then.

561
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,720
Vixen. I don’t think

562
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,770
I can’t kill you.

563
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:31,800
Hurry.

564
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:38,630
By then,

565
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:40,190
create a disturbance with them.

566
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,690
I’ll teach the Jing sisters

567
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:42,410
a lesson.

568
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:44,340
Go.

569
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,280
Go.

570
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:15,490
Snakes! Snakes!

571
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,620
Snakes!

572
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,880
There are snakes!

573
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,450
Run! Quickly!

574
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:22,750
Snakes!

575
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,140
What do we do?

576
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,220
Why are there

577
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:27,860
so many snakes and insects in the room

578
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,210
when it’s in the day?

579
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,160
Who can be so wicked?

580
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,350
Who is scaring us

581
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,240
with such snacks and insects?

582
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,190
Yeah.

583
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,000
Oh, I know.

584
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,200
Jinzhu.

585
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,600
What do you know?

586
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,920
Jinsi, who do you think

587
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,520
could have done this?

588
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,780
Jinzhu.

589
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:56,210
You mean Xing’er?

590
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,370
- Xing’er?
- Normally,

591
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:00,810
only the Jing sisters aren’t scared of snakes.

592
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,070
- Yes.
- That’s right.

593
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,240
- She’s right.
- Yeah.

594
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,440
How vicious

595
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,650
they are!

596
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,060
We can’t let them think

597
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,320
we’re pushovers.

598
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,360
Yes. Yes. Yes.

599
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,640
We can’t let them bully us.

600
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,650
Go. Go to her room and look for evidence.

601
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,520
Go. Go. Go.

602
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,010
Go for the evidence.

603
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:17,880
Go find it in her room.

604
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,730
Go. Go.

605
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:33,940
What do you come for?

606
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:38,010
It’s been raining lately.

607
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,270
Rooms are damp.

608
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,760
See? There are cockroaches and fleas.

609
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,740
Butler Zhu asked us

610
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,660
to bring insecticide to each place.

611
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,420
We bring some to you, too.

612
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,080
Give it to me.

613
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,720
Butler Zhu asked

614
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,890
Jinzhu and me

615
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,570
to spray it

616
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:00,290
in every room.

617
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,920
It’s our duty.

618
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,120
How can I have you do it?

619
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:06,150
I think

620
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,860
you come for something else!

621
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,130
Go. Look for it.

622
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,430
Go. Look carefully.

623
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:13,360
Is there any?

624
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:13,930
I find nothing here.

625
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:14,520
You...

626
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:15,830
You...

627
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,530
I find nothing here, too.

628
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:18,380
What about there?

629
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,780
Go check over there.

630
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:20,970
I believe I’ll find it.

631
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,740
- Look carefully.
- Jinzhu.

632
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,240
You haven’t learnt your lesson!

633
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,220
How dare you come

634
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,020
and make trouble in our room?

635
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:26,850
Don’t you fear

636
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,270
my sister will avenge us?

637
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,270
Is there any?

638
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:29,910
- No.
- Fear?

639
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:30,960
- Go look over there.
- There isn’t any.

640
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,010
Check here.

641
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,600
- Check over there.
- I find nothing here.

642
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,030
Where are they hiding it?

643
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,460
You’re not looking carefully.

644
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,080
Keep looking. There.

645
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,350
Where are they keeping it?

646
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:42,730
See?

647
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,330
I slapped you.

648
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,830
Ask her to slap me back.

649
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,280
Jinzhu!

650
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:56,900
Uh...

651
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,540
Are you crazy?

652
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:00,700
Xiaoliu.

653
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,170
Who allowed you in?

654
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,130
Butler Zhu.

655
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:04,970
I wasn’t asking you.

656
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:07,980
Didn’t you understand

657
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,950
what I asked?

658
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,520
Who allowed you in?

659
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,260
Butler Zhu asked us

660
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,920
to spray some insecticide.

661
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:17,770
Did he?

662
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:19,230
Does Butler Zhu

663
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,600
work for Qingshan House?

664
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,700
Since when

665
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,140
must we

666
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,210
take his order?

667
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,740
Butler Zhu works for the whole mansion.

668
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:27,180
Why can’t he

669
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,400
give order to us?

670
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,140
Oh, that explains.

671
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,110
Jinzhu.

672
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,150
I’m new here

673
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,230
and I don’t know the rules.

674
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,540
Shall I go

675
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,800
and ask Young Master Yue?

676
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,350
What do you think?

677
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,050
Xing’er, we don’t know

678
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,620
this is an order from Butler Zhu.

679
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,280
We came,

680
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,120
under the command of Jinzhu.

681
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,310
Besides,

682
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,840
it’s not a big deal.

683
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,600
You don’t need to bother Young Master Yue.

684
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:54,840
Yeah.

685
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,950
I think this room

686
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,840
is very clean.

687
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,400
There’s no cockroach or flea.

688
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,730
We’ve got work to do.

689
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,530
We’re leaving, then.

690
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,610
- Yes.
- Let’s go. Go.

691
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:04,880
Let’s get to work. Go.

692
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,510
- Let’s get to work.
- Hurry.

693
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,080
What, Jinzhu?

694
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,520
Want some more talk?

695
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:17,490
Go.

696
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,740
Xiaoba, are you okay?

697
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,000
Yes.

698
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,360
Weird.

699
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,380
What we hid

700
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,540
under her bed

701
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,260
was all gone.

702
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,530
No way.

703
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,930
I’ve been keeping an eye on her.

704
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:41,640
She has barely left Qingshan House.

705
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,490
Barely?

706
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,100
I’m sure

707
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,000
she wasn’t away for too long.

708
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,660
If that pot is still

709
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,400
inside the mansion,

710
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:55,410
she’ll find a chance to throw it away.

711
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,590
When she gives herself away,

712
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,370
the old case

713
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,690
would be reversed.

714
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:02,650
By then,

715
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:04,640
Xing’er will be doomed.

716
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,490
So, they really hid some snakes

717
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:31,630
under our bed?

718
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,650
Xing’er.

719
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,110
When did you find that?

720
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:36,580
When I was on night duty.

721
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,090
Shouldn’t we get rid of

722
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,300
the snakes immediately?

723
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,600
Or those stupid things

724
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,650
Xiaoqi did

725
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,190
would be brought up again.

726
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,370
If Young Master Yue

727
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,870
keeps checking on it,

728
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,290
we’ll be doomed.

729
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:02,760
No.

730
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,370
We can’t get rid of them now.

731
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,840
Jinzhu is waiting

732
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,590
for that.

733
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,010
Uh, Xing’er.

734
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,360
What are you going to do?

735
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,400
Jinzhu must be involved in

736
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,840
Linxi’s death.

737
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,050
I’ll use her

738
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,630
to find out the real murderer.

739
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,200
Little cat covers its poo.

740
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,300
Young Master,

741
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,530
you’re saying something weird again.

742
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,650
I don’t understand.

743
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,950
You really don’t?

744
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,600
Jinzhu is stupid.

745
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,360
But compared to her,

746
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,800
you’re not much wiser.

747
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,350
Don’t think I don’t know

748
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,710
who released the snakes.

749
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:25,850
Young Master, you’re thinking too much again.

750
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,710
I’ll go make the tea for you.

751
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,020
Burning vine.

752
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,470
Mosquitoes brought birds.

753
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,520
Birds brought snakes.

754
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,120
It’s a complicated trick.

755
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,300
But you only fooled

756
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,370
stupid Jinzhu.

757
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,670
It hurts, Young Master.

758
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,480
All you alright?

759
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:54,280
I’m fine.

760
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,780
Thank you for the care.

761
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,000
Young Master.

762
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,330
You saved me.

763
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,760
I just want to live a safe life

764
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,850
and serve you.

765
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,120
As for dealing with Jinzhu,

766
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,490
I don’t dare to think more of it.

767
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,370
I don’t dare to cheat you, either.

768
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,840
Don’t dare to think more of it?

769
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:16,260
I’m afraid you’ve got a plan already.

770
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,020
You’re doing better.

771
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,090
But you’d better

772
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,010
not leave things to luck.

773
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:26,770
Be careful and don’t let me know.

774
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:31,060
Go. Don’t stand here and offend my eye.

775
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,230
Offend your eye? Could you see?

776
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:34,860
You think I can’t hear

777
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,570
when I’m blind?

778
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,540
Sorry, Young Master.

779
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,900
You don’t see things now.

780
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,850
But you see everything in your heart.

781
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,300
Do you want everyone in Chang’an

782
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,200
to know

783
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,500
I can’t see?

784
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,240
Sorry, Young Master.

785
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,580
I’ll never say

786
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,860
you’re blind again.

787
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,970
Jinsi, finally, they’re finally taking action.

788
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,100
What?

789
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,680
Go tell Butler Zhu

790
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,690
I’ve found the evidence

791
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:16,250
that the Jing sisters

792
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,320
tried to kill Young Master Yue.

793
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:18,850
Okay. I’m going right away.

794
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:20,980
Wait.

795
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,550
Ask Yueqi to come

796
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,800
and be the witness.

797
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,660
I’ll see

798
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,140
how the Jing sisters can deny.

799
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,400
Jing Xiaoqi.

800
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:53,070
Morning, Jinzhu.

801
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,450
It’s early in the morning.

802
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,710
Where are you going?

803
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,790
I...

804
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,830
What’s in the pot?

805
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,250
May I have a look?

806
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,980
There’s nothing to look at.

807
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,970
Jinzhu.

808
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,200
If you have nothing else to say,

809
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,430
I’ll leave.

810
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,370
Leave?

811
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,740
You can’t leave that easily.

812
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,760
Open the pot and show me.

813
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,970
It’s mine.

814
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:22,330
Why must I show you?

815
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,590
You don’t, huh?

816
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,250
You broke my honey pot.

817
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:41,190
Honey?

818
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,230
Sure, it is.

819
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,480
What else do you think it is?

820
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,470
Oh, I see.

821
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:47,080
You set a trap

822
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,720
to trick me, huh?

823
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,930
What trap?

824
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:51,180
Don’t think you can act against reason

825
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,480
just because you’re a Silver Bell?

826
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,770
Pay for my honey,

827
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:54,950
or I won’t let you go.

828
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,330
It’s still early.

829
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,440
Why is Yan Xun’s horse here?

830
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,720
Wait.

831
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:04,440
You didn’t expect to see me here,

832
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,910
did you?

833
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,040
What? The pot is the evidence that

834
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,860
you tried to kill Young Master, huh?

835
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,570
You can’t get away this time.

836
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,660
So what,

837
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,660
Jinzhu?

838
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,110
I want nothing else,

839
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:20,390
but to see you

840
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,840
killed and skinned

841
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,570
so that I’ll be satisfied.

842
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,570
Do you?

843
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,800
Come and get it.

844
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,900
You hear the footsteps, huh?

845
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,260
Everybody is coming.

846
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,060
Stop playing smart.

847
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,470
Take your time

848
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:43,480
and think carefully about

849
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,890
what you can explain.

850
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:47,080
You can’t get away this time.

851
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:48,940
I can’t.

852
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:50,570
