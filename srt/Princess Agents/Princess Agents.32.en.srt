Bravo! Bravo!

Bravo!

18
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,810
What?

19
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,490
Why don’t you wear the dress

20
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,730
I gave you?

21
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,080
I think this dress looks good.

22
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,590
No, not at all.

23
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,600
It doesn’t suit you at all.

24
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,910
I think it suits me very well.

25
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,380
Yan Xun, it doesn’t suit her,

26
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,350
does it?

27
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,530
I also think it suits her well.

28
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,580
No, not at all!

29
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,910
What a poor taste you have!

30
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,130
Put on the dress I gave you.

31
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,670
Or I will be angry.

32
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,310
Come here, Your Highness!

33
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,120
Okay.

34
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,300
Put it on.

35
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,000
Or I will be angry.

36
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:33,530
I’m leaving.

37
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,890
Achu, wait here for me.

38
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:43,860
I’ll go propose a toast.

39
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,270
Okay.

40
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,670
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

41
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,730
There you are.

42
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,400
Do you still remember me?

43
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,710
In Chang’an,

44
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,230
everyone knows you.

45
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,240
Look.

46
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,480
This place has a real buzz.

47
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,890
However,

48
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,290
everybody has secrets.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,790
What do you think?

50
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,950
Your words are too deep for me.

51
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,800
I don’t understand.

52
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,610
Come on. Come on.

53
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,880
Cheers.

54
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,130
Come on, cheers.

55
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:43,510
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

56
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,680
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

57
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,060
Your Excellency, long time no see.

58
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,110
Would you like to drink with us?

59
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,330
I’m not good at drinking.

60
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,330
And I have drunk a lot earlier.

61
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,370
Sorry, but I’ll leave you alone.

62
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,890
You want to leave?

63
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,660
I hear

64
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,770
your maid is still alive.

65
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,110
You hide her well.

66
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,600
Wasn’t she Yuwen Yue’s maid?

67
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,340
Why is she your maid now?

68
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,150
You sound so domineering!

69
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,800
Don’t you fear

70
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,170
you might get your family in trouble?

71
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,860
Why must I? Your family has declined.

72
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,160
I am not afraid of you at all.

73
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,300
If I remember it clearly,

74
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,230
Young Master Wei,

75
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,000
your restriction has just been lifted.

76
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,900
Such a long-time restriction

77
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,140
couldn’t make you restrain yourself.

78
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,070
No wonder your father thinks more highly

79
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,040
of your elder brother

80
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,760
Wei Shuye.

81
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,300
What do you mean?

82
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,950
You’d better not talk rubbish!

83
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,310
Young Master Wei,

84
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,060
I just told the truth.

85
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,640
Why do you get angry about it?

86
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,720
Believe it or not,

87
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,380
you will not leave
the hunting field alive!

88
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,760
Your Excellency, I’m sorry.

89
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,880
He drank too much.

90
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,360
Please forgive him.

91
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,500
None of your business!

92
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,340
Shut up!

93
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,980
Look what a place

94
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,850
you’re in!

95
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,200
Fine. Forget it.

96
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,920
Let’s go. Go.

97
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,760
When you go back, tell Yan Xun.

98
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,720
Many people are keeping an eye on him

99
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,620
in Chang’an City.

100
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,300
He’d better behave himself.

101
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,250
If he dare to

102
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,200
cross the line,

103
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,490
I won’t let him go.

104
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,550
Young Master Yue, don’t worry.

105
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,780
Yan Xun and I

106
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,780
have behaved ourselves in Chang’an

107
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,170
over so many years.

108
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,120
We are accustomed to it.

109
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,860
Don’t worry about us.

110
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,090
Fine. I hope so.

111
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,650
Awesome! Bravo!

112
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,030
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

113
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,430
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

114
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,920
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

115
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,440
Somebody!

116
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,870
Award Princess Zhama.

117
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,790
I don’t want any reward.

118
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,000
This is the first time
I’ve come to Chang’an.

119
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,640
Your Majesty,

120
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,230
could you allow me to challenge someone?

121
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,910
Well, Princess Zhama.

122
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,450
Who do you want to challenge?

123
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,800
I have long heard

124
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,870
His Excellency Yan Xun’s maid
has great martial arts.

125
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,590
But I didn’t have the chance
to see it with my own eyes.

126
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,920
As we are all in high spirits,

127
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,030
why don’t we try it?

128
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,870
Yan Xun.

129
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,150
You may rise.

130
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,430
Your Majesty,

131
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,580
my maid could do

132
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,020
very few martial arts.

133
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,130
She will make a fool of herself.

134
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,240
Besides, we know

135
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,300
Princess Zhama has exquisite horsemanship

136
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,550
and exceptional martial arts.

137
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,800
I don’t think

138
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,050
she needs to prove that.

139
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,950
Your Excellency.

140
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,260
My sister just wants a competition

141
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,390
against your maid.

142
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,790
Couldn’t you do her the favor?

143
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,310
A man of virtue always helps others.

144
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,720
Now that our distinguished guest is

145
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,340
in such a mood for competition,

146
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,640
why don’t you just let them do it?

147
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,580
Yan Xun.

148
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,350
Today, we dine with guests from the North

149
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,160
to have fun together.

150
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,060
Don’t be

151
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,810
such a killjoy!

152
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,000
Just let them do it.

153
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,300
Your Majesty,

154
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,060
Princess Zhama has just finished her show

155
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,350
and hasn’t been restored.

156
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,380
Isn’t it too unfair

157
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,860
to let her fight again?

158
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,090
Your Majesty,

159
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,570
may I have my subordinate Shida

160
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,960
compete with her first?

161
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,750
If she wins,

162
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,010
I’ll fight her.

163
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,020
Alright.

164
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,820
It’s not a good idea. It’s unfair.

165
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,740
Princess Zhama is a noble girl.

166
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,550
It’s inappropriate for her

167
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,590
to fight a maid.

168
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,100
Besides,

169
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,620
she just performed equestrianism.

170
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,930
Your Highness.

171
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,690
That is just a maid.

172
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,690
She doesn’t need fairness.

173
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,950
Xifeng, you make sense.

174
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,770
We are just seeking pleasure.

175
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,990
Well, say no more.

176
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,380
Let’s get it started.

177
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,380
Be careful.

178
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,350
Achu.

179
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,500
- Well done!
- Bravo!

180
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,440
He didn’t kill her?

181
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,230
Let’s wait and see.

182
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,930
Princess Zhama won’t

183
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,050
let her go.

184
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,360
Your Grace, are you ready?

185
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,600
If you still feel tired,

186
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,870
let’s drop the competition then.

187
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,000
Come on, then!

188
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,400
I’m not afraid of a maid like you.

189
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,100
Let’s have an archery competition.

190
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,100
Each of us has three arrows

191
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,870
and we’ll shoot each other.

192
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,290
Whoever gets shot loses.

193
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,900
Your Grace, you’re a noble girl.

194
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,330
How could you get hurt in such a game?

195
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,090
Why not shoot the target?

196
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,990
What’s the fun of that?

197
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,630
People in our family

198
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,140
are best at archery.

199
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,880
I don’t believe

200
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,380
a maid could defeat me.

201
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,950
I have an idea.

202
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,860
Princess Zhama uses normal arrows

203
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,640
while the maid uses

204
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,840
headless arrows.

205
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,820
Then Princess Zhama won’t get hurt

206
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,960
even if she gets shot.

207
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,050
Are you kidding?

208
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,760
You’re bullying her, aren’t you?

209
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,370
She is just a maid.

210
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,030
No one cares even if she’s killed.

211
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,300
Zhao Xifeng!

212
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,330
I’m okay to compete with Princess Zhama

213
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,400
with headless arrows.

214
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,910
You win.

215
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,190
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

216
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,050
Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!

217
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,670
Who are you?

218
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,590
Your Majesty, my name is Chu Qiao.

219
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,520
I haven’t seen

220
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,700
such great archery

221
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,300
for many years.

222
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,900
It’s also harder for a girl like you

223
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,550
to achieve this.

224
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,180
Father, she has won.

225
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,300
Why don’t you

226
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,580
award her?

227
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,670
Fine.

228
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,550
Award Chu Qiao ten thousand taels of gold.

229
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:01,710
Award Princess Zhama
ten thousand taels of gold.

230
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,590
Thank you, Your Majesty.

231
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,560
Thank you, Your Majesty.

232
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,300
Your Majesty.

233
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,450
Chu Qiao was a maid in Qingshan House.

234
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,340
Before she was set free,
she went over to another master.

235
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,080
According to our law,

236
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,230
fugitive slaves should be killed.

237
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,240
Father.

238
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,060
Chu Qiao is a slave indeed.

239
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,920
But she brings honor to us tonight.

240
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,710
It’s not appropriate

241
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,340
to punish her now.

242
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,110
A fugitive slave is always
a fugitive slave.

243
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,490
If she can get away
just by winning a competition,

244
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,480
how will our laws work?

245
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,960
You make sense, Your Grace.

246
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,670
Your Majesty, please kill her

247
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,420
according to our law.

248
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,840
Your Majesty,

249
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,970
Chu Qiao was once my maid.

250
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,140
But she has been freed.

251
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,030
I prepared the slave-releasing certificate
long ago.

252
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,610
But I went to the borders so hurriedly

253
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,660
three years ago

254
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,370
that I didn’t give it to her

255
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,590
in time.

256
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,920
Now she is already free

257
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,130
and she’s no longer a slave.

258
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,680
Right, Xing’er?

259
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,090
Your Majesty,

260
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,880
Young Master Yue is right.

261
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,990
Then you can go to his house

262
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,430
and get the slave-releasing certificate.

263
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,530
Fine. Let’s continue to enjoy ourselves.

264
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,670
Thank you, Your Majesty.

265
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,810
Wei, have you got ready

266
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,340
for tomorrow’s plan?

267
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:49,040
Don’t worry. I’ve got everything ready.

268
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,240
From tomorrow on,

269
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,510
the last man of Yanbei will be dead.

270
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,270
Report!

271
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,990
Young Master, everything is ready

272
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:07,910
for tomorrow’s plan.

273
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,870
Good! Stick to the plan.

274
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,880
Aye.

275
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,050
I have arranged assassins

276
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,360
along the way Yan Xun will go.

277
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,700
Tomorrow, he will walk in our trap.

278
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,200
That damn slave

279
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,860
survived today.

280
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,240
But I swear

281
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,970
with my family honor

282
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,230
that she won’t survive tomorrow.

283
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,840
It’s lucky for Yan Xun

284
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,540
to get killed

285
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,710
by my arrow.

286
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,280
You are back?

287
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,830
Is everything ready?

288
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,660
Everything is ready.

289
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,670
When you competed with Zhama,

290
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,670
Zhao Xifeng and Wei Shuyou

291
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,350
were more nervous.

292
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,060
They were waiting to see you

293
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,830
get killed.

294
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,730
However, they don’t know

295
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,840
you have great marital arts now.

296
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,140
They’re all here,

297
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,310
except Yuwen Huai.

298
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,020
He?

299
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,410
He found himself a scapegoat.

300
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,470
He was relegated for three levels,

301
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,910
but managed to live.

302
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,060
Recently,

303
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,320
he can’t come

304
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,410
to such a banquet.

305
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,140
He’ll escape again.

306
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,160
They want me to fall into their trap.

307
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,510
I also want them to fall into mine.

308
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,830
Where is he going?

309
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,320
No matter where he goes,

310
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,680
he will be dead meat!

311
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,120
But our helpers haven’t come yet.

312
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,190
There are nine of us now.

313
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,860
Can’t we defeat Yan Xun?

314
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,120
Coward.

315
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,790
Follow up!

316
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,160
Follow him closely!

317
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,790
Go take him down!

318
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,820
Yan Xun.

319
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,400
I’ll fight you with my life!

320
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,920
Young Master Zhao, don’t leave so quickly.

321
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,240
Yan Xun, what you’ve done to me today,

322
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,100
I’ll pay you back blow for blow!

323
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,120
One day,

324
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,370
I will make you regret

325
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,670
living in this world!

326
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,610
Yan Xun.

327
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,850
Now you look

328
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,280
so much like someone else.

329
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,730
I mean your sister.

330
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,640
Your families

331
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,210
all look alike.

332
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,910
I still remember her pretty eyes.

333
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,290
I shot her from behind.

334
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,650
She died dissatisfied
with the baby in her.

335
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:20,640
Yan Xun, Yanbei has been destroyed.

336
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,910
Your family

337
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,960
has been decapitated without dignity.

338
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,800
You’re the only one alive

339
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,430
who lives a life without dignity!

340
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,720
Dare you kill me?

341
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,370
Do it!

342
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,790
You’re just giving a swashbuckling.

343
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,740
Once you kill me,

344
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:45,160
the hunting will end!

345
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,660
My family will not

346
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,210
let you go!

347
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,320
You like that maid,

348
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,620
don’t you?

349
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,520
By then, you will die with her

350
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,260
and meet your family

351
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,100
in the hell!

352
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,100
That’s all you can do.

353
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,930
It’s time for you

354
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,650
to apologize to my family in the hell.

355
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,030
Achu, you may leave first.

356
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,170
Be careful on your way.

357
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,520
Young Master Yue.

358
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,630
Is everybody back?

359
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,170
Yes, except Zhao Xifeng.

360
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,020
- Young Master Zhao!
- Young Master Zhao!

361
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,600
Young Master Zhao!

362
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,660
Young Master Zhao!

363
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,000
Where are you?

364
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,280
Young Master Zhao! Young Master Zhao!

365
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,720
Where are you, Young Master Zhao?

366
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,640
Young Master Zhao!

367
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,330
Young Master Zhao!

368
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,360
You two. Go check it.

369
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:42,970
Aye.

370
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,710
Your Majesty.

371
00:24:59,070 --> 00:24:59,960
We found his body

372
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,870
in the forest outside the hunting field.

373
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,750
At that time,

374
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,920
his body was already torn up

375
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,900
by wild animals.

376
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,490
It’s my fault, Your Majesty.

377
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,620
Please punish me.

378
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,640
You are just responsible
for the security in the hunting field.

379
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,840
Zhao Xifeng died

380
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,990
outside the hunting field.

381
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,500
I won’t blame you.

382
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,220
You may rise.

383
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,900
This is the jade pendant

384
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,010
I gave you.

385
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,280
But it was found

386
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,510
beside Zhao Xifeng’s body.

387
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,830
How will you explain?

388
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,530
Your Majesty,

389
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,750
I lost it accidentally

390
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,510
yesterday,

391
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,150
and I couldn’t find it anywhere.

392
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,120
I was very nervous.

393
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,730
I don’t know

394
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:58,870
why it was found

395
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:59,690
beside Young Master Zhao’s body.

396
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,670
Please kindly check it, Your Majesty.

397
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,680
Your Majesty, Yan Xun never

398
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,000
gets on well with Zhao Xifeng.

399
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,740
He must have

400
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,390
killed Zhao Xifeng

401
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,880
when the latter was out for hunting.

402
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,870
Wei Shuyou!

403
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,880
Don’t slander me!

404
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,230
Slander you?

405
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,980
If it weren’t you,

406
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,420
why did they find the jade pendant

407
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,010
His Majesty gave you

408
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:23,720
beside Zhao Xifeng’s body?

409
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,390
You!

410
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:32,290
Your Majesty, it’s not true.

411
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:35,790
I think

412
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,210
you killed Young Master Zhao

413
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,990
and framed me up.

414
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,780
Yan Xun.

415
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,430
Don’t talk nonsense!

416
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,790
Your Majesty, it must be true.

417
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,190
At the banquet last night,

418
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,280
Wei Shuyou argued with me

419
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,660
on purpose.

420
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:52,920
I think

421
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,250
he just wanted to steal the jade pendant

422
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:54,980
from my waistband.

423
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,710
Your Majesty, a lot of people

424
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:58,760
can be my witnesses!

425
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,250
Father,

426
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,510
I did see them argue

427
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,670
last night.

428
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,660
Your Highness, mind your words.

429
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,340
I did argue with Yan Xun,

430
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,980
but I didn’t steal his jade pendant.

431
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,540
Your Majesty, Yan Xun is talking nonsense!

432
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,520
He is the murderer!

433
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:22,790
Your Majesty.

434
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:25,030
I’m not talking nonsense.

435
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,790
But Wei Shuyou has framed me up

436
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,950
again and again!

437
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:30,840
That was also why

438
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,350
you locked me up

439
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,740
in Oriole Courtyard.

440
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,800
It’s wise of His Majesty.

441
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,390
He won’t be cheated by your little trick.

442
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:41,820
Yan Xun, you don’t have the guts
to admit what you did.

443
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,680
You’re not a real man!

444
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,790
Yuwen Yue, what do you think?

445
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,460
Your Majesty.

446
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,710
His Excellency Yan Xun

447
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,470
can be the prime suspect.

448
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,910
But yesterday,

449
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,010
Zhao Xifeng left with three attendants.

450
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,020
He was killed.

451
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,500
And his attendants are missing.

452
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,280
As I see it,

453
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,430
why don’t we

454
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,940
make a final decision

455
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,370
after finding the three attendants

456
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,870
instead of judging the case now?

457
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,440
Your Majesty, Concubine Zhao is so sad

458
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,330
that she has been crying.

459
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,630
She passed out again just now.

460
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,970
Go get an imperial physician for her.

461
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,660
We’ve got one.

462
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,060
That’s enough, then. Leave.

463
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,560
Aye.

464
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:50,870
Yuwen Yue,

465
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,720
I’ll leave the case to you.

466
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,290
Your Majesty.

467
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,810
Too many people are involved in this case.

468
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,500
If I investigate it alone,

469
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,320
I’m afraid I can’t convince them.

470
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:04,310
Why don’t you leave it

471
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,310
to Prince Yu or Prince Xiang

472
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,150
for fairness?

473
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:11,420
Father.

474
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,340
I don’t know how to solve a case.

475
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,040
Have my brother do it.

476
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,460
Fine. Che.

477
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,890
Here.

478
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:26,130
Take care of the case.

479
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:26,830
Remember.

480
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,990
It must be handled justly, understand?

481
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,060
Aye.

482
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,380
So much for the hunting.

483
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:36,650
Somebody! I’m getting back to the palace.

484
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,050
Go get ready for that.

485
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:42,910
Somebody.

486
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,350
Here.

487
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,710
Hand out the portraits

488
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,670
of Zhao Xifeng’s attendants.

489
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:49,750
Find them,

490
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,230
whatever it takes.

491
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:51,740
Aye.

492
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,120
Lock His Excellency Yan Xun up

493
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,260
before there’s a decision.

494
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,150
Take him away.

495
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,310
Please, Your Excellency.

496
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,580
Young Master.

497
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,680
What happened?

498
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,070
If His Excellency Yan Xu

499
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,340
really killed Zhao Xifeng,

500
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,350
Xing’er will also be implicated

501
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,480
as his maid.

502
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,850
Don’t you worry about her?

503
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,070
There’s no need to worry.

504
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:33,710
Young Master.

505
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,270
Let’s just wait

506
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,550
and see how it goes.

507
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,590
Aye.

508
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,830
Search this place!

509
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,860
Aye!

510
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:51,990
And over there!

511
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,950
Aye!

512
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,070
Come here, all of you!

513
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,200
You two, go down and have a look.

514
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,910
Aye.

515
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,900
Where did you find the bodies?

516
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,140
In the forest

517
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:01,910
outside the hunting field.

518
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:02,950
Less than

519
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,290
1.5 kilometers away

520
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,540
from Young Master Zhao’s body.

521
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,470
What have you got?

522
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:35,710
Send some guards

523
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,120
to carry Zhao Xifeng’s body

524
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,870
to me.

525
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:41,580
And, go to Wei Shuyou’s tent

526
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,630
and borrow a Spiral Arrow from him.

527
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,130
Aye.

528
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,030
Look, Your Highness.

529
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,930
There is only a fatal injury in his body.

530
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,720
I compared him with other bodies,

531
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,880
they all had the fatal injuries

532
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,100
in the same place.

533
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,070
The injury is spiral.

534
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,900
It was made by Wei Shuyou’s Spiral Arrow.

535
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:22,330
That’s his special weapon

536
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,120
that no one else has.

537
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,070
Who do you think

538
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,030
is the real murderer?

539
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,310
Wei Shuyou.

540
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,870
Is this your Spiral Arrow?

541
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,250
Yes.

542
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,430
It’s your unique weapon, isn’t it?

543
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,660
It’s extremely hard

544
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,710
to forge the head of Spiral Arrows.

545
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,340
Among the finished products,

546
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,600
many must be scrapped.

547
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,650
Only very few can be used.

548
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,840
Does it mean

549
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,710
such arrows are precious?

550
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:15,790
They are.

551
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,430
But there could also be copies.

552
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,970
So, as you know,

553
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:22,040
who else uses such arrows in this place,

554
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,950
except you?

555
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,130
I don’t know.

556
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,170
Zhao Xifeng and his three attendants

557
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,010
were shot by such arrows.

558
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,170
How do you explain this?

559
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,290
It’s... It’s impossible!

560
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,060
It had nothing to do with me.

561
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,110
I didn’t kill him!

562
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,270
Yesterday,

563
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:43,840
people saw you go out

564
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,910
with Zhao Xifeng

565
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:45,610
and his attendants.

566
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:46,450
Where have you been?

567
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:48,340
We... We went hunting.

568
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,180
But why did no one come back,

569
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:50,560
except you?

570
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,180
When they were missing for the whole day,

571
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,360
why didn’t you tell us?

572
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,540
I didn’t notice that.

573
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:55,980
But, Zhao Xifeng’s death

574
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,090
has nothing to do with me.

575
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,710
Wei Shuyou, you insist

576
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,710
his death has nothing to do with you.

577
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,720
Now I’m going to search

578
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,660
your tent.

579
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,480
Okay.

580
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,350
Your Highness.

581
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,220
This box cannot be opened.

582
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,120
Split it!

583
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:50,560
Aye.

584
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,190
Wait!

585
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:53,440
This box was crafted

586
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,320
by Master Lu Ban’s disciples.

587
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,280
It would be a shame to destroy it.

588
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:58,870
I will open it.

589
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:14,240
Look please.

590
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,600
Your Highness.

591
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,230
We’ve found nothing in it.

592
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,630
Your Highness,
you had everywhere searched.

593
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,930
Now am I innocent?

594
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,670
Your Highness, there is an interlayer
at the bottom.

595
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,040
A precious box like this

596
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:48,860
made by masters

597
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,430
usually has an interlayer.

598
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:04,670
Your Highness.

599
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,850
Well, a man like me enjoys this.

600
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,340
Your Highness, there’s something in it.

601
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,630
Deployment diagram for Yanbei?

602
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,190
This...

603
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,690
Wei Shuyou.

604
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,090
What else do you want to say?

605
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:07,630
Your Majesty, someone framed me up!

606
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,280
Please check it!

607
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,820
Your Majesty, the fief of the Wei family

608
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,670
is very close to Yanbei.

609
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,250
They always want to take our fief.

610
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:18,930
Over the past years,

611
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,200
they have sent countless killers

612
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,500
to Oriole Courtyard!

613
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,840
Everyone knows that!

614
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,430
That night,

615
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,880
Wei Shuyou stole my jade pendant

616
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,090
from my waistband,

617
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,850
killed Zhao Xifeng,

618
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,140
and framed me up

619
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,790
so that I would be executed.

620
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,030
In this way,

621
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,080
Yanbei will lose its master!

622
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,040
Then his family will have a chance

623
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,040
to occupy Yanbei!

624
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:45,990
Unexpectedly, he was caught
in his own trap!

625
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,510
Yan Xun, this is nonsense!

626
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:49,880
Your Majesty!

627
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,150
My son Xifeng has been your friend

628
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,600
since you were little.

629
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,410
But you killed him

630
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:57,030
just for selfish interests!

631
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,470
Your Majesty. I didn’t do that!

632
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,720
I didn’t kill Xifeng!

633
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,900
His death

634
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,880
has nothing to do with me!

635
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,750
The evidence is conclusive.

636
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,740
What else can you argue?

637
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,200
Your Majesty, I didn’t do that!

638
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,760
Your Majesty, I am begging you

639
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:14,310
to kill him for Xifeng.

640
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,030
Your Majesty, I didn’t do that!

641
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,440
Please don’t be deceived by him!

642
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,510
Your Majesty!

643
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,990
Your Majesty!

644
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,480
Your Majesty.

645
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:37,910
Our family has served you for years.

646
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:41,400
We will never betray you.

647
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,530
Please don’t get us wrong.

648
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,060
Prime Minister,

649
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,020
you have been my loyal minister

650
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,470
for years.

651
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,770
Your family has also
made extraordinary accomplishments.

652
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,950
You won’t betray me.

653
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,710
I trust you.

654
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,810
Thank you, Your Majesty!

655
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,380
However,

656
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,360
the evidence is conclusive.

657
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:25,650
Wei Shuyou, you’d better confess,

658
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,310
in case you get your father and family

659
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,840
in trouble.

660
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,000
Your Majesty!

661
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,730
Your Majesty, I didn’t do that!

662
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:33,700
Your Majesty!

663
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:34,960
Father!

664
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,150
Father! Father!

665
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,610
I didn’t do it, Father!

666
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:39,560
Bastard!

667
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,460
Father!

668
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,810
Bastard!

669
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,630
His Majesty has always
been generous to our family.

670
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,750
How could you do something like that?

671
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,980
Father, I didn’t do it!

672
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,670
Father! Father!

673
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,670
Father! Father!

674
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:58,570
Father! Father!

675
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:00,920
Father!

676
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:09,770
Father!

677
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,020
Go. Go rest in peace.

678
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:29,770
I will take revenge for you.

679
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,950
Your Majesty, I failed
to instruct my son properly.

680
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,680
Please punish me.

681
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,850
You killed your own son.

682
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:05,340
It shows your loyalty.

683
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,710
I won’t blame you.

684
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,080
You may rise.

685
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,020
Thank you, Your Majesty!

686
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,400
Expose Wei Shuyou’s body
to the public for three days

687
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,820
in order to do justice.

688
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,670
Yan Xun,

689
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,490
you’re clear

690
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,090
of the murder.

691
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,210
You may leave.

692
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,030
