It’s…

20
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,550
Report!

21

General. Commandant.

22
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,160
General. A prisoner escaped.

23
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,230
Escaped?

24
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,500
Who?

25
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,280
Yan Hongxiao.

26
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,830
Yan Xun’s elder sister?

27
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,850
Where did she escape from?

28
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:15,700
Shili Slope.

29
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,980
She couldn’t have gone far.

30
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,230
She is pregnant after all.

31
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,920
Let’s go.

32
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,910
I’ll catch her.

33
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,400
Brother.

34
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,090
Aye.

35
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,490
Let me do it.

36
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,210
You?

37
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,880
I’ll take good care of

38
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,860
Yan Xun’s family member.

39
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,540
Your Majesty.

40
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,120
Should we bring Bai Sheng to the Palace?

41
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,340
Guards!

42
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,170
Cut off her head

43
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,170
and bring it back.

44
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,520
What about her body?

45
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,020
Her body?

46
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,090
Feed it to the wolves.

47
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:58,800
Let’s go.

48
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,610
Yuwen Yue, what are you doing?

49
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,890
I should ask you that!

50
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,440
We are after a prisoner.

51
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,300
A prisoner?

52
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,340
She tried to escape,

53
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,990
so we made her stay.

54
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,320
You bastard!

55
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,080
You are such a hypocrite.

56
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,520
I abhor that look on your face.

57
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,380
Who shot Yan Xun

58
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,450
at last?

59
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,250
You are a bastard.

60
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,720
You pretended to be his closest friend.

61
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,900
But in the time of crisis,

62
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,370
you chose to protect yourself.

63
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,250
Your hypocrisy

64
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,840
disgusts me.

65
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,520
Yan Xun was such a fool

66
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,330
that he chose to trust you.

67
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,250
Yuwen Yue, don’t you dare!

68
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,550
If you kill me,

69
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,230
my father will make you pay.

70
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,390
Don’t… Don’t hurt me.

71
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,270
Are you afraid of death as well?

72
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,020
We have known each other for years.

73
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,870
We are friends.

74
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,360
Please don’t kill me.

75
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,100
Spare me, please.

76
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,480
You’ve also known Yan Xun for years.

77
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,690
Why didn’t it stop you

78
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,120
from destroying his family?

79
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,550
He is doomed.

80
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,950
So is Yanbei.

81
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,630
No one can help it.

82
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,890
They are going to die sooner or later.

83
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,210
So are you.

84
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,970
Let me give you a hand.

85
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,330
Stop, Young Master Yue!

86
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,500
- Eunuch Wang, help!
- Young Master Yue.

87
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:58,840
His Majesty summons you to the Palace.

88
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,810
Please put your sword away

89
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,030
and come with me.

90
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,790
Eunuch Wang said you injured Zhao Xifeng.

91
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,330
Yes.

92
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,020
I meant to end him.

93
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,420
Why?

94
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,010
Yan Hongxiao was pregnant.

95
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,330
She was a harmless woman.

96
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,670
As a court official, Zhao Xifeng

97
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,290
must be executed for murder without permission.

98
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,320
Zhao Xifeng is Zhao Gui’s heir.

99
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,170
Aren’t you afraid the Zhaos

100
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,840
will take revenge on you?

101
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,550
It is my responsibility

102
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,200
to safeguard the court’s dignity.

103
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,350
You are loyal indeed.

104
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,540
Yuwen Huai told me

105
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,770
that your maid

106
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,380
assassinated Yuwen Xi.

107
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,860
The Eye of Intel

108
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,570
is not as powerful as before,

109
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,960
but we still have house spies.

110
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,950
If I meant to kill Yuwen Xi,

111
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,670
I wouldn’t have waited till this day,

112
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,140
let alone

113
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,010
ordering a maid

114
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,180
from Qingshan House

115
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:03,940
to do the job.

116
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,210
Are you saying

117
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:12,080
that maid acted of her own accord?

118
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,120
I’m not sure.

119
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,990
It’s pending investigation.

120
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,990
According to my spy,

121
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,120
the night when Yan Xun escaped,

122
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,180
someone shot him

123
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,880
and blocked his way out.

124
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,080
He also said

125
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,080
that person was you.

126
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,890
Correct.

127
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,930
You have known Yan Xun for years.

128
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,630
You could watch him die like that?

129
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,560
Serving Your Majesty is my priority.

130
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,060
My friendship with Yan Xun comes after.

131
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,290
I’m well aware of my duty.

132
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,760
Besides, it was Marquis Dingbei
who attempted to rebel.

133
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,490
His son, Yan Xun, has been in the capital for years

134
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,280
and has never got involved in it.

135
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,270
I’m sure Your Majesty will be lenient with him

136
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,320
and spare him.

137
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,410
You are good at reading my mind.

138
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,520
Since you are a loyal

139
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,390
and helpful servant,

140
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,950
tomorrow, at Jiuyou Platform,

141
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,270
you’ll be Deputy Supervisor of Execution.

142
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,540
Yuwen Huai eliminated

143
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,180
Marquis Dingbei for me

144
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,590
and shall be rewarded

145
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,200
with the title of Chief Supervisor.

146
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,290
You should assist him

147
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,430
with the execution of all those rebels tomorrow.

148
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,360
What?

149
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,470
Is there a problem?

150
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,250
Since you call yourself loyal,

151
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,130
I’m warning you

152
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,420
that tomorrow at Jiuyou Platform,

153
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,970
if you show even the slightest bit of

154
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,800
mercy on Yan Xun,

155
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,300
I’ll treat you as one of them

156
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,400
and level Qingshan House!

157
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,430
Yes, Your Majesty.

158
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,880
You may leave.

159
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,240
Your Majesty, Marquise Dingbei has arrived.

160
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,880
Where is she?

161
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,300
She’s right outside.

162
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,010
Would you like to see her now?

163
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,330
Achu.

164
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,030
I have enough food.

165
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,000
Achu.

166
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,710
They still give us food,

167
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,260
which means we are safe

168
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,280
at least for now.

169
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,180
My father will soon arrive.

170
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,410
He’ll get us out in no time.

171
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,880
Once everything is settled,

172
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,420
go to Yanbei with me.

173
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,960
You can bring your two sisters along.

174
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,740
After we get out,

175
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,020
I will help you find them.

176
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,610
I don’t even know

177
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,780
if they are still alive.

178
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,660
Don’t worry.

179
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,930
They will be just fine.

180
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:43,990
I certainly hope so.

181
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,860
The city is in chaos.

182
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,070
Even if you’re out,

183
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,310
do you know where to find them?

184
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,990
Don’t think your hot temper

185
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,710
can scare everyone away.

186
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,410
You’ve never met

187
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,590
real villains.

188
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,160
If you do,

189
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,100
you may get hurt, too.

190
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,010
Achu,

191
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,000
when I first met you

192
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,870
at the human hunting ground,

193
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,070
I knew you are special.

194
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,680
I don’t know why.

195
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,920
You seemed weak,

196
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:23,790
but seeing you

197
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,280
fighting desperately for your life

198
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,680
on that ground,

199
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,220
I couldn’t be cruel to you anymore.

200
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,120
Achu, Yanbei is beautiful

201
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,050
and peaceful most of the time.

202
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,090
When summer comes,

203
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
the grassland stretches everywhere.

204
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,670
I remember those times when Father,

205
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,780
my two brothers and I

206
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,540
rode horses

207
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,740
and went hunting together in Xiuli Mountain.

208
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,840
Back then,

209
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,950
I was little,

210
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,900
about seven years old.

211
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,680
Most horses were too big for me.

212
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,060
So my eldest brother

213
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,140
gave me a pony

214
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,100
of the head horse.

215
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,360
I thought he meant

216
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,190
to humiliate me.

217
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,450
So I got angry at him.

218
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,610
Now, I realize

219
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,830
he didn’t want me

220
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,060
to get hurt.

221
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,150
You know,

222
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,840
my third brother had a bad temper.

223
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,000
We fought a lot.

224
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:41,790
He…

225
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,400
Every time when he got angry,

226
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,220
he would lift me up

227
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,660
and threaten to drop me on the ground.

228
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,350
Then

229
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,080
my second sister would come at him

230
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,330
with her whip

231
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,490
and lash him

232
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:00,880
again and again.

233
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,710
I would lie on the floor

234
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,250
laughing out loud.

235
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,440
My third brother was strong,

236
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,370
but honestly,

237
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,440
he wasn’t

238
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,150
my sister’s match at all.

239
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,270
But now, I understand

240
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,460
he chose

241
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,520
not to fight back.

242
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,520
In winter,

243
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,920
the snow season

244
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,560
would last for over a month.

245
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,040
Our whole family

246
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,220
would move to Shuobei Highland.

247
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,510
Huihui Mountain there

248
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,880
is high and steep.

249
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,720
There are hot springs at the top.

250
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,730
My mother was too weak

251
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,010
to bear the coldness.

252
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,510
So she spent most of the year

253
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,020
at the palace

254
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,090
beside the hot spring.

255
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,860
We always

256
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:05,030
sneaked out to see her

257
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,200
and kept her company

258
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,520
without father’s permission.

259
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,110
But

260
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,740
when we got there,

261
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,800
he was inside already,

262
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,570
cuddling with Mother.

263
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:31,810
Achu,

264
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,470
unlike Chang’an, in Yanbei

265
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,190
fathers and sons, brothers and sisters

266
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,270
husbands and wives wouldn’t harm

267
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,620
or set each other up.

268
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,150
Noble families here

269
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:48,920
live an extravagant life,

270
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,260
but right outside

271
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,460
their walls,

272
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,010
many have been frozen

273
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,510
or starved to death.

274
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,590
While everyone in Yanbei

275
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,340
has enough to eat

276
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,730
and keeps themselves warm.

277
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,280
They can live

278
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,290
the way they want.

279
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,090
Achu,

280
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,780
go home with me.

281
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,930
When we are back,

282
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,090
I can protect you.

283
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,320
No one will hurt you anymore.

284
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:29,840
Neither will they

285
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,780
hold you against sharp weapons.

286
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,750
I’ll take you to the prairie,

287
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,510
to hunt horses in Xiuli Mountain,

288
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,930
to see the endless grassland

289
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,330
and go to Huihui Mountain

290
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,680
to visit my mother.

291
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,080
She’s tender.

292
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,590
I’m sure she’ll like you.

293
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,360
Achu.

294
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,500
Can I believe you?

295
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,330
Don’t lie to me.

296
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,690
Is that a yes?

297
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,850
That’s some fine liquor!

298
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,400
Be good, girls.

299
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,240
What a wonderful day!

300
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,080
Leave now!

301
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:35,720
Why?

302
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,280
No greetings meeting the elder?

303
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,460
Is that what I taught you

304
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,150
all these years?

305
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,160
Uncle.

306
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,060
Why?

307
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,350
Why did you do that?

308
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,070
You know Yan Xun is innocent.

309
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,110
Shuye,

310
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,520
you are the most talented one

311
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,330
among your peers

312
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,820
in our family.

313
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,170
Executing His Majesty’s order

314
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,450
is nothing wrong.

315
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,740
No need to rush here

316
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,690
to confront your own uncle

317
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,950
this late, either.

318
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:26,970
No.

319
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,000
It should not be like this.

320
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,870
Uncle, this isn’t

321
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,120
what you taught me.

322
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,070
Not at all.

323
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,480
Winner takes it all. Only the strongest survives.

324
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,020
That’s the law

325
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,730
of the jungle.

326
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
Am I right?

327
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,160
I know

328
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,490
you sympathize with the Yan family

329
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,490
and loathe the power struggle.

330
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,240
But however much you detest your identity,

331
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,250
you still carry the bloodline

332
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,740
of the Weis.

333
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,510
All the things

334
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,370
you enjoy since childhood

335
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,580
come from your family.

336
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,100
Your status and power

337
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,400
stem from your family.

338
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,000
One enjoying all that for free

339
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,510
has no right

340
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,010
to blame or judge the provider.

341
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,360
Everything in this world

342
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,620
exists for a reason.

343
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,430
We, the Weis,

344
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,510
got to kill those traitors today

345
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,860
instead of

346
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:47,010
being killed by them

347
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:50,790
only because our ancestors

348
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,000
never ceased fighting

349
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,060
for the future of our family.

350
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,080
All these years,

351
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,280
no matter who invaded the state

352
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,230
or took the throne,

353
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:10,150
nothing could

354
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,190
shake our family.

355
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,840
Only the fittest survives in this dog-eat-dog world.

356
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,390
The only way to protect yourself

357
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,050
is to become stronger.

358
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,500
Right now, you’re feeling sorry for them.

359
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,520
But have you ever thought

360
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,140
if everyone in our family

361
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,650
is as soft-hearted as you,

362
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,810
then

363
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:43,440
those to be executed tomorrow

364
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,570
will be your siblings?

365
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,730
No.

366
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,300
That’s wrong.

367
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,340
That’s not true, Uncle!

368
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,360
I’m not getting any younger.

369
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,860
I can’t protect you forever.

370
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,470
If one day,

371
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,150
I leave,

372
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:18,020
who will protect our family?

373
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,370
Who will protect my sons

374
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,180
from being killed?

375
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,680
Who will protect my daughters

376
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,340
from being ravished?

377
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:31,120
Who will protect all of them?

378
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:33,720
You?

379
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,080
Brother, how is it going?

380
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,970
Zhao Dongting is back.

381
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,360
He’s back?

382
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,200
What about Ms. Bai Sheng?

383
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,800
Is she also back?

384
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,220
She’s kneeling outside the main hall

385
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,540
without being summoned by Father.

386
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:26,780
Why?

387
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,350
Zhao Xifeng also killed

388
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,470
Princess Hongxiao.

389
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:34,420
Father didn’t punish him

390
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,710
when he heard the news.

391
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,390
What?

392
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:43,520
Chun,

393
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,250
he’s given the order

394
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,870
to execute those from Yanbei

395
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:51,320
at Jiuyou Platform at noon.

396
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,280
What...

397
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,640
What about Yan Xun?

398
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,420
He’s left out in the imperial edict.

399
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,110
Ms. Bai Sheng,

400
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:27,900
I will save Yan Xun.

401
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,650
Father, I’m here to pay respects.

402
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,810
I want to show you something.

403
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,520
This is the pair of boots

404
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,690
that Marquis Dingbei and Ms. Bai Sheng

405
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,580
gave me as a gift

406
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,790
when they sent Yan Xun to Chang’an

407
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,600
as a hostage.

408
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,030
This pair of boots

409
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,660
was handmade

410
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,950
by Ms. Bai Sheng.

411
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:50,790
There are orchids, plum blossoms,

412
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,410
and they’re adorned with pearls.

413
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,580
They’re too cute

414
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,930
to be worn.

415
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,690
Before I actually put them on,

416
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:04,740
I had grown up.

417
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,800
My feet were too big

418
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,720
to fit in

419
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,050
when I wanted to try them on.

420
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,320
Back then,

421
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,440
when you asked all Marquises

422
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,440
to send their sons to Chang’an,

423
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,560
they were all reluctant to do so,

424
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,950
weeping and sobbing.

425
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,560
Marquis Dingbei was the only one

426
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,640
that sent Yan Xun here

427
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,390
without a second thought.

428
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,710
Father, when you first saw him,

429
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,190
you had a good feeling about him.

430
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,260
You said that

431
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,710
you would treat him as your own son.

432
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,260
Do you remember

433
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,790
when he was 14 years old,

434
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,390
you two went hunting together.

435
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,300
He almost got killed by a horse,

436
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,930
and injured his arm

437
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,280
when he tried to hunt a leopard.

438
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,270
You gave him a good talking-to.

439
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,090
But what did he do?

440
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,680
He showed the leopard

441
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,980
to you, grinning.

442
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,780
He said

443
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,110
that leopard was for you.

444
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,070
And...

445
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,170
He wanted to make a leather vest for you.

446
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,060
When it snowed in winter,

447
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,630
you could wear it under your garment.

448
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,360
The vest would keep you warm.

449
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,420
You cherished that vest

450
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:19,040
and wore it year after year

451
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,810
without even considering discarding it.

452
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,160
You said he was more like your son

453
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,490
than all my brothers.

454
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,450
Have you forgotten all that?

455
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,640
Father!

456
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,170
Father.

457
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,430
Please pardon Yan Xun.

458
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,890
He didn’t do anything.

459
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,110
He did nothing wrong.

460
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,960
He hasn’t been home

461
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,020
all these years.

462
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,060
He grew up under your watch.

463
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:00,480
Do you really want to kill him?

464
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,900
Won’t that pain you, Father?

465
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,640
Father.

466
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:11,340
Ms. Bai Sheng is kneeling right outside.

467
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,800
She’s lost her husband,

468
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,880
her son and daughter.

469
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,750
All she has left

470
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,110
is Yan Xun.

471
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,160
Are you going to deprive her

472
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,200
of her last hope to live,

473
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,380
Father?

474
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:28,670
Father.

475
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,200
Please exonerate Yan Xun!

476
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:34,170
Please, Father!

477
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,120
Ma’am, His Majesty summons you.

478
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,260
Thank you.

479
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,340
Your Highness.

480
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,000
What are you doing?

481
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,220
Move!

482
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,150
Behave yourself!

483
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,320
Mother.

484
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,420
Mother,

485
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,330
don’t stop me.

486
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,500
I’ll get Yan Xun out one way or another.

487
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:00,840
Ridiculous!

488
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,650
What can you do?

489
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:03,660
I...

490
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,150
Throwing a temper tantrum like you always do?

491
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,320
Or telling him

492
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,890
that you’ll live and die with him?

493
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,950
That’s only your wishful thinking.

494
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,380
Do you know

495
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,760
if he wants to die with you?

496
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,510
I don’t care.

497
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,330
If there’s still hope,

498
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:19,900
I won’t give up.

499
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,480
Since you want to see him...

500
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,780
Fine.

501
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,030
Let’s pay him a visit.

502
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:31,000
But I have to warn you.

503
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,370
If you’re to do anything

504
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,190
over the line,

505
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,780
I will kill everyone

506
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,550
in your chamber,

507
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,740
including

508
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,750
your nannie,

509
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,190
and your maids who grew up with you.

510
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,470
If you think

511
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,030
all their lives combined

512
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,890
can’t outweigh Yan Xun’s,

513
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,920
then be my guest.

514
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:59,310
I will show no mercy.

515
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:08,440
Mother…

516
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,760
Why are you doing this to me?

517
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,420
= Jiu =

518
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,180
= You =

519
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,420
= Platform =

520
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:07,460
= Jiuyou Platform =

521
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:23,340
= Imperial Prison =

522
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,180
Open the door.

523
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:55,780
Aye.

524
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,500
Wei Shuyou.

525
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:19,170
When is His Majesty going to

526
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,360
release me?

527
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,220
Dream on!

528
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,480
As per His Majesty’s order,

529
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:29,200
send suspect Yan Xun to Jiuyou Platform,

530
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,380
awaiting sentencing.

531
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,300
Your Excellency.

532
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:34,790
Please.

533
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,380
What are you waiting for?

534
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,620
Move!

535
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,770
What are you doing?

536
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,440
Do you want to die?

537
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,410
You have swallowed your words.

538
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,700
You said

539
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,820
you would take me to Yanbei.

540
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,940
I will.

541
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,280
Wait here for me.

542
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,400
I don’t believe you.

543
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:29,830
Take me with you.

544
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,590
You dirty slave!

545
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,130
Who are you calling a slave?

546
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,810
Yan Xun, you’ve got quite a temper.

547
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,930
At this stage,

548
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:48,860
you are still putting on airs

549
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,610
in front of me.

550
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,690
Achu, be good.

551
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,740
This is for your sake.

552
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,760
If so,

553
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:00,530
just bring me along.

554
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,040
Don’t be silly.

555
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,480
You’d be in danger around me.

556
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,330
Achu, be good.

557
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,540
Come on.

558
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:25,320
I killed Yuwen Xi.

559
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,100
If I get convicted,

560
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,420
I will die sooner.

561
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,210
Maybe I can live longer

562
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,050
if I go with you.

563
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:49,810
Let her out.

564
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,580
The imperial edict is only addressed to you.

565
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,990
I won’t go without her.

566
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,820
You can just kill me here.

567
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,900
Fine.

568
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:18,130
If you want to die together,

569
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:19,480
I will do you a favor.

570
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:21,840
Open the door.

571
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,630
Aye.

572
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,850
Yan Xun.

573
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:36,560
Achu.

574
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:39,680
Are you scared?

575
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,460
Of course not.

576
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,900
= Jiuyou Platform =

577
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:06,740
= Imperial Prison =

578
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,930
The emperor is chosen by Heaven

579
00:42:57,810 --> 00:42:59,240
to rule all corners of the land.

580
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,880
The bell will toll 45 times

581
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,120
to mourn his demise.

582
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,710
It tolls 36 times

583
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,580
for the death

584
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,460
of the nobility.

585
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,650
What will be, will be.

586
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,560
Just bring it on.

587
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,010
Since we can’t avoid it,

588
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,650
