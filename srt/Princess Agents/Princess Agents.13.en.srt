16

17
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:48,990
Your Majesty.

18
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,420
The deployment diagram

19
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,230
copied by a spy

20
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,510
is for the communications hub

21
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,410
between Yanbei and us.

22
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,680
Yan Xun

23
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,820
must be related.

24
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,840
It was a big problem.

25
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,060
But our Eye of Intel

26
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,500
failed to detect.

27
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,930
Sorry to let you down, Your Majesty.

28
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,960
I’d like to atone for my carelessness.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,510
Somebody. Draft the imperial edict.

30
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,060
Aye.

31
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,400
Forget it.

32
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,570
Yuwen Huai.

33
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,740
You...

34
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,000
You may leave.

35
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,450
Keep a close eye on Yan Xun

36
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,220
for me.

37
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,760
Aye.

38
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,330
You lost.

39
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,600
Did I?

40
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,550
The game has just begun.

41
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,000
We don’t know who will win.

42
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,300
Yuwen Huai.

43
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,330
Who swims well easily drowns himself.

44
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,960
You’d better be careful.

45
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,100
Fine.

46
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,730
Let’s wait and see.

47
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,390
Greetings, Your Majesty.

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,190
You may rise.

49
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,930
Thank you, Your Majesty.

50
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,410
The deployment diagram

51
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,960
for the hub between Yanbei and us

52
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,090
was copied by a spy.

53
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,550
What do you think of this?

54
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,100
I’ll make a thorough investigation on this

55
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,220
and arrest the spies.

56
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,940
When Han State perished,
Zhang Liang took revenge.

57
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,770
Lu Zhonglian also revolted against the tyrant.

58
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,400
I should be a loyal man,

59
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,510
just like them.

60
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,740
Do you know what poem it is?

61
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,050
It’s Linchuan Was Invaded

62
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,520
by Emperor Xiaojing.

63
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,370
It wasn’t long

64
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,850
before the Gao family killed him

65
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:08,230
when he wrote the poem.

66
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:12,110
In Yecheng City, the traitor Gao Yang

67
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,440
killed 721 members of our royal family,

68
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,550
even including babies!

69
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,720
Over so many years,

70
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,570
a lot of our family members

71
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,300
have been killed.

72
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,160
Tell me.

73
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,910
Who is

74
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,300
the next traitor?

75
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,200
I don’t know.

76
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,670
You don’t know?

77
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,390
You’re the legal son of the First Branch
of your family.

78
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,060
You’re the inheritor

79
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,080
Yuwen Zhuo picked for the Eye of Intel.

80
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,800
You’re the information source of our nation.

81
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,250
You’re also the one I entrust with great tasks.

82
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,960
Now you tell me you don’t know?

83
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,620
Rebellion is a capital felony.

84
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,600
Without conclusive evidence,

85
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,860
I don’t dare to guess.

86
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,390
You don’t dare to or you don’t want to?

87
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:17,400
Yuwen Yue.

88
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,280
Do you dare to swear

89
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,030
with your family name that

90
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,630
you’re saying everything

91
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,090
for fairness,

92
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,420
instead of

93
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,250
private friendship?

94
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,390
Correct information

95
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,870
can be the intel.

96
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,470
But man-made intel

97
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:32,760
is a plot.

98
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,420
When I’m entrusted,

99
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,940
I should find out causes

100
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,190
and report with evidence.

101
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,060
Then I can be loyal to you.

102
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,710
Enough!

103
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,880
You should be my eyes,

104
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,310
instead of making decisions for me.

105
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,290
Remember who you are.

106
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,440
Your Majesty,

107
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,810
let me finish.

108
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,750
The one who copied the deployment diagram

109
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,970
and framed Yan Xun up.

110
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:00,910
What does he want?

111
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,390
Does he want to

112
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,850
drive a wedge between you and ministers

113
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,510
so that he can get something?

114
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,830
In terms of revolt,

115
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,310
the emperor of every dynasty would rather

116
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,470
kill thousands of traitors by mistake

117
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,440
than let go of one.

118
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,850
What you said today

119
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,460
fails how your grandpa

120
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,010
taught you.

121
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,330
Your Majesty, I...

122
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,230
Leave.

123
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,060
= Qingshan House =

124
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,600
Noble Consort Wei said

125
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,440
His Majesty didn’t trust

126
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,540
the Eye of Intel.

127
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,350
I can’t stop worrying

128
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,050
unless we clear out

129
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,470
the spies among us

130
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,070
sent by Liang.

131
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,770
Yue.

132
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,940
How is it going

133
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,190
with Xing’er?

134
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,330
You want to use her?

135
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:53,790
No.

136
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,490
She... She can’t help now.

137
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:57,890
Yue.

138
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,040
You took pains to train her.

139
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,620
Now you tell me I can’t use her?

140
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,680
Then why must I

141
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,440
keep her?

142
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,340
Fine.

143
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,370
If Xing’er can do that,

144
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,120
I can let you use her.

145
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,420
But I have one request.

146
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,690
Tell me

147
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:15,820
how my mother went crazy.

148
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,750
I want to know

149
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,250
if her problem

150
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,650
has anything to do with Pleasure Pavilion.

151
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,000
Shut up. This is a family scandal.

152
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,180
But she’s my mother.

153
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,750
I’ve been

154
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,640
thinking about it

155
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,930
for sixteen years.

156
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,110
Fine.

157
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,860
If you can train Xing’er

158
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,830
to assassinate that spy,

159
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,140
I’ll tell you

160
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,540
what happened

161
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,210
sixteen years ago.

162
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,610
Aye.

163
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,890
Young Master.

164
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,490
What are you teaching me today?

165
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,940
There’s a sandglass behind you.

166
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,780
When the sand

167
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,790
drops completely,

168
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,670
all traps in this place

169
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,810
will be triggered.

170
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,460
Ten thousand arrows will be shot.

171
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,040
This time, you won’t have headless arrows,

172
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,260
but iron arrows that kill people.

173
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,690
It depends

174
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,160
if you can run away.

175
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,650
If you’re fine,

176
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,870
go practicing shooting in the archery yard.

177
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,820
Shoot the bull’s-eye for thirty times
in succession.

178
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,340
You mustn’t stop before you succeed.

179
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,700
Young Master, here comes His Excellency Yan Xun.

180
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,740
I’ll buy Xing’er.

181
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,000
Is it enough? Tell me if it isn’t.

182
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,630
I don’t sell her.

183
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,650
Fine. Today,

184
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,490
let me tell you something

185
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,600
I really mean.

186
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,620
Xing’er is just like me.

187
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,610
We’re like eagles

188
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,840
flying freely on the grasslands.

189
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,280
When kept in the cage,

190
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,640
she makes trouble.

191
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,210
She’ll ruin the cage and herself.

192
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,380
I’ve guessed

193
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,720
what you want her to do.

194
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,130
But I don’t agree.

195
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,780
What have you got?

196
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,640
I won’t tell you.

197
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:54,550
Wild Kitten is

198
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,170
only one of your slaves.

199
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,140
But to me,

200
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,940
she’s like the bird in the same cage

201
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,540
who chirps sadly with me.

202
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,110
If you don’t

203
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,630
let her go,

204
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,580
I won’t leave.

205
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,140
You’re a noble man.

206
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,920
But misfortune can be a blessing in disguises.

207
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,070
If you want her to go with you,

208
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,900
you’ll get her implicated, won’t you?

209
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:04,500
Swift.

210
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,200
Eat it.

211
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,910
It’s grass with salt and wine.

212
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,980
All horses love it.

213
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,260
Your master is hard to please.

214
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,900
Be more reasonable, could you?

215
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,760
Stop making trouble for me.

216
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,690
Swift is always

217
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,070
intractable.

218
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,020
Also,

219
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,630
it always bullies me.

220
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,100
Today,

221
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,950
I borrowed it

222
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:32,720
from Yan Xun.

223
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,430
You didn’t know

224
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,460
what it did all the way here.

225
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,700
It was too numerous to be listed.

226
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,180
That’s because it doesn’t like you.

227
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,990
Why does it never bully me?

228
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,200
You’re great.

229
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,360
Look.

230
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,260
Even I listen to you,

231
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,130
not to mention a mere horse.

232
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,570
Xing’er.

233
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,800
Go for a ride with me.

234
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,210
With you?

235
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:01,860
No.

236
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,630
Please go.

237
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,740
You know what?

238
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,690
When I get close, it kicks me.

239
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,620
I walked here,

240
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,100
pulling its rein.

241
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,440
If you don’t ride me back,

242
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,680
I have to walk back.

243
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,820
You’re a prince.

244
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,580
Can’t you just find a servant

245
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,110
to walk the horse home?

246
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,140
I can’t.

247
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,500
Think about it.

248
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,750
Even I can’t get close to it,

249
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,640
what servant

250
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,920
can do that?

251
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:28,830
Xing’er.

252
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,810
It’s like being bewitched.

253
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,230
It likes you only.

254
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,000
All right. Stop flattering me.

255
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,390
Well,

256
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,870
I’m in good mood today.

257
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:41,500
Fine.

258
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,070
Swift.

259
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,850
Let’s

260
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,340
ride Prince Yu home,

261
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,550
shall we?

262
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:49,860
Here it is.

263
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,600
Damn you, Yuwen Yue.

264
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,190
You don’t give Xing’er to me.

265
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,300
You even sound mysterious.

266
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,520
If Wild Kitten

267
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,190
becomes your concubine,

268
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,150
she’ll sound mysterious, too.

269
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,670
I won’t sell her.

270
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,940
Everyone has his fate.

271
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:24,900
Don’t push it.

272
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,420
All right.

273
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,850
I won’t push it.

274
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,110
Anyway,

275
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,050
she has left Qingshan House.

276
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,240
You cooperated with Prince Yuan Song

277
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,390
to take her away?

278
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,730
Why would I do that?

279
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,580
Yuan Song cooperated with me,

280
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,840
of course.

281
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,290
Anyway, he only took away Xing’er

282
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,410
for a ride.

283
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:50,750
It’s no big deal.

284
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,400
Yueqi.

285
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,290
Young Master.

286
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,510
Without my permission,

287
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,740
Xing’er shall not step out of

288
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,420
Qingshan House.

289
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,840
She doesn’t have time

290
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,740
to be wasted on such guys.

291
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,530
Aye.

292
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,440
Damn you, Yuwen Yue.

293
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,570
Today,

294
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,610
I’ll break up with you,

295
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,020
unless you give Xing’er to me.

296
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:30,780
Young Master.

297
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,050
Why didn’t you

298
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,240
tell His Excellency Yan Xun that

299
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,420
His Majesty suspects Yanbei

300
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,920
and if he stays in Chang’an,

301
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,450
he and his hometown will be in danger?

302
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,140
What will he do

303
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,380
after I tell him?

304
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,440
He’ll defend himself before His Majesty

305
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,790
and ask the Empress Dowager for favor.

306
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,620
When he fails,

307
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,290
he’ll roar in anger.

308
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,960
But this is politics.

309
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,570
It’s the fight for power.

310
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,410
As long as

311
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,810
he suspects His Majesty,

312
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,270
His Majesty will have a reason

313
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,030
to kill his father.

314
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,130
Now,

315
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,930
I must persuade him to leave quietly.

316
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,410
Hope the Eye of Intel can be in full operation

317
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,200
before His Majesty takes action

318
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,100
so that we can find out the truth.

319
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:18,860
Aye.

320
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,360
Besides,

321
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,280
don’t let Xing’er know that.

322
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,290
Aye.

323
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,750
Prince Yu.

324
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,450
Didn’t you say we came out for a ride?

325
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,510
Where are we going?

326
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,760
Why are we still in Qingshan House?

327
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,410
Let me take you

328
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,310
to an interesting place.

329
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,280
You’ll know.

330
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:45,890
I’m not going.

331
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,860
Stop. I’m getting down.

332
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,890
Xing’er.

333
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,510
Just go with me.

334
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,080
Well, close your eyes

335
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,010
and we’ll be there soon.

336
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,090
Why must I close my eyes? I won’t.

337
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,150
If you don’t want to

338
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:56,970
close your eyes,

339
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:57,760
fine.

340
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,500
We’re arriving soon.

341
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,640
Just hold on.

342
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:06,860
Come on.

343
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,270
Do you like it?

344
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,920
This is a secret flower tree

345
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,840
I’ve found.

346
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,360
At this time of year,

347
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,430
it gives a petal rain at dusk.

348
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,490
I’m the only one

349
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,840
who knows the secret.

350
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,590
Now I’ve told you.

351
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,400
This is a secret

352
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,000
between us.

353
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,770
All right?

354
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,380
Xing’er.

355
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,040
Do you know

356
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,150
why I take you here?

357
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,980
Because only you

358
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,800
deserve such a beautiful

359
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,150
petal rain.

360
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,690
You’re nice and interesting,

361
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,700
just like the petals.

362
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,570
In fact,

363
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,720
you’re also a secret

364
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,050
in my heart.

365
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,200
Xing’er?

366
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,540
Xing’er?

367
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:14,920
I’m talking to you.

368
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,130
What are you dazing at?

369
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,250
Prince Yu.

370
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,660
I’m a bit thirsty.

371
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,810
I’d like to get some water.

372
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,010
Go ahead.

373
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,270
Be careful on the way.

374
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,880
I’ll wait for you here.

375
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,440
Okay.

376
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,220
Be careful on your way.

377
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,610
I’ll be waiting here.

378
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,000
Go.

379
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,900
= Guilty-slave Chamber =

380
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,510
Young Master.

381
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:56,450
What?

382
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,200
You’re awake?

383
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,890
Don’t think

384
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,000
I can’t deal with you

385
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,770
when I can’t get into Qingshan House.

386
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:10,820
Young Master Huai.

387
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,370
Why do you always

388
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,290
find trouble with me?

389
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,940
You’re clever.

390
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,940
You must know why.

391
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,370
How can I know

392
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,980
what you want?

393
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,950
You’d better tell me

394
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,190
all you know

395
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,530
about the Eye of Intel.

396
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,420
Then I’ll marry you as my concubine.

397
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:30,700
You no longer need to

398
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,970
serve Yuwen Yue as his maid.

399
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,590
Think carefully about

400
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,890
what you’re going to do.

401
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,410
Young Master.

402
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:42,690
Miss Xing’er was taken away.

403
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:43,460
Where was she taken?

404
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,180
To the Guilty-slave Chamber.

405
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:44,940
When?

406
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,110
Half an hour ago.

407
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,560
She deserves it.

408
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,070
Tell Yue Guards

409
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,040
not to save her!

410
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,640
Aye.

411
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:56,010
Young Master Huai,
you take care of the whole mansion.

412
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,560
You’re a noble man with great power.

413
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,520
If you don’t know something,

414
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,530
how can I know it

415
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:02,430
as a mere maid?

416
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,580
You mean

417
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,480
if I hadn’t caught you,

418
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,870
I could hardly

419
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,100
see you,

420
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,880
could I?

421
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,020
Young Master Huai, you get me wrong.

422
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,320
I deliberately let Yuan Song

423
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,230
take me out

424
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,170
so that I could report to you.

425
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,040
But...

426
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,010
Before I found you,

427
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,850
your subordinates knocked me out.

428
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,320
Stop finding excuse.

429
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,930
I’m telling the truth,

430
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:29,910
Young Master Huai.

431
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,460
Yuwen Yue killed your brother.

432
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,560
Don’t you hate him?

433
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,660
I’ll certainly avenge my brother.

434
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,480
But if I act rashly,

435
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,730
I would bite the hook.

436
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:40,450
Seems like

437
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,060
you have your own plan.

438
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:44,780
Young Master Huai.

439
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,820
You should know it, huh?

440
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,300
Young Master Yue

441
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,080
likes me a lot.

442
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,950
This is what he gave me.

443
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,740
It proves that

444
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,380
he trusts me more.

445
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,400
Maybe,

446
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,520
I’ll soon have a chance

447
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,540
to get to the secret for

448
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,270
the Eye of Intel.

449
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,350
How evil you are!

450
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,820
He handled so many aftermaths for you,

451
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,330
but you still want to hurt him.

452
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,940
Young Master Huai.

453
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,690
We have the same enemy,

454
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:26,850
Yuwen Yue.

455
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,540
Besides, Elderly Master Xi

456
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,730
killed my sister.

457
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,000
Maybe,

458
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:32,960
we’ll still

459
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,120
have the same enemy.

460
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,590
Good.

461
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,100
When Yuwen Yue

462
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,420
keeps a crafty woman like you,

463
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,010
that’s really dangerous.

464
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,090
Thank you, Young Master Huai.

465
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,810
Seems like you have real charm.

466
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,210
Yeah.

467
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,560
You just wanted to marry me,

468
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,010
didn’t you?

469
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,210
With so many choices,

470
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,750
I feel upset, too.

471
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,590
Seems like you’re pretending.

472
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,800
Why don’t we pretend more?

473
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,340
All right.

474
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,890
Yuwen Huai.

475
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:04,350
What a special visit!

476
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,800
Let go of her.

477
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,560
What if I don’t?

478
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,520
Well,

479
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:21,040
let’s fight then.

480
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,810
Our family in Yanbei

481
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:24,770
develops ourselves

482
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,110
from battles.

483
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,890
Provocation is

484
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,210
the last thing I fear.

485
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,110
Oh, Your Excellency in Chang’an.

486
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:35,400
I must do you the favor.

487
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,150
Yes. Yes. Yes.

488
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,690
Yuwen Huai.

489
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,680
This is my second time

490
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,560
to come here.

491
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,640
This shall never happen again.

492
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:10,850
Young Master.

493
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,990
Go contact the Death Camp.

494
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:19,650
Young...

495
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,760
Young Master.

496
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,350
Think carefully about it.

497
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,390
Can she really help you?

498
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,040
Cut the crap!

499
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,210
She’s been pretending!

500
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,710
Didn’t you see?

501
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,900
If you keep taking nonsense,

502
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,370
- I’ll kill you, too!
- Aye.

503
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:31,320
Aye.

504
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,280
Where are you going?

505
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,680
I saved you so many times.

506
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:58,640
But you’re leaving,

507
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,530
without saying thank you?

508
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,670
Thank you, Your Excellency,

509
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,000
for helping me a few times.

510
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:10,800
Do I need to kneel?

511
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,250
Do I need to kneel?

512
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,230
No.

513
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,080
I’ve got something important

514
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,710
to do.

515
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:21,950
I’ll leave you alone.

516
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,640
Wild Kitten.

517
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,400
Wild Kitten, where are you going?

518
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,150
Xing’er.

519
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,380
Xing’er.

520
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,620
Are your arms all right?

521
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,020
Are your legs all right?

522
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:42,880
Oh,

523
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,520
did Yuwen Huai bully you?

524
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,030
If he did,

525
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,150
I would punish him for you.

526
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,090
Thank you for the care, Prince Yu.

527
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,340
I’m fine.

528
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,160
Luckily, His Excellency Yan saved me in time.

529
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,800
I’ve got something important

530
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,590
to do.

531
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,360
I’ll leave you alone.

532
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,390
Where are you going, Wild Kitten?

533
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,130
It’s your fault.

534
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,840
It’s all your fault.

535
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,030
Because of you,

536
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,000
I lost the chance to save her.

537
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,490
Come on.

538
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,990
What did it concern you

539
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,280
when I saved her?

540
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,230
Ungrateful girl.

541
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,050
You know what?

542
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,220
If I help her one more time,

543
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:29,900
I’ll abandon my family name.

544
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,610
All right.

545
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,350
You should learn to

546
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,610
appreciate a rose with thorns.

547
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,390
Got it?

548
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:41,000
Learn to appreciate it. Learn from me.

549
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:44,790
Why?

550
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,750
Who is she to me?

551
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,980
If Yuwen Huai catches her again,

552
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,510
I won’t help her.

553
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,560
Well, my Xing’er

554
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,960
is a good girl.

555
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,700
She has only one drawback,

556
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,650
being ungrateful.

557
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,480
Your Xing’er?

558
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:09,940
Ungrateful girl.

559
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,930
Oh, when you go back,

560
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,060
tell Yuwen Yue about it.

561
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,490
She rode my horse out without permission.

562
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,760
She’ll be punished, I guess.

563
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,060
You know what?

564
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,710
If I help her one more time,

565
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,670
I’ll abandon my family name.

566
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,750
I’ll no longer be Yan Xun.

567
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,720
Your Excellency, should I tell your father

568
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,910
about that?

569
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,040
Did Yuwen Huai send you?

570
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,910
Only you two?

571
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,300
= Qingshan House =

572
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,100
Young Master.

573
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,710
Why did Yuwen Huai catch you?

574
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,770
Because

575
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,540
he wanted me

576
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,960
to check the Eye of Intel for him.

577
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,670
But I didn’t know anything

578
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,730
about the Eye of Intel.

579
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,270
Nor did I know

580
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,680
why he asked me about that.

581
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:37,730
When I said I knew nothing,

582
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:38,820
he wanted to kill me.

583
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,240
Don’t you want to know about it?

584
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,630
I don’t.

585
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,690
But,

586
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,740
if you want me to know,

587
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,100
I will.

588
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,120
What else?

589
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,370
When he tried to kill me,

590
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,580
His Excellency Yan saved me.

591
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:07,920
On my way back,

592
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,370
I met some killers.

593
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,380
I thought Young Master Huai

594
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,120
sent them.

595
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:12,780
But I realized

596
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,700
they didn’t seem like

597
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,350
guards with Hongshan House.

598
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:19,650
So, Young Master,

599
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,450
do you know

600
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:21,560
who they are?

601
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,790
Leave me.

602
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,730
Young Master. Young Master.

603
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:11,970
Young Master.

604
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,860
They were about to kill her,

605
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,570
then someone suddenly helped her.

606
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,610
It was Yuwen Yue, I guess.

607
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,820
Let’s play cat and mouse

608
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:40,290
and turn her trick into our own use.

609
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,230
Let’s do it.

610
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,560
It’s wise of you, Young Master.

611
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,670
It’s wise of you, Young Master.

612
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,990
Come on. Drink it.

613
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,300
After you.

614
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,930
After you.

615
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,180
Elderly Master Xi.

616
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,890
Elderly Master Xi.

617
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:12,460
Elderly Master Xi.

618
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:15,480
Come.

619
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,250
Come on.

620
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,470
Elderly Master Xi.

621
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:23,850
Come on. Come on.

622
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,340
= Token =

623
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,450
Do you recognize this?

624
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,480
Spy Token from the spy agent of
the Southern Dynasty?

625
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,690
Since Zhou Yu, the governor of Eastern Wu

626
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:38,830
established the spy agent,

627
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,530
the token was passed down

628
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:42,060
for three hundred years.

629
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,520
Wherever it goes,

630
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,310
loyal ministers will rebel
and nobilities will yield.

631
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:48,030
This spy token

632
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,300
is held by the chief of spy agent.

633
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,520
You’re so young.

634
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,540
Can you already be

635
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,730
the chief of spy agent

636
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,330
who is only second to the master?

637
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,230
Precisely.

638
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,350
I come here personally,

639
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,410
to use the most important chessman

640
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,900
we have put

641
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,170
in Wei,

642
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,450
you.

643
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,200
You haven’t worked for sixteen years.

644
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,420
I’m no longer what I was

645
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,050
sixteen years ago.

646
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:21,810
The Spy Token

647
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:23,460
can no longer order me about.

648
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,390
I can’t recognize this.

649
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,300
You can drown me

650
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,620
in the pool.

651
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,930
Oh, there’s a bloody dress.

652
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,360
My Lord,

653
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:37,930
you must remember it, don’t you?

654
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,920
Now I’m a loser.

655
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,520
Why can’t you

656
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,100
let me go?

657
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,690
The ghost in the dress

658
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:54,890
doesn’t let you go.

659
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,770
Senior General Zhuguo’s wife,

660
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,470
Yuwen Yue’s mother.

661
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,940
The secret and scandal sixteen years ago

662
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,330
will turn the rich family

663
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,400
you love

664
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,240
into a stinky toilet.

665
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,630
What the hell do you want me to do?

666
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,480
What do you want?

667
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:19,510
Give me the map of

668
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:22,860
the secret passage in the Intel Building.

669
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:05,000
Oh, do us another favor

670
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,470
about something graceful.

671
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,690
Hold a party

672
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,920
to invite Yuwen Yue

673
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,130
and young masters of other rich families.

674
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,780
Sounds easy.

675
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,180
Ask Yuwen Huai to handle that.

676
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,290
What about next?

677
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,370
By then,

678
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,550
you’ll know.

679
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,610
It tastes so bitter.

680
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,040
With the hot stone,

681
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,880
it’ll be warm.

682
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,050
He won’t feel cold, then.

683
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,700
Young Master, your moves...

684
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:38,930
Look familiar?

685
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,380
You don’t have enough inner force

686
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,090
or fighting experience.

687
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,860
When the enemies change their moves,

688
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,620
you can’t recognize them.

689
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:15,410
You should learn to find their weak points

690
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,870
during the chaotic fight

691
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,820
and kill them immediately.

692
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,120
What was that?

693
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,620
I want you to close your eyes

694
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:23,220
instead of looking haughty.

696
