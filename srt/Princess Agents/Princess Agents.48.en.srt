16
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,130
Princess.

17
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,620
There’s a scroll.

18
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,040
Thank you, Princess.

19
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,770
Don’t touch things here.

20
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,970
There are traps everywhere.

21
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,600
Have you found anything?

22
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,950
The traps here

23
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,650
are somewhat familiar.

24
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,270
When I was little, I came across a genius

25
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,790
who excelled at designing traps

26
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,560
and making horses

27
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,640
that could travel a thousand miles a day

28
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,890
without eating or drinking.

29
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,410
Is it the one

30
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,490
you mentioned

31
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,360
who gave you a little wooden bird?

32
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,650
Exactly.

33
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,350
Do you think

34
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,910
that person

35
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,270
has something to do with this Camp?

36
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,130
It seems that

37
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,230
the arrangement of traps

38
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,620
here in this Camp

39
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,710
is of his style.

40
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,310
Anyway, there’s more to this place.

41
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,560
Are you spies from Liang?

42
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,110
Aren’t you sharp, Young Master Yue?

43
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,280
You’re too slow.

44
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,670
Princess.

45
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,830
Leave me alone.

46
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,500
I need some space.

47
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,170
Xiao Ce!

48
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:15,880
I told you

49
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,180
she had left.

50
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,950
Where did she go?

51
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,970
Where else could it be

52
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,630
other than Yanbei?

53
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:24,970
Or would she go back to Chang’an

54
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,160
to have her head off?

55
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,860
Who let her leave?

56
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,630
She could leave as her own wish.

57
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,000
Who could stop her?

58
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,240
After taking your antidote,

59
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,510
she’s good as new.

60
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,450
Why would she

61
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,490
continue staying here?

62
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,630
Alright.

63
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,210
Do not be so upset.

64
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,370
You two are never

65
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,270
meant to be together.

66
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,910
If you did,

67
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,480
it wouldn’t end well.

68
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,500
I know you are a decent man.

69
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,340
How about this?

70
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:57,970
I can

71
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,500
introduce a few girls to you.

72
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,740
You can...

73
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,450
I’m not finished yet.

74
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,600
Where are you going?

75
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,270
Hear me out. I can...

76
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,620

It’s time for me to leave.

95
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,220
I’m sorry

96
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,400
that I’ve caused you so much trouble.

99

If Yanbei

100
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,500
and Wei are at war,

101
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,210
we’ll have to meet on the battlefield.

102
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,510
In that case,

103
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,560
don’t show any mercy on me.

104
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,950
Other than taking a stand,

105
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,570
is there anything else you want to

106
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,490
tell me?

107
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,740
What else is there to say

108
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,790
between us?

109
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,780
I see.

110
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,800
I did everything of my own free will.

111

Yuwen Yue.

112
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,000
You should know

113
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,390
Yan Xun and I

114
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,530
have been through so much to come far.

115
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,700
I can’t be selfish

116
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,100
or reckless.

117
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,500
Thank you for saving me again and again.

118
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,040
I am sorry,

119
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,600

Who is against him?

124

I don’t know any of that.

125
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,080
I’m worried about him

126

My heroine

157
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,810
is about to embark on a long journey.

158
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,230
You can’t travel on an empty stomach.

159
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,170
I have no appetite.

160
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,870
I tried to make him leave.

161
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,640
Then you wouldn’t have

162
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,910
felt so bad

163
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,790
if you hadn’t met him.

164
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,110
Qiaoqiao.

165
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,310
There are different paths in life.

166
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,520
Choosing one means

167
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,530
you have to give up the other.

168
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,950
Silly girl,

169
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,560
you have to take

170
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,970
the bumpy and challenging one

171
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,530
instead of the other

172
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,930
that is safe and smooth.

173
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,520
It’s natural

174
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,150
that you’re torn

175
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,310
standing at the crossroad.

176
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,250
You can’t do anything about it.

177
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,390
Do you believe in yourself?

178
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,550
Of course I do.

179
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,200
Do you believe in Yan Xun?

180
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,590
Yes.

181
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,790
Then fight your way out

182
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,560
through the bumpy road

183
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,510
to gain victory.

184
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,900
Then you’ll realize

185
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,470
all your effort

186
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,090
isn’t in vain.

187
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,230
As for Yuwen Yue,

188
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,130
you have to wait

189
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,180
until he comes around.

190
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,900
Time is the best cure.

191
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,990
If the wound

192
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,050
does not kill you,
it will heal eventually.

193
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,600
In this world,

194
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,580
everyone can live with or without others.

195
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,520
As smart as he is,

196
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,130
he’ll figure it out.

197
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,730
Don’t worry.

198
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,500
You know,

199
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,780
Yuwen Yue was strictly disciplined

200
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,760
by his family.

201
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,180
He was unsophisticated.

202
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,350
Look at you.

203
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,970
Average-looking.

204
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,930
Skinny.

205
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,600
Your figure

206
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,200
isn’t curvy.

207
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,590
And you have a baby-face.

208
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,080
Excuse me?

209
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,390
Am I that bad?

210
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,210
Alright. Calm down.

211
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,150
Do not be mad.

212
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,310
I was joking.

213
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:37,810
Alright.

214
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,590
Finish the noodles and go to bed.

215
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,590
Recently,

216
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,440
there are people

217
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,500
staking out this place.

218
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,250
They must be Yan Xun’s men.

219
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,070
You can leave with them tomorrow.

220
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,200
By the way,

221
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,320
no need to say goodbye to me this time.

222
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,550
I need a good sleep.

223
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,290
Xiao Ce.

224
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,510
Thank you.

225
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,670
We are here right now.

226
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,300
So tell our men...

227
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,090
Commander,

228
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,880
our soldiers are missing one by one.

229
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,740
What happened?

230
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,350
Hongchuan is right ahead.

231
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,430
They might

232
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,170
go back to visit their families.

233
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,960
Those fools!

234
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,910
If they get caught,

235
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,040
they will die.

236
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,440
Enter the city

237
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,850
and bring them back

238
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:04,510
- Aye.
- Aye.

239
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:11,260
= Hongchuan =

240
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,070
Have you found them?

241
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,380
We can’t stay here for too long.

242
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,120
Let’s leave first

243
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,110
before making other plans.

244
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,670
Let’s go.

245
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,900
What’s wrong?

246
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,620
Commander, we want to...

247
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,300
You can’t.

248
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,370
It’s too dangerous.

249
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,310
We will be careful, Commander.

250
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,050
We all miss our family.

251
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,530
One glimpse is enough.

252
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,190
Just one glimpse, Commander!

253
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,310
Fine.

254
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,830
You have two hours.

255
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,250
Thank you, Commander.

256
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,330
Thank you, Commander.

257
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,990
Look. Hold it like this.

258
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,660
Good. Slowly.

259
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,230
Well done.

260
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,290
Remember,

261
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,560
this character

262
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,560
is “Wu”,

263
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,940
your father’s surname,

264
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,380
as well as yours.

265
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,230
But when will he come back?

266
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,150
Soon.

267
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,220
Once you finish learning
all the characters

268
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,450
in this book,

269
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,250
he will be back.

270
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,710
Understand?

271
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:58,820
Yes.

272
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,140
Alright, let’s continue.

273
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,580
Slowly.

274
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,570
Would you like meat rice-puddings?

275
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:19,930
They’re tasty.

276
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:36,980
= Teahouse =

277
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:39,870
Hey, geezer,

278
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,430
is this saber sharp?

279
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,570
Yes.

280
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,960
Now that His Excellency Yan Xun
has successfully returned.

281
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,550
Maybe the Wei Army

282
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,000
will attack us soon.

283
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,420
We should

284
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,030
prepare sharp weapons

285
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,840
to avenge our family members’ murder.

286
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,620
That’s brave and admirable.

287
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,870
Of course.

288
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,590
Unlike your son,

289
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,160
a coward

290
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,710
who defected to the enemy.

291
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,110
My son would never surrender.

292
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,860
I know him

293
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,100
better than anybody.

294
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,120
This is the price.

295
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,010
You’re still defending him.

296
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,100
Everybody knows

297
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,340
what kind of person he is.

298
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,060
I am not selling you that saber.
Just leave.

299
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,120
Like we want it.

300
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,040
Yes. Let’s go.

301
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,590
That old fogy.

302
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,190
Get out!

303
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,250
Brother.

304
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,280
Leave!

305
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,190
- Brother!
- Go!

306
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:48,630
Brother!

307
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,910
I know I am a sinner.

308
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,720
I’m back to see Mother.

309
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,720
She was ill

310
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,870
when I left her.

311
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,700
Three years have passed.

312
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,080
I just want to see her again.

313
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,890
Shut up!

314
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,430
How dare you come back!

315
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,710
Mother is dead.

316
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,230
Her condition worsened

317
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,400
the first year you left.

318
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,480
Because of you,

319
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,240
no one in town

320
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,130
would sell us medicine.

321
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,790
Why aren’t you dead?

322
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,410
Why are you back?

323
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,560
Do you know

324
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,100
how much discrimination

325
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,720
we’ve suffered

326
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,780
because of you?

327
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,390
It is all my fault.

328
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,990
I’m sorry.

329
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,790
Mother!

330
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,440
I’m a bad son.

331
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,750
I’m so sorry.

332
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,400
Mother!

333
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,330
- Zhang Yu!
- Zhang Yu!

334
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:07,480
Zhang Yu!

335
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,390
Zhang Yu!

336
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,570
You bastard!

337
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,720
Zhang Yu!

338
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:20,910
You don’t want him.

339
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:22,740
I do.

340
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,270
Who is the Commander of the Xiuli Army?

341
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:00,860
I am.

342
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,100
My name is He Xiao.

343
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,420
I serve under General Cheng Yuan.

344
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,640
I’m here

345
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,560
to escort Xiuli Army

346
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,120
to the North Pass.

347
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,250
General,

348
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,390
what do you mean

349
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,210
by “escort”?

350
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,870
I’m not a general.

351
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,110
Yanbei is a small place

352
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,570
unlike Chang’an.

353
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,370
Those chickens and rats,

354
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,840
pigs and snakes

355
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,560
don’t get to be generals.

356
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,040
I serve as a lieutenant

357
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,260
in the Black Eagle Army.

358
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,960
As for the escorting part,

359
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,000
I bet you people

360
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,820
have more experience than us.

361
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,120
Didn’t your members

362
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,940
of the Xiuli Army

363
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,240
assist Wei

364
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,320
to occupy

365
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,170
Beishuo and Hongchuan?

366
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:53,070
And you disarmed those soldiers

367
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,000
and escorted them to Chang’an.

368
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,830
How could you forget

369
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,120
such a remarkable achievement?

370
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:01,630
Fine.

371
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,710
Lieutenant,

372
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,710
you still haven’t

373
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,780
answered my question.

374
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:11,670
I’ll tell you

375
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,660
what “escort” means.

376
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,580
That’s for

377
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,250
animals

378
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,940
who betrayed their ancestors

379
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,650
and faith.

380
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,670
Have I made myself clear?

381
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,090
Rebels!

382
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,270
Xiuli Army has rebelled!

383
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,830
Xiuli Army has rebelled!

384
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,760
Retreat!

385
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:45,990
Go!

386
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,640
Let’s go.

387
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,870
Commander, where should we go?

388
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,110
Any place is fine.

389
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,380
They won’t let us

390
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,050
get away with what happened just now.

391
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,640
They’ll ask for backup.

392
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,710
The whole Wei State

393
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,810
is after us.

394
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,060
There are so many of us here.

395
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,590
Where can we hide?

396
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:13,530
Relax.

397
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,980
Yanbei is sparsely populated.

398
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,090
Mountains and rivers are many.

399
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,270
No matter where we go,

400
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,340
we need to find a shelter first.

401
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:20,680
We can do nothing

402
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,700
if we stay here.

403
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,500
Let’s go.

404
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,920
Your Highness.

405
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,980
I have bad news.

406
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,270
Our grains are

407
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,220
running out.

408
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,500
Provisions

409
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,080
Mr. Wu and Liang prepared

410
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,970
will take another month

411
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:41,600
to arrive.

412
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,490
Although the eight tribes

413
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,720
have agreed to join the battle

414
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,740
under your pressure,

415
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,100
they won’t send in their troops

416
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,600
until supplies arrive.

417
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,330
Exactly.

418
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,970
We are short of food

419
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,310
and weapons.

420
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,090
Without sufficient supplies,

421
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,690
we can’t afford

422
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:55,610
the upcoming war.

423
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,560
Your Highness, a few troops

424
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,550
of the Wei State

425
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,740
have been moving frequently.

426
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,160
It seems that they are ready

427
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,070
for the expedition.

428
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,110
The Emperor of Wei

429
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,540
is sure to appoint a prince

430
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,900
to lead the troops.

431
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,760
Prince Xiang, Prince Yu,

432
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,820
Prince Mu

433
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,120
and other grown-up princes

434
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,220
are all in the capital.

435
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,100
I’m not certain which one will be sent.

436
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,410
Based on the intel,

437
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,030
their troops will set out

438
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,260
in November.

439
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,720
That means

440
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,500
even if everything goes well,

441
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,690
we only have

442
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,390
one month at most for preparation.

443
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,100
So we need to decide on the place

444
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,050
and strategies

445
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,470
to strike.

446
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,240
How about we dispatch

447
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:33,910
the force at the North Pass

448
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,480
to garrison Meilin Pass?

449
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:36,880
No.

450
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,300
The grassland in the north was hit
by a natural calamity this year.

451
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,650
Those barbarians

452
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,290
have already coveted us.

453
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,330
If we withdraw the troops,

454
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,060
they will attack us at once.

455
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,960
Then we will face

456
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,190
a two-fronted war.

457
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,830
Even if they do attack us,

458
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,850
the eight tribes will suffer.

459
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,620
Don’t worry, Zhong Yu.

460
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,210
Although they are

461
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,720
disobedient,

462
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,490
they still promise to

463
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,900
send troops to Hongchuan.

464
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,350
That’s their gesture

465
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,750
of allegiance.

466
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,150
Yanbei relies on the force
at the North Pass

467
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,650
to tame the eight tribes.

468
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,840
They can battle barbarians

469
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,920
and act as a deterrent.

470
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,930
That’s the key.

471
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,750
That force wasn’t moved

472
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,440
even when Hongchuan was taken.

473
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,870
How can we do that now?

474
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,680
Zhong Yu,

475
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,290
you regard them as our own,

476
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,250
but they don’t recognize

477
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,430
His Highness as their master.

478
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,550
Recently,

479
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,470
I have seized three groups
of their messengers

480
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,910
to Chang’an.

481
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,490
They are ready

482
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:33,390
to betray us at any time.

483
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,550
If they do send the troops,

484
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,950
can you trust them?

485
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,410
General Xia,

486
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,640
you followed my father

487
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,820
to battle north and south.

488
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:52,840
Do you have any advice?

489
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:54,940
Your Highness,

490
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:59,820
as dire as the situation is,

491
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,460
we are determined

492
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,430
to fight the enemies.

493
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,830
I believe

494
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,550
if we move the troops from the North Pass,

495
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,670
to reinforce the east,

496
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,340
we will have a bigger chance

497
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,060
to defeat the Wei Army.

498
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,580
But that way,

499
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,280
the eight tribes will have

500
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:15,680
good reason to

501
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,270
refuse to reinforce.

502
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,110
There are both advantages

503
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,640
and disadvantages.

504
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,530
Your Highness,

505
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,640
I’m sure you have plans

506
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,600
to clobber the enemies.

507
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,010
General Xia, you didn’t

508
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,000
give any useful suggestions.

509
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,490
Fine.

510
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,540
Then I’ll say something useful.

511
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,230
Your Highness, you’ve just returned

512
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,800
and are unfamiliar with

513
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,800
military affairs

514
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,960
in Yanbei.

515
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,180
To cope with the coming war,

516
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,360
after consulting a few generals,

517
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,760
here’s a suggestion.

518
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,440
I suggest that

519
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,840
we reorganize all the troops in Yanbei.

520
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,140
Reorganize them?

521
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,460
Yes. It’s nothing serious.

522
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,930
You’re busy already.

523
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:02,990
So we took the liberty

524
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,800
to deal with that.

525
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,440
Details will be handed in shortly

526
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,860
for you to review.

527
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,790
General Xia,

528
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,660
are you

529
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,620
seeking His Highness’s approval

530
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,620
or simply informing him?

531
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,270
You surprised me.

532
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,150
When Marquis was in charge,

533
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:22,960
I didn’t know

534
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,210
you were so bold.

535
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,790
How dare you

536
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,540
reorganize the army without permission?

537
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,260
General Cheng,

538
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,000
watch your attitude.

539
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,900
Who are you to me?

540
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,040
What’s wrong with

541
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,710
my attitude?

542
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,560
Do I have to

543
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,140
list everything

544
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,520
you have done these years?

545
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,350
General Cheng,

546
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,360
you can’t accuse others

547
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,330
without proof.

548
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,430
General Xia isn’t someone

549
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,620
you can slander.

550
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,230
Slander or not,

551
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,230
you know it better than others.

552
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,380
Xianyang Chamber of Commerce

553
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,270
delivered money and goods back every year.

554
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:54,980
How much was used on the army?

555
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,440
How much went to

556
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,870
your own pockets?

557
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,470
Utter nonsense!

558
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,970
The investigation

559
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,170
will reveal the truth.

560
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,470
Shut up,

561
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,470
or I’ll kill you!

562
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,010
Come on.

563
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:05,860
Enough!

564
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:17,670
Father,

565
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:21,950
I’m back.

566
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,990
It’s been ten years

567
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,770
since the last time we met.

568
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,820
In my memory,

569
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,590
Yanbei was a wonderland,

570
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,710
the freest place in the world.

571
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,110
When I was in Chang’an,

572
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,200
I still trusted you

573
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,310
and our people.

574
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,960
You have no idea

575
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,350
how disappointed I was

576
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,590
when I finally came back

577
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,670
after the near-death experience.

578
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:00,870
Father.

579
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,180
Yanbei is not

580
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,210
what it used to be.

581
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:10,660
Eight tribes all have their own agendas.

582
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,650
They only care about their survival.

583
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,530
Those who used to serve under you

584
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,770
are no longer loyal.

585
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,580
They’re thirsty for power and wealth.

586
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,710
Even the locals

587
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,840
don’t want me back.

588
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,120
No one came out to greet me

589
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,910
the day I came back to Hongchuan.

590
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,080
Father.

591
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,890
They have been on their knees for so long

592
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,990
that they’ve forgotten how to stand up.

593
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,160
This is not

594
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,400
our home anymore.

595
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,670
The weak

596
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,860
are not qualified to live.

597
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,450
I will be strong.

598
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,670
I will get rid of everything

599
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,430
in my way,

600
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,850
including my conscience and weakness.

601
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,470
Today, I appoint Prince Yuan Qi

602
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,870
Marshal to Pacify Yan;

603
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:45,660
Wei Shuye,

604
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:49,360
Vice Marshal as well as
General to Pacify Yan.

605
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,260
The troop will set out immediately
to wipe out the rebels.

606
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:56,970
Yes, Your Majesty.

607
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:07,300
= City Gate =

608
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:44,820
Report!

609
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,600
Who let you in? Speak!

610
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,090
Your Highness,

611
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:53,390
they’re coming.

612
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:56,700
Who is coming? Don’t panic.

613
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,650
It’s urgent.

614
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,770
The Emperor of Wei
has dispatched 200,000 troops

615
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,070
led by Prince Yuan Qi

616
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,080
heading to Meilin Pass.

617
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,230
Gentlemen, get ready to fight!

618
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:11,710
- Aye.
- Aye.

619
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,730
General Cheng, a word.

620
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,830
Young Master,

621
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,680
the Wei Army has arrived

622
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,450
at Chiyuan Ferry.

623
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,640
Hongchuan

624
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,810
is right behind it.

625
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,560
The Black Eagle Army has set off, too.

626
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,640
Where are they?

627
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,210
Given their speed,

628
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:55,520
they should be close

629
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,390
to Chiyuan Ferry.

630
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,090
Yanbei has delivered

631
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,470
tons of grains to the front.

632
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,400
A war is inevitable.

633
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,900
= Yanbei =

634
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,380
= Wei =

635
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:12,340
Chang’an is in danger.

636
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,740
Young Master, do you mean

637
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,090
Yan Xun is planning to attack Chang’an?

638
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:20,970
Yes.

639
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:24,970
Yan Xun will round Meilin Pass

640
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,720
to avoid the main force of Wei

641
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:29,510
and head to Chang’an directly.

642
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,870
Although the Black Eagle

643
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,290
is formidable,

644
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,530
they’re against 200 thousand troops

645
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,590
of Wei.

646
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,720
It’s difficult to foretell the result.

647
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,530
Usually,

648
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,960
they’re supposed to guard Hongchuan.

649
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:45,490
Make sure its safety
before launching attacks.

650
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,770
But Yan Xun

651
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,960
adopted the opposite approach.

652
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,780
And he has already prepared

653
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,660
enough supplies.

654
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,880
So he’s going on an expedition.

655
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:58,890
His target

656
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,290
is clear.

657
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,210
In that case,

658
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,720
won’t Yanbei

659
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,450
be taken by others?

660
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:08,930
Yes.

661
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,480
No one expected that.

662
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,320
Wei Shuye and Yuan Che

663
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,040
would never consider that possibility.

664
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,790
They understand military affairs well,

665
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,700
but they don’t understand

666
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,590
Yan Xun.

667
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,410
He is homeless

668
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:26,510
and eager to revenge.

669
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,190
As far as he is concerned,

670
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,590
if he could take Chang’an,

671
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:31,960
Yanbei

672
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,690
would no longer be his home.

673
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,910
Let’s go back to Chang’an immediately.

674
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:43,930
- Aye.
- Aye.

675
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,450
Achu.

676
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,260
His Highness asked you to wait
for him in Lancheng.

677
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,410
Once he defeats Wei,
he will come back to see you.

678
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,510
Get out!

679
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,410
Leave if you can’t afford the medicine.

680
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:07,820
Go!

681
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:09,490
My mother is dying.

682
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,010
I’m begging you.

683
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,770
Please show some mercy

684
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,270
on her.

685
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,800
Stop crying and go away.

686
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:17,910
Get out.

687
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,120
Give it to me.

688
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:28,620
Feng Mian, go and check it.

689
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,130
Go away!

690
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:29,680
Aye.

691
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,630
I’m begging you!

692
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,100
Please!

693
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,450
Show some mercy!

694
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,030
- I’m begging you.
- Hold on.

695
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,220
I will pay for him. Give him the medicine.

696
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:48,990
Hey,

697
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,160
take this.

698
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:01,400
Let’s go.

699
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,930
She’d better leave.

700
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,260
Or she’d get in the way of
His Highness’s revenge.

701
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:54,860
= Hongchuan =

702
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,980
Greetings, Father.

703
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,030
Rise, my son.

704
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,120
Thank you, Father.

705
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,570
I asked you to come

706
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:06,380
for a tricky task.

707
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:09,610
I need you to seize a felon.

708
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,540
What happened?

709
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,550
This time,

710
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,610
I have managed to

711
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,830
assemble 200 thousand soldiers

712
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,990
led by Yuan Qi and Wei Shuye

713
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,860
to suppress Yanbei.

714
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:24,510
Only 150 thousand troops are left

715
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,780
to guard the capital.

716
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,710
Just now,

717
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,560
I was told

718
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:32,790
the commander’s tally of
the imperial guards had been stolen

719
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,900
and all the guards had been relocated.

720
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,660
This is serious.

721
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:46,820
Father, the tally is gone

722
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,220
and so is our force.

723
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,610
If Yan Xun

724
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:50,940
gets through Meilin Pass,

725
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,250
he will head to Chang’an directly.

726
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,710
We’ll be in trouble.

727
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,340
That’s what I’m worried about.

728
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,490
I will go and search
for the tally immediately.

729
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,640
Find it as soon as possible,

730
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,480
or Chang’an will be in grave danger.

731
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:05,780
Aye.

732
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:17,450
Your Highness,

733
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,100
I have checked as you requested.

734
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,850
Lately, only Princess Chun

735
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:21,650
left the Palace.

736
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,810
We failed to find out where she had been.

737
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,370
Have you searched the entire Palace?

738
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:26,300
Yes, we have.

739
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,680
There’s no sign of Princess.

740
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:30,900
The tally is missing.

741
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,400
The guards are far away.

742
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,780
And Chun is nowhere to be found.

743
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:39,090
Chun.

744
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,170
Report!

745
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,530
Your Highness, a secret letter
from General Yuwen.

746
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:54,080
The main force of Yan Xun
rounded Meilin Pass

747
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,870
to attack Chang’an.

748
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,340
What?

749
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,390
Chun stole

750
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,710
the commander’s tally?

751
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,940
Was she crazy?

752
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,990
Actually,

753
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,230
whatever Chun does

754
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,960
won’t surprise me.

755
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,200
It’s over.

756
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:33,460
That’s a capital crime.

757
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,870
Miss Chu.

758
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,370
You have misunderstood His Excellency.

759
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,450
What happened to the Xianyang Chamber

760
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:48,060
was done by General Cheng Yuan.

761
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,590
Right now, the biggest problem

762
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,500
is Hongchuan.

763
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,820
His Highness, Mr. Wu

764
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:52,850
and Zhong Yu

765
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,590
are the most prestigious

766
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,680
and respected

767
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,410
military leaders in Yanbei.

768
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,020
But none of them

769
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,020
stayed to guard Hongchuan.

770
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:02,970
And you have been assigned to Lancheng.

771
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:03,780
The whole city

772
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,690
is in the hands of mobs.

773
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,350
If I didn’t see General Cheng,

774
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:09,590
I would really think His Highness

775
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,860
had given up Hongchuan.

776
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,770
I’m just talking nonsense.

777
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,150
Don’t take it to heart.

778
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:17,420
No.

779
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:19,940
I’m not going to Lancheng.

780
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,370
I’m going back to Hongchuan.

781
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:22,970
I need to figure what on earth

782
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,520
Cheng Yuan and Yan Xun are up to.

783
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:37,340
= Wei =

784
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,980
= Yanbei Hongchuan =

785
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:50,470
Young Master.

786
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,600
We’ve been traveling

787
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,560
for a few days in a row.

788
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,620
It’s exhausting.

789
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,410
Get some rest now.

790
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:56,650
Don’t drain yourself.

791
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,490
Young Master, an urgent letter
from Prince Yuan Che.

792
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:07,810
Give it to me.

793
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:15,700
= Yuan Chun stole the commander’s tally. =

794
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,650
Yueqi, inform all the Yue Guards

795
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,520
to go back to Chang’an overnight.

796
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,120
Aye.

797
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:29,360
They reported back

798
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,600
that Miss Chu had returned.

799
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,880
Should we pay her a visit?

800
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,270
Miss Chu is close

801
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:34,250
to His Excellency Yan.

802
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,640
If she agrees to explain it for us,

803
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:36,910
we might be able to turn things around.

804
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,650
Miss Chu helped us before.

805
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,590
We can’t drag her into this.

806
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,620
She and His Excellency Yan

807
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,440
have relied on each other for years.

808
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,310
If we play them off against each other,

809
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,810
won’t we be ungrateful?

810
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,710
I know you can’t wait to go home.

811
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,380
Just be patient.

812
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,850
Commander, bad news.

813
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,260
What happened?

814
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,830
Wei Army is coming,

815
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:07,700
yet Yan Xun and his troops

816
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,910
are heading to Meilin Pass.

817
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,470
