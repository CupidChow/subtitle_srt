16
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,230
Maybe it’s because of the yellow sand,

17
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,400
the sky of Yanbei is never clear

18
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,370
even when it’s sunny.

19
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,500
I like the rain here.

20
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,110
It’s less dense than that in Wei,

21
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,320
but fresh and cool.

22
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,540
I wish there’d be more rain.

23
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,180
By the way,

24
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,990
how are Mr. Chen and the others?

25
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,270
Young Master,

26
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,730
they’ve been escorted

27
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,190
to a safe place.

28
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,160
According to him,

29
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,810
the one who released them wore a mask.

30
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,180
It seemed to be a man.

31
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,750
That person is familiar

32
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,580
with Hongchuan.

33
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,160
Who would that be?

34
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,840
A message came from Chang’an.

35
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,020
His Majesty is too sick

36
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,500
to control the court.

37
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,160
Now, Prince Che

38
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,030
is taking charge of everything.

39
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,850
In that case,

40
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,830
peace might be restored

41
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,650
sooner.

42
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:43,850
He who is unjust

43
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:44,970
is doomed to destruction.

44
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,360
Am I right, Your Highness?

45
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,060
I have sworn long ago
to paint Chang’an with blood,

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,240
and cut off that man’s head

47
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,390
to avenge the murder of our warriors.

48
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,330
How can he die

49
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,400
so easily?

50
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,300
I agree, Your Highness.

51
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,080
He must be killed by us

52
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,490
so that those who died for Yanbei

53
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,950
can rest in peace.

54
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,130
That geezer is doomed.

55
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,670
But his successor will still

56
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,030
be our biggest threat.

57
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,080
Prince Che is prudent.

58
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,360
He can see the big picture.

59
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,370
It’s too soon to call him a threat.

60
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,290
Sounds like

61
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,870
you and he

62
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,210
go way back, Zhong Yu.

63
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,930
Cheng Yuan, what are you insinuating?

64
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,770
If you are not

65
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,590
close friends,

66
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,600
how do you know

67
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,650
he is not a threat?

68
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,750
Cheng Yuan.

69
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,510
No matter who ascends the throne,

70
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,270
this war is inevitable.

71
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,860
Pass my order.

72
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,510
Prepare enough troops
and supplies quickly.

73
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,050
Yes.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,150
Your Highness, please think twice.

75
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,820
If the war is on again,

76
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,580
countless families

77
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,570
will be ruined.

78
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,230
Stability has just been restored.

79
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,050
We can’t afford another war.

80
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,990
I’ve said it long ago

81
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,760
that women should never

82
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,310
lead the army to battle.

83
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:02,750
Yanbei and Wei

84
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,270
are mortal enemies.

85
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,360
If we back off,

86
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,520
they’ll take every corner of our land

87
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,440
sooner or later.

88
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,720
You know the best

89
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,730
how it feels to be whipped by a woman.

90
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,290
General Cheng.

91
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,070
Don’t cross the line.

92
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,330
Did I?

93
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,550
As a general,

94
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,170
you should know well about

95
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,730
the current situation.

96
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,660
We have strong enemies outside

97
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,760
and traitors among us.

98
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,310
Today, someone

99
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,980
let those spies from Wei go.

100
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,550
Then tomorrow that person

101
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,840
is likely to assassinate His Highness.

102
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,860
What do you mean?

103
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:45,910
Your Highness.

104
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,350
Those who attempted
to burn the barn escaped.

105
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,000
But the strange thing is

106
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,120
none of the shackles in prison

107
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,200
were damaged by force.

108
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,900
So someone must have used keys

109
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,860
to free them.

110
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,980
I think that traitor

111
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,190
is one of us.

112
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,660
I’m sure

113
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,130
Miss Chu is well aware of that.

114
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,020
General Cheng.

115
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,270
Are you

116
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,620
calling her a suspect?

117
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,110
Yes, Cheng Yuan.

118
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,500
It could be anyone,

119
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,220
but certainly not Miss Chu.

120
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,350
You know

121
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,740
if it was her or not.

122
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,580
Your Highness, this is serious.

123
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,200
Enough!

124
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:26,800
This matter

125
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,740
is no longer your concern.

126
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,560
You may leave.

127
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,150
Aye.

128
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:31,590
Aye.

129
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,280
Aye.

130
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,560
What are you doing here?

131
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,910
Achu.

132
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,780
Be honest with me.

133
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,100
Did you release those

134
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,930
who came to burn the barn?

135
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,330
You don’t believe me?

136
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,730
I do if you say no.

137
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,980
Fine. I’ll say it.

138
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:07,990
No.

139
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,360
Alright.

140
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,470
Yan Xun.

141
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,930
People of Yanbei couldn’t wait

142
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,120
for you to return.

143
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,990
Is this how you pay them back

144
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,150
with war?

145
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,150
There’s a price

146
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,870
for everything.

147
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,440
And peace

148
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,600
can only be gained

149
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,450
through war.

150
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:40,830
Is that so?

151
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,240
Princess.

152
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,590
That’s Concubine Zhao’s son.

153
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,630
The other day,
she caught a strange disease

154
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,680
and died in less than an hour.

155
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,790
Now, that boy is motherless.

156
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,220
What a tragedy!

157
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,690
Concubine Zhao is gone.

158
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,110
He lost his mother.

159
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,470
Poor child.

160
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,500
He is there alone.

161
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,940
Look,

162
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,750
there isn’t a maid or eunuch with him.

163
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,190
Those women in the harem

164
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,230
only care about themselves.

165
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,010
Besides,

166
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,490
he is not their son.

167
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,270
Why should they care for him?

168
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,830
Concubine Zhao died.

169
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,630
Those servants

170
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,700
no longer take him seriously.

171
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,620
Who are you?

172
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,980
I am Yuan Chun,

173
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,860
your sister.

174
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,680
Can you play with me?

175
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,580
Sure.

176
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,950
From now on,

177
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,000
we can play together every day.

178
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,730
Are you happy?

179
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,530
Yes.

180
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,240
Let’s play then.

181
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,950
Sure.

182
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,580
I am going to kick it.

183
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,370
Yang.

184
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,670
No.

185
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,420
Yang.

186
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,590
Who am I?

187
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,090
Sister!

188
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,820
Are you sure?

189
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,640
Yes!

190
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,670
Really?

191
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:02,810
Yes.

192
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:03,640
See for yourself.

193
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,850
Are you correct?

194
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:07,950
Are you?

195
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,090
Sister, you lost!

196
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,090
Fine, I lost.

197
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:13,900
Tell me,

198
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,370
what do you want me to do?

199
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,420
I will say yes to everything.

200
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,790
Play lanterns with me tomorrow.

201
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,330
That’s it?

202
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,190
Alright. We’ll do that.

203
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,280
- Princess.
- Come here.

204
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,770
Princess, Chief Eunuch Wang is here.

205
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:34,460
Send him in.

206
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:35,680
Aye.

207
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,070
Here.

208
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,640
Mr. Wang, please.

209
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,310
How come

210
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,490
you recognized me instantly?

211
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,030
Your fingers gave you away.

212
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,440
You are so smart.

213
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:49,950
Princess,

214
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,930
His Majesty invites Prince Yang

215
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,030
to dine in Concubine Lan’s palace.

216
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,030
I see.

217
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,430
But Mr. Wang,

218
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,230
he needs to wash his hands

219
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,870
after playing with us.

220
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,680
Please excuse us.

221
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,430
Aye.

222
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,530
Let’s go.

223
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:16,710
Here.

224
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:21,970
Yang.

225
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,970
Don’t take anything

226
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:24,770
from others.

227
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,390
Do you remember

228
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,630
my rabbit?

229
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,490
It died

230
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,330
because someone

231
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,460
fed it bad food.

232
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,950
Your Majesty, why did you

233
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,520
ask me to cook for Prince Yang?

234
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,670
Lan.

235
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,410
You don’t have a child.

236
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,850
And my condition is worsening.

237
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,780
Do you have any plans for the future?

238
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,830
I will listen to you.

239
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,250
Fine.

240
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,360
I have

241
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,740
a few sons.

242
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,280
I think

243
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,930
Yuan Yang is a good boy.

244
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,590
His mother is gone.

245
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,450
And I’m too busy

246
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,100
to look after him.

247
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,980
Why don’t you

248
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,730
adopt him

249
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,480
to take care of him?

250
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,900
That way, you can rely
on him in the future.

251
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,220
What do you think?

252
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,970
Thank you for your trust.

253
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,320
I will treat him

254
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,450
as my own

255
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,620
and take good care of him.

256
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,220
Your Majesty, Your Grace.

257
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,480
Prince Yang is here.

258
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,390
Father.

259
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,690
Yuan Yang.

260
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,740
Come here.

261
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,730
Father, are you feeling better?

262
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,480
I know you’re worried about me.

263
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,860
How could I not feel better?

264
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,000
Prince Yang, you’re still growing.

265
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,360
Have some soup.

266
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,220
No.

267
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,240
I don’t want to be that rabbit.

268
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,480
What rabbit? Don’t be silly.

269
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,010
Here. Taste it.

270
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,180
I don’t want to be that rabbit.

271
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,430
There, there.

272
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:43,930
I don’t want to be that rabbit.

273
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:44,760
You won’t.

274
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,070
You won’t.

275
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,370
There, there.

276
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,220
Don’t cry.

277
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:50,720
There, there.

278
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,280
Your Majesty, I shall take my leave.

279
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,080
Father.

280
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,520
There, there.

281
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,180
You won’t be a rabbit.

282
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,340
Don’t be afraid.

283
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,190
Nothing will happen to you.

284
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,960
Nothing at all.

285
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,630
There, there.

286
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,080
There, there.

287
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,070
Tell me.

288
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,770
Who would you like to look after you?

289
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,290
Dear Young Master Yue,

290
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,220
the situation in Chang’an is fickle.

291
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,730
You advised me to compete for the throne.

292
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,610
I am afraid the odds are against me.

293
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,410
I am in my prime with military power.

294
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,320
Father probably worries that

295
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,120
I’ll pose a threat to his reign

296
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,930
if he makes me his heir.

297
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,470
Therefore, he’s taking

298
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,550
more precautions against me.

299
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,680
His health is

300
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,120
falling off day by day.

301
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,710
Recently,

302
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,220
he intends to make his young son,

303
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,150
Yuan Yang, his heir

304
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,370
to protect his throne.

305
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,070
Obviously, Yuan Chun

306
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,050
saw through that

307
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,720
and deliberately approached Yuan Yang.

308
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,100
She alienated him

309
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,590
from Concubine Lan

310
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,540
on purpose.

311
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,270
So Father had to ask her

312
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,130
to take care of Yuan Yang for now.

313
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,730
The power struggle has already begun.

314
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,860
Yuan Chun’s motive is obvious.

315
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,230
Now, Father is suspicious about me.

316
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,910
Yuan Chun also sees me

317
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,740
as a thorn in her flesh.

318
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,030
I am treading on thin ice.

319
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,620
The slightest mistake may bury me.

320
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,910
Prince Xiang,

321
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,560
it’s better to get away from danger.

322
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,830
Why don’t you volunteer

323
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,160
to battle in Yanbei

324
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,170
to fool Yuan Chun

325
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,890
but hide outside Chang’an instead?

326
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,420
Even if she takes action,

327
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,190
you can go back in time

328
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,300
to control the situation.

329
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,700
Sister,

330
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,620
why is brother

331
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,590
leaving?

332
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,170
Well,

333
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,290
isn’t it good?

334
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,920
Wang.

335
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,790
Servant.

336
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,290
Lan.

337
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,880
Lan.

338
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,400
Somebody.

339
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,310
Bring me the medicine.

340
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,450
I need to take it.

341
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:45,660
Chun, there you are.

342
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,310
Give me the medicine.

343
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,700
Father, do you want this?

344
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,560
It’s too hot. You can take it later.

345
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:07,410
Where are Lan and Chief Eunuch Wang?

346
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,980
Where are the others?

347
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,790
I asked them to leave

348
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,410
because they failed to serve you well.

349
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,970
You are sick, Father.

350
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,620
You should have a good rest.

351
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,450
I will keep you company. Aren’t you happy?

352
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,980
What do you want?

353
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,910
Nothing.

354
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,280
I just want to talk to you.

355
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,430
There’re just you and me

356
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,430
in this room.

357
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,830
No one else is here.

358
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,720
We won’t be disturbed.

359
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,020
Father, I have always

360
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,690
wanted to ask you about something

361
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,670
but never got the chance to.

362
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,460
Back then, when you

363
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,460
married me to Yan Xun,

364
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,470
was I a bait to you?

365
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:19,160
I had no choice.

366
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,160
The only thing I regret

367
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,820
is that I didn’t kill that traitor.

368
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,880
The happiest moment

369
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,870
in my life was

370
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,070
when you approved

371
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,340
our marriage.

372
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,180
But in the end,

373
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,260
that was nothing but a sham.

374
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:55,420
A lie from the very beginning.

375
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,750
Yan Xun’s sin

376
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,480
can’t be forgiven

377
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,510
even if he is torn into pieces.

378
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,430
Why are you so obsessed with him?

379
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,370
He is my childhood sweetheart.

380
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,930
We grew up together.

381
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,330
I love him.

382
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,620
I’ve loved him since long ago.

383
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,720
I thought you knew that.

384
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,040
Chun, you don’t know his true color.

385
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,070
You were fooled by him.

386
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,350
I wasn’t.

387
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,320
He had stayed in Chang’an for years

388
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,040
without causing any trouble.

389
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,660
He was always sweet to me.

390
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,190
Hadn’t you…

391
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,930
Hadn’t you suspected your sworn brother,

392
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,490
massacred his people,
slaughtered his clan,

393
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,510
tortured Yan Xun

394
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,130
on the Jiuyou Platform,

395
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,230
in the cruelest way,

396
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,710
how would he have rebelled

397
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,820
against you?

398
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,150
Just like his father,

399
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,450
he’s disloyal.

400
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,320
He’s rising in rebellion,

401
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,740
plunging the people
into misery and suffering.

402
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,900
It’s you who’s making them suffer!

403
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,190
It is you who should be punished!

404
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,830
It is you who must go to hell!

405
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,830
Enough!

406
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,980
How dare you slander your father

407
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,000
for a traitor?

408
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,060
Father?

409
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,620
Now, you know

410
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,460
you are a father.

411
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,120
I used to think that

412
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,330
you were like

413
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,060
every father in the world.

414
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,660
You would think for your children.

415
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,940
I never anticipated that

416
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,400
I...

417
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,020
I was merely a pawn in your plan.

418
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,260
When you used me

419
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,840
to kill Yan Xun,

420
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,060
did it ever occur to you

421
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,080
that you

422
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,120
were a father?

423
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,930
Do you know how many sins

424
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,990
you have committed throughout your life?

425
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,740
You killed Marquis Dingbei
who was innocent.

426
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,030
You left Bai Sheng no choice
but to kill herself.

427
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,080
Persecuting the loyal is your first sin.

428
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,350
Branding Yanbei people as rebels,

429
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,840
and massacring innocent people

430
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,950
are your second sin.

431
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,530
To keep people from

432
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,510
calling you a tyrant,

433
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,860
you deliberately spared

434
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,550
Yan Xun’s life.

435
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,090
But you incited noble families in secret

436
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:13,610
to assassinate him,

437
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:15,170
turning them against each other

438
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,790
for your benefit.

439
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,010
That’s your third sin.

440
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,360
My mother, Noble Consort Wei,

441
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,210
was with you for decades.

442
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,580
Yet you made her poison herself to death

443
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,260
despite your marriage.

444
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,610
And Yuan Song, my brother,

445
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,210
he’s never wanted anything

446
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,620
but you exiled him.

447
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,110
Yuan Che has great ambitions.

448
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,230
But you’d rather

449
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,050
pick an ignorant child

450
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,380
to accede

451
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:40,920
to the throne

452
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,580
in fear of losing your power!

453
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,480
Do you want me to continue?

454
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:01,250
You are a merciless emperor,

455
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,990
a disloyal brother, a heartless father

456
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,640
and a suspicious, jealous

457
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,720
spineless coward!

458
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,850
That’s why you ended up

459
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,820
all alone like this.

460
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,790
Father.

461
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,720
Let me tell you one thing.

462
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,660
Either you let others live,

463
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,650
or eradicate their entire clan.

464
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,760
When you murdered Marquis Dingbei,

465
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,990
you should have murdered Yan Xun, too.

466
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,400
When you killed my mother,

467
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,770
you should have killed me, too.

468
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,740
You weren’t like this before.

469
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,700
You used to be...

470
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,590
Used to be...

471
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,550
Different.

472
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,880
That’s because I know

473
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:19,510
good people always get bullied

474
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,860
and the innocent always die first.

475
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,230
It’s not that I have changed,

476
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,380
but I have grown up.

477
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,730
I didn’t want to be a princess.

478
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,680
I didn’t want

479
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,790
fame or wealth.

480
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,500
All I wanted

481
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,950
was to live with my love

482
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,210
for the rest of my life.

483
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,390
But now,

484
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:52,000
my mother died, my brother left,

485
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,640
and my love abandoned me.

486
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,480
People I care about

487
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,420
have left one by one.

488
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:04,080
Now, I’m the only one left.

489
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,670
Do you know

490
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,760
that I have nightmares every night?

491
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,540
I wish I were dead!

492
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,450
Never mind.

493
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,620
How could I expect

494
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,010
the most selfish one in the world

495
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,980
to understand my feelings?

496
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,670
What are you doing?

497
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,300
What is that?

498
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,880
Chun, what are you doing?

499
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,550
Chun.

500
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,010
What is that?

501
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,450
What are you doing?

502
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,990
Help!

503
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,060
Help!

504
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,270
Somebody help!

505
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,960
Help!

506
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,900
- Help!
- Stop barking.

507
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,360
- It’s useless.
- Help!

508
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,080
I almost drowned by accident when I was 8,

509
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,780
then I had a high fever.

510
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:45,530
You took care of me tirelessly

511
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,890
and had all the ponds

512
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:48,890
in the palace filled up.

513
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,030
Who would expect

514
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,170
that you and I

515
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,620
would turn against each other now?

516
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,580
I wasn’t cruel

517
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,230
or shrewd enough.

518
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,980
It was you who made me come this far

519
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:08,440
step by step.

520
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:16,300
Father, it’s time to take your medicine.

521
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,540
You are committing murder and regicide!

522
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:26,440
I will give the throne to Yuan Yang

523
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,230
as you wish.

524
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,670
But I will be assisting him.

525
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,470
Chun, I know I was wrong.

526
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,740
You can take my place.

527
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,560
I will give it to you, alright?

528
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,290
Why would I need that?

529
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,300
What I want

530
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,550
has already been destroyed by you.

531
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:54,220
Be good and take this.

532
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,120
Finish it and get some rest.

533
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,240
Stop.

534
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,050
Help!

535
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,060
Help!

536
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,250
Why are you back?

537
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:17,450
Chun, you went too far this time.

538
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:18,940
I understand you hold a grudge,

539
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,450
but you’re committing a heinous crime.

540
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,870
A heinous crime?

541
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,150
What he did

542
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,430
is tens of thousands of times

543
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,790
worse than me.

544
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,400
He is our father after all.

545
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,290
Father?

546
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,320
Did he act as a father

547
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,760
when he married me to Yan Xun?

548
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,920
Did he act as a father

549
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,300
when he killed my mother?

550
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,410
Did he act as a father

551
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,270
when he kicked you out of the city?

552
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,600
What he did to us is unforgivable.

553
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,890
Why should I still be kind to him?

554
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,180
I must kill him!

555
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:44,620
Chun!

556
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,700
- I must kill him!
- Chun!

557
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,830
Stop!

558
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:55,450
Whatever it takes,

559
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,970
I cannot let you do it!

560
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:04,710
Father.

561
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,070
Are you sure it’s true?

562
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:00,900
Absolutely.

563
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,940
I saw it with my own eyes

564
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,410
that Princess had been
sent out of the palace.

565
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:04,730
What to do?

566
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,710
What should we do now?

567
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,150
His Majesty

568
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:09,810
won’t let her get away with it.

569
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,650
No. I can’t let it happen.

570
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,140
I must save her.

571
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,480
Young Master. Young Master.

572
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:14,920
What are you doing?

573
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,760
I’m going to save her.

574
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,780
Are you going to rebel, Young Master?

575
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,750
I’m going to save Princess.

576
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,900
Why would I rebel?

577
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,140
Disobeying orders is an act of rebellion.

578
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:20,400
Young Master.

579
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,470
Whatever! The situation is dire!

580
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:22,320
Young Master!

581
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,240
Young Master!

582
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,260
Yuwen Yue.

583
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,710
Thanks to your idea,

584
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,130
I made an excuse to leave Chang’an

585
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,510
and stationed the troops outside the city,

586
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,790
so I could go back in time
to stop Yuan Chun

587
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,400
from committing regicide.

588
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,340
I feel sorry for my poor sister.

589
00:30:59,340 --> 00:30:59,860
= Ganfu Temple =

590
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,320
She’s confined to Ganfu Temple,

591
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,860
awaiting sentence.

592
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,390
After this incident,

593
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,440
Father always stays alone in his chamber

594
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,140
and he seldom speaks.

595
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,750
I’m sure he’s in great pain.

596
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:09,970
As I managed to save Father,

597
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,070
he finds me loyal

598
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,130
and trustworthy.

599
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,270
So he asks me

600
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,750
to handle all state affairs.

601
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,760
I feel pressured,

602
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,990
but I will not let him down.

603
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:25,030
I’ll be prudent as always.

604
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:52,030
Brother, come and catch me.

605
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,400
Slow down.

606
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,610
Come on, you can’t catch me.

607
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,180
I’m coming.

608
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,660
Come and catch me.

609
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:03,940
Slow down.

610
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:05,730
You can’t catch me. You can’t catch me.

611
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,180
Come on.

612
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,240
Wait for me.

613
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:11,460
Come on.

614
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,520
I got you.

615
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,280
I’m sorry, sir.

616
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,300
It’s alright.

617
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,630
Nice to meet you, sir.

618
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,190
Would you like some water?

619
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,060
Make yourself at home. Please.

620
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,010
- Please.
- Sir.

621
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,310
Come on in.

622
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:30,600
Have a seat.

623
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,700
This way.

624
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,140
Please.

625
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:34,900
Thank you.

626
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,470
Have some water.

627
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,290
I have got something to do.

628
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,610
I will be back soon.

629
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:46,950
Take a rest.

630
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:47,480
Sure.

631
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:50,830
You must have had a long journey.

632
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:51,900
Have some

633
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,950
homemade snacks.

634
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,650
Take your time. I’ll leave you alone.

635
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,450
Thank you.

636
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:01,320
Come here.

637
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,510
Let’s go inside.

638
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:11,650
Your Highness.

639
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,360
Let’s go back.

640
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,110
The sunset is so beautiful.

641
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:28,510
The sun sets every day.

642
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,540
Why are you full of sorrow, Your Highness?

643
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,340
Yes, the sunset is always there,

644
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,990
and so is time.

645
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,460
It goes day by day.

646
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:45,700
But people are different.

647
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,720
Once they leave,

648
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,200
they will never come back.

649
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:53,630
Do you miss Chang’an, Your Highness?

650
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:59,170
What I miss is not the city

651
00:34:59,170 --> 00:34:59,900
we see now,

652
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:04,070
but the one in my memory.

653
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,110
At that time, Chun and I were just kids,

654
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,640
and Chun liked to play hide-and-seek,

655
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,210
so I played it with her.

656
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,690
Mother and Fath...

657
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,020
They sat together

658
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,300
and watched us with smiles.

659
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,330
We were carefree and worriless.

660
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,240
But I didn’t

661
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,710
realize anything

662
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,360
until now

663
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,250
when everything is falling apart

664
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,420
that how happy

665
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,770
and how lucky we were

666
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,400
at that time.

667
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,380
Your Highness, the past is the past.

668
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,880
I know.

669
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,050
That’s why

670
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,750
I followed Father’s order

671
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:57,900
and came to Yanbei.

672
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,840
I thought

673
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,970
that could let the dust settle

674
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,100
and Chun would

675
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,990
be herself again.

676
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,340
Your Highness.

677
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,780
Please wait here for me.

678
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,230
Your Highness, look.

679
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,710
When I was a kid,

680
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,060
I was good at making this.

681
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,900
Everyone in the village

682
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,470
came to me for help.

683
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,410
There was a time

684
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,040
when scarecrows I made

685
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,570
were all over the fields in our village.

686
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,040
You must be a smart girl

687
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,030
when you were a kid.

688
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,100
Your neighbors

689
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,350
must’ve adored you.

690
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,580
I didn’t ask them

691
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,270
if they all liked me or not.

692
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,220
Perhaps I will

693
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,970
when we meet again in hell.

694
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,130
Did they...

695
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,820
They all died.

696
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:13,930
I was making scarecrows

697
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:14,980
in the field

698
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,070
and survived.

699
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:20,180
When I came home with joy,

700
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,110
I saw

701
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,470
something that I’d never forget

702
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,770
for the rest of my life.

703
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:37,320
My neighbors, friends,

704
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,060
brother,

705
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:43,560
mother

706
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,270
and father,

707
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,150
they were all soaked in blood.

708
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,590
It was thick and dark

709
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,030
as if a blood pool

710
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:03,060
seeing from afar.

711
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,370
Everyone has his or her

712
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:12,170
own story.

713
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,110
Just because I didn’t say it

714
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,110
doesn’t mean it didn’t hurt.

715
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,240
So you were taken to

716
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,230
the Death Camp

717
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,510
and trained to be an assassin?

718
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:31,340
Let bygones be bygones.

719
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,220
You can’t move on

720
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,170
if you don’t put the past behind.

721
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,700
I’m telling you all this

722
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,000
not to show you

723
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,040
how much I suffered,

724
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,100
but I hope you can move on

725
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,680
just like me,

726
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:51,750
then you will see hope.

727
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,730
Your Highness, please come here.

728
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,920
Do me a favor.

729
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,470
Great.

730
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,550
Our scarecrow is finished.

731
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,230
Meng Feng, thank you.

732
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,770
You did it yourself.

733
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,650
There is no need to thank me.

734
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:36,270
From now on,

735
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,610
I am just like this scarecrow

736
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,770
at the Meilin Pass.

737
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,450
I will guard

738
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,470
this land.

739
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:48,450
Let’s drink.

740
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:49,160
Drink. Drink.

741
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,200
Fill the cup.

742
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,140
Yes. Sure.

743
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,060
Quickly.

744
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,520
Here. Here.

745
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,710
Go.

746
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:59,810
Serve the liquor.

747
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,100
Yes.

748
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,590
Set the table.

749
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,770
Xiuli Army

750
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:23,760
has camped here for days.

751
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,010
They only patrol around the place.

752
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:26,190
Nothing is strange.

753
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,690
Young Master Yue asked us

754
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:28,810
to watch them in secret

755
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:30,090
for a reason.

756
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,560
Be patient.

757
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,180
Miss Chu has never mentioned anything

758
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,890
about transferring us

759
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:02,910
to Xiuli Mountain.

760
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,030
So?

761
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,480
Look carefully.

762
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,230
That’s His Highness’s order.

763
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:12,020
Does the Xiuli Army

764
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,510
only listen to Chu Qiao

765
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:15,310
but not His Highness?

766
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,840
General Cheng, that’s not what I meant.

767
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,140
Xiuli Army

768
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,460
is a crack troop.

769
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,070
A crack troop?

770
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,920
Indeed.

771
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,440
Hongchuan, Beishuo

772
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,920
and even Chang’an

773
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:39,430
were almost ruined

774
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,630
by you.

775
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,820
You are the best indeed.

776
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,660
Top-notch.

777
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,520
General Cheng, what’s that

778
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,670
supposed to mean?

779
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,680
I am just telling the truth.

780
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,080
You’re here to pick a fight!

781
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,990
Who the hell are you?

782
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,620
I’m talking to He Xiao.

783
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,350
How dare you interrupt us!

784
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,370
You…

785
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:14,510
General Cheng,

786
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:16,140
we’ll certainly

787
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,610
obey His Highness’s order.

788
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:19,830
But can we bid farewell to Miss Chu

789
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:21,120
before we leave?

790
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:23,080
That’s not necessary.

791
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:24,490
According to His Highness,

792
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:26,000
you must leave immediately.

793
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,470
Your army is downsized

794
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:28,230
because of casualties.

795
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,060
When you arrive at Xiuli Mountain,

796
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,620
you will merge with the force there.

797
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,030
Xiuli Army

798
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,520
will no longer exist.

799
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,310
Jiang Teng.

800
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:35,800
Take down their flag

801
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,100
and burn it.

802
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:37,970
Aye.

803
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,550
Stop!

804
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,800
Stop!

805
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:43,600
Stop!

806
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,380
What are you doing?

807
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,950
What are you doing?

808
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:51,270
What are you doing?

809
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:52,480
Step back, all of you!

810
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,630
Step back!

811
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:54,460
I’ll kill you!

812
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,280
Step back!

813
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:56,950
Let go of me!

814
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,350
Calm down!

815
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,350
They can kill us but not insult us.

816
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:01,130
Look at me.

817
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,380
Overreaching isn’t allowed.

818
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:53,660
If you still have dignity,

819
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,070
you should know

820
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,690
this flag represents

821
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:58,770
the greatest stigma of your entire army.

822
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,650
You betrayed Marquis,

823
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:03,400
which led to our defeat

824
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,170
and the massacres

825
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:06,790
in Hongchuan and Beishuo.

826
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,230
You were kicked out of

827
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:09,310
Chang’an,

828
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:11,440
so you came back to His Highness.

829
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,030
In order to survive,

830
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:15,920
you are all hiding behind a woman.

831
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:18,150
As a man,

832
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:19,590
I am ashamed

833
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:21,300
that you are part of our army.

834
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:22,460
Cheng Yuan.

835
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,600
It is not your place to judge

836
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,130
our loyalty.

837
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,620
When Yuan Qi’s troops came,

838
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,190
you escaped and abandoned the city.

839
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,490
After that,

840
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,820
you sacrificed your man’s life

841
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,070
to protect yourself.

842
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,380
And you call yourself a man?

843
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:39,650
Don’t be so full of yourself.

844
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,170
You are ashamed
that we are part of this army.

845
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:43,220
So are we

846
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,030
that we are your allies.

847
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:46,350
His Highness only ordered us

848
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,340
to station at Xiuli Mountain.

849
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,780
There was nothing else.

850
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,030
You better

851
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:52,410
give that flag back!

852
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:00,040
Do not touch

853
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,150
