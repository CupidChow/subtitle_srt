16
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,050
Oh, the physician said

17
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,730
there was some strange inner force

18
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,190
inside Xing’er.

19
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,600
I asked you to find out

20
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,090
what girls

21
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,350
managed to have strong inner force

22
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,650
in all sects

23
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,480
before they turned ten.

24
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:56,750
What have you got?

25
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,830
I’ve checked all sects,

26
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,780
but found no such girls.

27
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,700
Yet we failed to check

28
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,210
two secret files for now.

29
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,490
Which two?

30
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,160
Secret file for Twelve Elites in the palace

31
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,450
and for Death Camp in the legend.

32
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,410
Grandpa.

33
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,860
Young Master.

34
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,070
Jinzhu deserved her death.

35
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,410
Even if

36
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,710
Xing’er did little tricks,

37
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,440
she just intensified the problem

38
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:37,960
so that she could protect herself.

39
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,100
Yue, look up

40
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,820
and look into my eyes.

41
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,290
Yue.

42
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,470
If someday

43
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,750
I fail to

44
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,900
see through your eyes,

45
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,200
it means

46
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,190
you’ve already been

47
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,980
a supreme spy.

48
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,660
But you’ll no longer

49
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,490
be my closest grandson.

50
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,660
Grandpa, I never keep any secret

51
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,060
from you.

52
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,010
Fine, then.

53
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,310
You can keep Xing’er around

54
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,640
and train her

55
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,910
until she becomes

56
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,480
your sharpest weapon.

57
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,790
Yes, Grandpa.

58
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,920
You may leave.

59
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:28,970
Yes.

60
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:50,670
Master.

61
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,300
Zhan Mou, however shocked you are

62
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,680
to hear what I’m going to say,

63
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,780
you mustn’t tell anyone else

64
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,780
about it,

65
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,540
including my grandson Yuwen Yue.

66
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,790
Aye.

67
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,830
The spider from the Western Regions

68
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,960
which bit me exposed a case

69
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,800
sixteen years ago.

70
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,350
They used the same method

71
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,460
to kill the chief executive of

72
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,830
the Secret Service of Liang

73
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,750
who turned to us.

74
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,190
His death made His Majesty suspect

75
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,190
there was a spy in Yuwen Mansion.

76
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,870
Sixteen years ago,

77
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,310
His Majesty abandoned the Eye of Intel.

78
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,710
Could it be because

79
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,850
the murderer colluded with the Southern Dynasty

80
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,040
and betrayed our imperial court?

81
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,050
I didn’t expect

82
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,100
the spider to come from

83
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,680
the Third Branch of

84
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,790
our clan.

85
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,400
I can almost be sure that

86
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,330
Yuwen Xi colluded with Liang.

87
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,470
Master, let me send someone

88
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,740
to kill them secretly.

89
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,070
You mustn’t.

90
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,280
No Yue Guards

91
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,910
shall be involved in the scandal of

92
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,740
Yuwen clan.

93
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,570
I need someone

94
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,020
to kill them

95
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,060
who has nothing to do with our clan.

96
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:20,930
Then...

97
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,710
Master, do you mean Xing’er?

98
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,050
So,

99
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,140
you asked Young Master to train her?

100
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,140
My grandson

101
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,290
never keeps a secret from me.

102
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,710
But from today on,

103
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,790
I must keep something from him,

104
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,280
for His Majesty,

105
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,270
for our clan

106
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,710
and for the Eye of Intel.

107
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,780
Aye.

108
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,300
You can stop.

109
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,850
No.

110
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,730
I haven’t written three hundred words yet.

111
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,070
She’s pushing herself.

112
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,880
You’ve got the nerve.

113
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,550
No, I haven’t.

114
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,180
Do you have anything to say?

115
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,510
No... No.

116
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,770
The rainbow after the rain.

117
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,510
Your hometown

118
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,660
must be more beautiful than this place.

119
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,730
My hometown? I don’t remember.

120
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,100
You don’t remember?

121
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,270
I hurt my head

122
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,070
and I didn’t remember the past.

123
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,340
Fine.

124
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,860
Tell me

125
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,260
if anything interesting happened

126
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,170
after you came back

127
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,370
from the Guilty-slave Chamber.

128
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,710
Nothing interesting happened.

129
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,190
Young Master, it’s smart of you.

130
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,410
You should know everything.

131
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,830
Should this be

132
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,150
how you talk to your master?

133
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:12,950
Young Master.

134
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,240
I’m a mere

135
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,980
maid.

136
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,280
If you suspect that

137
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,520
I’m hiding something from you,

138
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,170
just torture me.

139
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,690
Don’t waste your time

140
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,600
to get words out of me.

141
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,540
Five senses make up for each other

142
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,020
to feel things.

143
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,680
When you can’t see,

144
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,590
you can hear and smell

145
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,570
more sensitively.

146
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,560
The smell helps you to see.

147
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,770
Smell it.

148
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,060
It’s the smell of pine needles.

149
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,280
Smell it again.

150
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,620
There’s also the smell of grass

151
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,770
under the hot sun.

152
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,220
It smells good and fresh.

153
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,190
And...

154
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,430
And some hidden smell.

155
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,310
If you dare to play tricks again,

156
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,420
I’ll hang you upside down for seven days.

157
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,980
I’ll be dead then.

158
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:01,900
What did you say?

159
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,990
Nothing. I mean...

160
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,440
I mean...

161
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,660
there’s smell from you.

162
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,100
Yes. You can recognize people with the smell.

163
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,630
Oh, I see.

164
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,570
It was the Gold Incense from Liang.

165
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,860
In the yard,

166
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,740
there was a flower in full bloom.

167
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,700
Go find it.

168
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,020
Do you want me to cut your hand?

169
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,120
Don’t move.

170
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,690
Are you pretending to be blind

171
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,610
for fortune-telling or for begging?

172
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,590
Who are you?

173
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,110
Go. Go away.

174
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,240
Oh, I know.

175
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,290
You must be playing the hide-and-seek.

176
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:21,930
Right?

177
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,320
Yeah. Yeah.

178
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,350
Wonderful.

179
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,200
Let me join you.

180
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,180
Don’t take off the patch.

181
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:27,650
When I count to three,

182
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,610
come and catch me.

183
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,960
One, two, three.

184
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,900
He uses such strong Gold Incense.

185
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,750
I’ll just use him to practice.

186
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,790
I’ll see where he can hide himself.

187
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,570
I got you.

188
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,000
Open your eyes

189
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,610
and see who I am!

190
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,830
Who are you?

191
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,750
You’re a wet boy

192
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,590
who is yelling,

193
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,450
aren’t you?

194
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,420
You! Wait!

195
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,320
Stop.

196
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,430
How dare you! You...

197
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,770
A horsewhip is used for a horse.

198
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,280
I don’t think you should use it on me.

199
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,310
Do you believe it or not?

200
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,550
I can kill your whole clan.

201
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,510
People in my clan

202
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,840
are almost dead.

203
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,660
If you still want to kill them,

204
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,400
it’ll take trouble

205
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,510
to find them out.

206
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,310
Stop.

207
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,760
It hurts. It hurts.

208
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,440
Let me go. Let me go.

209
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,760
It hurts. It hurts.

210
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,240
I hear Yuwen Huai

211
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,550
is having a big banquet today.

212
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,740
All playboys in Chang’an

213
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,590
are there.

214
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,240
Why are you asking for trouble with me

215
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,440
instead of going to the banquet?

216
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,870
Good.

217
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,290
You’re even satirizing me.

218
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,450
I’ve made up my mind.

219
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,880
I won’t kill your clan.

220
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,720
I’ll ask Yuwen Yue

221
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,710
to give you to me.

222
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,610
I’ll torture you in different ways

223
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:09,730
and see if you’ll surrender.

224
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,360
Give me to you?

225
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,190
Yes.

226
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,840
You little maid.

227
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,690
You’re sharp-tongued.

228
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,840
And you dare to fight me.

229
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,050
I don’t believe

230
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,300
you still dare to be so rude to me

231
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,400
after I own you.

232
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,520
I must conquer you.

233
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,200
But now

234
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,550
I no longer belong to Qingshan House.

235
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,260
Nor am I under the jurisdiction of Yuwen Yue.

236
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,480
I’ve met you many times,

237
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,780
but I forgot to ask you.

238
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,080
What’s your name now?

239
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,830
And what house do you work for?

240
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,880
My master favors me.

241
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,960
When you ask my master for me,

242
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,000
it depends on

243
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,650
if you’re capable to have me.

244
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,890
Stop kidding.

245
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:47,630
You are

246
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,630
a mere maid.

247
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,920
Even if I want eight or ten maids,

248
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,460
the Yuwen family must give them to me.

249
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,260
Fine. Listen carefully.

250
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,120
My name is Void.

251
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,030
Now I work for Fictitious House.

252
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,320
I’m a maid,

253
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,200
under the leadership of Ms. Dou.

254
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,330
Every day,

255
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,920
I mold clay figurines

256
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,240
for young masters and ladies.

257
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,430
Do remember that.

258
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,740
You mold clay figurines?

259
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,580
Sure.

260
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,830
I can do a lot of things.

261
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,020
I’ll show you someday.

262
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,280
Okay.

263
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,640
Miss Void, go back

264
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,890
and get packed.

265
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,510
I’ll send guards to pick you up.

266
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,390
Miss Void from Fictitious House.

267
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:03,940
A maid subordinate to Ms. Dou

268
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,520
who molds clay figurines?

269
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,150
That was unexpected.

270
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,280
You climbed so high.

271
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,460
Don’t you fear you’ll fall and die?

272
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,960
Don’t bother.

273
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,900
But you little wicked Wild Kitten,

274
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,960
worry more about yourself.

275
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,820
See? Dark clouds are over there.

276
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:21,920
Maybe lightning will flash

277
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,950
and thunder will rumble

278
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,350
to kill those sneaky guys like you.

279
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,380
Don’t worry. You’re up so high.

280
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,110
The thunder will kill you before me.

281
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,240
What the hell do you want?

282
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,050
The thunder has eyes.

283
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,210
Bad ass. Bad ass. Bad ass.

284
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,180
Bad ass. Bad ass.

285
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,150
Bad ass.

286
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,050
Bad ass. Bad ass.

287
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:57,840
Cangwu Bird.

288
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,870
Bad ass. Bad ass.

289
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,400
See? What goes around comes around.

290
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:08,930
When you chuckle at people’s misfortune,

291
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,150
you look so pretty.

292
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,050
Young Master.

293
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,330
Prince Yuan Song and His Excellency Yan Xun

294
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,160
have arrived at the gate.

295
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,840
Do we need to tell them

296
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,600
you can see now?

297
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,640
I don’t think so.

298
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,380
We must pretend before His Majesty.

299
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,270
Keep it a secret.

300
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,520
Your Highness.

301
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:53,680
Yuwen Yue.

302
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,480
Prince Yu.

303
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,570
Were you sweating?

304
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,300
Or did you fall into a pool

305
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,650
by accident?

306
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,350
Aren’t you blind?

307
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,820
How do you know I fell in water?

308
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,270
I’m blind, but not deaf.

309
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,430
You’re walking

310
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,450
with different footsteps.

311
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,460
And you’re rubbing your robe so hard.

312
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,070
I can easily figure that out.

313
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,180
It’s smart of you.

314
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,460
As smart as the hound

315
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,390
I’m raising.

316
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,240
I wondered

317
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,740
why Mr. Cold had such an extreme taste today

318
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,600
to use the mud as incense?

319
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,740
I didn’t know it was from Prince Yu.

320
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,560
I think the smell of bird droppings

321
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,480
was from Cangwu Bird

322
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,690
who made fun of you again.

323
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,080
Then go punish the damn bird.

324
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,410
Seems like

325
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,400
I’m not the unluckiest guy today.

326
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:42,790
How do you feel now?

327
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,860
Are your eyes getting better?

328
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,840
Not really.

329
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,150
God blesses the good man.

330
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,010
Rest assured, Prince Yu.

331
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,370
Maybe his eye disease

332
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,390
will be gone

333
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,650
without medical help someday.

334
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:55,930
No way.

335
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,540
We can’t miss Mr. Cold

336
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,960
among Five Aces of Chang’an.

337
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,160
Well, when I go back,

338
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,450
I’ll ask my father

339
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,120
to send you the best physician.

340
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,290
Thanks, Prince Yu.

341
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,560
I really wonder

342
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,670
what you come for today.

343
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,670
Mr. Cold.

344
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,270
I don’t think you’ll decline me

345
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,340
if I want someone from you.

346
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:14,580
Right?

347
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,950
It depends on who you want.

348
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,860
The only survivor

349
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,090
I spared in the human hunting ground

350
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,200
last time.

351
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,600
And at the birthday party,

352
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,520
she pleaded for her sister.

353
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,350
She’s Miss Void

354
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,170
in Fictitious House.

355
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,260
You must have recognized the wrong guy.

356
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,410
Impossible.

357
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,730
That’s possible.

358
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,930
I must have recognized her.

359
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,460
She has big eyes.

360
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,710
She seldom smiles.

361
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,500
But when she smiles,

362
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,080
she is as pretty

363
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,980
as the beautiful clouds in the sky.

364
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,460
I can’t

365
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,760
always remember people.

366
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,990
But this girl

367
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,560
has impressed me greatly.

368
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,360
Prince Yu.

369
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,110
The maid Void from Fictitious House

370
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,290
who works for Ms. Dou

371
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,270
and molds clay figurines.

372
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,410
Isn’t she fictitious

373
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,610
and making fun of you?

374
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,270
Void? Fictitious?

375
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,310
How dared she lie to me!

376
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,600
Sorry, Prince Yu.

377
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,410
Even a naive maid

378
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,480
managed to cheat me.

379
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,340
I can be more naive, right?

380
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,940
Forget it. Let’s come to the point.

381
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,970
Yuwen Yue, Mother asked me

382
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,270
to take you a message.

383
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,490
She said the commander’s tally

384
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,540
you handed in

385
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,590
would never go to Yuwen Huai.

386
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,110
Don’t say thank you.

387
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,160
I’ll take her away.

388
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,480
Wait.

389
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,490
Do you mean Wild Kitten?

390
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,000
I want her.

391
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,270
You both want Xing’er,

392
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,580
don’t you?

393
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,370
Yes.

394
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,230
Right.

395
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:40,840
But there’s only one Xing’er.

396
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,820
You’re Prince Yu.

397
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,360
And you’re the son of Marquis Dingbei.

398
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,580
I can offend

399
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,000
neither of you.

400
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,290
Give her to me, of course.

401
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,010
To me.

402
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,390
Stop arguing.

403
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,090
My eyes haven’t recovered yet.

404
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,700
I need Xing’er to stay

405
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,450
and take care of me

406
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:00,280
in case

407
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,990
you hate each other as well.

408
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:02,810
But...

409
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:05,090
Yueqi, take Prince Yu to get changed

410
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,250
in case he gets a cold.

411
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,690
Aye.

412
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,310
This way, please.

413
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,180
= Lingyue Chamber =

414
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,820
I think

415
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:39,740
Yuwen Huai must be

416
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,040
behind the Jade Dog.

417
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,530
Do you think I don’t understand?

418
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,160
His Majesty wants you and him

419
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,400
to restrain each other.

420
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,460
But considering

421
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,130
what Yuwen Huai has done to you,

422
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,580
His Majesty must

423
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,650
abandon him.

424
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,760
His Majesty wants his subordinates

425
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,380
to restrain each other,

426
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,590
but he doesn’t want anyone

427
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,790
to be dominant.

428
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,810
Even you understand that.

429
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,360
Doesn’t your father understand?

430
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,990
After you go back to Yanbei,

431
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,580
advise your father to keep a low profile

432
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,530
and bide his time.

433
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,120
My father and His Majesty

434
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,280
are sworn brothers.

435
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,870
He saved His Majesty three times.

436
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,360
Besides,

437
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,870
they grew up together.

438
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,700
Anyway,

439
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,710
I’m still in Chang’an.

440
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,630
Why must His Majesty

441
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:27,560
worry about our place?

442
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,810
I think you should

443
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:30,640
advise your uncle

444
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,570
General Zhuguo

445
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,540
to keep a low profile.

446
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,210
It doesn’t matter what a profile he keeps.

447
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,130
Even His Majesty can’t change him.

448
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:39,390
I don’t like to bother.

449
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,620
Is that why you can be willful?

450
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,560
When His Majesty

451
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:47,570
gave the commander’s tally,

452
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,030
you just declined it

453
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:49,900
as if it had been a hot potato?

454
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:52,960
Who doesn’t know me wonders what I want.

455
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,030
But who knows you understands

456
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,000
what you’re worried about.

457
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,470
Do you not want the commander’s tally,

458
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,550
or do you not dare to take it?

459
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,330
Besides protecting the capital city,

460
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,040
did His Majesty give you

461
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,230
some other secret mission?

462
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,080
You’d better

463
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,220
worry more about yourself.

464
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,650
Find a chance to go back to Yanbei.

465
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:13,770
What?

466
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,110
Sounds like

467
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,700
you mean something else.

468
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,550
I’m blind now.

469
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:20,950
But I see things with my heart.

470
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,910
Princess Chun loves you.

471
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,040
If you refuse her,

472
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,120
Prince Yu will not let you go.

473
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,570
Noble Consort Wei and His Majesty

474
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,080
will also punish you.

475
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,860
If you accept her,

476
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,710
you can’t bear with

477
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:35,950
her obstinacy.

478
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,560
So, the only solution

479
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,100
is to leave Chang’an

480
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,300
and go back to Yanbei.

481
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,190
There will be less trouble.

482
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,860
What about your own trouble?

483
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,800
Mr. Cold.

484
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,290
I realized you were pretending.

485
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,320
So what?

486
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,930
Yuan Song was gone. Stop pretending to be blind.

487
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,140
I know what you want.

488
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,270
But I’m not like you.

489
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,580
I’m not afraid of trouble.

490
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,110
Instead, I even want to sacrifice myself

491
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,270
to look for some trouble.

492
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,170
What do you mean?

493
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,150
I want to share your burden

494
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,410
when you’re in trouble.

495
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,860
For example,

496
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,210
taking away a useless maid

497
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,600
who always makes trouble.

498
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,200
We’re friends.

499
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,580
I can’t give you a useless maid.

500
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,010
Good, Yuwen Yue.

501
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,190
Thank you for your warning,

502
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,020
anyway.

503
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:41,620
= Xun =

504
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,140
= Seal of Yan Xun =

505
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:47,610
Fengmian.

506
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,330
Here.

507
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,390
Your Excellency.

508
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:54,000
Travel day and night

509
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,160
and send this letter to my father.

510
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,830
This is a very important letter.

511
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,400
Don’t let anyone else have it.

512
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,170
Got it?

513
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,010
Yes.

514
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,500
Oh,

515
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,550
if my father asks about me,

516
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,110
tell him everything is fine with me.

517
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,650
And take my regards

518
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:07,730
to my father and mother.

519
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,390
Go.

520
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,160
Aye.

521
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,570
Leave us.

522
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,190
Aye.

523
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,450
Be seated.

524
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,580
Yuwen Yue, as requested,

525
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,580
I checked the secret file myself

526
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:48,540
and found a girl

527
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,400
who had strong inner force.

528
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,610
Luo He’s daughter?

529
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,200
This is the closest identity.

530
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,010
But it’s also the most impossible identity.

531
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,780
Luo He’s daughter

532
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,070
is the new master of Storm Token.

533
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,330
But she fell into the Yellow River one year ago,

534
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:15,940
didn’t she?

535
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,390
So, it’s the most impossible identity.

536
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:33,860
= Qingshan House =

537
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,620
Is Jing Xiaoliu

538
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,870
your real sister?

539
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,820
She... she is.

540
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,230
Why are you hesitating?

541
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,260
Are you hiding something?

542
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,750
I am.

543
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,350
Because…

544
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:59,090
she’s not a legal daughter of our family.

545
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,670
She’s the daughter of my father’s concubine.

546
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,980
Since she was taken back,

547
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,000
she has been talking little.

548
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,110
She seldom played with us.

549
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,590
Xiaoliu, what are you dazing at?

550
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,470
Come.

551
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,780
- Come.
- Xiaoliu, come.

552
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,730
Play with us.

553
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:17,950
Yeah. It’s fun.

554
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,250
Xiaoliu, come.

555
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,520
What a poor girl!

556
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,170
She doesn’t know

557
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,050
where her mother is.

558
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,970
My father had her divined,

559
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:31,140
saying she would always be alone.

560
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,730
As expected,

561
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,180
she left without telling anyone

562
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,500
after staying with us for over one year.

563
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,110
It wasn’t long

564
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,050
before people in our hometown were massacred.

565
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,430
Our parents were killed.

566
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,050
We were sold to

567
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,010
your family.

568
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,160
We didn’t know

569
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,370
what had happened to her

570
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,190
during this period.

571
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:57,530
Later,

572
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,210
within half a month after she came,

573
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,710
Linxi and Zhixiang died, too.

574
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:03,790
Would she

575
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,510
really be a jinx

576
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,170
and will get all families dead?

577
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,290
She’s a jinx.

578
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,930
She’s sharp.

579
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:20,220
She has no one to rely on and she must fight.

580
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,780
She’s born to be a fighter.

581
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:25,230
Interesting.

582
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,190
Yue.

583
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,030
Why are you in a mood

584
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,510
to enjoy the scenery?

585
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,210
Why do you want to see me?

586
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,950
We’re cousins.

587
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,480
We should get close to each other.

588
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,860
Must there be a reason?

589
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,540
You always do things without a reason,

590
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,170
don’t you?

591
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,670
You even caught my own maid

592
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,470
without telling me.

593
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,070
What else

594
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:04,510
can’t you check?

595
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,620
She’s a mere maid.

596
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,160
We don’t need to

597
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,870
hate each other for her.

598
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:10,660
Oh,

599
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,970
I haven’t seen Ms. Song

600
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,790
for days.

601
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,900
I wonder where she has gone.

602
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,720
You really like to worry.

603
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,230
You take care of everything

604
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,680
in our mansion.

605
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,320
You even remember

606
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,970
the name of a female steward.

607
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,560
Grandpa leaves the big family

608
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,600
to me.

609
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,960
I’m taking great responsibilities.

610
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,090
Unlike you, Yue.

611
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,220
You always live an easy life.

612
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,050
We can’t live an easy life without peace.

613
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,850
With so many distracting thoughts

614
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,110
and so many plans,

615
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,320
how can I live an easy life?

616
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,780
I’m an ordinary man.

617
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,630
But you sound so allegorical.

618
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:57,850
I always live

619
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,370
in rumors.

620
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:03,550
Rumors get completely changed

621
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,440
after going around.

622
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,200
When you’re confused by rumors,

623
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,640
don’t you feel tired?

624
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,760
Evidence matters instead of rumors.

625
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,290
Why must you defend

626
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,670
a mere maid?

627
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,910
You don’t know what pleases me.

628
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,210
I think you know me best.

629
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,720
I hate it most

630
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,830
when someone touches my things

631
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,210
or my people.

632
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,920
The Cold Food Festival is coming.

633
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,370
Shall we hold a tea party

634
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,050
and invite Princess Chun?

635
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,280
You won’t refuse, will you?

636
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,340
As you wish.

637
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,120
Wait here.

638
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,010
There you are.

639
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,910
Mr. Cold, where is Wild Kitten?

640
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,330
Why isn’t she coming with you?

641
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,440
Here comes Princess Yuan Chun.

642
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,180
Is everybody there?

643
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,360
I think so.

644
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,050
I just saw

645
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:07,030
the horse of His Excellency Yan Xun.

646
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,210
How dare you!

647
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,530
Didn’t you watch your steps?

648
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,080
Greetings, Your Highness.

649
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,960
I’m sorry.

650
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,080
Please punish me.

651
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,390
All right. Don’t scare her.

652
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,240
You may rise.

653
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,350
Thank you, Your Highness.

654
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,720
Your Highness.

655
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:38,620
Wish you peace and happiness, Your Highness.

656
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,550
It’s rat poison.

657
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,130
Very poisonous. Don’t touch it.

658
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,510
It kills people.

659
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,280
It does?

660
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,700
Your Highness.

661
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:49,800
Did you touch anything?

662
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,660
Does it hurt?

663
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,980
I don’t think so.

664
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:55,920
Really?

665
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,300
I’m fine.

666
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,170
You know pretty much.

667
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:02,440
Awesome.

668
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,280
Thank you, Your Highness.

669
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,820
You maid.

670
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,820
How dare you bring such poison

671
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,800
to Her Highness!

672
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,040
What do you want?

673
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,050
Chun.

674
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,400
Why are you still here?

675
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,190
Everyone else is waiting for you over there.

676
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,250
Xing’er?

677
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,770
Why are you kneeling?

678
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:20,880
Get up. Hurry.

679
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,290
I’m Xing’er.

680
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:24,740
Greetings, Prince Yu.

681
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,850
Xing’er?

682
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,480
You’re Xing’er?

683
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,400
Wild Kitten Yan Xun mentioned?

684
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,610
Raise your head

685
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,040
and let me see your face.

686
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,830
I remember you.

687
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,170
You’re the maid

688
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,890
who was punished for making a mistake.

689
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,730
What Wild Kitten or Dog?

690
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:52,730
Come on.

691
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,320
Everybody is waiting for you.

692
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,540
Let’s go. Go.

693
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,570
But...

694
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,020
- I haven’t finished yet.
- Go.

695
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,500
Don’t push me.

696
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,810
I haven’t finished yet.

697
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,520
Xing’er, come in, too.

698
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,210
Go. Go. Go.

699
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:07,140
Why is she the Wild Kitten?

700
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,200
Here it is.

701
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,240
Is everybody there?

702
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,390
Yes. Yes.

703
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,070
Everybody is there.

704
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:25,940
Has Yan Xun

705
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,930
come?

706
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,480
Sure. He’s over there.

707
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,490
Look.

708
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,980
Yan Xun.

709
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,030
Why didn’t you come out

710
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,930
- and welcome me?
- Greetings, Your Highness.

711
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:38,710
Greetings, Your Highness.

712
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,460
Chun, come.

713
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,570
Come and have some tea. Hurry.

714
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,870
Xing’er. Come over.

715
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,760
What do you want, Your Highness?

716
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:31,800
Cold Ice.

717
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,910
I hear your maid Xing’er is good at

718
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,170
making the tea.

719
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,710
May I use her

720
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:40,770
to make some tea for us?

721
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,860
Xing’er, make the tea.

722
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:49,830
Aye.

723
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,400
When having tea,

724
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,440
there are rules.

725
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,560
Tea and stories.

726
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,960
We’ve got a lot of stories in our mansion.

727
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,410
I’m sure you don’t know.

728
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,400
There is a Forbidden Lake nearby.

729
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,930
When a dead body is thrown into it,

730
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,770
it’ll be gone soon.

731
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:44,760
Guess

732
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,220
how many dead bodies there are.

733
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,110
We’re enjoying the tea.

734
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:50,930
Please enjoy it, Prince Yu.

735
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,270
Why do you say something

736
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,170
so disgusting?

737
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,710
If you want to know the number of bodies,

738
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:55,920
that’s easy.

739
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,730
Dry the lake and you’ll see.

740
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,320
Good idea.

741
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,930
I’ll try it lately.

742
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,770
Xing’er, there you are.

743
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,020
Come. Come.

744
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,900
Xing’er.

745
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,570
Do you know what incense it is?

746
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:33,820
You don’t know, huh?

747
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,940
You don’t know.

748
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,300
My cousin

749
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,460
and everyone else here

750
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,550
don’t know, either.

751
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,450
This incense

752
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,220
is made by my grandfather

753
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,480
with the blood of a virgin

754
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,120
and medicine from the Western Regions.

755
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,930
In my mansion,

756
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:53,150
there’s a maid named Zhixiang.

757
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,650
This maid

758
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:56,270
is dead.

759
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,990
But in Pleasure Pavilion,

760
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:00,500
her blood incense is still burnt.

761
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,970
That smells perfect.

762
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,160
Yuwen Huai.

763
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,930
Zhixiang is Wild Kitten’s sister.

764
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,430
Don’t go too far.

765
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:11,640
Yeah.

766
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,200
Even a horse or a dog

767
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,390
has families.

768
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,700
Not to mention a maid.

769
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,340
What horse or dog?

770
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:21,080
When they die,

771
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,610
they’re nothing.

772
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,750
I’d rather make them into blood incense.

773
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,010
You...

774
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,790
The blood incense

775
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,100
smells great,

776
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,030
especially when people are

777
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,120
having sex.

778
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,050
Oh, Yue,

779
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:39,390
if you send Xing’er

780
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,830
to Pleasure Pavilion

781
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,560
and make her into blood incense,

782
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:47,120
she’ll be great, too.

783
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:52,100
Yuwen Huai, enough!

784
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,520
What?

785
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,230
We should share good things,

786
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,480
shouldn’t we?

787
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:02,780
Xing’er, come.

788
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,610
Smell it.

789
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:06,990
Smell it

790
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,950
and see if it smells like your sister?

791
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,760
Smells good, doesn’t it?

792
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,700
It’s wonderful.

793
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,380
Young Master Huai, you really are a rich man.

794
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:37,930
You enjoy such a unique thing.

795
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:39,750
But you’d better

796
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,360
keep such a thing

797
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,600
to yourself.

798
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,350
I don’t deserve to enjoy it.

799
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,110
Young Master Yue, I don’t feel well.

800
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,580
I’d like to have a rest.

801
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,220
Yan Xun...

802
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,640
Why is it you?

803
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,230
Why do you come?

804
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,780
The wind blows hard by the lake.

805
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,560
You’re wearing a thin dress.

806
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,440
Put the cape on.

807
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,540
Who wants your cape?

808
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,670
What virgin incense?

809
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,070
So disgusting.

810
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,320
You know what?

811
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:50,210
Everyone

812
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,300
in your mansion

813
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,540
is a freak.

814
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,040
I know you hate me.

815
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:57,550
I’m glad you know that.

816
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,630
Yes. You should be hating me.

817
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:04,850
I’m a son of a concubine.

818
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,680
But you’re different.

819
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,520
You’re no ordinary girl.

820
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,590
You’re from a noble family.

821
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,810
You’re kind, generous and lovely.

822
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,820
You’re the most beautiful girl

823
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,290
I’ve ever met.

824
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,160
I am beautiful.

825
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:28,200
But you’re

826
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,440
going too far.

827
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:31,530
I’m not that perfect.

828
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,440
But I’d like to warn you.

829
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,210
Don’t ever dream to get me.

830
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:36,780
I will never like you.

831
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:38,800
I know

832
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,800
I can never get close to you.

833
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,390
All I can do is to watch you from far away.

834
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:48,250
In fact,

835
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:50,030
I think

836
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,720
everybody has his advantages.

837
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,420
You, for example.

838
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,070
You have...

839
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:56,830
You have...

840
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:02,440
Well, I can’t think of any

841
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,710
for the moment.

842
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:04,730
But...

843
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,710
you must have some advantages, I guess.

844
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:12,830
I do have some advantages.

845
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,460
What?

846
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:17,190
I like what you like.

847
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,060
And I hate what you hate.

848
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,740
Whatever you like,

849
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:22,980
I’ll get it

850
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,190
to you.

851
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:25,720
Whatever you don’t like,

852
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:27,860
I’ll destroy it, too.

853
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,980
What... what do you mean?

854
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,880
When the Cold Food Festival ends in three days,

855
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,220
I’ll make everything and everyone

856
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,620
you hate

857
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,790
disappear in front of you.

858
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:47,880
Are you...

859
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,250
Are you going to

860
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,540
sell Xing’er?

861
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,530
I don’t like her.

862
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:59,780
But don’t go too far.

863
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:03,520
I won’t tell you then,

864
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,600
in case I scare you.
