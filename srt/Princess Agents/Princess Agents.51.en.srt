General He,

17
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,750
we’re losing Hongchuan.

18
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,300
Take you men and prepare
for street fighting.

19
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,990
Protect civilians

20
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,650
and fight

00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,730

Consider it done.

Go!

Wei Shuye, seize the day and pursue!

Go!

Retreat!

32
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,200

Ge Qi!

00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,700
Didn’t see this coming, did you?

36
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,620
I’ve endured

37
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,470
and suffered all kinds of insults

38
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,670
and torture just for

39
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,660
this very moment

40
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
so that I can watch you

41
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,750
going down.

42
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,630
You people ruined my life!

43
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,210
I will make you pay

44
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,550
a thousand times more!

45
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,020
How do you feel?

46
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,330
Do you hate me?

47
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,060
Do you regret

48
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,150
saving me that day?

49
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,890
You wish I were dead,

50
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,310
don’t you?

51
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,190
But what can you do?

52
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,120
You’re still going to die

53
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,390
under my sword today.

54
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,940
Doesn’t Yan Xun like you?

55
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,940
Don’t worry.

56
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,370
I will drop your head

57
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,100
to Yan Xun

58
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,260
so that he can mourn your death.

59
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,650
Aren’t you kind

60
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,910
and brave?

61
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,620
Doesn’t everyone like you?

62
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,960
Go to hell now!

63
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,430
Yan Xun is back!

00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,450
Retreat!

65
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,630

66
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,460
Retreat!

67
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,320
Retreat!

68
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,040
Retreat!

69
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,520
Kill!

70
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,310
Kill!

71
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,310
Go!

72
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,200
Princess!

73
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,150
Catch her!

74
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,380
Don’t let her go!

75
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,510
Princess, are you all right?

76
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,130
Get up.

77
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,270
Princess.

78
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,190
Let me go.

79
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,740
Stop!

80
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,970
I’ll kill her!

81
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,280
Let’s go!

82
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,500
Let me go!

83
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,340
Let’s go, Princess!

84
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,620
Let go of me!

85
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:45,940
Achu.

86
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:47,590
Achu!

87
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,240
Father.

88
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,610
Father!

89
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,630
Father.

90
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,350
Father.

91
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,880
Your father

92
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,180
hid us here.

93
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,570
Father!

94
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,470
Xiangxiang.

95
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,570
Be good, sweetie.

96
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,430
Are you Mrs. Ge?

97
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,060
Who are you?

98
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,950
We are Ge Qi’s friends.

99
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:46,720
Hi, sweetie,

100
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,780
what’s your name?

101
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,760
Her name is...

102
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,420
My name is Ge Xiangxiang.

103
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,960
Girls are sweet.

104
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,160
They’re caring.

105
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:00,880
What brings you here?

106
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,280
Where is Ge Qi?

107
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,940
Why hasn’t he come back?

108
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,120
Ge Qi was killed by the Wei Army

109
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,330
in order to guard Hongchuan.

110
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,890
This is his pension

111
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,680
from His Excellency Yan Xun.

112
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,680
Ge Qi wanted me to tell you

113
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,390
that he wasn’t a traitor.

114
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,200
He wanted to return home with dignity.

115
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,270
I knew he wasn’t.

116
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,420
I knew it.

117
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,100
I knew he wasn’t.

118
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,250
- Xiangxiang.
- Mom.

119
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,770
My baby girl.

120
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,120
Don’t worry about us.

121
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,140
The city is surrounded.

122
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,670
Food is limited.

123
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,650
Leave these

124
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,260
to the soldiers.

125
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:20,880
They can’t battle

126
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,390
on an empty stomach.

127
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,610
The locals

128
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,960
have accepted you.

129
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,030
Don’t let them down.

= Weipin Pavilion =

132
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,150
He left?

133
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,120
Do you like me?

134
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,740
I...

135
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,460
Do not.

136
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,080
You do!

137
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,760
I… I don’t.

138
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,540
Am I not pretty?

139
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,870
You are!

140
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,010
I like you.

141
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:22,920
Miss Chu!

142
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,640
Ping’an.

143
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,040
You’re finally awake.

144
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:28,990
How long did I sleep?

145
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,600
You slept for a whole day.

146
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,940
We were worried sick.

147
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,490
How are things out there?

148
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,150
Don’t worry.

149
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,780
His Highness arrived just in time.

150
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,300
The Wei Army has withdrawn in defeat.

151
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,480
Now, His Highness is dealing with

152
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,930
the remnants.

153
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,580
How are those wounded soldiers?

154
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:03,920
All of them

155
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,250
are gathered in the camp,

156
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,190
being treated by physicians in town.

157
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,930
Tell them

158
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,450
to treat patients

159
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,340
according to

160
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,350
the severity of their conditions.

161
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,950
Save as many

162
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:14,600
as they can.

163
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,310
Yes, Your Highness.

164
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,920
I will convey your order to them.

165
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:19,540
About

166
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,980
the deceased…

167
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,100
The remains have been given to the bereaved

168
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,250
if they come to claim them.

169
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,500
And the rest

170
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,270
have been buried properly.

171
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,160
Any news about Young Master Yuwen?

172
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,290
Nothing yet, I’m afraid.

173
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,760
We’ve lost sign of him
since the withdrawal

174
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,770
of Yan Xun and his army.

175
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,700
Maybe he left to go after them.

176
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,620
Don’t let it out.

177
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,710
Or it will demoralize the army.

178
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:50,850
Aye.

179
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,520
As far as I know,

180
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,380
he’s not a reckless person.

181
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,260
Even if he gets held up,

182
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,620
he will come back in time.

183
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,510
How are your injuries?

184
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,810
Thank you for your concern.

185
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,680
I’m fully recovered.

186
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,600
That’s good.

187
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,130
Don’t let this happen again.

188
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,170
Do you think I don’t know

189
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,260
what you are thinking?

190
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,790
Keep in mind that

191
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,330
you and Xing’er

192
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,440
are on different sides now.

193
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,710
Hearing that Yuwen Yue got wounded,

194
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,720
I came to visit him.

195
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,690
Thank you, Your Highness.

196
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,010
I am fine.

197
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,250
Your Highness, I didn’t know you’d come.

198
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,820
Please forgive me for my rudeness.

199
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,170
No apology needed, Master Yuwen.

200
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,710
Your Highness, I heard that

201
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,450
you’ve been handling
the aftermath of the war.

202
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,360
Although the rebels in Yanbei
should be killed,

203
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:16,290
right now, they are in high morale

204
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,690
and strong.

205
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,170
With the stalemate,

206
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,170
and the threat of Liang,

207
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,150
we are attacked front and rear.

208
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,020
This is not an easy war.

209
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,310
Both sides will lose.

210
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,870
And Liang intends to

211
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,130
take advantage of the situation.

212
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,630
The victims who suffered the most

213
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,530
are those innocent people.

214
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:03,050
The land is abandoned.

215
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,820
Wives lost their husbands.

216
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,200
Babies in the cradles

217
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,210
lost their fathers.

218
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,000
That’s the last thing

219
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,870
I want to see.

220
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,870
Your Highness,

221
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,090
you’re compassionate.

222
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,410
Father is determined to kill Yan Xun,

223
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,560
while Yan Xun wants revenge.

224
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,750
This is a Gordian knot.

225
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,910
I cannot untie it.

226
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:35,510
Man proposes and God disposes.

227
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,510
You will figure something out

228
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,200
for the sake of the people.

229
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,510
Miss Chu.

230
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,700
Take care of yourself. Don’t catch a cold.

231
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,410
Your...

232
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,540
Miss Chu.

233
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,680
Miss Chu.

234
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,090
His Highness is outside.

235
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,120
Ping’an.

236
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,120
Go to bed.

237
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,130
I’m going to sleep, too.

238
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,430
Aye.

239
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,180
Your Highness.

240
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,850
How is Achu?

241
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,190
Is she getting better?

242
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,570
Your Highness,

243
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,360
she just took the medicine,

244
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,380
and she is resting now.

245
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,860
And diner?

246
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,370
She only had some porridge.

247
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,040
Her appetite was not good.

248
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,530
Go to the kitchen later.

249
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,190
I’ve had them make

250
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,070
sweet potato cakes for her.

251
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,470
Once they’re done,

252
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,170
bring her some tomorrow morning.

253
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,370
Aye, Your Highness.

254
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,630
Your Highness, you have been

255
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,390
fiddling with this jade recently.

256
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,280
Is it something valuable?

257
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,360
Not exactly.

258
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:15,610
Ajing,

259
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,540
is it nice?

260
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,310
Your Highness, I am a vulgar man.

261
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,290
I don’t understand this kind of thing.

262
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,280
But it does

263
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,490
look good.

264
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,760
I think so, too.

265
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,300
And I want to polish it,

266
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,670
making it smoother,

267
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,270
and give it to Achu.

268
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,190
Your Highness,

269
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,660
you treat her so well.

270
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:43,890
Exquisite as this jade is,

271
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,290
it is kind of small.

272
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,010
You should give her a bigger one.

273
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,510
That’s more generous.

274
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,250
My father was dexterous.

275
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,630
He could wield swords,

276
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,140
make liquor,

277
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,580
craft silverware and fine jade.

278
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,870
I left home early,

279
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,540
learning nothing from him.

280
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,520
This is terrible.

281
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,950
Your Highness, don’t say that,

282
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,150
or think like that.

283
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,260
You see, you and Achu

284
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,630
have been through so much together.

285
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,960
At that time

286
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,700
when you had nothing,

287
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:19,650
she never

288
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:21,060
abandoned you.

289
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,710
That shows

290
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,500
she loves you deeply.

291
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:27,040
Now, she is just being moody,

292
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,160
and upset.

293
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,480
Cheer her up
and she’ll soften towards you.

294
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,210
Also, I think that

295
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,380
it’s high time that you two get married.

296
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,300
You’re old enough after all.

297
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:40,640
Ajing.

298
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,630
Look at the city outside the windows.

299
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:47,990
Your Highness.

300
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,010
It’s pitch dark.

301
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,330
What’s there to see?

302
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,490
Yes.

303
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,220
The war broke Yanbei.

304
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,020
Recuperation is the priority.

305
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,570
I, Yan Xun,

306
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,880
am just a rebel,

307
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,110
holing up at a corner.

308
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,980
If I marry Achu now,

309
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,860
she will be the wife of a rebel.

310
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,430
I want to give her

311
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,220
the best of everything.

312
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,870
So I still need to wait.

313
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:25,850
My only concern is

314
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,920
if she can fully recover.

315
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,940
Your Highness, relax.

316
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,360
I’m here.

317
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:34,420
Trust me.

318
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,960
I will cook

319
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,130
whatever she wants to eat.

320
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,400
The better she eats,

321
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,560
the sooner she recovers.

322
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,880
You are a general

323
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,770
with your own troops now.

324
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,230
Do you still think that you were the cook

325
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,220
back in the Oriole Courtyard?

326
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,500
Your Highness. Please don’t say that.

327
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,690
You and Miss Chu

328
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:55,960
saved my lives.

329
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,270
I would like to cook meals for you

330
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,420
for the rest of my life.

331
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,810
I’ll always be your cook.

332
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,420
= Yanbei Mansion =

333
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,430
Achu.

334
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,510
Zhong Yu.

335
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,320
I heard that you had been wounded,

336
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,280
so I drop by to visit you.

337
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,090
Come in.

338
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,500
Achu.

339
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,020
Thank you.

340
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,460
What... What for?

341
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,430
Hadn’t it been for you,

342
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,570
Hongchuan would’ve been taken

343
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:48,710
before reinforcements arrived.

344
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,250
Actually, I’m the one
who should thank you.

345
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,270
Without your message to Yan Xun,

346
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,110
I’m afraid

347
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,350
I would have been

348
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,500
long gone by now.

349
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,920
I simply did my job.

350
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,320
Before leaving Hongchuan,

351
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,950
His Highness had already assigned me
to protect you.

352
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,270
How are you?

353
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,300
Almost recovered.

354
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,620
That’s great.

355
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,840
Has he

356
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,880
explained anything to you?

357
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,880
I was resting all the time

358
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,200
and haven’t got to see him.

359
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,190
Achu.

360
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,990
You two were so close before,

361
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,120
sharing weal and woe.

362
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,520
I don’t want to judge.

363
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,120
But I just want you to know

364
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,430
it was never his intention

365
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,410
to expose you

366
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,940
to the slightest possibility of danger.

367
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,060
He asked me to get you to Lancheng,

368
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,430
but I failed.

369
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,270
Zhong Yu, say no more.

370
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,050
I understand.

371
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,890
Anyway,

372
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,830
it’s good that Yanbei is safe.

373
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,770
Either for Yanbei or Wei,

374
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,380
peace is only temporary.

375
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,660
The situation remains deadlocked.

376
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,130
If it continues,

377
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,450
both sides will suffer heavy casualties.

378
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,530
Since you have known what my choice is,

379
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,390
I believe you don’t want

380
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,030
people to suffer more than I do.

381
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,000
All you want is peace.

382
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,410
Zhong Yu.

383
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,510
It’s suffocating

384
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,770
being in the room these days.

385
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,010
Let’s go for a walk.

386
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,410
Sure.

387
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,430
But

388
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,060
you need to be prepared.

389
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:05,880
In the battle of Hongchuan,

390
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,690
we have lost eight thousand soldiers.

391
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,960
Among them,

392
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,920
some were married,

393
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:12,680
and some had children.

394
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,490
I couldn’t sleep

395
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,560
or eat

396
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,600
on the thought of that.

397
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,540
I don’t know

398
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,350
what I can do.

399
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,920
This is war.

400
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:26,690
Victory is achieved at the cost of lives.

401
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,440
Innocent people will suffer.

402
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,780
We have already done what we could.

403
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,600
Achu.

404
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,800
I know you are smart,

405
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,080
so I didn’t mean to

406
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:38,880
keep it from you.

407
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,370
In the battle of Hongchuan,

408
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,240
I did make some decisions

409
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,170
based on

410
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,660
my own consideration.

411
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,840
What you did was right.

412
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:50,140
Because of your mediation,

413
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,400
Yan Xun came back to Hongchuan.

414
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,010
Actually, I took a chance.

415
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,980
I really hoped that

416
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,790
he would come back to Hongchuan

417
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,320
for you.

418
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,020
Whose kid is that?

419
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,030
I heard from the soldiers

420
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,260
that his mother had died young,

421
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,100
and he was raised by his father

422
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,420
and a few brothers.

423
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,750
But a few days ago,

424
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,990
all of them died in the battle.

425
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,680
The soldiers sympathize with him,

426
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,380
so they keep him in the camp

427
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,510
and give him their food to eat.

428
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,010
He can’t stay here forever.

429
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,510
Is there any place he can go?

430
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,310
We tried,

431
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,290
but he refused to leave.

432
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,160
He said he wants to stay

433
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,030
to take revenge for his family.

434
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,590
Greetings, Prince Xiang.

435
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,950
I heard that my father
confined you at home,

436
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,860
so I cleared my schedule

437
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,950
to check on you.

438
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:16,160
I didn’t expect
that you’d be at leisure like this.

439
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,020
I guess my visit

440
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,230
is unnecessary.

441
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,920
His Majesty blamed me
for deserting my post

442
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,660
without permission.

443
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,750
And he demanded an answer
to my whereabouts.

444
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:30,700
On top of that,

445
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,680
before Wei Shuye left,

446
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,220
he wrongly accused me

447
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,310
of what I did in Xianyang.

448
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,090
I heard he had come back.

449
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:43,650
Yes.

450
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,920
He’s back with Chun.

451
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,170
My father flew into a fury

452
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,710
and imprisoned Chun.

453
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,640
And Wei Shuye was deprived of

454
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,370
certain rights

455
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,420
and was locked up at home.

456
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:59,460
Princess Chun made a huge mistake.

457
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,690
I’m afraid she couldn’t get away with it.

458
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,270
I wonder

459
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,270
how Noble Consort Wei

460
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,470
and Yuan Song are.

461
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,470
Noble Consort Wei isn’t my birth mother,

462
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:14,040
but she raised me.

463
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,760
Chun is just like

464
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,850
my own little sister.

465
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,360
I hope you can put in a good word

466
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,790
in front of my father

467
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,840
to exempt Chun from the death penalty.

468
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:31,980
Thank you.

469
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,290
I don’t deserve this.

470
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:34,800
Noble Consort, Prince Song,

471
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,470
this way, please.

472
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,580
Please.

473
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:12,760
Chun.

474
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:17,740
You must’ve been through a lot.

475
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,770
What are you doing here?

476
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,580
To see you.

477
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,490
To see me?

478
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:30,920
To see how big a fool I am?

479
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,300
To see how miserable I am?

480
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,390
To see how big a failure I am?

481
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:37,190
Chun!

482
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,470
How could you say that?

483
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,440
I’m your brother.

484
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,830
I’m here for you.

485
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,530
Chun. Listen to me.

486
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,280
Apologize to your father.

487
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:27,150
Apologize for what?

488
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,530
Why should I apologize?

489
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,180
You stole the commander’s tally

490
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,740
and led the troop to Yanbei.

491
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,050
You could die for that.

492
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,440
Die?

493
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,700
I should’ve died long ago.

494
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,230
All right, Chun.

495
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,720
Stop acting perversely.

496
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,000
I’m not.

497
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,900
I meant I should’ve died long ago.

498
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:56,200
I should’ve died outside Hongchuan,

499
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,390
or in Xianyang.

500
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,670
Or I should’ve died

501
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,060
on that shameful night.

502
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,390
I will never let you die.

503
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,120
I will save you.

504
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,180
Save me?

505
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,220
Why would you save me?

506
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:09,390
Don’t you feel ashamed enough?

507
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:12,080
As

508
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:16,870
the noblest princess of Wei,

509
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,460
my groom revolted

510
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,560
on our wedding day.

511
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,440
But I still chose to follow him

512
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,600
without any shame,

513
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,910
getting myself ravaged,
trampled and tortured

514
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:28,320
by his soldiers.

515
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,100
I’m nothing but a tramp.

516
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,370
Why should I live?

517
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,320
- Enough!
- I...

518
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,250
Stop!

519
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:35,070
You are not a tramp.

520
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,480
You are my daughter.

521
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,030
You are the Princess of Wei.

522
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,930
You are innocent, kind and lovely

523
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:41,050
since childhood.

524
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,580
Kind?

525
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,350
Lovely?

526
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,830
Kind and lovely?

527
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,950
That kind and lovely daughter of yours

528
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,900
has already died.

529
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,890
That daughter of yours

530
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:21,560
is dead.

531
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,820
Chun.

532
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:41,930
Chun.

533
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,280
This is a talisman

534
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,360
I asked for you.

535
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,310
Take it

536
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:49,240
and you’ll be safe and sound.

537
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,720
It’s my fault.

538
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,770
You suffered so much because of me.

539
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,520
But, Chun,

540
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,580
everyone encounters

541
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,260
difficulties in his or her life.

542
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,500
You just have to bear with it,

543
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:22,390
and everything will be fine.

544
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,860
Trust me, please?

545
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,960
Mother.

546
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,840
Tell me,

547
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,340
tell your daughter,

548
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:40,960
could a rose that had been

549
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,600
stepped into the mud

550
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:45,490
rise back

551
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,660
to its original branch?

552
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,900
At this stage, just say no more.

553
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:12,050
I’ll take full responsibility
for my deeds.

554
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:14,910
I’ll pay with my life.

555
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:27,430
Chun.

556
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:31,070
I won’t let you die.

557
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:47,430
Chun.

558
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,170
I’m leaving.

559
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:55,990
But listen,

560
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:58,460
one will have to grow up sooner or later.

561
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,750
I can’t always protect you.

562
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:08,390
I hope you will grow up

563
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:12,390
after all this.

564
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:24,760
Chun.

565
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,750
Get some rest.

566
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,750
I’m leaving too.
