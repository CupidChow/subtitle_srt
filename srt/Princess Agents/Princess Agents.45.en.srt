16
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,130
There is someone inside.

17
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,460
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

18
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,960
So she is the girl

19
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,600
Mr. Tian prepared for me.

20
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,990
A beauty

21
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,700
is stuffed in the closet,

22
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,460
yet a shrew

23
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,230
is lying in bed.

24
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,640
Any man will think

25
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,620
it is a pity.

26
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,490
You call yourself a man?

27
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,090
But I heard

28
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,570
those Yue Guards outside

29
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,940
saying that you’ve been celibate for years

30
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,480
and you’re going to be a monk.

31
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,190
Don’t get on my nerves,

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,960
or I’ll show you

33
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,430
if I am a real man.

34
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,380
You’re shameless!

35
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,190
Where are you going?

36
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,160
I am leaving.

37
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,070
No way.

38
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,660
Let go of me.

39
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,260
- I won’t.
- Mr. Tian.

40
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,110
Sure.

41
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,320
Sir.

42
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,230
Sir, are you still awake?

43
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,870
Mr. Tian, it’s late.

44
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,230
Why are you here?

45
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,230
Young Master Wei Shuye is here.

46
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,180
He wants to see you.

47
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,830
How about this?

48
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,830
Please entertain him for me.

49
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,470
I am

50
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,640
a bit tired.

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,120
Yes, sir.

52
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,080
I understand.

53
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,000
Consider it done.

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,280
I will certainly

55
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,560
take good care of him.

56
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,710
Sir, the night is still young.

57
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,440
Please enjoy.

58
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,600
I shall excuse myself now.

59
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,320
After Princess went back to Chang’an,

60
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,860
she ordered to arrest you.

61
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,150
She can’t wait to kill you.

62
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,150
You know

63
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,470
Wei Shuye always has a crush on her
since childhood.

64
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,340
Why did he come here

65
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,340
out of the blue?

66
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,340
Unless he is here to catch you.

67
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,530
Why didn’t you escape

68
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,180
but still sit here enjoying the food?

69
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,270
Didn’t you say that

70
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,620
Wei Shuye is outside

71
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,660
to catch me?

72
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,550
If I escape now,

73
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,740
I will definitely get caught.

74
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,590
Tell me,

75
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,810
why did you

76
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,850
come here so suddenly?

77
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,980
I need money, so I’m here to get some.

78
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,080
You are going to need a lot of it.

79
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,620
Yanbei is far from

80
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,680
being rich.

81
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,110
Without enough money,

82
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,970
you may starve to death.

83
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,730
Young Master Wei.

84
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,650
He is still asleep?

85
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,340
I’m not sure

86
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,440
if Young Master is up.

87
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,490
I heard he

88
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:02,230
catches the flu.

89
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,700
I happen to have some medicine.

90
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,450
Please hold on.

91
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,200
I heard that

92
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,180
he went inside to rest

93
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,150
before sunset.

94
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,280
It’s already noon.

95
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,690
He should be up by now.

96
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,030
Since when did Yuwen Yue

97
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,110
sleep late?

98
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,820
He’s

99
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,160
not alone inside.

100
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,270
I am intrigued.

101
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,620
What kind of woman

102
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,050
could make him fall

103
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,770
head over heels?

104
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,020
Please wait here, Young Master Wei.

105
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,470
Young Master.

106
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,240
You arrived late last night,

107
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,840
but got up so early.

108
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,490
You really are diligent.

109
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,290
I must be cautious
about His Majesty’s order.

110
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,620
Good for you.

111
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,480
Mr. Tian is going to throw me

112
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,300
a banquet later.

113
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,750
Why don’t you join us?

114
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,240
Of course.

115
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:05,900
By the way,

116
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,550
I heard

117
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,720
you and your new girl

118
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,010
had a wonderful night together.

119
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,160
Why don’t you bring her with you

120
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,890
to the banquet?

121
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,060
I can’t wait to see her in person.

122
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,110
Sure.

123
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,390
It’s easier to escape at night.

124
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,060
I’ll leave when the night falls.

125
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,220
You aren’t going anywhere.

126
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,900
Wei Shuye must’ve known

127
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,830
you are here.

128
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,540
Even if he is not certain,

129
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,290
he is already suspicious.

130
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,100
If you leave now,

131
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,750
you will definitely get caught.

132
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,710
He alone

133
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,660
isn’t my match.

134
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,620
Don’t be cocky.

135
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,150
Do you know

136
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,450
how many people are out there

137
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,630
to catch you

138
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,510
in exchange for money?

139
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,990
Your portraits

140
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,250
are all over the city.

141
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,700
Other than local officials,

142
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,390
and imperial guards,

143
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,260
bounty hunters

144
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,410
from various sects

145
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,380
are looking for you.

146
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,590
Besides,

147
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,340
Yanbei is far away from here.

148
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,140
How can you battle

149
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,380
all of them alone?

150
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,440
Are you insane?

151
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,580
I know what I am doing.

152
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,850
Ever since I decided to go back

153
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:27,890
to Yanbei with Yan Xun,

154
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,650
I have known

155
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,450
I am up against

156
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,220
the entire world.

157
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,650
But that doesn’t scare me.

158
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,540
Yanbei is Yan Xun’s hometown.

159
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,250
So is mine.

160
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,750
I have to fight my way out,

161
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,230
alive or dead.

162
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,390
Fine.

163
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,590
You can go.

164
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,020
Even if you get caught, wounded

165
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:00,880
or killed,

166
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,640
all that doesn’t matter.

167
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,820
Just don’t let me know.

168
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,590
Don’t let me see it, hear it,

169
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,960
or worry about it.

170
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,420
I can’t take it.

171
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,320
You’re always in black or white.

172
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,690
Are you going to a funeral?

173
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,950
This one is better.

174
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,600
At least, it makes you feminine.

175
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,720
Dress yourself up

176
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,700
and go to the banquet with me.

177
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,590
After that, I’ll escort you to leave.

178
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,350
Make sure you look

179
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,870
pretty and stunning.

180
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,060
Are you done?

181
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,230
Just shut up.

182
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,170
Let’s go.

183
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,870
You look not bad.

184
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,230
Wait.

185
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,460
This is good.

186
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,130
Put this on.

187
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,880
No one will recognize you.

188
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,130
Very nice.

189
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,150
Are you messing with me?

190
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,390
I can’t see the road

191
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,560
after wearing it.

192
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,080
Follow me then.

193
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,690
Sense the direction by listening.

194
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,020
A good chance to practice that skill.

195
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,800
I wouldn’t have worn the make-up

196
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,160
had I known I’d wear this.

197
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:19,650
Hold me.

198
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,070
Give me your hand now.

199
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,730
Young Master.

200
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,920
Slow down.

201
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,340
Yuwen Yue.

202
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,910
I heard you just

203
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,700
got a beauty

204
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,310
and was with her

205
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,640
a whole day without rest.

206
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:57,870
I thought they were lying

207
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,790
at first.

208
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,030
Now, I know they were telling the truth.

209
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,670
Yuwen Yue,

210
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,500
you had a long night.

211
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,230
Enjoy the meal to enrich your energy.

212
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,190
How’s your mission going?

213
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,980
Tons of wealthy businessmen in Xianyang

214
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,510
are now transferring their property.

215
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,340
His Majesty has been aware of that.

216
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,450
I came overnight to

217
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,310
get to the bottom of it.

218
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,460
Honestly,

219
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,250
I envy you.

220
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,520
You have more leisure time.

221
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,830
I was wondering

222
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,720
why you refused to

223
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,580
see me last night.

224
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,180
Turns out, you were having fun.

225
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,510
When Mr. Tian told me

226
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,440
about it,

227
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,710
I could not believe it.

228
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,950
Since you know

229
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,220
I was busy with her,

230
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,250
you shouldn’t have pulled me out of bed.

231
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,530
We have known each other for so long.

232
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,830
I thought

233
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,550
other than

234
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,920
that maid of yours,

235
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,960
you wouldn’t fall for

236
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,920
anyone else.

237
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,700
It seems that may not be true.

238
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,910
I really want to know

239
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,950
how beautiful she is

240
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,080
that you’re so obsessed

241
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,860
with her.

242
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,250
The legendary Yuwen Yue

243
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,690
seems to have found his true love.

244
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,860
Young Master Wei,

245
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,060
we’d better not

246
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,860
rub him the wrong way.

247
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,960
Alright.

248
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,440
Let us have a taste of

249
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,230
the fine liquor of Wupeng.

250
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,500
Cheers.

251
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,090
Good.

252
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,940
Report!

253
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,750
Sir, the target has arrived,

254
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,460
Bring him in.

255
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,140
Aye.

256
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:57,950
Let me go!

257
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,510
Let me out!

258
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,800
Let me go!

259
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,840
Let me out!

260
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,750
Be quiet!

261
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,310
Sir, the suspect is here.

262
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:08,950
Let me out.

263
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,160
- Open it.
- Let me out!

264
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,670
Let me out!

265
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,560
Who are you?

266
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,670
Who gave you the right to arrest me?

267
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,990
Shut up!

268
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,940
He is the trusted follower of the leader

269
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,180
of Xianyang Chamber of Commerce.

270
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,360
He has knowledge of

271
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,560
the most confidential information.

272
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,580
And he gets hold of

273
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,990
the most important

274
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,090
account book.

275
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,510
Over the past few days,

276
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,520
I’ve looked everywhere

277
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,530
to find him.

278
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,500
Young Master Wei,

279
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,030
we’ve secured a valuable asset

280
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,670
this time.

281
00:14:59,210 --> 00:14:59,970
Guards.

282
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,360
Take him into custody

283
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,780
and watch him closely.

284
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,310
Young Master Wei’s men

285
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,290
can watch over him.

286
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,700
What are you doing?

287
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,270
Let me go!

288
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,400
- Alright.
- What are you doing?

289
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,460
You may leave.

290
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:27,710
Aye.

291
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,500
Let me go!

292
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,340
Let me go!

293
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,160
Let me go!

294
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,790
Gentlemen,

295
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,910
both of you are outstanding.

296
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:40,250
Congratulation to Young Master Yue
on getting a beauty.

297
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,090
Congratulation to Young Master Wei, too,

298
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,150
on achieving such a success.

299
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,360
Thank you, Mr. Tian.

300
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,600
All these years, that traitor Yan Xun

301
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,820
seemed to have kept a low profile,

302
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,730
but he bought weapons, trained armies

303
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,100
and raked in money behind our backs.

304
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,400
Xianyang is

305
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,980
his source of income.

306
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,090
And this Xianyang Chamber

307
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,170
is in his charge.

308
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,590
Young Master Wei,

309
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,750
how did you find these leads?

310
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,830
Thanks to my uncle,

311
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,020
he’s always been

312
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,670
vigilant against Yan Xun.

313
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,960
And he’s been checking him in private.

314
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,350
I also know that

315
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,790
those wealthy businessmen in Xianyang

316
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,070
were afraid that Yan Xun wouldn’t

317
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,170
keep his promise.

318
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,590
Now, they’re transferring their property.

319
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,570
Once we obtain the account book,

320
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,760
we’ll know everything

321
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,700
about this.

322
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,070
Mr. Tian,

323
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,670
the beauty you found

324
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,710
is just to Young Master Yue’s taste.

325
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,770
Where did you get her?

326
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,170
I bought her from Jiankang.

327
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,550
She was sent here two days ago at night.

328
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,180
So she’s from Liang.

329
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,630
Well,

330
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,240
may I ask

331
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,080
your name, pretty?

332
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,490
Hold on. I’ll

333
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,690
drink for her.

334
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,340
Report!

335
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,820
Sir, that suspect

336
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,700
has been taken away

337
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,650
by a few masked kidnappers.

338
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,870
You good-for-nothing!

339
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,550
Please excuse me.

340
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:05,720
General,

341
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,720
that scholar we kidnapped

342
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,510
refuses to confess.

343
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,330
What should we do?

344
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,710
Torture him.

345
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,250
We have no time to waste on him.

346
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:13,860
Aye.

347
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,020
I will be out of Wupeng tomorrow morning.

348
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,170
Then I’ll escort you to leave.

349
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,110
Xing’er.

350
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,080
Fine.

351
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,170
Master, a letter from home.

352
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,740
What does it say?

353
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,940
= To His Highness =

354
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,710
A few cubs are ready to leave the nest.

355
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,490
How long has it been?

356
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,840
Less than half a year, right?

357
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,460
Those kids are pretty talented.

358
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,650
One of them is especially outstanding.

359
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,490
What are they waiting for?

360
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,640
Arrange the first assassination test.

361
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,870
We got a problem.

362
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:32,840
What is it?

363
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,410
The target has been chosen, but...

364
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,760
But what?

365
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,250
That person just left the boat yesterday.

366
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,170
That girl.

367
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,170
You’re wise.

368
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,430
That man can’t fight.

369
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,670
No need to send people from home.

370
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:57,870
Yes.

371
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,600
But since you

372
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,200
have agreed to

373
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,120
help Crown Prince Xiao Ce,

374
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,230
why don’t we tell our men

375
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,360
to let her go?

376
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,980
I have finished

377
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,740
what he asked me to do.

378
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,490
I do not owe him anything.

379
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,680
Now,

380
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,880
it’s a new business here.

381
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,510
I have no reason to give that up.

382
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,620
Aye.

383
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,550
I’m exhausted.

384
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,590
Let’s take a break.

385
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,360
Have some rest.

386
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,190
Hey, nerd.

387
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,870
Wake up!

388
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:53,920
Qiao!

389
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,580
Let’s go.

390
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:58,540
Come.

391
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,240
Go. I’ll stop them.

392
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:09,990
No.

393
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,460
I won’t leave without you.

394
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,250
Why are you following me?

395
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,840
You heartless woman!

396
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,200
How could I let you go easily?

397
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,070
Were I as heartless as you said,

398
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,660
you think you’d have the chance
to follow me?

399
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,680
If I hadn’t ordered Yueqi

400
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,300
to let you off the hook,

401
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,470
you think you could escape?

402
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,730
Where is Yueqi?

403
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,690
Still there to distract them

404
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,030
and to stall Wei Shuye.

405
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,990
This is none of your business.

406
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,050
Just go back.

407
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,820
Could you do a little thinking
before stealing the horse?

408
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:05,750
The horse you stole,

409
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,320
Tengyun, belongs to Wei Shuye.

410
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,440
Once he found out you...

411
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,530
Go after them!

412
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:46,290
Aye.

413
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,440
Broken Rainbow! Where did you get it?

414
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,620
We’ve been behind them all the way.

415
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,680
How come they’re gone?

416
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,510
Be careful

417
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,450
when we take action later.

418
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,140
Come on.

419
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,470
The big test is over.

420
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,080
That test comes every three years.

421
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,560
This time, because of her,

422
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,010
only three of us are left
within half a year.

423
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:21,010
Do you trust her

424
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,540
to cover your back?

425
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,160
We have suffered a lot all these years.

426
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,520
Don’t let her ruin it.

427
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,190
I must kill that woman

428
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,860
Chu Qiao.

429
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,350
Xing’er!

430
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,060
There’s poison on it.

431
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,120
Xing’er!

432
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:20,620
Xing’er!

433
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,180
= Town God’s Temple =

434
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,600
Young Master Wei.

435
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,370
Sir, have you caught her?

436
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,720
You didn’t see her.

437
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,030
How can you be sure

438
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,490
she is the wanted woman

439
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,600
you’re looking for?

440
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,640
Rest assured.

441
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,870
The only person

442
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,530
Yuwen Yue

443
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,100
would protect

444
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,110
is her.

445
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,550
She is with that traitor Yan Xun.

446
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,820
Liang Shaoqing,

447
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,630
is a member of Xianyang Chamber.

448
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:12,030
Is it possible that her men

449
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,510
seized Liang Shaoqing?

450
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,380
Probably.

451
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,870
That woman is ferocious.

452
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,890
I’m afraid

453
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,800
it’s hard to catch her.

454
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,880
Don’t panic.

455
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,370
I’ll take care of it.

456
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,680
All you need to do

457
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,400
is to set up checkpoints.

458
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,170
As for that woman,

459
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,070
she hardly has any help.

460
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,990
My job

461
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,780
is to kill her in Xianyang.

462
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,510
Aye.

463
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:52,100
Yuwen Yue, I’m sorry.

464
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,150
I have to do this for Princess.

465
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,390
That woman must die.

466
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,420
It has been so long

467
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,540
and there is still no trace of Achu.

468
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,020
Can you

469
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,090
do your job or not?

470
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,890
Please calm down.

471
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,260
I have urged

472
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,120
my people to look for her.

473
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,760
I promise we’ll find her soon.

474
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,230
Your Excellency,
General Cheng Yuan is back.

475
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,310
Let him in.

476
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:21,930
Aye.

477
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,440
Your Excellency, I have fulfilled my task.

478
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,940
The account book has been found.

479
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,040
Good.

480
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,610
We can’t waste

481
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:40,580
more time here.

482
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,310
Take care of the Chamber of Commerce

483
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,130
as soon as possible.

484
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,550
Today is the day.

485
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,610
Let’s draw an end tonight.

486
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,300
Tonight?

487
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,970
Don’t you own a restaurant

488
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,030
called Zhaoxi?

489
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,860
That place serves all kinds of delicacies.

490
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,960
We haven’t

491
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,560
been there yet

492
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,650
since we came.

493
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,110
Alright. I’ll make arrangements.

494
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,350
Get it done.

495
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,250
Aye.

496
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:05,860
Aye.

497
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,380
- Thanks. Cheers.
- Cheers.

498
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,100
Cheers.

499
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,700
No matter what Feng Mian says,

500
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,410
I’ve made up my mind.

501
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,460
I will move to the south

502
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,570
after paying this year’s tax

503
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,800
for the sake of

504
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,400
our relationship these years.

505
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,920
Yes, that makes sense.

506
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,690
That’s right.

507
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:36,790
I agree.

508
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:40,130
Ouyang, say something.

509
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,310
To be honest,

510
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,790
I’ve been living a peaceful life

511
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,800
with my wife and children,

512
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,340
and I’m not as ambitious as before.

513
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,350
Nor do I want to

514
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,580
drift from place to place again.

515
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:00,380
But I wouldn’t have amassed a fortune

516
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:03,990
without Mr. Wu and Yanbei.

517
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:08,970
So as long as His Excellency

518
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,380
allows me to leave

519
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:14,750
to lead a peaceful life with my family,

520
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,180
I am willing to

521
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:20,030
hand in all my property.

522
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,380
Ouyang,

523
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,000
that’s quite generous of you.

524
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,600
Gentlemen.

525
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:40,580
Mr. Feng

526
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,380
really has put on airs.

527
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,760
Not only does he arrive late,

528
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,450
but he brings outsiders with him.

529
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,110
It seems that

530
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:54,040
his business is booming.

531
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,650
And he no longer needs our support.

532
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:59,720
That explains why

533
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,390
he shows no respect for us.

534
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,140
This must be Mr. Xu.

535
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:04,850
Greetings.

536
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,760
Let me introduce myself.

537
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:09,040
- I am...
- No one

538
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,270
cares about who you are.

539
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,510
You don’t have a say here.

540
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,610
As Mr. Feng’s add-ons,

541
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,960
you should step aside,

542
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,320
keep your mouth shut

543
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,410
and listen with your ears.

544
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:22,060
You…

545
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,480
Mr. Xu.

546
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,450
I think it is necessary

547
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,220
to introduce myself to you.

548
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,080
Because...

549
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,310
Because starting today,

550
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,990
you must remember

551
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,450
my name!

552
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,110
This...

553
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:51,790
They...

554
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,690
Mr. Xu, it is rude

555
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:56,280
to interrupt others’ speech.

556
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:07,980
What...

557
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,960
I apologize.

558
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,310
After the long journey,

559
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,070
I probably got too excited just now.

560
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,750
Have a seat. Please.

561
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,150
Let’s...

562
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,420
Mr. Feng,

563
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,630
this is...

564
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,300
I will introduce myself.

565
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,410
I am Cheng Yuan from Yanbei.

566
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,540
Now, I answer to His Excellency,

567
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:48,160
Duke Yanbei, to be accurate.

568
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,580
His Highness has risen against Wei,

569
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,480
and he’s no longer under their control.

570
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,840
Whether

571
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,750
he will crown himself duke or emperor

572
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,290
is up to him.

573
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,710
Are you holding a grudge

574
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,930
because His Highness

575
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,780
didn’t come in person?

576
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,530
No. No. No.

577
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,340
Absolutely not.

578
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:12,110
Well, Yanbei is far from here.

579
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,990
We wouldn’t His Highness

580
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,540
to travel this far.

581
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,350
- Yes.
- Lord Zhao.

582
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,250
You certainly don’t want him here

583
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,760
as you have sold your property

584
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,420
and you’ll move to Liang soon.

585
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,640
If he came,

586
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,700
your plan would be ruined.

587
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,850
Right now,

588
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,360
Yanbei and the Wei are
on the brink of war.

589
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,950
At this crucial moment,

590
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,380
you are withdrawing your money.

591
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,310
Mr. Cheng…

592
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,770
Sorry, General Cheng.

593
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,260
Our Chamber of Commerce

594
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,840
has always been

595
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,610
backing Yanbei.

596
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,030
Especially in the last three years,

597
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,960
Mr. Wu and Ouyang

598
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,500
have asked for money from us

599
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,350
aboveboard and under the table

600
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,240
to help His Excellency rebel.

601
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,140
- Yes.
- Yes. Yes.

602
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,210
That’s right.

603
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,270
It’s true that you people

604
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,400
have raised money and grains for the army,

605
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,230
and helped with

606
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,290
the survival of

607
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:06,790
the remnants of Yanbei Army.

608
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:09,190
But in the meantime,

609
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,680
you’ve also

610
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:13,320
controlled the local finance and tax

611
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,380
in the name of His Excellency,

612
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,780
and have traded with

613
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,820
tribes at Yumen Pass and Xirong

614
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,810
successfully,

615
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,320
amassing an enormous fortune.

616
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,840
How should we

617
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,440
deal with that?

618
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,730
We...

619
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,900
Yanbei is recuperating.

620
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,000
And the war with Wei is approaching.

621
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,260
Yet you people

622
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,520
are acting against us

623
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,860
at this point.

624
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,330
Don’t you have

625
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,910
a guilty conscience?

626
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:50,860
I acquired something

627
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,170
from Lord Liu, Liu Xi.

628
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,760
It clearly records

629
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,130
all financial transactions

630
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,900
between you and Yanbei.

631
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,490
You have signed

632
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:02,390
all of it yourselves.

633
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:05,030
Everything is clear.

634
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,850
If it gets out,

635
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,550
you will be hunted

636
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,470
by both Wei and Liang.

637
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,860
That...

638
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,600
General, don’t get us wrong.

639
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,190
When did we say

640
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,900
we’d stop supporting Yanbei?

641
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,630
As long as you say it...

642
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,940
No, that’s unnecessary.

643
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,660
A word from Mr. Feng,

644
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,200
and we will

645
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,710
hand in this year’s tax revenue

646
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,150
immediately.

647
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,010
You’ll receive it

648
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,550
tomorrow morning.

649
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:39,080
Then we will just sit

650
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,840
and wait here

651
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,820
for Yanbei’s victory.

652
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,440
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes.

653
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,710
Aren’t you leaving?

654
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,420
- No.
- No. No.

655
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,800
Cheers, everyone.

656
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,970
Cheers. Let’s drink.

657
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,970
Great.

658
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,990
With the account book,

659
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,310
they can’t massage the numbers

660
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:16,190
or fool us.

661
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:20,230
What happened?

662
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:22,300
Why is there only half of it?

663
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,920
Someone took the other.

664
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,380
What do we do then?

665
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,090
Well, thanks to you,

666
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,350
they wouldn’t dare

667
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:32,420
to play tricks again.

668
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,740
That makes no difference.

669
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,120
In the future,

670
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,230
they won’t have the chance anyway.

671
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,260
What do you mean?

672
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:43,380
The Wei family was

673
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,320
onto them long ago.

674
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,990
When I went to seize that person earlier,

675
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,600
I saw their men again.

676
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,590
Do you think that the court

677
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,250
will let them get away with it
after we leave?

678
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,110
Besides, half of the book is lost.

679
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,500
Once the court has it,

680
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,200
they will be fully exposed.

681
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,520
Then the court

682
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,790
will confiscate

683
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,440
all their property.

684
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,500
They’d better leave now

685
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,370
before it’s too late to regret.

686
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,820
If so,

687
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,740
why didn’t you warn them?

688
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:13,210
Warn them?

689
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,130
They are rotten from top to bottom.

690
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,850
What’s the point of keeping them?

691
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,510
Did His Highness

692
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,700
consent to your plan?

693
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,350
Mr. Feng,

694
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,280
you are a household name

695
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,440
in this area.

696
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,560
How could you

697
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,390
be so naive?

698
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,710
You’ve been with His Highness
since childhood,

699
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,040
and have been in charge
of the Chamber for years.

700
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,650
If he intended to

701
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:43,290
deal with this matter

702
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,300
in a normal way,

703
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,840
would he ask me to

704
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,340
assist you?

705
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,250
He awarded me with a dagger,

706
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,400
called Phoenix.

707
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:59,070
The demon spirit in it

708
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,390
is thirsty for blood.

709
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,050
I am that dagger

710
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,050
to His Highness.

711
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,590
He let me out

712
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,860
to kill.

713
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,900
= Cao’s Mansion =

714
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,880
Kill them all.

715
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,100
= Ouyang’s Cellar =

716
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,100
=Jia's Mansion=

717
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:33,330
Mr. Wen, we might not be able to

718
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:34,370
go into town today.

719
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,200
We can only camp outside.

720
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,360
Sure.

721
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,470
How is your wife?

722
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:44,760
Thanks to your medicine,

723
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,090
she is much better.

724
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,100
That’s good.

725
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,430
Take care of her.

726
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,830
It is quite a bumpy road.

727
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,510
It seems that you come
from a wealthy family.

728
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,160
This must be new to you.

729
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,360
Drink some water.

730
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,070
Be careful, guys.

731
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,550
Mr. Wen’s wife is in there

732
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,800
and she’s ill.

733
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,990
Where are we?

734
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:10,720
In front of us is Kongsang Mountain.

735
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,490
We’ll reach Liang

736
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:13,850
in about two days.

737
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,050
So fast.

738
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:16,230
Not really.

739
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,130
You have been sleeping all the way.

740
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:19,290
We have traveled

741
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:20,560
for four days.

742
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,960
Who are they?

743
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,200
A caravan.

744
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:28,860
We are following the armed escorts

745
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,520
hired by the caravan.

746
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,750
After you got poisoned,

747
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,080
I managed to join them.

748
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:34,740
Our safety

749
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,630
is guaranteed for now.

750
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,650
Shouldn’t the armed escorts

751
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:38,180
lead the caravan?

752
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:40,040
Why are they behind them?

753
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,770
It’s not my place to ask.

754
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,480
They are going to Jiankang.

755
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,040
We can just go with them.

756
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,400
Your poison is strong.

757
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:53,390
I stopped it from spreading temporarily.

758
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,910
A cure is still needed.

759
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,190
Your Highness, why not

760
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,350
let me try to find her?

761
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,100
Both Feng Mian and Ajing failed.

762
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,820
You don’t even know where to begin.

763
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:13,800
Your Highness,

764
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,820
I have been looking for Miss Chu.

765
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,940
And I have left marks along the way,

766
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,310
but received no reply.

767
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,950
Your Highness, is it possible

768
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,320
that Miss Chu has returned to Yanbei?

769
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,920
I hope so.

770
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,220
Your highness,

771
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,550
news came in.

772
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,270
The government had discovered

773
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,120
the murder of members

774
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,300
of the Chamber,

775
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:37,110
and they had been investigating it
thoroughly.

776
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:39,150
Thoroughly?

777
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,520
Are they

778
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,200
going to charge me?

779
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,050
The rest isn’t your concern.

780
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,470
Just send all your men out

781
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:51,770
and bring Achu back.

782
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:52,940
Aye.

783
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:00,150
Feng Mian,

784
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,560
have you found

785
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,540
Ouyang’s son?

786
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:04,870
I have searched the entire city

787
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:05,740
but to no avail.

788
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,710
I guess he had got out of the city.

789
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,020
He is still a kid,

790
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,180
just let him go.

791
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,400
Do you know

792
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,160
why Wei has got into

793
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,370
such a plight like this?

794
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:17,190
That’s because

795
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:19,060
they let His Excellency go

796
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,650
when wiping out his family.

797
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,320
Don’t worry about it.

798
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,320
I got it.

799
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,600
The dignified Young Master Yue

800
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,290
has come down to eat plain buns.

801
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,710
Does it taste good?

802
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,030
Not bad.

803
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,360
The famished would eat anything.

804
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,590
Beggars don’t get to be choosers.

805
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,280
When I was a kid, in order to survive,

806
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:02,530
I ate things like worms,

807
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,190
snakes,

808
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:06,820
mice and rabbits.

809
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:08,830
You name it.

810
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,860
That was the only way to live.

811
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,110
In Chang’an,

812
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:16,730
girls your age

813
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,560
only care about

814
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,610
all kinds of cosmetics

815
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,280
and their marriages.

816
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:25,320
In our household,

817
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,450
all the maids

818
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:28,620
are dreaming of being the Silver Bell.

819
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:30,820
But you

820
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,550
are different from them.

821
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:35,870
You didn’t realize that

822
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:36,700
until now?

823
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:38,460
If I tell you

824
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:42,210
I would like to share your dream,

825
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,230
will you believe it?

826
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,540
I don’t know

827
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,630
why you are telling me this.

828
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,250
Share my dream?

829
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:56,150
You have no idea

830
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:56,990
what my dream is.

831
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,190
I’m not the same as three years ago.

832
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:03,570
Back then,

833
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,820
Yuwen family’s rise and fall

834
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,830
was everything in my life.

835
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,590
During the three years at the border,

836
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:14,590
I saw blood shed

837
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,180
and lives treated like dirt.

838
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,930
Then I began to understand

839
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:21,420
the unfairness you had hated.

840
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,390
Before leaving,

841
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:27,680
I had persuaded my grandfather

842
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:29,880
into freeing

843
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,590
all the maids

844
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:31,650
