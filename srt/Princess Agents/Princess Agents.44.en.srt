How did you get caught again?

17
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,880
How would I know?

18
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,720
Miss, you are the only one

19
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,820
who can get me out of here.

20
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,280
I am a scholar.

21
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,730
How can I become a slave?

22
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:48,870
Also, they are always

23
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,410
picky about me.

24
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,360
Get me out now.

25
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,710
How?

26
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,580
Buy me again.

27
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,410
You are a scholar.

28
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,730
How can you

29
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,660
be bought with money?

30
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,410
That’s an insult to your dignity

31
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,810
and status.

32
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,780
Moreover, you are

33
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,740
my savior.

34
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,820
How could I do that to you?

35
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:12,690
Well,

36
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,460
just put aside

37
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,360
the so-called dignity and stuff.

38
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:17,970
Well,

39
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,250
get me out first,

40
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:19,890
please.

41
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,130
I don’t have money.

42
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,340
Hello again.

43
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,900
You still want him?

44
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,710
That’s wonderful.

45
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,300
The price now is 200 taels of silver.

46
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,650
Mr. Mu.

47
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,720
I have already bought him once.

48
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,520
How could you

49
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,360
capture him again?

50
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,390
Where’s your proof?

51
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,020
Do you have it?

52
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,300
Look,

53
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,250
give me the money and he’s all yours.

54
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,720
Simple as that.

55
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,300
Well...

56
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,990
You think he’s worth that much?

57
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:53,680
Look, he...

58
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,520
Fine. Just take it as

59
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,830
I bought a pig the first time.

60
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,910
Keep him if you want.

61
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,750
I’m no longer interested.

62
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,110
Sir. Sir.

63
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,400
I’m only asking for a bit more.

64
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,710
Then he is yours.

65
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,590
More?

66
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:11,600
Mr. Mu.

67
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,080
I don’t have money with me now.

68
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,710
Can I pay you later?

69
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,520
No. No. No.

70
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,370
You can’t do that.

71
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,030
There’s...

72
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,540
There is no such thing...

73
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:20,980
Look, Mr. Mu,

74
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,460
you tricked me first.

75
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,850
Don’t blame me for robbing you.

76
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:25,540
Will you let him out or not?

77
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,140
Yes. Yes. Yes.

78
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,150
Yes. Yes. Yes.

79
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,230
Let him go!

80
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,190
You are back.

81
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,580
Eat it.

82
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,260
I’m leaving Xianyang tomorrow.

83
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,520
I won’t be able to save you

84
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,750
if you’re in trouble again.

85
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,390
I suggest

86
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,030
you take the money.

87
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:07,760
You...

88
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,510
Didn’t you say that you had no money?

89
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,810
Who said that?

90
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,760
You said it yourself

91
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,610
earlier at the market.

92
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,030
However much I have,

93
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:18,720
I can’t always

94
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,410
give it to traffickers.

95
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,050
This is all I have.

96
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:25,870
Keep it.

97
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,010
What about you

98
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:30,960
if you give all your money to me?

99
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,600
I will be fine.

100
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,750
Hadn’t it been for me,

101
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,950
you wouldn’t have gotten
into such a plight.

102
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,580
Just take it.

103
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,390
In the future, think twice before you act.

104
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,470
Be cautious.

105
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,080
Don’t be a busybody.

106
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,430
By the way,

107
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,450
what’s your name?

108
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,710
Surnamed Qiao.

109
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,750
I’m a Liang, Liang Shaoqing.

110
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,190
I know.

111
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,530
How do you know my name?

112
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,160
When we first met,

113
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,480
you introduced yourself

114
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,940
right in front of me

115
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,020
and those soldiers.

116
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,250
Is that so?

117
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,290
May I ask,

118
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,560
why did the government of Wei

119
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,030
want to capture you?

120
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,630
Didn’t you

121
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,850
call me a confirmed thief.

122
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,600
You were right.

123
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,500
I am one.

124
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,830
I was caught in the action

125
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,770
when stealing things,

126
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,080
so they were after me.

127
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,950
You stole from others?

128
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,340
Yes.

129
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,020
The food you are eating

130
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,460
and the banknote in your hands

131
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,810
belonged to others.

132
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:55,610
So,

133
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,640
would you eat

134
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,720
the stolen food?

135
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,000
I...

136
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,750
Let’s go.

137
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,730
Go after her!

138
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,320
Hurry up!

139
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,210
Go!

140
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,100
Catch her!

141
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:06,910
Let’s go!

142
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,760
She is truly something.

143
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,580
No wonder she is worth that much.

144
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,880
We’ve already reached the border.

145
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,050
It will be more difficult

146
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,430
to capture her in the future.

147
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,810
Put me down. Put me down.

148
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,850
Mr. Mu is such a villain.

149
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,600
He sent so many people to catch us.

150
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,050
No wonder they say

151
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,410
scholars are of no use.

152
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,190
You are so slow.

153
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,340
And you have bad luck.

154
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,040
Without you,

155
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,450
I wouldn’t have been shot.

156
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,220
I...

157
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,690
You’d better stay away from me.

158
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,570
Get out of my face.

159
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,680
What?

160
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,150
Fine, I will go.

161
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,460
You...

162
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,280
Just go!

163
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,050
Don’t play hide and seek with me.

164
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,140
Come out now.

165
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,530
I thought

166
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,810
you were a man.

167
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,270
Turns out,

168
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,910
you are a chick.

169
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,850
Hey,

170
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,830
you’ve made quite a lot of enemies.

171
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:47,930
Catch her.

172
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,700
Don’t move.

173
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,170
Or I will kill him.

174
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,110
General Cheng Yuan,
I have heard a lot about you.

175
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,100
So have I about you,

176
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,710
Mr. Feng.

177
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,390
Look at you.

178
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,330
You are a big shot now.

179
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,390
We have come to your house,

180
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,860
and you didn’t come out to greet us.

181
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,200
You’ve really put on airs.

182
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,310
There are many people watching over me.

183
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,630
If I went out to greet you,

184
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,390
I’m afraid

185
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,400
you’d be tracked down

186
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,870
within two hours.

187
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,850
General, you’ve had a long journey.

188
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:50,830
Please get some rest.

189
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,080
I have prepared

190
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,160
food and liquor for you.

191
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,770
After you, General.

192
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,830
You may leave.

193
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,420
- Aye.
- Aye.

194
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,500
Your Excellency.

195
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,710
Feng Mian, it’s been a while.

196
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,120
Your Excellency, what brings you here?

197
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,550
It’s too risky for you to come over.

198
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,830
I’m here

199
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,560
not just to see you.

200
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,240
I know.

201
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,370
I have sent people

202
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,950
to look for Miss Achu.

203
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,130
If there’s any news,
I will let you know immediately.

204
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,800
Mr. Feng,

205
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,620
I hear that you’re doing well.

206
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,690
And you sure are.

207
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,270
I wouldn’t recognize you

208
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,460
if I saw you

209
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,830
wearing this in the streets.

210
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,670
I thought you’d call me extravagant,

211
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,770
so I changed into this instead.

212
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,480
Had I known His Excellency would come,

213
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,850
I would’ve borrowed my servant’s outfit.

214
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,440
Rise.

215
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,460
Aye.

216
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,780
Tell me about

217
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,360
Xianyang Chamber of Commerce.

218
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,760
Their leader’s name is Liu Xi,

219
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,670
a former Education Commissioner in Yanbei.

220
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,710
He met with Mr. Wu once.

221
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,950
Later, after his father died,

222
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,050
he returned to his hometown
to mourn for him.

223
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,140
At that time,

224
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,840
the Emperor of Wei State occupied Beishuo.

225
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,760
The old Marquis died.

226
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,330
Less than one tenth
of the locals survived.

227
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,410
During the next six months,

228
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,680
people there suffered
from famine and plague.

229
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,470
Liu Xi despised the Emperor
for persecuting the loyal.

230
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,270
Plus, Yanbei meant a lot to him.

231
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,580
So he sold his assets to

232
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,740
buy food and medicine

233
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,730
and sent them to Yanbei.

234
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,470
Judging from what you said,

235
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,870
Liu Xi sounds like a decent man.

236
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,310
Later, in order to support
and protect you,

237
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,510
and to revive Yanbei,

238
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,870
he and a few others

239
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,540
founded the Xianyang Chamber of Commerce

240
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,370
under Mr. Wu’s arrangement.

241
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,670
Every member

242
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,070
in the Chamber

243
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,630
came from Yanbei

244
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,870
and was handpicked

245
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,950
by Mr. Wu except for Liu Xi.

246
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,380
Then I was planted here

247
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,050
to assist them in secret.

248
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,950
With the help of Mr. Wu

249
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,970
and people and resources

250
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:22,830
from Yanbei,

251
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,990
within two years,

252
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,240
Xianyang Chamber

253
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,420
rose to the top.

254
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,940
These people were born in poverty,

255
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,340
however,

256
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:33,710
they became greedy

257
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,530
after hanging out

258
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,910
with the rich.

259
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,230
Over the past six months,

260
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,180
they made all kinds of excuses

261
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,250
to not pay money.

262
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,140
Some even cooked books,

263
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,150
concealed incomes
and transferred their property.

264
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,840
With the help of Liu Xi,

265
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,220
I killed two men to set an example.

266
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,400
They behaved well for some time.

267
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,880
But a month ago,

268
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,230
when you left Chang’an

269
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,560
and fought all the way back to Yanbei,

270
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,380
that nerd Liu Xi thought

271
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,200
you harmed too many people,

272
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,750
and he was holding the handle
to the devil.

273
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,160
Then he refused to show me
the account book.

274
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,540
Once others found out

275
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,570
about that,

276
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,130
they became even more brazen.

277
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,280
Some even contacted people from Liang

278
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,820
to transfer their property

279
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,900
and fled to Liang

280
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,700
to get rid of my control completely.

281
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,840
It’s not at all surprising

282
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,630
that things have come this far.

283
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,140
But they’re way over the line.

284
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,800
I have controlled

285
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Liu Xi and his family.

286
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,170
But the account book was nowhere
to be found.

287
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,370
There was a tutor

288
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,290
at his house.

289
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,230
Liu Xi gave him the account book

290
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,510
and asked him to send it

291
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,300
to the shop in Wupeng.

292
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,430
I have sent people

293
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,950
to look for him there,

294
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,180
but haven’t found him yet.

295
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,370
My people are staking out along the way.

296
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,710
Once he shows up,

297
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,800
we will catch him immediately.

298
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,180
As long as we get hold of
the account book,

299
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:41,750
we can

300
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,930
get even with

301
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,980
those geezers.

302
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,030
Good.

303
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,510
Well done.

304
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,430
Let Cheng Yuan

305
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,230
help you with the rest.

306
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,580
Aye.

307
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,040
Yanbei?

308
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,970
Yes, Young Master.

309
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,000
Yanbei.

310
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,680
Liu Xi

311
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,560
was an Education Commissioner

312
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,870
in Beishuo, Yanbei.

313
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,950
When Yanbei was struck by famine,

314
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,350
he delivered food there

315
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,390
to help the victims.

316
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,360
Young Master,

317
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,280
I heard another news.

318
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,090
Mr. Feng’s men

319
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,870
are heading to Wupeng

320
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,210
to look for a tutor

321
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,580
at Liu Xi’s house.

322
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,670
It is said that he has

323
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,660
the secret account book of

324
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,240
Xianyang Chamber of Commerce.

325
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,590
Whoever is behind this Chamber,

326
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,640
either he’s from Liang

327
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,840
or Yanbei,

328
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,420
that account book

329
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,100
is of great significance.

330
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,840
Young Master, there’s more.

331
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,640
Men of Wei Guang,
the Wei Household in Chang’an,

332
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,510
had been in Xianyang

333
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,870
acting against Xianyang Chamber

334
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,620
since a long time ago.

335
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,580
After Wei Guang died,

336
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,200
all that simply ended.

337
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,940
But recently,

338
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,340
I heard that

339
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,700
Wei Guang’s successor, Wei Shuye,

340
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,890
pleaded with His Majesty

341
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,360
to reorganize Chambers of Commerce
in Xianyang.

342
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,130
His Majesty seems to have agreed.

343
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,490
He’s already arrived in Wupeng.

344
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,630
Xianyang Chamber

345
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,980
is such a treasure.

346
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,280
Are you alright?

347
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,520
Qiao, this is the account book

348
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,140
that my boss asked me

349
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,290
to take to Wupeng.

350
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,770
I’m already a few days

351
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:51,960
behind the schedule.

352
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,310
Why don’t you

353
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,040
keep it for me?

354
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,440
Why?

355
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,930
I’m afraid that I will lose it.

356
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,060
Can’t you see I’m...

357
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:03,850
You...

358
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:04,540
No.

359
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,610
Just keep it for me.

360
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,480
Be quiet

361
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,710
and let me get some rest.

362
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,040
Fine.

363
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:15,800
Qiao,

364
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,750
you look pale.

365
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,510
You are burning up.

366
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,620
Help! Help!

367
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,020
Please help my friend.

368
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,420
Help!

369
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,430
My friend needs help.

370
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,600
Have a look.

371
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,350
I like it.

372
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,280
This is nice.

373
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,400
Look at mine.

374
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,140
Isn’t it lovely?

375
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:43,810
Check this out.

376
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,120
It’s pretty, too.

377
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,940
I like yours.

378
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,480
Me too.

379
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,720
Gather round and take a look.

380
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,630
Come and look.

381
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,060
Come here.

382
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,230
These are the best slaves

383
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,950
in Xianyang.

384
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:17,790
They really are.

385
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,570
Let me see them.

386
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,530
Yes. Yes. Yes.

387
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,590
You all have good taste.

388
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,290
Check them out.

389
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,210
They are the best

390
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,790
in town.

391
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,200
Sir,

392
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,640
do you want to buy slaves?

393
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,350
Help!

394
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,710
Please help us!

395
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,870
What are you doing?

396
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,860
Help!

397
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,290
Help us!

398
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,570
Please help us!

399
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,980
Are there other slaves?

400
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,350
No, they’re all here.

401
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,200
Please help us!

402
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,160
Get us out!

403
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,910
Young Master,

404
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,880
did you see Xing’er?

405
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,210
She’s too skilled

406
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,710
to be caged here.

407
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,070
Please help us.

408
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,040
Please help us.

409
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,490
Please help us.

410
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,620
- Sir…
- Be quiet.

411
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,930
You don’t like any of them?

412
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:06,290
Please help us, sir!

413
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,400
Buy them all.

414
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,000
Aye.

415
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,570
Sir, we’ll take all of them.

416
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,460
All of them?

417
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,810
Thank you. Thank you so much.

418
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,990
Were this long arrow

419
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,350
removed a day later,

420
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,580
nobody

421
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,630
would be able to save her.

422
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,280
Is she alright?

423
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,270
She is stable for now.

424
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,160
Let her rest.

425
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,490
I see. Thank you.

426
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,480
You should be glad she’s still alive.

427
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,660
Some wealthy man

428
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,840
will come later

429
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,550
to buy her.

430
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,000
I’m surprised that someone

431
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,920
wants an injured slave.

432
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:08,650
You…

433
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,840
Young Master.

434
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,950
Let me go get horses

435
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,130
and a cart.

436
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,940
These girls can’t go back with us

437
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,880
on foot.

438
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:40,640
Luo.

439
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,390
Young Master.

440
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,530
You said you’re still single, right?

441
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,790
These girls

442
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,910
are all yours.

443
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,380
Good for you, Luo.

444
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,950
In just two days,

445
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,660
you’ve had wives and a son.

446
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,500
You don’t need to see us off.

447
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,440
We will leave on our own.

448
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,810
Just go and buy some new dresses

449
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:02,860
for your young wives

450
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,590
and take good care of them.

451
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,020
Thank you.

452
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:08,670
Young Master.

453
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,530
Thank you so much. Please take care.

454
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,040
Mr. Zhan,

455
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,010
there you are.

456
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,130
Look,

457
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,490
I have already got the people
ready for you

458
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,980
and I can bring them to you immediately.

459
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,070
Please take a look, Mr. Zhan.

460
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,240
They are the ones left.

461
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,350
These are good

462
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,510
while those are bad.

463
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,210
You are my regular customer.

464
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,340
I wouldn’t cheat you.

465
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,040
Is this the girl I wanted?

466
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,080
Is it she?

467
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,170
She fell earlier,

468
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,240
but soon,

469
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,940
she can walk again.

470
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,120
You can just be at ease.

471
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,590
This is her elder brother.

472
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,640
He can read and even write poems.

473
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,950
This is it.

474
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,090
Alright.

475
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,640
Come on, come on. Hurry up, hurry up.

476
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,890
Come on, hurry up.

477
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,870
Take them away.

478
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:01,960
Thank you so much, Mr. Zhan.

479
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,450
Thank you a lot.

480
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,410
Come on, come on. Hurry up.

481
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,340
Go.

482
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,430
Take care, Mr. Zhan.

483
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,080
Young Master, look.

484
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,670
Broken Rainbow.

485
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:13,590
Where did you find this?

486
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,170
In the marketplace.

487
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,370
His store was selling it.

488
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,640
I did nothing wrong.

489
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,300
I’m innocent, sir.

490
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,390
I told him

491
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,010
already

492
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:21,610
that this sword

493
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,940
is passed down from my ancestors.

494
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,660
I have been playing with it
since childhood.

495
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,870
I’ll ask you again.

496
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,130
Where did you get it?

497
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,370
Every word I said is true.

498
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,530
Are you going to confess or not?

499
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:30,980
I... I... I...

500
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,830
Say it,

501
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,690
or things will get ugly.

502
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,350
I... I’ll say it. I’ll say it.

503
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,190
I’ll tell you.

504
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,130
Sir,

505
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,610
I found this sword

506
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,420
on the beam in the Town God’s Temple

507
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,790
when I passed by Tangma Range.

508
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,600
I knew it’s a fine sword

509
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,480
and it must be expensive

510
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,360
when I saw it,

511
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,520
so I just took it.

512
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:47,840
Young Master.

513
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,090
Hello.

514
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,280
Welcome back, sir.

515
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,120
Thank you

516
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,410
for buying

517
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,980
all my girls today.

518
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,080
Thank you so much.

519
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,480
Thank you. You’re so generous.

520
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,340
Tell me,

521
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,040
did you see a girl

522
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,830
of average height,

523
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,730
with a round face and big eyes

524
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,420
who can also fight?

525
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,400
By the way, she might be injured

526
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,920
or dressed up as a man.

527
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,160
No.

528
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,630
No, no, no, no.

529
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,140
Absolutely not.

530
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,350
Think again.

531
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,460
Sorry,

532
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,190
I had no idea

533
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,320
she is your friend.

534
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,490
I’m ignorant.

535
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:23,400
Where is she?

536
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,560
She was bought by someone just now.

537
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,860
Who? When?

538
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,660
Just a few minutes ago,

539
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,390
and they got out of the city.

540
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,310
I didn’t know who the buyer is,

541
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,430
but the name of their steward

542
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,790
is Zhan.

543
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,020
Get me a horse.

544
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:40,650
Aye.

545
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,740
Young Master, we have got the information

546
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,180
that two caravans have gotten out.

547
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,130
Both of them are going to Wupeng by water.

548
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,640
That happens to be our destination, too.

549
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,720
Xing’er wouldn’t have been caught

550
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,100
unless

551
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,420
she’s injured.

552
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,950
We’re heading to Wupeng immediately.

553
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,590
Qiao.

554
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,480
You’re awake.

555
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,520
Where are we?

556
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,160
Someone bought us.

557
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,650
They’re kind enough

558
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,100
to treat your wound.

559
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,090
They also left this medicine to you.

560
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,330
You lost too much blood

561
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,610
and this will help enrich it.

562
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,770
Where are you going?

563
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,100
We are on the boat.

564
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,300
So,

565
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,690
you’re healthy again.

566
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,430
Are you in charge here?

567
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,880
Do I

568
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,780
look like one?

569
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,670
The quilt covering your legs

570
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,270
is made of Sichuan brocade.

571
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,070
The glazed cup is worth a fortune.

572
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,670
And the glazed jar

573
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,330
is a rare treasure.

574
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:12,860
What you’re drinking

575
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,420
is not the one that commoners can afford.

576
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,020
This boat is smaller

577
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,340
and simpler than I thought.

578
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,810
I can tell

579
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,050
you are really a man

580
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,380
of low profile.

581
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,870
I didn’t expect

582
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,910
a maid I randomly bought

583
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,250
would be so well-informed.

584
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,920
Randomly bought you said?

585
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:37,810
Did you really not know who I am?

586
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,690
Don’t be so surprised.

587
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,490
An average maid

588
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,700
is worth 20 to 30 taels.

589
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,370
Even the best one is less than 50 taels.

590
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,470
Put aside the medicine you gave me,

591
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,640
the bottle alone

592
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,690
is priceless.

593
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,120
It’s equal to

594
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,610
at least 10 maids.

595
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,950
If you didn’t know me,

596
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,730
why would you go to such great lengths?

597
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,090
Couldn’t I be a saint

598
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,000
who cares less about

599
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,240
the mere worldly possessions?

600
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,600
How could a man

601
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,990
drinking the best liquor
from the finest jar

602
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:17,960
care less about

603
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,990
worldly possessions?

604
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,860
And it’s already late.

605
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,520
You didn’t row ashore to rest

606
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,040
but asked the boatmen to set sail

607
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,250
to go upstream instead.

608
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,290
That doesn’t fit

609
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:36,870
the description of a kindhearted

610
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,400
and considerable master.

611
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,420
You are really smart.

612
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:49,780
Tell me,

613
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,060
who gave you the order?

614
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,730
Why did you save me?

615
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,300
What do you want?

616
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,200
What if I don’t?

617
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,660
Are you going to kill me

618
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,850
with the flying dagger

619
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,130
in your hand?

620
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,520
Honestly,

621
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,880
I’m not interested in you.

622
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:16,900
Someone asked me

623
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,350
to find you

624
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,210
and help you out.

625
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,940
The boat will dock in Wupeng tomorrow.

626
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,950
You can leave then.

627
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,220
Who asked you to do this?

628
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,200
Prince Xiao Ce.

629
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,110
I’ve got company.

630
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,170
Can I take him with me?

631
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,230
Suit yourself.

632
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,850
Qiao, slow down.

633
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:17,060
Wait for me.

634
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,760
Slow down.

635
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,810
Listen, nerd,

636
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,170
Wupeng is right ahead.

637
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,310
We should part here.

638
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,020
What?

639
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,060
You’re leaving?

640
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,470
I have something important to do.

641
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,750
Why are you following me?

642
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,150
Do you want money?

643
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,250
Let me be clear.

644
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,360
My pocket is empty.

645
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,760
Wupeng is right there.

646
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,350
Didn’t you say you have contacts there?

647
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,510
I’m not following you for money.

648
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,730
If you think so little of me,

649
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,790
then… So long.

650
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,270
Hey, your...

651
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:04,460
I forgot to give him this.

652
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,900
= Account Book =

653
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,140
Listen,

654
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,110
don’t beat me.

655
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,680
If you hurt me,

656
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,870
my friend will make you pay.

657
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,270
She’s a highly skilled martial artist.

658
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,070
You people

659
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,170
wouldn’t be her match

660
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,790
even if you were doubled.

661
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,500
Don’t bluff!

662
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,130
I’ll cut to the chase.

663
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,350
You’re Liang Shaoqing,

664
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,230
a tutor

665
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,360
at Liu Xi’s household

666
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,490
and his personal accountant, correct?

667
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,190
How did you know that?

668
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,240
You’re going to Wupeng

669
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,810
to deliver an account book.

670
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,400
I searched you

671
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,540
but didn’t find it.

672
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,820
Where is it?

673
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,760
You know that, too?

674
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,640
I know everything.

675
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,630
Be good

676
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,140
and give me the account book

677
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,210
to avoid suffering.

678
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,640
You look like a bad buy.

679
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,620
If you really know everything,

680
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,200
you can find it yourself.

681
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,290
You… I...

682
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:14,070
Forget it. Never mind.

683
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,450
We’re only asked

684
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:16,560
to go to Mr. Tian’s mansion

685
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,360
to hand him in

686
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,620
tonight.

687
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,210
That account book

688
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,530
isn’t our concern.

689
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:23,970
Take him away.

690
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:24,760
- Aye.
- Aye.

691
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,950
Get up.

692
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,250
What are you doing?

693
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:32,600
Don’t move.

694
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,440
Let go of me!

695
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,480
Don’t move. Shut up. Or I will beat you.

696
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,710
Let me go!

697
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,330
What are you doing?

698
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:40,830
- Let me out.
- He is so heavy.

699
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,830
Where are you taking me?

700
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,540
Let me out!

701
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:46,120
Let me out!

702
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,320
Zip it. Shut up.

703
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:48,760
Let me out!

704
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,210
Shut up. Or I will beat you.

705
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,060
There’s money

706
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,040
and an address in it.

707
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,750
Go to that place

708
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,320
and ask the owner there

709
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,020
to kill someone for me.

710
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,930
I’m sorry. It’s my fault.

711
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,090
May I ask

712
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,090
who the target is?

713
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,400
Chu Qiao.

714
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:27,280
What the heck is this place?

715
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,620
It’s too hot and my mouth is dry.

716
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,370
I haven’t had anything for three days.

717
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,720
Kind sir, could you give me
something to eat?

718
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,700
In this case,

719
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,680
staple food is not enough.

720
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,010
There should be liquor and meat at least.

721
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,390
They can only be bought with money.

722
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,350
I have got the money,

723
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,790
but not liquor and meat.

724
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,190
They can only be found in the afterlife.

725
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:17,840
The afterlife may not
have everything you want.

726
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,330
= Chu Qiao =

727
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,310
My master wishes to

728
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:31,450
employ the Death Camp
to get rid of someone.

729
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,760
Money is not a problem.

730
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,180
The flu can be serious.

731
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,530
I can

732
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:04,490
find a physician

733
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,800
to treat you.

734
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,500
That’s unnecessary.

735
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,170
This way, please.

736
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,700
Alright then.

737
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,770
I just bought a showgirl

738
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:13,090
from Xianyang.

739
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,540
She’s beautiful.

740
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,090
She can

741
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,910
take care of you tonight.

742
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:20,310
This way, please.

744
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:04,090
Mr. Tian.

745
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,110
Please see to the matter

746
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:07,780
that I entrusted you carefully.

747
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,980
Rest assured, sir.

748
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,630
I have already passed the order

749
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,980
to search all boats

750
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,600
arriving in Wupeng thoroughly.

751
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,190
Once we find that girl,

752
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,640
I will let you know immediately.

753
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,530
Thank you.

754
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,320
This way, please.

755
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:27,370
Sir, this is Hot Spring Pavilion.

756
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,310
That showgirl

757
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:31,080
is a fantastic dancer

758
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,620
and masseuse.

759
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,800
You can

760
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,730
take a bath at first,

761
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:37,970
and then

762
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:39,240
enjoy the massage.

763
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:42,350
Your flu will soon be gone.

764
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,310
Please.

This way, please.

766
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,050
Sir,

767
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,610
you can get some rest.

768
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,430
The guards are outside.

769
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,180
If you need anything, just let them know.

770
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,090
You must serve him well.

771
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,160
Aye.

772
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,510
Have a good night.

773
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:21,580
I shall take my leave.

Sure.

775

Mr. Tian told me

776
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:56,930
you are a good masseuse.

777
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,400
Come here.

778
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,510

cold and serious.

790
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,660
I didn’t know he liked it rough in bed.

791
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,180
I know, right?

792
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,620
They were so loud

793
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,770
all the way from the bathtub

794
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,070
to bed.

795
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,340
They are really enjoying themselves.

796
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,350
That woman is lucky

797
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:10,040
that Young Master likes her.

798
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,150
I admire Young Master so much.

799
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:13,340
Yueqi.

800
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,150
Yueqi.

801
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,410
What is on your mind?

802
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,570
Are you sure

803
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,220
it’s Young Master inside?

804
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,770
- Yes.
- Yes.

805
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,230
Really?

806
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:25,920
Of course.

807
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,100
No, no, no.

808
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,510
He must be drugged.

809
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,480
I need to take a look inside.

810
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:33,730
- Yueqi!
- Yueqi!

811
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:34,850
- Don’t.
- Don’t.

812
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,700
Don’t interrupt them.

813
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,430
Finally, Young Master

814
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,520
has become normal again.

815
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,260
You can’t ruin it.

816
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,520
I was worried for years

817
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,830
that he’d eventually

818
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,040
become a monk.

819
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:46,630
Right.

820
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,170
That woman is good.

821
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,640
We need to keep her for Young Master

822
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,710
and take her back to Chang’an.

823
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:53,120
- That’s right.
- I agree.

824
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:53,820
Agreed.

825
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:55,890
Yes.

826
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,300
Your servants are as crooked as you.

827
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:03,190
Fine.

828
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:06,320
You’re a lady

829
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,910
in bed with another man.

830
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,020
Why are you staring at me?

831
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,250
You haven’t had enough yet?

832
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:21,990
We can continue.

833
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,230
There is someone inside.

834
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,660
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

835
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:54,400
So she is the girl

836
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,830
Mr. Tian prepared for me.

837
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,270
What a pity!

838
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,730
Why?

839
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:06,060
Did I ruin your night?

840
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:07,860
You like her?

841
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:11,850
Yes.

842
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,260
A beauty

843
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:15,760
is stuffed in the closet,

844
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,710
yet a shrew

845
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:19,500
is lying in bed.

846
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,790
Any man will think

847
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:23,110
it is a pity.

848
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,750
You call yourself a man?

849
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:27,420
But I heard

850
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,840
those Yue Guards outside

851
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,340
saying that you’ve been celibate for years

852
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:31,800
and you’re going to be a monk.

853
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,650
Don’t get on my nerves,

854
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:43,760
or I’ll show you

855
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:46,130
if I am a real man.

856
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:49,760
You’re shameless!

857
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,890
You dressed like this to seduce me first.

858
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:54,440
Who has no shame?

859
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,870
Who was seducing you?

860
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:58,130
Where are you going?

861
00:43:58,130 --> 00:43:59,130
I am leaving.

No way.

I won’t.

Sir, are you still awake?

Mr. Tian, it’s late.

Why are you here?

869

Young Master Wei Shuye is here.
