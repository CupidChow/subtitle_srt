16
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,910
Commander, bad news.

17
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:42,270
What happened?

18
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,870
Wei Army is coming,

19
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,710
yet Yan Xun and his troops

20
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,080
are heading to Meilin Pass.

21
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,770
Hongchuan is in danger.

22
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,020
Inform our men to pack up

23
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,090
to defend Hongchuan.

24
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:52,990
Aye.

25
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,420
Don’t panic.

26
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,330
You’re free to stay or leave.

27
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,390
I promise

28
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,550
we won’t harm you.

29
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,400
I just want to know

30
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,950
if Miss Chu has arrived in Hongchuan.

31
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,630
How is she now?

32
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,380
Is she alright?

33
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,580
Miss Chu is fine.

34
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,630
Miss Chu.

35
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,790
General He.

36
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,720
I’m so glad to see you again.

37
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:29,940
Great.

38
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,880
I’m happy you’re safe.

39
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,250
What happened here?

40
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,570
You’re already in Yanbei.

41
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,810
Why did you camp here

42
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,790
instead of going into town?

43
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,490
Miss Chu, don’t you know,

44
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,320
without you,

45
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,320
there’d be no place

46
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:51,650
for Xiuli Army

47
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,310
in Hongchuan?

48
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,050
He Xiao, the thing is,

49
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,580
as you have seen,

50
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,570
Wei dispatched troops to Yanbei.

51
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,630
Among the five cities of Yanbei,

52
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,210
Hongchuan has been lost

53
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,420
to a group of mobs.

54
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,970
It’s in danger.

55
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,310
I alone

56
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,050
can’t do much.

57
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,750
Luckily,

58
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,720
your force came right in time.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,870
At this moment,

60
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,970
Yanbei needs you.

61
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,310
I, Chu Qiao,

62
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,060
also need you.

63
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,210
Miss Chu.

64
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,910
What are you doing?

65
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,320
I don’t deserve this.

66
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,440
Miss Chu.

67
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,430
You once

68
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,890
saved hundreds of our troops

69
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,250
from danger on your own

70
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,360
at the risk of your own life.

71
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,430
Miss Chu.

72
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,800
Now that Hongchuan is in danger,

73
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,980
Xiuli Army

74
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,500
is obligated to guard the city.

75
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,250
I, He Xiao,

76
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,900
implore you to take command

77
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,610
of the Xiuli Army.

78
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,270
At this critical moment,

79
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,910
Yanbei and I

80
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,210
are more than grateful to you

81
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,170
for protecting Hongchuan.

82
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,090
I will take command

83
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,040
and accept your allegiance.

84
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,840
Your wish is our command!

85
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,370
- Your wish is our command!
- Your wish is our command!

86
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,160
- Your wish is our command!
- Your wish is our command!

87
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,720
Report!

88
00:04:58,970 --> 00:04:59,700
General.

89
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,780
Princess Yuan Chun is here.

90
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,690
Chun, what are you doing here?

91
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,050
You may leave.

92
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:19,890
- Aye.
- Aye.

93
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,580
Leave us alone.

94
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:36,980
- Aye.
- Aye.

95
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,390
Why did you come to this battlefield

96
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,790
instead of keeping yourself safe
in Chang’an?

97
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,480
I’m already in this battle

98
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,170
since a long time ago.

99
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,090
Chun, you are the Princess of Wei.

100
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,420
You represent Chang’an.

101
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,880
Has it ever occurred to you

102
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,860
that if you

103
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,720
abandoned Chang’an,

104
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,170
what else did you have?

105
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,500
I represent Chang’an?

106
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,830
Every breath I’m taking,

107
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,240
every mouthful of food

108
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,840
I’m stuffing down my throat

109
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,190
are for revenge.

110
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,630
That’s all

111
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,390
that matters to me.

112
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,890
I wouldn’t give up until it’s done.

113
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,950
Chun.

114
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,910
Why do you have to do this?

115
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,630
If you really want to help me,

116
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,910
then raid Hongchuan.

117
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,330
If you succeed,

118
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,340
Chang’an will also be safe.

119
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,030
Better sooner than later.

120
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,490
You know

121
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,740
you are the only person

122
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,120
I can’t say no to

123
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,050
in my entire life.

124
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,230
Open the gate! Open the gate!

125
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,330
Let us in!

126
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,400
Let us in!

127
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,700
Open the gate!

128
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,660
Let us in!

129
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,400
Open the gate!

130
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,990
Open the gate!

131
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,420
Open the gate!

132
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:31,940
Open the gate!

133
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,670
A crowd is gathering outside.

134
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,440
Why didn’t they open the gate?

135
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,520
Wei Army is approaching.

136
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,670
I think

137
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,050
they are worried that

138
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,290
there might be spies of Wei in the crowd.

139
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,680
That’s why they don’t let them in.

140
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,530
Poor people.

141
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,720
I hope we still have time.

142
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,760
Miss Chu.

143
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,170
Wei Army is coming.

144
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,160
How far are they?

145
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,570
25 kilometers away.

146
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:55,760
Flag a message.

147
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,030
Tell them to open the gate.

148
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:57,690
Aye.

149
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,460
Open the gate!

150
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,830
Open the gate!

151
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,610
Please let us in!

152
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:11,740
Report!

153
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,060
General, a soldier is outside

154
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,290
flagging a message.

155
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,320
What is he saying?

156
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,580
It seems that

157
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,130
he wants us to open the gate

158
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,280
and let the civilians in.

159
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,550
They are reinforcements.

160
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,370
It can’t be

161
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,680
in Yanbei.

162
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,870
Don’t let them in.

163
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,460
I’ll report to General now.

164
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,090
Aye.

165
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,490
Report!

166
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,020
General, Wei Army is 25 kilometers

167
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,910
away from us.

168
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,510
And you’re telling me that now?

169
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,710
I’m sorry.

170
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,690
Wei Army

171
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,640
pops out of nowhere

172
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,850
all of a sudden.

173
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,040
You may leave.

174
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,570
Aye.

175
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,860
General.

176
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,670
General.

177
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,990
Reinforcements are outside,

178
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,980
asking us to let them

179
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,630
and the civilians in.

180
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,510
What? They can’t be reinforcements.

181
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,320
They are spies from Wei.

182
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,110
I agree.

183
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,550
They are definitely spies

184
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,100
in disguise.

185
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,440
They are waiting for us to open the gate

186
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,740
to clobber us from the inside.

187
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,130
Don’t let them in.

188
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,540
I have the order from His Highness.

189
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,250
Do not open the gate.

190
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,330
If Hongchuan is lost,

191
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,170
we can leave from the secret tunnel.

192
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,870
Eliminate those

193
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,750
who try to break in.

194
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,370
Aye.

195
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,580
Kill everyone within the 30-meter range

196
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,120
from the gate.

197
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,130
Protect Miss Chu.

198
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,040
Bowmen.

199
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,750
Listen up!

200
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,650
The crowd is full of people from Yanbei.

201
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,020
There is no spy from Wei.

202
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,060
Please open the gate now

203
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,180
and let us in.

204
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:07,690
Shoot!

205
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,570
Aye!

206
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,970
Xiuli Army, protect civilians!

207
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,790
Protect Miss Chu!

208
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,140
Miss Chu, are you all right?

209
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,630
I am fine. Look after the crowd.

210
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,350
Miss Chu,

211
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,740
we don’t know those in Hongchuan

212
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,760
are friends or foes.

213
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,400
It’s risky to break in.

214
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:30,890
Don’t stop me.

215
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,600
Protect Miss Chu.

216
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,150
I am Chu Qiao.

217
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,770
I’m asking to see

218
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:49,660
your leader.

219
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,000
Cheng Yuan, what are you doing?

220
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,760
That is Miss Chu outside.

221
00:10:59,010 --> 00:10:59,700
General.

222
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,680
General.

223
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,600
Bad news! That’s Chu Qiao outside.

224
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,970
Miss Chu.

225
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,890
Did you shoot them?

226
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,390
Yes.

227
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,350
Did anyone die?

228
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,070
Yes.

229
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,240
What about Miss Chu?

230
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,180
Cheng Yuan.

231
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,260
What do you want?

232
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,350
Miss Chu.

233
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,110
That was just a misunderstanding.

234
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,360
You can come inside.

235
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,910
Open the gate.

236
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,130
Stop!

237
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,650
Stop!

238
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,290
Miss, run!

239
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,230
It’s a trap!

240
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,100
Feng Mian!

241
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,260
Leave now!

242
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,010
Retreat!

243
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,370
Shoot!

244
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,730
General, it was all my fault.

245
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,360
Feng Mian tipped Chu Qiao off.

246
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,250
Our plan failed.

247
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,460
If Chu Qiao is alive,

248
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,670
we will all be in trouble.

249
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,210
Report.

250
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,830
General, the vanguard of Wei

251
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,380
are 20 kilometers away.

252
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,830
Pass my order.

253
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,180
Gather our troops.

254
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,350
We are leaving.

255
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,110
- Aye.
- Aye.

256
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,720
Miss Chu!

257
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,180
Miss Chu!

258
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,550
Wei Army is 20 kilometers away.

259
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,760
Our plan…

260
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,310
You came just in time.

261
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,410
Find a way to go inside.

262
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,120
Aye.

263
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,640
Your Highness, bad news.

264
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,650
We were fooled.

265
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,090
Troops at Meilin Pass

266
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,400
are less than 10 thousand.

267
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,780
Wei Shuye is leading the rest of the army

268
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,200
to Chiyuan Ferry.

269
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,700
They are heading to Hongchuan.

270
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,500
We came with

271
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,170
tens of thousands of people

272
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:08,750
and walked

273
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,870
right into their trap.

274
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,540
Hongchuan is in danger.

275
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,010
Your Highness.

276
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:20,690
I see.

277
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,020
How long does it take

278
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,380
to go to Meilin Pass?

279
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,880
About one hour

280
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,240
at top speed.

281
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,430
How long

282
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,510
can troops there hold?

283
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,340
Meilin hasn’t experienced war for years.

284
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,290
Troops there

285
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,890
are weak.

286
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,000
They are outnumbered.

287
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,630
Besides, Wei Shuye

288
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,970
employed a large number of soldiers

289
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,140
to work as farmers.

290
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,740
Based on our military strength,

291
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,510
we can defeat them in less
than half a day.

292
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,950
After that,

293
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,820
how far are we from Chang’an?

294
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,630
Are you planning to take Chang’an?

295
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,410
Why not?

296
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,040
But…

297
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,380
Wei Shuye

298
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,780
tricked us here

299
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,810
using Meilin Pass as the bait

300
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,450
in an attempt to raid our hinterland.

301
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,450
Why can’t I

302
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,390
use Hongchuan to distract them

303
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,920
to conquer Chang’an?

304
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,820
But…

305
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,400
From Meilin Pass to Chang’an,

306
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,460
there aren’t any major forts

307
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,960
or garrisons.

308
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,400
It’ll take us

309
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,090
less than two days

310
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,670
at full speed

311
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,740
to arrive at the heart of Wei.

312
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,400
They all assumed I’d hole up in Yanbei

313
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,710
after I returned.

314
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,280
I’ll prove to them they’re wrong.

315
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,010
I’m going to Chang’an

316
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,410
and behead the Emperor of Wei myself.

317
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,910
Your Highness, Hongchuan lacks
enough force.

318
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,050
They might not match

319
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:00,750
Wei Shuye’s army.

320
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,440
If we lose Hongchuan,

321
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,070
then Beishuo, Lancheng,

322
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,320
even the whole Yanbei

323
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,360
- Half of Wei
- will be…

324
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,510
is already mine.

325
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,680
Why do I still need Yanbei?

326
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,920
Your Highness,

327
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,990
Yanbei is our home.

328
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,390
Home?

329
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,240
When Wei invaded us,

330
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,600
did any of the eight tribes

331
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,590
offer to help us?

332
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,960
My father treated them so well.

333
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,590
Did those jerks

334
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,230
ever go to our ancestral hall

335
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,160
to mourn the death of my father

336
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,980
or sweep his tomb?

337
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,280
You think we still have a home?

338
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,230
Our home is long gone.

339
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,890
Your Highness,

340
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,330
Achu is still in Hongchuan.

341
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,970
Zhong Yu will get her out.

342
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,190
Ajing, go get ready.

343
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,060
Conquer Meilin Pass

344
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,900
and head towards Chang’an.

345
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,560
The Emperor of Wei must pay with blood

346
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,490
for the deaths of our Yanbei warriors.

347
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:45,790
Who are you?

348
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,010
Save it.

349
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,880
Open the gate and let the Xiuli Army in.

350
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,590
Don’t do anything stupid,

351
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,350
or we will kill you!

352
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,700
Behave yourself.

353
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:03,620
= Hongchuan =

354
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,770
Follow me. Let’s go!

355
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:22,550
Let’s go!

356
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,980
Let’s go!

357
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,640
Listen up!

358
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,010
Set off instantly

359
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,590
to take Chang’an!

360
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,080
Get ready to shoot!

361
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,310
Shoot!

362
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,140
Run!

363
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,570
Run for life!

364
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,430
Go!

365
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,100
Run!

366
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,850
Hurry!

367
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,470
Run!

368
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,660
This way.

369
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,360
Come out and surrender at noon tomorrow.

370
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,540
Or there will be a massacre

371
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,890
in the city.

372
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:44,320
Surrender!

373
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,390
Retreat!

374
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,680
Open the gate and surrender.

375
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,030
Open the gate and surrender.

376
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,300
Or we will all die.

377
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,220
Yes.

378
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:51,700
Just surrender

379
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,010
As the guard of Hongchuan,

380
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,970
I’ll protect the city with my life.

381
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,360
No one shall

382
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,130
take our land

383
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,700
or harm our people!

384
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:03,820
Who are you?

385
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,180
The Xiuli Army

386
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,710
you command once betrayed Yanbei.

387
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,560
How are we supposed to trust you?

388
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,180
Yes. Right.

389
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,150
How can we believe you?

390
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,080
Three years ago,

391
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,250
Xiuli Army was tricked

392
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,710
into opening the gate.

393
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:21,520
Hongchuan was filled with blood
and corpses.

394
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,560
Their own family and friends

395
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,510
died as well.

396
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:27,940
All these years,

397
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,950
they couldn’t come home.

398
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,160
They are as painful

399
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,980
as you are.

400
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,570
To return to our hometown,

401
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,060
we fought side by side

402
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,730
more than once

403
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,700
and made our way out of Chang’an.

404
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,470
I trust them.

405
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,900
And I implore you to

406
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,910
give them another chance as well.

407
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,080
I promise you.

408
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,540
If we fail to defeat the enemy tomorrow,

409
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,170
you can tie

410
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,780
all of us up

411
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,120
to surrender to Wei.

412
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,410
I won’t stop you

413
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,160
or put up any resistance.

414
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,040
Hongchuan is old

415
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,180
and so are the facilities.

416
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,840
When Cheng Yuan and Jiang Teng

417
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,150
escaped with their men,

418
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,740
they took everything.

419
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,780
Miss,

420
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,530
what can we use to battle?

421
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:31,870
I have some

422
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,050
drafts of weapons.

423
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,310
We can use what we have here

424
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,250
to make some right now.

425
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,690
Hope we can finish in time.

426
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,840
We will guard this place

427
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,660
as long as we can.

428
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,160
Our goal

429
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,690
is not to wipe out the enemies.

430
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:47,430
But to fight

431
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,870
by guerrillas

432
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,420
to interrupt their strikes,

433
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,080
demoralize them

434
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,080
and delay their attack.

435
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,750
Time and patience

436
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,610
are all that we have.

437
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,190
As long as we can hold on for seven days,

438
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,350
I’m sure

439
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,280
His Highness’s reinforcements will arrive
by then.

440
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,070
Everyone,

441
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,600
the war is coming.

442
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,190
No time to hesitate.

443
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:17,050
Our state is in danger.

444
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,690
It’s time to show our loyalty.

445
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:21,370
As a soldier,

446
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,280
it’s our duty

447
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,040
to safeguard our land and people.

448
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,700
No matter how this will end,

449
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,260
we cannot fail Yanbei,

450
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,080
we cannot fail ourselves,

451
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,650
and more importantly,

452
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,490
we cannot fail this flag above us!

453
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,680
This battle

454
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,280
is life-and-death.

455
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,760
Everyone,

456
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,390
do take care!

457
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,110
You too, Miss!

458
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,430
Ge Qi?

459
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:00,310
Commander.

460
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,010
You are not on duty tonight.

461
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,090
Why are you still up?

462
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,570
I can’t sleep.

463
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,030
Why?

464
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:12,830
What’s on your mind?

465
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:17,450
Well,

466
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,290
it’s been years since I left home.

467
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:24,160
I wonder if my wife

468
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,110
gave birth to a boy or a girl.

469
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:29,440
Did she marry another man?

470
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,750
And how are my parents?

471
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,250
Are they alright?

472
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:43,680
What happened last time?

473
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,750
Last time,

474
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,190
I did not go inside

475
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,020
because I was still

476
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,070
seen as a traitor.

477
00:27:58,690 --> 00:27:59,490
I get it.

478
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,400
I really hope

479
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,000
I can survive this battle.

480
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,000
And His Highness will

481
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,360
clear my name

482
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,770
so that I can go home

483
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:14,640
with honor.

484
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,870
Don’t worry, man.

485
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,520
I’m sure

486
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,920
we will make it.

487
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,280
Come out.

488
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,040
Who are you?

489
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,400
You are still young.

490
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,410
Why didn’t you leave with others?

491
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,240
We’ve met before.

492
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,020
Last time, outside the pharmacy,

493
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:29,880
one of your men

494
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,060
paid for my mother’s medicine.

495
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,170
You are not sending me away?

496
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,850
Whether you choose to live or die

497
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,190
is none of my business.

498
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,710
I am busy every day.

499
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,770
I don’t have time for a kid like you.

500
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,240
A kid?

501
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,640
I... I…

502
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,070
I’ve turned 15.

503
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,310
I can go on the battlefield
to kill enemies.

504
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,470
I...

505
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,270
Look at me.

506
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,940
Look how strong I am.

507
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,340
Why didn’t you leave

508
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,360
with them?

509
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,410
My mother is sick. She can’t move.

510
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:19,190
Don’t send us away.

511
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:21,680
I can guard the city with you

512
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,500
and help you kill bad people.

513
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,050
What’s your name?

514
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,230
Du Gouzi.
[*Gouzi means puppy.]

515
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,160
You seem to be a good boy.

516
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,630
Why that name?

517
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,800
It was my grandmother’s idea.

518
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,880
A humble name could keep me safe.

519
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,350
Actually,

520
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,250
I don’t

521
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,470
like that name, either.

522
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,010
How about you think of a new one for me?

523
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,470
But I’m still a Du.

524
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:00,810
How about Ping’an?

525
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:02,960
Ping’an?

526
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,770
Yes, Du Ping’an.

527
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,520
Du Ping’an? Ping’an means
peace and safety.

528
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:25,450
Kill!

529
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,020
Report!

530
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,130
Report!

531
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,480
Our grains and heavy weapons

532
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,290
were robbed.

533
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,440
Right and Left Wings, back up the tail.

534
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,510
Open the gate and surrender!

535
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,070
Charge!

536
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:18,040
Kill!

537
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:15,130
Kill!

538
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,350
Kill!

539
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,710
Kill!

540
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:54,170
Kill!

541
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,750
In defense formation!

542
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,350
Fellows,

543
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:53,810
brothers and sisters,

544
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,700
Wei Army

545
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,400
has gone around the Meilin Pass

546
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,320
and passed Chiyuan Ferry.

547
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,940
Now, they are right outside Hongchuan.

548
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,440
They have come

549
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,970
all the way here

550
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:05,640
under the Emperor of Wei’s order

551
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,360
only to

552
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,940
slaughter us all.

553
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,600
But don’t be afraid.

554
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,730
We aren’t alone.

555
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,520
The King of Yanbei, Yan Xun,

556
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,040
will come to our aid

557
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,840
once he gets hold of the Meilin Pass.

558
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,310
All these difficulties

559
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:20,540
are only temporary.

560
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,820
We will hold on

561
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,890
to the last moment.

562
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,720
There’s still a chance for us

563
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,400
to survive.

564
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:29,110
To surrender or to fight?

565
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,660
Or to stand up against them

566
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,040
and battle it out

567
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,120
with dignity?

568
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:33,950
- Battle!
- Battle!

569
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:36,830
- Battle! Battle! Battle!
- Battle! Battle! Battle!

570
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:37,840
I announce that

571
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,430
on behalf of His Excellency Yan,
I, Chu Qiao,

572
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,930
take over Hongchuan.

573
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:45,100
All the troops

574
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,430
must follow my orders.

575
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,210
All women and children

576
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,460
shall leave from the West Gate

577
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,870
and rush to Lancheng.

578
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,930
All men above 15

579
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:54,500
and under 50

580
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,870
shall follow me

581
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:58,250
to protect Hongchuan, protect Yanbei!

582
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:01,100
- Protect Hongchuan, protect Yanbei!
- Protect Hongchuan, protect Yanbei!

583
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,410
- Protect Hongchuan, protect Yanbei!
- Protect Hongchuan, protect Yanbei!

584
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:06,060
- Protect Hongchuan, protect Yanbei!
- Protect Hongchuan, protect Yanbei!

585
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,720
- Protect Hongchuan, protect Yanbei!
- Protect Hongchuan, protect Yanbei!

586
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,580
- Protect Hongchuan, protect Yanbei!
- Protect Hongchuan, protect Yanbei!

587
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,290
Father. Father.

588
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:05,150
Son.

589
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:05,900
Father.

590
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:09,860
You look busy.

591
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,220
The situation is tense.

592
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,290
Why are you back?

593
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,700
I am patrolling in this neighborhood,

594
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,830
so I drop by to visit.

595
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,540
These are for you.

596
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,650
You can share it with others.

597
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:22,250
The city is surrounded. Food is limited.

598
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,150
Leave these

599
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,970
to the soldiers.

600
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,960
They can’t battle on an empty stomach.

601
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,890
Right?

602
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:28,620
Yes. Right.

603
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,270
We are not hungry.

604
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:29,770
Yes.

605
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:30,700
We are fine.

606
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,080
Yes, we all depend on you!

607
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,230
You’re our hope.

608
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,560
But, Father…

609
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,150
Don’t worry about us.

610
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,520
We have food.

611
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,210
Everything is fine. You should go.

612
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:40,630
Son.

613
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,000
The locals

614
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:44,730
have accepted you.

615
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,990
Don’t let them down.

616
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,100
I won’t. Don’t worry.

617
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:50,780
Go. Go. Go.

618
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,390
Father.

619
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:52,310
- Go ahead.
- Father.

620
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,320
I’m fine.

621
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,650
Don’t worry.

622
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,780
Yes. Right.

623
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,580
We got it.

624
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:57,900
Go. Don’t worry.

625
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,810
Thank you for your hard work.

626
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:00,190
Just go.

627
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:07,750
Zhuzi,

628
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:08,710
come here.

629
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:09,370
Yes.

630
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,880
Our victory this time

631
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,610
is pure luck.

632
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:13,650
But how long will it last?

633
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,780
Will Yan Xun’s reinforcements
come in time?

634
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:20,650
Seven days.

635
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,900
