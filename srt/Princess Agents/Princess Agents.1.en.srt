most people know

who they are,

where they will go,

20
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,590
and who will be the one of their life.

But I don’t.

in the struggle.

26
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,490
Because I don’t remember the past.

Why are they asking us to wear these?

Look. There are characters on the clothes.

What are the characters?

- I can’t read.
- I can’t read, either.

No, I can’t.

yet we are horse racing here.

Horse racing is fine,

I wouldn’t bring you here

and these young beauties.

175
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:22,990
- No...
- It...

176
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,390
There are our names on their clothes.

177
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,410
Yes.

178
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,030
That’s exactly the fun.

179
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,600
Each of us will have a quiver of arrows.

180
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,950
We can shoot the girl slaves

181
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:33,430
with others’ names

182
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,570
or shoot the wolves.

183
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,620
It will end upon the signal

184
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,270
of an arrow after an incense is burnt out.

185
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,780
The one with the most living slaves remaining

186
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,710
will win.

187
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,260
That’s too cruel.

188
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,290
Looks like

189
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,330
protecting your own slaves

190
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,140
is more likely to win

191
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,180
than hunting wolves.

192
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,770
That’s so interesting!

193
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:50,740
Perk up.

194
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,090
Perk up, guys.

195
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,240
Zhao Xifeng has a point.

196
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,340
Prey on girl slaves?

197
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,590
It’s indeed a rare way to have fun.

198
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,850
But it’s too cruel.

199
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,360
I’m out.

200
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,820
Why don’t we change the preys?

201
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,070
That’s the same.

202
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,090
Just some slaves.

203
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,360
They made mistakes,

204
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,730
and deserve to die.

205
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:15,830
I’m giving them a chance

206
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:16,850
to live by the game.

207
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,750
If they can make it,

208
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,310
they will be spared the death penalty.

209
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,780
Prince Yan.

210
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,540
Marquis Dingbei of Yanbei

211
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,030
earned his title and wealth

212
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,370
by arrow shooting on horse.

213
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,740
With the horse he rode

214
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,040
and the wolf saber in his hand,

215
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,440
he made a name for himself.

216
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,680
Yan Xun,

217
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,950
you’re his son.

218
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,440
The saying has that

219
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,480
like father, like son.

220
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,330
Do you want to

221
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,620
disgrace your father’s name?

222
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,330
Yanbei’s wolf saber

223
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,110
can slain treacherous traitors,

224
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,850
and the invading enemies,

225
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,480
but not

226
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,530
these innocent girls.

227
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,370
I don’t care about that name.

228
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,590
Cut it out.

229
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,360
If Yan Xun is out,

230
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,430
just kill

231
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,310
all his slaves.

232
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,440
No more talking.

233
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,260
Get the wolves out!

234
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,350
Get the wolves out! Get the wolves out!

235
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,110
We’d better wait.

236
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,820
Yuwen Yue hasn’t come yet.

237
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,510
Maybe Yuwen Yue

238
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,680
is enjoying himself with some girl.

239
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,540
= Qingshan House =

240
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,900
= The heir of the First Branch in Yuwen family,
Yuwen Yue =

241
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,550
You’re back, Young Master.

242
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,410
It’s nearly dawn.

243
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,520
I’ve been waiting for you.

244
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,130
I know you’re afraid of coldness.

245
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,290
I’ve warmed the bed

246
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,940
for you.

247
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,540
Life is short.

248
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,450
Are you sure you’ll still sit there?

249
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,840
Why are you looking at me like that?

250
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,930
It embarrasses me.

251
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,270
If the person who sent you here

252
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,010
sees your performance,

253
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,340
he’ll be very disappointed.

254
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,130
What are you talking about?

255
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,820
I don’t understand a word of it.

256
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,230
What do you know then?

257
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,570
I know quite a lot.

258
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,930
Why don’t I show you?

259
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,710
I’m a girl.

260
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,680
Please be active, Young Master.

261
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,210
If I’m active,

262
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,330
there will be no room for you to show.

263
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,430
I’ll show you then.

264
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,310
When did you see through me?

265
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,150
As soon as you came.

266
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,070
What did I do

267
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,430
made you see through me?

268
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,010
Everything you did

269
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,960
from the very beginning.

270
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,530
Why didn’t you call me out?

271
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,050
I get assassinated and poisoned a lot.

272
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,660
But a honey trap is the very first time.

273
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,900
As ever,

274
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,670
it’s nothing special.

275
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,550
Come back!

276
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:13,660
Young Master.

277
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,990
I’ve applied poison

278
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,410
in the incense burner.

279
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,400
Don’t you want the antidote?

280
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,530
It’s you who are poisoned.

281
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,410
Looks like Yuwen Huai will be disappointed again.

282
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,080
Yueqi, get me a horse.

283
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,250
Aye.

284
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:43,770
Get the wolves out!

285
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:01,570
Xiaoliu.

286
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,720
Run that way!

287
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,570
- Run!
- Run!

288
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,320
Run!

289
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,500
= Yue =

290
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,180
Are they gonna hunt us

291
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,930
like beasts?

292
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,870
But we... We are human!

293
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,090
How can I...

294
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,650
Yuwen Huai, you!

295
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,610
Shooting girls is easier than shooting wolves.

296
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,750
To win the game,

297
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,140
you need to shoot the slaves first.

298
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:58,960
Why don’t we

299
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,250
kill Yuwen Yue’s slaves

300
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,020
first?

301
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,480
He’s too late.

302
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,190
Run!

303
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,680
Yan Xun, save them!

304
00:19:58,990 --> 00:19:59,710
Hurry!

305
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:29,690
Yan Xun!

306
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,370
Go.

307
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,260
Prince Yan. You’re a good archer.

308
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,600
Let’s compare

309
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,510
to see if you can shoot wolves faster

310
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,800
than I shoot slaves.

311
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,000
Hide away!

312
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,810
Prince Yan.

313
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,740
This girl is quite interesting.

314
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,540
= Yue =

315
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,410
Prince Yan.

316
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,220
What are you doing?

317
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,650
Don’t you want the fine wine?

318
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,300
I’m not interested in the wine,

319
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,830
but I want this girl.

320
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,640
No one dares to hurt her.

321
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:22,870
Let’s see how long she can live.

322
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,930
A natural born warrior.

323
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,500
She’s good.

324
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,970
Guys, get on the horses!

325
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,390
Hurry!

326
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,660
Get up!

327
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:34,870
Hurry!

328
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,820
Hurry! Run to the dune!

329
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:43,910
Hurry!

330
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,580
Hurry!

331
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,530
Go!

332
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:51,500
= Yue =

333
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,860
OK. You hear the signal.

334
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:05,970
The game is over.

335
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,780
No one shall shoot.

336
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:11,900
= Yue =

337
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,000
Xiaoliu, I can’t run anymore.

338
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,180
We can’t stop.

339
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,620
They won’t keep us alive.

340
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,430
Hurry. Keep running!

341
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,240
Hurry up!

342
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,470
Xiaoliu.

343
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:37,150
I’m so tired.

344
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,470
Curly!

345
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,300
Thank you, Xiaoliu.

346
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,560
Yuwen Huai.

347
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,170
So many people died.

348
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,060
Is this your so-called

349
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:24,970
game?

350
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,180
This is so fun.

351
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,680
Yuwen Yue doesn’t come,

352
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,740
yet his slave survives

353
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,140
to the end.

354
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,790
She’s guilty! She must die!

355
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,720
Huai.

356
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,490
Even you miss sometimes.

357
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,720
It’s all over.

358
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,360
It’ll be up to your fate.

359
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,210
She can survive from this.

360
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,770
What a miracle.

361
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,230
Huai.

362
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,040
Such a good maid

363
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,190
is used as a prey.

364
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,300
Looks like your Hongshan House

365
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,540
is full of talents.

366
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,390
That’s nonsense.

367
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,610
I think he just made a mistake.

368
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,790
He gives such a clever girl

369
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,870
to someone else.

370
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,340
Now she belongs to Yuwen Yue.

371
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,300
It’s just as the saying goes,

372
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,900
go for wool and come home shorn.

373
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,040
Zhao Xifeng.

374
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,140
Shut up.

375
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,550
Watch your mouth.

376
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,890
Are you pissed off?

377
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,680
Since she makes it,

378
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,260
pardon her as we promised

379
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:51,570
before.

380
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,310
She’s a guilty maid.

381
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,400
How can I pardon her?

382
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,400
You even dared to cheat

383
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,500
in public.

384
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,490
Giving back on your words

385
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,030
is understandable.

386
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,070
Alright.

387
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,840
I, as the Prince of Western Wei,

388
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,620
hereby

389
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,860
pardon her.

390
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,710
Are you leaving now?

391
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,700
We may leave as well.

392
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,650
Clear up the bodies.

393
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:41,690
- Aye.
- Aye.

394
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,600
Go!

395
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,050
- Go!
- Go!

396
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,080
Move!

397
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,660
Don’t touch me!

398
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,760
Yuwen Yue is indeed good.

399
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,300
Lass, what’s your name?

400
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:20,880
Until one day

401
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,400
I don’t have to look up to you,

402
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,380
I will tell you my name.

403
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,580
- Move!
- Move!

404
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:30,470
You are

405
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,910
the most bad-tempered maid I’ve ever met.

406
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,390
Prince Yan Xun.

407
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:36,420
Take her back carefully.

408
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,760
Don’t you dare to hurt her!

409
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:38,930
Aye.

410
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,390
You stinking girl.

411
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,570
You made Young Master Huai unhappy.

412
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,610
You’re doomed.

413
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:56,780
= Yuwen Yue’s Mansion =

414
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,220
Butler Zhu.

415
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,650
It’s so late.

416
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,660
What do you meet me for?

417
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,630
This girl is quite something,

418
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,380
the only survivor in the hunting game.

419
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,780
= Yue =

420
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,890
She isn’t a maid in our family.

421
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,970
Just because of her,

422
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:26,790
Young Master Huai lost his bet.

423
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,080
He was very unhappy.

424
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,260
Xiaoliu.

425
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,710
Listen.

426
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,020
Take her to the woodshed.

427
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,830
Take good care of her.

428
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,310
How good should I be to her?

429
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,440
Like this?

430
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,410
No. That’s too easy for her.

431
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,010
Listen to me.

432
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,380
You’ll torture her hard.

433
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,110
Let her suffer

434
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,580
and wish she could die.

435
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,390
Got it?

436
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,350
Loud and clear.

437
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,690
What kind of world is this?

438
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,370
Those nobles

439
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,320
are even scarier than beasts.

440
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:46,540
People’s lives are lower than anything else.

441
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:50,430
I will make you pay

442
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,220
for the blood.

443
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,070
Xiaoliu, it’s me,

444
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,300
your brother, Linxi.

445
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,400
Don’t you recognize me?

446
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,480
Xiaoliu.

447
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,090
It’s me, your fifth brother, Linxi.

448
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:20,540
My brother, Linxi?

449
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,510
You’ve left home for years.

450
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,670
Don’t you remember us?

451
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,010
Here.

452
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,850
How did you get hurt so badly?

453
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:35,230
Here.

454
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,280
Here. Slowly.

455
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,450
Slowly.

456
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,860
How did you survive

457
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,770
from the hunting ground?

458
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,840
That’s such a dangerous place.

459
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,130
It’s said there were 30 slaves.

460
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,680
Only you made it.

461
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,130
Where are your injuries?

462
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,950
Come on. Let me see.

463
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,210
I’m fine.

464
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:05,780
Xiaoliu. You’ve suffered so much.

465
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,680
I’m sorry.

466
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,340
I couldn’t protect you.

467
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,350
Don’t blame yourself.

468
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,990
It’s not your fault.

469
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,170
You must be starving.

470
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,770
Look what I have brought you.

471
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,480
Eat now.

472
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,260
I’m not hungry.

473
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,380
You must eat.

474
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,730
You almost died and got badly injured.

475
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:41,310
You’ll die if you don’t eat.

476
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,430
I don’t want to eat.

477
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:47,890
Here. Xiaoliu. Have some meat.

478
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,290
You love meat.

479
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:50,640
Here.

480
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,300
Here. Eat some.

481
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:59,440
I... I don’t like the fat.

482
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,120
Will you eat now?

483
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,920
Hurry. Eat some.

484
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:30,680
Here.

485
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,320
Eat.

486
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:54,930
Is it tasty?

487
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,440
Yes.

488
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,010
That’s good.

489
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:01,820
Seeing you eat, I’m even happier

490
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,390
than eating it myself.

491
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,780
It’s really good.

492
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,350
This piece of roast pork

493
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,930
is the best thing I’ve ever eaten

494
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,650
in my life.

495
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:20,260
You silly girl. You’re so young.

496
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:22,200
There’s still a long future ahead.

497
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:25,750
When we were at home back then,

498
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,050
roast pork was your favorite.

499
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,220
You used to give me the fat.

500
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,530
But, Xiaoliu,

501
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,790
don’t worry.

502
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,300
I promise I’ll feed

503
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,090
and clothe you well someday.

504
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,710
No one can bully us again.

505
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,280
Do you believe me?

506
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:48,280
Yes, Linxi.

507
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,680
Listen. Eat them up.

508
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,620
Eat them all up.

509
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,930
Now I’m the personal attendant

510
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:59,570
of Young Master Yuwen Yue in Qingshan House.

511
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:00,590
I’m already an middle-rank servant

512
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,350
wearing Copper Bell.

513
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,870
Your sister, Zhixiang, and Xiaoba

514
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,440
are in the mansion as well.

515
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,450
How are they?

516
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:09,910
They are both well.

517
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,700
Zhixiang and Xiaoba

518
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,860
will look after you.

519
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,340
I’m gonna get you some medicine.

520
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:22,790
Linxi.

521
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,320
How is Xiaoliu?

522
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,670
She’s badly injured.

523
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,680
Zhixiang.

524
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,310
There are tons of medicines in Yuwen’s Mansion.

525
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,820
Some can cure and others can kill.

526
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:33,960
How should the servants like us

527
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,510
get the medicine?

528
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:37,150
You’re just promoted to be the personal attendant

529
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,240
of Young Master Yue.

530
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,740
But Yuwen Yue is cold.

531
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:42,140
You can’t ask him for it directly.

532
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,340
I heard from Zhu Shun

533
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,510
and Ms. Song that

534
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,110
they’d torture Xiaoliu.

535
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,200
It concerns her life.

536
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,720
What should we do?

537
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,010
Butler Zhu in Yuwen’s Mansion

538
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,490
is fully in charge of the mansion.

539
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,590
Now Xiaoliu is targeted by him.

540
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:57,700
She’s in great danger.

541
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,640
I’ll figure a way out.

542
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,430
Zhixiang.

543
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,740
Don’t worry about me.

544
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,760
Xiaoliu’s injuries are the priority.

545
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,410
I’m going first.

546
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,630
Impressive!

547
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:17,990
You’re impressive, too.

548
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,490
You didn’t miss any in the hunting game.

549
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,770
You’re not fooling around anymore, are you?

550
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,540
Well.

551
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,390
I’m fooling around,

552
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,240
but I’ve got some skills.

553
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,630
Arrow shooting and riding horse

554
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,020
are the basics.

555
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:33,770
I was born

556
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:35,220
in a rich and noble family after all.

557
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,190
I need to be a talent.

558
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:38,800
Otherwise, how can I

559
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,020
live freely

560
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:40,840
in Chang’an city

561
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,230
which is full of talents?

562
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,260
Hold on.

563
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,120
You didn’t go to the hunting ground.

564
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,910
How did you know so much?

565
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,610
Seriously,

566
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:51,150
I believe you’ve known

567
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:53,010
Princess Chun will hold a birthday party for me.

568
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,140
All that fuss.

569
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,640
Please help me

570
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,680
stop her.

571
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,150
Why should I help you?

572
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,130
Because you’re good at

573
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,750
those infightings

574
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,310
and scheming, aren’t you?

575
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,530
I’m so pure

576
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,000
and broad-minded.

577
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:10,700
How can I

578
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,880
do such things?

579
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:13,840
But I have to rely on you

580
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:17,050
for the birthday party.

581
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:23,900
Your mother is

582
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,700
the Empress Dowager’s favorite adopted daughter.

583
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,020
Your father

584
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,120
is the sworn brother of the Emperor.

585
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,240
You’re a hostage, but you’re favored by them.

586
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,010
Holding a party for you

587
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:34,540
is nothing big.

588
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,910
I just don’t want Chun

589
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:39,280
to hold the birthday party for me.

590
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,140
She’s clever and sparky.

591
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:43,440
I always see her

592
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,460
as my younger sister.

593
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,390
But she always clings to me.

594
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,150
As your wish.

595
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,990
We’ll hold the party at our mansion.

596
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,490
I’ll be the host.

597
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:55,990
Invite all the dandies like you

598
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,260
from the noble family.

599
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,470
With more people here,

600
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,010
the misunderstanding can be avoided.

601
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,910
That’s more like it.

602
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:05,580
By the way,

603
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:08,370
I’ll give this back to you.

604
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:09,980
Don’t say

605
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,520
I owe you one in the future.

606
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:14,950
Tell me.

607
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:16,290
Why did you save that girl?

608
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,050
That’s not like you.

609
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:22,050
Just speak your mind.

610
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:23,550
Yuwen Yue.

611
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,680
There’s something wrong with you.

612
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,370
You have a crush on her?

613
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,510
She’s just a maid.

614
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:35,730
A maid?

615
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:37,240
Give her to me then.

616
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,160
That girl is really something.

617
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,040
She’s got sharp eyes and claws,

618
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,550
like an wild cat in our steppe

619
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:45,390
of Yanbei.

620
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,090
She even fought against wolves.

621
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:49,230
If you like her,

622
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,470
then take her.

623
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:54,870
If you like her,

624
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:56,270
then take her.

625
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,050
I may really take her away.
