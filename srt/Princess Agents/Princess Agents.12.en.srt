There are laws

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,150
in Chang’an!

19
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,980
Laws?

20
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,410
Fugitive slaves should be killed.

21
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,040
Laws?

22
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,870
Yield to us, will you?

00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,020
If you don’t,

24
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,670
you’ll be disfigured.

25
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,020
Let go of me!

26
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,310
Bitch, you ask for it!

27
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,880
I’ll kill you.

Hurry.

31
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:16,650
Go.

32
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,920
- Go.
- Xiaoliu.

33
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,150
Xiaoba, how are you?

34
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,310
Xiaoba, are you alright?

35
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,940
My face...

36
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,340
My face...

37
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,650
I’m disfigured!

38
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,310
Screwed. I’m disfigured.

39
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,360
Mirror. Give it to me.

40
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,180
Xiaoba. Xiaoba.

41
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,260
- Where is the mirror?
- Calm down, Xiaoba.

42
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,050
Mirror!

43
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,130
Xiaoba, calm down.

44
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,230
But I’m disfigured.

45
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,560
Appearance is the future of a woman.

46
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,510
Now I’ve lost my future.

47
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,940
Young Master Yue.

48
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,390
He has the panacea.

49
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,250
It works well.

50
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,260
Let’s...

51
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,540
Let’s go back to him.

52
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,880
Let’s go back and ask for the panacea.

53
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,280
- All right?
- Xiaoba.

54
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,540
We escaped after all the trouble.

55
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,640
But I’m disfigured!

56
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,110
I’m disfigured!

57
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,560
When a woman is disfigured,

58
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,820
what future can she have?

59
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,650
Warlords of Wei are hunting fugitive slaves.

60
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,100
I’m holding a faked

61
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,030
slave-releasing certificate.

62
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,360
Once caught,

63
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,980
we’ll all die.

64
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,860
Xiaoliu, you won’t leave me alone.

65
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,400
Xiaoba.

66
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,650
- Will you?
- Xiaoba, calm down.

67
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,250
Xiaoliu.

68
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:18,830
Xiaoba.

69
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:19,860
- We...
- Xiaoliu.

70
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,320
Let’s go back to Yuwen Mansion.

71
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,210
But Xiaoliu...

72
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:24,900
All right.

73
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,230
People are hunting fugitive slaves.

74
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:28,660
Once caught,

75
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,900
we’ll die.

76
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,580
Let’s go back to Qingshan House.

77
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,050
I’ll take the blame, whatever happens.

78
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,220
At least,

79
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,130
I can keep you alive.

80
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:39,370
Okay.

81
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,800
Young Master Yue will defend you.

82
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,090
Right, Xiaoliu?

83
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,710
It’s okay, Xiaoba.

84
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,740
It’s okay.

85
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,460
Hurry.

86
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,240
Hurry up. Hurry.

87
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,150
Be faster.

88
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,060
Do it quickly.

89
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,070
When the day breaks,

90
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,960
the whole truth

91
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,160
will be exposed.

92
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,130
Doomed.

93
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,650
We’re losing

94
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,520
our last hope.

95
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,610
What should we do then?

96
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,080
Don’t panic.

97
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,740
Let’s go back to Qingshan House

98
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,140
before we think of a way.

99
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,030
You must remember.

100
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,580
Shift all responsibilities to me.

101
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,440
Go. Go.

102
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,330
Go.

103
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,440
It’s weird.

104
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,720
The door isn’t locked.

105
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:44,600
Go.

106
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,550
Xing’er.

107
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,510
Aluo, it’s so late.

108
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,690
Why haven’t you slept yet?

109
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,050
How could I fall asleep?

110
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,190
Where have you been?

111
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:05,730
I’ve been waiting for you

112
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,020
the whole night.

113
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,710
My horse was startled. I just came back.

114
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,200
Where is Young Master Yue?

115
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,140
It’s so late.

116
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,440
Why haven’t you locked the door yet?

117
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,200
You are

118
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,270
lucky enough.

119
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,000
Young Master Yue

120
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,280
has been reading the whole night.

121
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,850
He doesn’t ask us to lock the door

122
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:23,850
or go to bed.

123
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:24,660
Then...

124
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,040
I dare to wait for you here.

125
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,740
Thank you.

126
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,370
Oh,

127
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,860
when Young Master came back,

128
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,900
he didn’t look happy.

129
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,690
If you have something to tell him,

130
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,130
do it tomorrow.

131
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,600
Okay.

132
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,420
Thank you.

133
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,800
Get to sleep.

134
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:40,790
See you.

135
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,390
Xiaoliu.

136
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,940
Young Master Yue is fathomless.

137
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,710
If he knows

138
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,630
we escaped secretly,

139
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,950
he will kill you.

140
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,970
Why don’t you hide yourself?

141
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,880
You also know he’s fathomless.

142
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,510
Can I hide myself

143
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,650
just because I want?

144
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,750
What should you do then?

145
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,450
Don’t bother. Go back to your room.

146
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,450
Use the remaining panacea

147
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,280
for the moment.

148
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,680
I’m going to see Young Master.

149
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,540
But you...

150
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,220
Don’t worry about me.

151
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,270
Take care of Xiaoba.

152
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,580

00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,470
Young Master, you couldn’t fall asleep, too?

176
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,160
Come with me.

177
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,980
Hurry up.

178
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,970
Hurry. Hurry.

179
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,360
Hurry.

180
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,220
Have you made up the lie

181
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,420
to cheat me?

182
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,870
I don’t dare to lie.

183
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,390
You’ve made progress.

184
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,780
Thanks for your instruction.

185
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,180
Don’t say that.

186
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,960
I never taught you to do double-faced behavior

187
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,640
or talk insincerely.

188
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,250
I didn’t.

189
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,460
Young Master, what do you mean?

190
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,350
Fine.

191
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,870
Tell me

192
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:26,610
what happened later

193
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,010
in the lantern show.

194
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,240
Explain honestly and slowly.

195
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,830
I was lost in the lantern show

196
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,230
and failed to find you.

197
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,810
Later, someone I didn’t know

198
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:42,720
hunted me.

199
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,910
Luckily, His Excellency Yan Xun helped me.

200
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,780
Then,

201
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,670
I met Wei Shuyou killing fugitive slaves.

202
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,510
I was held up.

203
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,210
Repeat it from the beginning.

204
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,460
I was lost in the lantern show

205
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,130
and failed to find you.

206
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,600
Later, someone I didn’t know

207
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,810
hunted me.

208
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,570
Luckily, His Excellency Yan Xun helped me.

209
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,620
Then,

210
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,700
I met Wei Shuyou killing fugitive slaves.

211
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,050
I was held up.

212
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,250
Hurry.

213
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,070
Be faster, all of you.

214
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,850
Such is a repetitious talk.

215
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,270
How many times do you still want to hear?

216
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,620
I don’t want to hear such words.

217
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,320
What do I want to hear?

218
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,230
Think about it yourself.

219
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,730
Young Master, the day is almost breaking.

220
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,230
Time to sleep.

221
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:37,760
I’ll...

222
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,160
I’ll go back and think about it.

223
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,230
I’ll think about it carefully.

224
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,000
When I figure it out,

225
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,390
I’ll reply to you tomorrow.

226
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,070
Sleepy?

227
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,300
Fine.

228
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,550
Burn the incense to cheer yourself up.

229
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,800
Aye.

230
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,730
Why don’t you use the rat poison now?

231
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,230
Young Master, you must be kidding.

232
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,960
Rat poison is used out of the rooms

233
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,990
to poison rats.

234
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,660
Why would I use it in the incense?

235
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,470
But you used it at the tea party,

236
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:31,800
didn’t you?

237
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,500
Why can’t you use it again?

238
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,210
All right.

239
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,460
Go get me some hot wine.

240
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,940
Young Master, it’s the Cold Food Festival.

241
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,090
Based on the custom, we can have only cold food.

242
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,210
We can’t have hot food.

243
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,220
Why don’t you enjoy the cold wine?

244
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,290
When I ask for hot wine, just do it.

245
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:30,990
Aye.

246
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,450
When cock crows

247
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,190
in two hours,

248
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,230
the Cold Food Festival is over.

249
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,550
We’ll use the new fire bestowed by His Majesty

250
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,750
to cook hot food.

251
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,490
When the fire is sent to the Pleasure Pavilion,

252
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,230
I guess Yuwen Huai will also

253
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,120
enjoy some hot wine.

254
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,510
Young Master, don’t drink it.

255
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,230
Why can’t I?

256
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,360
Xing’er.

257
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,450
What are you nervous at?

258
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,000
Young Master, you want hot water
on the Cold Food Festival.

259
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,730
I’m nervous about your health.

260
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,050
Are you? You’re nervous for me?

261
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,100
Sure.

262
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,870
Your eyes

263
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,940
look innocent and bright.

264
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,180
Seems like you have nothing to hide

265
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,330
and you never lie.

266
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,070
I’m curious.

267
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,180
Is your heart

268
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,960
as clean as your eyes?

269
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,830
I don’t know

270
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,290
what you mean.

271
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,130
But compared to

272
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,340
most people in this place,

273
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,760
my heart

274
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,520
is much cleaner.

275
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,140
Is it?

276
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,860
See?

277
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,850
I’m still alive.

278
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,150
Do you think you can kill Yuwen Huai

279
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,870
with such a little trick?

280
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,220
Our family

281
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,390
is the origin of all spies.

282
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,390
Recognizing different kinds of poison

283
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,810
is the basic skill.

284
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,590
You want to use such a poor trick

285
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,110
on us.

286
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,700
You’ve wasted

287
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,800
what I taught you.

288
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,840
When the rat poison is burnt,

289
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,530
it’ll be strengthened.

290
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,620
But it’s still not enough to kill people.

291
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,070
The man can’t die,

292
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,550
unless he has some hot wine

293
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,390
at the same time.

294
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,620
Using the custom of the Cold Food Festival,

295
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,510
you can make the poison come into effect

296
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,450
after the day breaks.

297
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,770
It is long enough

298
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,050
for your sisters

299
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,120
to leave Chang’an.

300
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,420
Time matters so important

301
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,600
for your plan.

302
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:34,930
That’s why

303
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,570
you look at the sandglass frequently.

304
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,250
Young Master.

305
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,570
That was just

306
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,850
your conjecture.

307
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:44,960
It’s not true.

308
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,540
My sisters

309
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,780
are still here.

310
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,120
That’s because

311
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,970
some accident happened

312
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,270
and your sisters had to

313
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,810
come back.

314
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,150
But you know what?

315
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,850
Even without those men,

316
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,120
your sisters couldn’t run away, either.

317
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,350
Now,

318
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,790
will you tell the truth?

319
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,040
I was telling the truth.

320
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,760
Young Master, what else would you like to know?

321
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,570
What do you think

322
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,540
you should say

323
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,810
to protect you

324
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,550
and your sisters?

325
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,300
You know everything,

326
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,500
don’t you?

327
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,530
I don’t.

328
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,910
For example, I don’t know who you are.

329
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,700
I am

330
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,780
an ordinary maid.

331
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,290
All my families have been dead,

332
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,600
except my two sisters.

333
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,770
With your help,

334
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,170
I manage to stay here.

335
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,830
An ordinary maid?

336
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,110
You can imitate my handwriting

337
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,830
and you have fathomless inner force.

338
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,960
You think you’re an ordinary maid?

339
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,480
Since you already know,

340
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,410
I don’t need to hide it from you.

341
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,840
I do want to kill Yuwen Huai,

342
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,430
because I know

343
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,780
he’s the real murderer

344
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,180
who killed Linxi.

345
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,300
He should pay with his life.

346
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,590
He deserves it.

347
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,340
You saw it

348
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,820
when I killed Linxi.

349
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,880
Don’t you ever want to

350
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,490
take revenge on me?

351
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,030
Now,

352
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,630
even if I tell you I don’t,

353
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,580
you won’t believe me.

354
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,380
But later,

355
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,650
I found out the real murder.

356
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,270
There’s a cause for hatred.

357
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,820
I’m a person with a conscience.

358
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,540
Even if I want to take revenge,

359
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,200
I’ll find the chief criminal.

360
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,420
I don’t kill innocent people.

361
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,760
You don’t kill innocent people?

362
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,670
Ms. Song was dead

363
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,400
in the Forbidden Lake.

364
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:56,800
There must be a reason for her death,

365
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,890
isn’t there?

366
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,040
I didn’t kill her.

367
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,010
She fell accidentally into the lake

368
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,320
and drowned herself.

369
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,730
It had nothing to do with me.

370
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:07,910
Young Master.

371
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,310
Yuwen Huai killed your grandpa.

372
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,270
Don’t you ever want to

373
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,600
avenge him?

374
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,300
You and I

375
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,630
have the same enemy.

376
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,760
Why don’t you let me

377
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,700
help you?

378
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,600
Help me?

379
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,060
You train me,

380
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,290
just because you want me to help you

381
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,660
and work for you,

382
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,540
don’t you?

383
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,400
You and Yuwen Huai

384
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,830
are fatal enemies.

385
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,220
I’ve been doing everything

386
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,660
for your own good, too.

387
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,150
You’re finding an excuse.

388
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,730
I’m not, Young Master.

389
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,110
Yuwen Huai killed Linxi and Zhixiang

390
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,210
and I hate him.

391
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,440
How can I live a life

392
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,250
when he’s still alive?

393
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,780
I used to be an ordinary maid.

394
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,760
But Young Master,

395
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,400
you know

396
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,850
I want to take revenge,

397
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,790
but you still teach me martial arts

398
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,080
and other skills.

399
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,850
Aren’t you encouraging me

400
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,270
to take revenge?

401
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,540
You mean

402
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,820
I’m doing the wrong thing?

403
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:17,870
No.

404
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:21,270
You keep me and teach me.

405
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,050
You’re my savior.

406
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,640
Seriously?

407
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,610
I’m saying it

408
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,250
with my true heart.

409
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,930
When the day breaks,

410
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,430
the dead body will be brought out

411
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,870
from the Forbidden Lake.

412
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,780
Even I can’t defend you.

413
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,650
Young Master, to be honest,

414
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,210
since I came here,

415
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,530
I’ve never done anything

416
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,200
to hurt you.

417
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,220
I’m loyal to you

418
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,500
and I swear to God.

419
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,300
I don’t think

420
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,540
you want to lose me, either.

421
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,290
As long as you want to help me,

422
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,880
you will succeed,

423
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,560
considering how smart you are.

424
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,140
= Yue =

425
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,070
Leave me.

426
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:52,670
Aye.

427
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,960
Wait.

428
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,200
Why are you sure

429
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,360
Yuwen Huai killed

430
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,160
your brother Linxi?

431
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,140
Because that day,

432
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,130
Jinzhu told me.

433
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,440
She told me that

434
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,860
she caused the death of Linxi.

435
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,910
Jinzhu worked for Yuwen Huai.

436
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,650
Haven’t you ever suspected that

437
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,050
I framed them up?

438
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,280
No.

439
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,060
Because I believe

440
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,370
you’re a good man

441
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:36,910
and you’ll do nothing like that.

442
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,010
Xiaoliu.

443
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,680
Xiaoliu, how was it going?

444
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,510
Will we be all right?

445
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,290
We will, I guess.

446
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,910
Miss Xing’er.

447
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,110
It’s been a while.

448
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,570
Go with me.

449
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,650
Zhu Siliu.

450
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,460
This is Qingshan House.

451
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,280
Young Master Yue

452
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,550
is in his room.

453
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,240
If you want to take us away,

454
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,200
you should at least

455
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:49,890
tell him, huh?

456
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:50,690
Bitch.

457
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:51,940
Stop pretending.

458
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:55,270
You...

459
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,810
- Xiaoliu.
- Xiaoliu.

460
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,880
Xiaoliu, I don’t want to go.

461
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,930
Don’t worry. We’ll be all right.

462
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,700
Don’t worry. You’ll be all right.

463
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,720
Let’s go.

464
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:10,240
Take them away.

465
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:10,780
Go.

466
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:11,790
Go.

467
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:12,990
Go.

468
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,050
Young Master.

469
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,030
Zhu Shun came and said

470
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,170
Xing’er killed Ms. Song

471
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,350
and left her body in the Forbidden Lake.

472
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,070
She’s taken away for the interrogation.

473
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:27,940
Go handle it.

474
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,640
Aye.

475
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,800
Wait.

476
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:35,960
Throw it away.

477
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,240
Aye.

478
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,100
Come back.

479
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,450
Clean it and give it back to me.

480
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:47,930
Can’t you understand?

481
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,950
Not really.

482
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,560
But I’m going right away.

483
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,150
You, go check over there.

484
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,230
Aye.

485
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,200
Go inside.

486
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,430
Have you checked over there?

487
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,720
Over there. Over there.

488
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:22,960
That part.

489
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,870
The back part.

490
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,280
Find anything?

491
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,990
Check over there. There.

492
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,790
No one is looking here.

493
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,950
Somebody, come.

494
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,560
Look carefully.

495
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,340
Over there. Over there.

496
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,310
Go over there.

497
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,670
Keep looking. What are you doing?

498
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,520
Young Master.

499
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,300
Young Master.

500
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:56,010
What have you got?

501
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,550
The lake is dried.

502
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,080
We’re looking for the dead body.

503
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,460
Young Master, I’ve picked a female cook

504
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,540
as the witness.

505
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,490
With the witness and evidence,

506
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,440
Xing’er can’t get away with it.

507
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,380
Well done.

508
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,180
Young Master.

509
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,370
Sir.

510
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,620
Here is a dead body.

511
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:20,790
Where?

512
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,190
Get it out. Get it out.

513
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,780
Sir.

514
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,130
We found another two dead bodies.

515
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,750
Get them out.

516
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,460
Aye.

517
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,380
Hurry.

518
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,640
What do we do?

519
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,870
More dead bodies?

520
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,530
Get them out together.

521
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,850
Young... Young Master.

522
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:22,660
One of the three dead bodies

523
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,220
must be Ms. Song.

524
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,780
Xing’er.

525
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:29,920
Come and have a look.

526
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,730
This is a male.

527
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,500
= Xie =

528
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,110
There is a purse on him,

529
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,310
with a character Xie on it.

530
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,930
Xie must be his family name.

531
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,560
Sir, we found a medical kit,

532
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,240
with Xie on it.

533
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,270
There was a knife wound on him.

534
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,870
He must have been killed.

535
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,550
Weird, Young Master Huai.

536
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,400
Physician Xie disappeared

537
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,960
after he checked on Young Master Yue

538
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,670
that day.

539
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,620
Now I finally know why.

540
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,970
He was killed?

541
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,660
The other day,

542
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,080
Physician Xie checked on my cousin.

543
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,450
But today, he’s found dead in the lake.

544
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,330
If people know about it,

545
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,220
your master will be humiliated.

546
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:07,110
Yes. So, we need a thorough investigation.

547
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,820
Yes.

548
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,390
Here is one dead body.

549
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,510
There are two.

550
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,820
We must find the murderers.

551
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:17,760
Don’t you think so, Xing’er?

552
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,980
Yes. Yes. Yes.

553
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,230
You’re right, Young Master.

554
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,320
We must find out the truth.

555
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,970
If one of these dead bodies

556
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,370
is Ms. Song,

557
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:27,990
Xing’er,

558
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,190
you can’t get away with it.

559
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,050
Your sisters will

560
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,690
die with you, too.

561
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,170
Do what you should do.

562
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,160
I’m confident I didn’t kill anyone.

563
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,820
Young Master, this must be Ms. Song.

564
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,860
I’m sure.

565
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,780
She has Ms. Song’s figure.

566
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,690
She must be Ms. Song.

567
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:10,820
She’s in a dress of Iron Bell.

568
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,270
How can she be Ms. Song?

569
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:14,700
Young Master,

570
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,520
can you be so impatient

571
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,770
to convict me, huh?

572
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,720
Stop arguing fallaciously.

573
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,040
Somebody. Take her to the Guilty-slave Chamber.

574
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,560
Young Master, these two dead bodies

575
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,700
both wear the dress for

576
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,370
Iron Bell.

577
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,700
And their bells

578
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,530
are with them.

579
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:35,280
They must be

580
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,010
Iron Bell maids.

581
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,830
There were two maids in Garden House

582
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,060
as close as real sisters.

583
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,650
One of them was picked to

584
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,900
the Pleasure Pavilion.

585
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:55,240
They cried the whole night

586
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,200
and then they went missing next morning.

587
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,160
We had thought

588
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,180
they both went to Pleasure Pavilion.

589
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:04,590
It turns out they killed themselves.

590
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,490
Why are you crying?

591
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,280
What makes you cry?

592
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,110
Only two useless maids are dead,

593
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,800
aren’t they?

594
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,910
Stop crying.

595
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,100
Butler Zhu.

596
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,640
Here is

597
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,450
Physician Xie’s dead body.

598
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,760
He’s a clansman,

599
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,990
instead of a maid.

600
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,790
Shouldn’t we

601
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,350
ask a coroner to check

602
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,150
if he fell into the lake accidentally

603
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,500
or someone killed him.

604
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,830
You bitch.

605
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,770
How dare you suspect Young Master Huai!

606
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,360
I don’t dare to.

607
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,030
I was just inferring.

608
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,800
I haven’t ever

609
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,630
suspected anyone.

610
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,920
You’re a maid

611
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,290
Yuwen Yue has cultivated.

612
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,500
You turn to be a tough girl.

613
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,830
Young Master,

614
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,760
I’ll cut her for you.

615
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,260
Go. Go. Go, sir.

616
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,180
Yueqi.

617
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,490
If I cut her,

618
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,690
how do you think

619
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,620
Yuwen Yue will feel.

620
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,950
I don’t know

621
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:11,910
how Young Master Yue will feel.

622
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,650
But his character

623
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:14,320
is that

624
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,590
no one can guess

625
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,700
how he feels.

626
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,210
Butler Zhu.

627
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,030
People care for his master before hitting anyone.

628
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,380
If you want to cut her

629
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,680
without evidence,

630
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,390
Young Master Yue won’t agree.

631
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,160
Even I won’t let you do that.

632
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,170
I’ve got a witness.

633
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,550
Somebody.

634
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,180
Bring us the female cook.

635
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:05,910
Come over.

636
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,580
Look. Look at her again.

637
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,580
Did this girl

638
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,070
kill Ms. Song?

639
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,140
Yes.

640
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,800
She killed Ms. Song.

641
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,170
What happened that day?

642
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,320
That day,

643
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,230
I was walking from the kitchen

644
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,100
when I heard someone yelling.

645
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,440
I ran out to have a look.

646
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,400
Then I saw her

647
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,560
kill Ms. Song

648
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,850
and push her into the lake.

649
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,930
How could you talk nonsense?

650
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,440
Butler Zhu.

651
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,100
But we haven’t found

652
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,440
Ms. Song’s dead body.

653
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:38,310
It doesn’t matter.

654
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,170
She just said

655
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,440
she saw you kill Ms. Song

656
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,470
and push her into the lake.

657
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:44,720
Stop arguing.

658
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,570
What did you see?

659
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,620
I saw you

660
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,760
kill Ms. Song

661
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,970
and push her into the lake.

662
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:51,610
Did she push this one?

663
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,850
Yes. Yes.

664
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,620
Did she

665
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,740
push these two guys?

666
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,110
Yes. Yes. No. No.

667
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,330
No. No.

668
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,770
Idiot. Get out of here!

669
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:03,500
Yes.

670
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:03,840
Get out of here!

671
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,810
Xing’er, go.

672
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,880
Stop. You mustn’t go!

673
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:17,490
Young Master.

674
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,260
Go.

675
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,520
Why didn’t they

676
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,680
find Ms. Song’s body?

677
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:44,960
I don’t understand.

678
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,480
Maybe her body was taken away

679
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,770
before they searched the lake mud.

680
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,240
Young Master Yue?

681
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,950
Xiaoliu.

682
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,990
Young Master Yue did so much

683
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,520
to help you.

684
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,500
I think he likes you.

685
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,700
Otherwise, I don’t understand

686
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,790
why he did that.

687
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,370
What are you laughing at?

688
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,860
If he didn’t like you,

689
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,560
why would he

690
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,820
do so much for you?

691
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,190
What if he likes me?

692
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,710
What if he doesn’t?

693
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:18,090
Xiaoba, don’t forget.

694
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,220
He did help us.

695
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,010
But he’s still our enemy.

696
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,040
All I want

697
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,440
is to take you away from this place.

698
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,820
I don’t quite agree.

699
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,660
Xiaoliu.

700
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,580
Young Master Yue is a noble man.

701
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,730
If he likes you,

702
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,140
we’ll no longer be slaves.

703
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:35,970
Xiaoliu,

704
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,100
you may even marry him

705
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,870
and be a noble woman

706
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,590
with the glory and wealth.

707
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:41,550
Xiaoba, what are you talking about?

708
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,880
Don’t you remember

709
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,850
how Zhixiang and Linxi were killed?

710
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:44,530
People in the Yuwen family

711
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:45,520
are our enemies.

712
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,140
How will Xiaoliu like him?

713
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,220
She wouldn’t,

714
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,830
before she knew who she really was...

715
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,400
What do you mean?

716
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,230
I mean

717
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,390
we didn’t grow up together

718
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,050
and we weren’t close.

719
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:05,990
Forget it, Xiaoba.

720
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,280
Stop hiding it from her.

721
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,730
Xiaoqi.

722
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,300
Xiaoliu, in fact,

723
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,930
you’re not our real sister.

724
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,440
Jing is not your family name, either.

725
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,460
We don’t know your real family name.

726
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,900
We only know the wooden bead

727
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,640
has something to do with your real identity.

728
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,420
I see.

729
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,530
After so many years,

730
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,550
it’s hard to read the notes.

731
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:55,610
Xiaoliu.

732
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:56,940
We didn’t mean to

733
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,900
hide it from you.

734
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,950
Father and Mother died.

735
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,230
Linxi and Zhixiang died, too.

736
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,730
If you leave someday,

737
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,970
we’ll have no one to reply on.

738
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,790
Xiaoliu, we didn’t mean to

739
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,030
hide it from you.

740
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,670
Don’t leave us alone.

741
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,500
You’re the last families

742
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,690
I have in this world.

743
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:22,890
I will

744
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:23,520
try my best

745
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,640
to protect you.

746
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,550
Stop imagining things.

747
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,460
= Pleasure Pavilion =

748
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,680
Turned his trick to your own use?

749
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:45,340
What did you get?

750
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,520
If you did,

751
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,510
you would have succeeded.

752
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:54,600
In anger, you always try and fail.

753
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:56,170
I don’t.

754
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,060
What did you get from the lake mud?

755
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,780
Humiliation.

756
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,110
Yueqi and she echoed each other.

757
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:05,720
Why didn’t you understand?

758
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,590
You’re not smart at all.

759
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,770
What bad luck!

760
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:14,950
We put

761
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,230
all our hope

762
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,190
to develop the family business

763
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,720
on a mere son

764
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,350
born by a maid!

765
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:22,650
I think

766
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:25,280
the heaven is punishing me!

767
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,440
Let’s drink and sing, for life is short.

768
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,010
Forget it. Forget it.

769
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,970
It’s just my fate.

770
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:44,590
Leave me.

771
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,700
Zhu Shun bought me

772
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,510
a beautiful pederast

773
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,820
and will bring him to me tonight.

774
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,050
I wonder

775
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,000
if the new elixir

776
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,880
works as perfectly as they boasted.

777
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,590
Damn old guy.

778
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,710
Let’s wait and see.

779
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,730
Xing’er, here you are.

780
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,050
What’s this?

781
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,830
Young Master asked me to give you this.

782
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:51,780
Thank you.

783
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,700
I’m getting back to work.

784
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,590
Tea, please, Young Master.

785
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:04,040
If you want nothing else,

786
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,350
I’ll leave you alone.

787
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,310
Come over.

788
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,780
I did you such a big favor,

789
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,920
but you’re going to leave

790
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:27,580
even without saying thank you?

791
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:29,970
Thank you, Young Master.

792
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,160
That’s all?

793
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,770
Yueqi and his men

794
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,270
worked the whole night

795
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:36,510
in the Forbidden Lake.

796
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:40,450
I’ll say thank you to Yueqi, then.

797
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:41,990
Why?

798
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,720
Didn’t you say

799
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:45,220
he worked the whole night

800
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,470
in the Forbidden Lake?

801
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:47,320
He did me such a big favor.

802
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,480
I should say thank you to him.

803
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,080
Yeah. You’re right.

804
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,750
You should say thank you to him.

805
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,160
This Finger Blade

806
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,430
is a rare sharp weapon.

807
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:06,410
I had planned to

808
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:08,230
reward you with this.

809
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,030
Since you say so,

810
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,290
I’ll give it to Yueqi instead.

811
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,020
Take it to him.

812
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:18,030
Aye.

813
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,520
Young Master.

814
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:55,470
I just tried it on.

815
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:58,130
It has a customized size.

816
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,230
Oh, and it’s my size.

817
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:02,070
It’s too small for Yueqi.

818
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,160
So,

819
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,570
I’d like to say thank you.

820
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:08,500
I’ll deeply remember

821
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,820
how you have helped me.

822
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:11,790
