Yan Xun!

17
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,200
I’m not forcing you anymore!

18
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,570
Please don’t do this!

19
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,240
I’m not marrying you!

20
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,150
You can just go and tell my father

21
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,630
I’m not marrying you!

22
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,890
Go and apologize to my father!

23
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,780
Go and apologize to my father!

24
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,480
Yan Xun.

25
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,090
Please don’t be stupid!

26
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,210
In this case,

27
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,010
my father will really kill you!

28
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,610
Yan Xun!

29
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,350
Yan Xun.

30
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,150
You crazy guy!

31
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,710
How dare you rebel!

32
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:24,940
But I treated you as my brother

33
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,360
for so many years!

34
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,800
Brother, you get him wrong.

35
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,630
He isn’t rebelling!

36
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,920
He just wants to...

37
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,100
To present a protest to Father!

38
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,690
Chun.

39
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,540
He is no longer

40
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,260
the man

41
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,470
you used to know.

42
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,970
He is a traitor who rebels!

43
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,990
It’s not true, brother!

44
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,960
It’s not what you think!

45
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,420
He just doesn’t want to marry me!

46
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,780
He is taking revenge!

47
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:06,990
Taking...

48
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,770
Taking revenge?

49
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,730
Go ask him.

50
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,370
Yan Xun.

51
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,620
It’s not true, is it?

52
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,380
You are not taking revenge, are you?

53
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,730
You just want to reason things out
with my father,

54
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,790
right?

55
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,750
You just don’t want to marry me,

56
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,050
do you?

57
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,060
I’m going back to Yanbei.

58
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,360
It has nothing to do with you.

59
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,240
But when you get married with me,

60
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,660
my father will allow you

61
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,220
to go back to Yanbei.

62
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,030
Chun.

63
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,800
Your father arranged many soldiers

64
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,050
at the Imperial Ancestral Temple

65
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,670
to kill me!

66
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,750
So today, no matter I rebel or not,

67
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,600
our wedding will not

68
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,740
be continued!

69
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,880
Because he had never planned

70
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,930
to marry you to me.

71
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,150
And I had never planned to marry you.

72
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,840
You ungrateful bastard!

73
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,840
What are you talking about?

74
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,170
Emperor of Wei shows no mercy to Yanbei!

75
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,560
It’s not true.

76
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,350
It’s not true, Yan Xun.

77
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,340
It couldn’t be true.

78
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,230
How could it happen?

79
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,430
It’s not true.

80
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,330
It’s not true.

81
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,070
My father has treated you as his own son.

82
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,760
He has not only let you be Marquis Dingbei

83
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,010
but also has married you

84
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,020
his beloved daughter!

85
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,020
But how about you?

86
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,730
You betrayed our nation
and killed the civilians.

87
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,960
You should be killed
for your wolfish nature!

88
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,520
Blood on Jiuyou Platform
has not coagulated yet!

89
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,920
Skeletons on Xiuli Mountain
have not rotted yet!

90
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,700
My whole family has been wiped out.

91
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,970
Every one of my clan has been executed!

92
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,830
Yuan Song.

93
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,920
Your father killed my whole family

94
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,130
and slaughtered my people!

95
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,830
Is this the kindness you mean?

96
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,560
Marquis Dingbei rebelled.

97
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,250
It’s my father’s right
to fight him!

98
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,950
Shut up!

99
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,860
For the sake of our friendship,

100
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,470
I will let you go today.

101
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,740
Go and tell your father

102
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,460
I will certainly take revenge

103
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,790
for my whole family!

104
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,800
Tell him to be alive

105
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,200
and don’t die too early.

106
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,330
You can leave.

107
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,010
Achu.

108
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,730
You are also going to be my enemy?

109
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,870
I have never planned to be your enemy.

110
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,190
I never forget your kindness

111
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,200
for protecting me for three years.

112
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:48,530
Fine.

113
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,200
Go back with me.

114
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,230
I will intercede for you and protect you.

115
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,530
Don’t rebel with Yan Xun.

116
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,800
However,

117
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,490
I am going to fight

118
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,820
against the whole nation.

119
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,270
Yuan Song, I’m afraid

120
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,200
I can never repay what I owed you.

121
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,120
Very well!

122
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,090
I was quite blind.

123
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,780
Today,

124
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,170
I’m making a clean break with you two!

125
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,210
When we meet again,

126
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,210
we will not be friends

127
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,430
but enemies.

128
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,490
Chun!

129
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,870
Go with me!

130
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,340
Why is this happening?

131
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,870
Why is this happening?

132
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,590
Yan Xun.

133
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,390
I know it’s all my fault.

134
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,820
I know I have made mistakes.

135
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,010
I really couldn’t do anything at all

136
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,220
on Jiuyou Platform!

137
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,630
I failed to stay

138
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,260
with you!

139
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,230
Yan Xun, I’m begging you!

140
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,150
Please don’t rise in rebellion, okay?

141
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,480
I don’t want anything!

142
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,160
I don’t want anything at all!

143
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,800
I don’t want to marry you!

144
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,500
I just want you to be alive.

145
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,450
As long as you’re alive,

146
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,350
I won’t keep you around.

147
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,710
I just want

148
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,420
to see you alive!

149
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,950
I’m serious, Yan Xun.

150
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,110
Chun.

151
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,320
Yuan Chun!

152
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,830
You are a princess.

153
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,930
Yan Xun.

154
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,510
I’m begging you.

155
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,250
Please don’t do this.

156
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,620
Chun.

157
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,040
I have blood feud with your father.

158
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,910
Sorry, but I don’t want your love.

159
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,150
Yan Xun!

160
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,850
Yan Xun!

161
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,210
Don’t go!

162
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,170
Your Excellency.

163
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,670
Four major battalions have known it

164
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,950
and are assembling the troops.

165
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,550
Time is running out. Let’s go!

166
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,450
How about the others?

167
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,150
They are fighting with the imperial guards

168
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,460
at the East Gate.

169
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,310
They can hardly hold out.

170
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,960
Achu, get out of the city,

171
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,980
defend the floating bridge
for the river crossing.

172
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:01,990
How about you?

173
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,300
I will catch up soon.

174
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,490
Okay, I will wait for you.

175
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,540
Your Excellency.

176
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,560
Are we going to the East Gate now?

177
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,300
Don’t rush.

178
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,700
Yuwen Yue has guarded the imperial palace

179
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,950
so completely.

180
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,710
This nation has not been greatly injured.

181
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,030
We won this time,

182
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,400
only because we attacked them

183
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,490
by surprise.

184
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,450
A chance like this

185
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,210
will never come up again.

186
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,460
What do you mean, Your Excellency?

187
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,390
I am going to give Martial Arts School
a bloodbath

188
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,270
so that the Emperor of Wei
will have no generals

189
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,620
in the next ten years.

190
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,400
I’ll get sons of powerful families

191
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,050
to spill blood for return.

192
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,170
Young Master, where are we going?

193
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,430
I’m sure Yan Xun is going
to Martial Arts School.

194
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,290
He is going to kill

195
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,290
all the students there.

196
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,180
They are the foundation

197
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,710
to build our nation.

198
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,230
Yueqi.

199
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,230
This is the commander’s tally
given by His Majesty.

200
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:24,950
Take it

201
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,600
and get soldiers
from the nearest battalion.

202
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,380
Aye.

203
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:22,140
= Martial Arts School =

204
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,320
I just knew you would come here.

205
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,590
You are the only one
who could figure it out.

206
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,750
Do you hate this place so much

207
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,380
that you want to destroy it?

208
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,490
I don’t hate this place.

209
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,700
I just want to dig up the roots.

210
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,040
This is where we met

211
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,220
for the first time.

212
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:49,290
I still remember that.

213
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,380
I had a fight with Zhao Xifeng

214
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,330
that day.

215
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,040
You won.

216
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,870
I still remember

217
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,680
what you said at that time.

218
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,840
A friend for one day

219
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,180
will be a friend forever.

220
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,650
I’ve never

221
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,780
done anything

222
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,210
to betray my friend.

223
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,390
I have made clear

224
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,190
what happened three years ago.

225
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,110
You helped me.

226
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,740
So, I owe you.

227
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,580
Today,

228
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,550
I will let them go

229
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,190
to reward your kindness

230
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,070
three years ago.

231
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,910
Yuwen Yue.

232
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,510
When we meet again, we’re enemies.

233
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,360
There is no mercy at the battleground.

234
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,340
Report! Soldiers with Cavalry Battalion

235
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,420
are coming from behind!

236
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:02,710
Your Excellency.

237
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,890
Go through the East Gate.

238
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:04,990
I will bring up the rear for you.

239
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,750
You should take care.

240
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,870
Everyone converges at the East Gate

241
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,510
when the clearance signal is received.

242
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,070
Okay.

243
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,200
Xiuli Army, come with me!

244
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,660
Let’s cover for the evacuation
of His Excellency.

245
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,030
Aye.

246
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,500
= Jueshui Ferry =

247
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,510
Achu.

248
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,530
Miss Yu.

249
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,780
His Excellency is coming soon.

250
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,530
There is only one floating bridge here.

251
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,830
And it takes time to cross the river.

252
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,060
Can so many soldiers with Xiuli Army

253
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,910
cross the river before it gets dark?

254
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,660
This is His Excellency’s plan.

255
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,470
It will work, I believe.

256
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:06,960
Your Excellency.

257
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,830
Soldiers with Xiuli Army all died

258
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,670
when fighting here.

259
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,730
We must get out of the city
as soon as possible.

260
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,900
Since you have got off safely,

261
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,580
I will go

262
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,540
and summon He Xiao immediately.

263
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,450
Don’t bother!

264
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,230
The troops with four major battalions

265
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,230
have come out.

266
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,030
To defend our military prestige,

267
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,020
Xiuli Army

268
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,380
will sacrifice themselves

269
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,290
and become the role models
for all soldiers!

270
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,350
Under my command,

271
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,290
everyone shall retreat
through the East Gate

272
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,780
and block off the gate after evacuation!

273
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,180
- Aye.
- Go!

274
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,540
= East Gate =

275
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:03,890
Commander.

276
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:04,890
Why hasn’t His Excellency

277
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:05,610
ordered us to retreat yet?

278
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,830
Yuwen Huai’s soldiers

279
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,890
are coming up.

280
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,230
We can hardly hold out.

281
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,690
He has ten times more soldiers.

282
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:12,930
There is no chance to win.

283
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,400
Let’s just break out of the East Gate

284
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,770
and catch up with His Excellency.

285
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:16,480
Go!

286
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,250
Go!

287
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,590
Open the gate.

288
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,880
It can’t be opened!

289
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,530
Commander.

290
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:05,950
Our dudes who guarded the gate

291
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:06,970
have all died in the battle.

292
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,910
His Excellency has gone.

293
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,820
What did I say?

294
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,170
We were abandoned!

295
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,230
No, it’s not going to happen!

296
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,360
Even if His Excellency abandoned us,

297
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,260
Ms. Chu would not lie to us.

298
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,340
Don’t be so naive!

299
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,440
We have been betrayed.

300
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,060
He had said

301
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:23,930
we would go back home decently.

302
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,140
He was just lying!

303
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,360
Why are you putting on the long faces?

304
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:30,540
Didn’t you always swear

305
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,730
you wanted to risk your lives?

306
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,830
What? When it really comes,

307
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,380
are you all scared?

308
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,940
What are you yelling for?

309
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,000
Who is scared?

310
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,800
Yeah, why are you shouting?

311
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,340
You are just a normal solider

312
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,410
just like me.

313
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,810
If you yell again, I will beat you!

314
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,740
Dudes!

315
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,180
Because of us,

316
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,590
Marquis Dingbei’s families were killed.

317
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,530
We owe the Yan family.

318
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,110
Today,

319
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,520
we will pay with our lives!

320
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,790
We are no longer in their debt.

321
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,840
Even if we die,

322
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,130
we will not regret!

323
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,090
Dudes.

324
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,230
Let’s fight

325
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,360
with all our strength

326
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,140
and show them

327
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,180
we are not traitors

328
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,780
or cowards!

329
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,070
Come on.

330
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,190
Let’s get back to Xiuli Mountain!

331
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:46,340
Let’s get back to Xiuli Mountain!

332
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,840
Let’s get back to Xiuli Mountain!

333
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,810
Let’s get back to Xiuli Mountain!

334
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,730
Let’s get back to Xiuli Mountain!

335
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,760
Let’s get back to Xiuli Mountain!

336
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,690
Let’s get back to Xiuli Mountain!

337
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,800
Let’s get back to Xiuli Mountain!

338
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,980
Let’s get back to Xiuli Mountain!

339
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,000
Let’s get back to Xiuli Mountain!

340
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,240
Let’s get back to Xiuli Mountain!

341
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,520
Let’s get back to Xiuli Mountain!

342
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,480
Let’s get back to Xiuli Mountain!

343
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,490
Let’s get back to Xiuli Mountain!

344
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,450
Let’s get back to Xiuli Mountain!

345
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:15,480
Let’s get back to Xiuli Mountain!

346
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,180
Let’s get back to Xiuli Mountain!

347
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,100
= Jueshui Ferry =

348
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,380
Yan Xun, where is Xiuli Army?

349
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,540
They are on their way.

350
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,670
Aren’t we supposed to wait for them?

351
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,340
They will catch up.

352
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,300
Let’s go now.

353
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:09,760
Let’s go.

354
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,280
Achu, where are you going?

355
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,980
We promised Xiuli Army

356
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,590
to bring them back to Yanbei.

357
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,970
We should keep our words!

358
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,190
I never promised

359
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,820
to bring them back to Yanbei!

360
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,730
They are traitors.

361
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,870
They need to be punished!

362
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,860
You shall go first.

363
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,890
I’ll bring them to catch up with you.

364
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,010
Achu!

365
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:29,890
Achu!

366
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,750
Achu!

367
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,030
Line up.

368
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,040
Line up!

369
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,120
Shoot!

370
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,920
Shield!

371
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,550
Kill!

372
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,540
Kill!

373
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,480
Kill!

374
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,390
Attack!

375
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:43,600
Kill!

376
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:47,320
- Kill!
- Kill.

377
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,230
Don’t be scared.

378
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,460
We are going to heaven together!

379
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,200
Wait for me!

380
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,050
You traitors!

381
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,620
How shameless you are!

382
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:53,890
Shoot.

383
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:07,990
Xiuli Army.

384
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,480
All of you who are alive,

385
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,530
line up!

386
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,670
Protect the army flag!

387
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:39,160
Soldiers from Yanbei!

388
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,730
You are not deserted!

389
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,980
Follow my order and come with me!

390
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,010
I’m taking you home!

391
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,250
Go home! Go home! Go home!

392
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,530
Go home! Go home!

393
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,790
He Xiao, listen!

394
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:54,040
Here!

395
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,150
Retreat with your soldiers!

396
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,650
Ms. Chu,

397
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,610
we are going with you!

398
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,770
We are going with you!

399
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:04,940
We are going with you!

400
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,350
We are going with you!

401
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,700
None of you is leaving today.

402
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,970
Xiuli Army!

403
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:33,880
Here!

404
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,320
Be strong!

405
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,840
I’m the reason

406
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:42,380
you’re still alive.

407
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,660
Fine. I am repaying you

408
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,250
right now!

409
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:25,860
The Chief Commander is dead!
The Wei army is defeated!

410
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:02,180
It’s a narrow and hard way to go through.

411
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,420
We must be very careful.

412
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,780
Report!

413
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:12,140
Your Highness, bad news!

414
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,720
General Wei Shuye sent a message

415
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,220
that His Excellency Yan Xun rebelled!

416
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,720
He broke out of the gate on his wedding

417
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,750
and escaped from Chang’an!

418
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:18,970
General Wei is running after him

419
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:20,150
with his troops!

420
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,610
Where is General Wei now?

421
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:22,460
No idea.

422
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,870
When General Cheng left,

423
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,590
General Wei already passed Lyuxian County.

424
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,470
Your Highness, the Crown Prince said...

425
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:28,090
Tieyou.

426
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,950
My vice general shall
take over the responsibility

427
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,520
to escort the Crown Prince.

428
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,190
Aye!

429
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,560
Your Highness, Your Highness!

430
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,040
Your Excellency.

431
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,210
Your Excellency.

432
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,980
We have waited for five days.

433
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,660
We must leave now.

434
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,600
Your Excellency.

435
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,350
We have delayed for days.

436
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,320
We have hiden our track well

437
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,610
all the way here.

438
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,870
But if we stay for longer,

439
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,450
pursuing troops will catch up.

440
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:54,580
That’s right.

441
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:58,340
Your Highness, Achu is fighting
our enemies

442
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,440
around Chang’an

443
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,400
with Xiuli Army

444
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:03,290
just to buy us time.

445
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,040
We can’t let her down.

446
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:17,880
I am just worried

447
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,170
when she arrives,

448
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,870
she will be disappointed

449
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:22,930
if she doesn’t see me.

450
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,390
Your Excellency.

451
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:28,700
You are leading the remaining soldiers

452
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:29,960
who are loyal to Yanbei

453
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,630
in such a dangerous place

454
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,550
only because you are afraid

455
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,860
when Miss Chu arrives,

456
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,180
she will be disappointed
for not seeing you?

457
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,550
That’s too...

458
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,700
Do you have a problem with that?

459
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,710
I abandoned Xiuli Army.

460
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,490
She must be angry with me.

461
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,660
I just want to wait for her myself.

462
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,520
When she comes,

463
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,910
maybe she will forgive me.

464
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,140
Your Excellency, anyone who wants success

465
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,350
should throw away emotions...

466
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,010
Your Excellency.

467
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,990
One more night.

468
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,150
We must leave

469
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:10,990
tomorrow morning,

470
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,350
no matter if she comes back.

471
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,330
I believe

472
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,600
she will come back to Yanbei safely.

473
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:56,830
Yan Xun.

474
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,660
I am already your wife.

475
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,290
No matter where you go,

476
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,880
I will find you.

477
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,490
Enemies are coming closer.

478
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,760
Give the order.

479
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:01,390
Let’s wait.

480
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,750
Ms. Chu.

481
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,070
Just a while.

482
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,330
If we don’t move now,

483
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:08,990
we will miss our best chance

484
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,210
to ambush.

485
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,830
He Xiao, believe me.

486
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,110
Wait for a while.

487
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,280
Enemies have entered the valley.

488
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,580
What are we waiting for?

489
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,290
Till they...

490
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,440
Move!

491
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,230
Xiuli Army!

492
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:33,000
Kill!

493
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,900
Kill!

494
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,990
Kill!

495
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:21,820
Report!

496
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,350
Our tenth ambush ends well.

497
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:25,800
No enemies catch up.

498
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:28,060
Okay, let our dudes withdraw.

499
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:28,620
Aye.

500
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:32,350
Ms. Chu, why do we withdraw now?

501
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:33,810
Our soldiers are at the highest spirit.

502
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:35,340
Shouldn’t we pursue the retreating enemy?

503
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,140
When we leave now,

504
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,900
aren’t we throwing away our best chance?

505
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:39,740
Right.

506
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,180
We were just enjoying the fight.

507
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,870
Why should we give up

508
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:43,900
such a perfect chance?

509
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,530
I know what you are thinking of.

510
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,870
Over all these days,

511
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:49,760
your spirit has risen to the peak

512
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,090
and you keep winning.

513
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,230
Some of you may think

514
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,600
we should not

515
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,710
waste our chance

516
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,710
or give up the combat success
right in front of us.

517
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,310
But is that true?

518
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,740
Once anything about the battle

519
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,660
goes around,

520
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,990
the Emperor of Wei will get angry.

521
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,290
A hundred times more soldiers

522
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:08,830
will chase us.

523
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,790
I believe,

524
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,170
the soldiers of Wei have returned

525
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,420
to kill us.

526
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:16,840
But we have run out

527
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,950
of food and weapons.

528
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:21,060
We don’t have spare horses,

529
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:23,250
food or medicine.

530
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,450
How long can we hold on

531
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:26,630
by fueling war with warfare?

532
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,490
Once we look exhausted,

533
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,050
enemies will come to fight us

534
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:31,820
like crazy dogs.

535
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:34,190
Even the fiercest lion

536
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,450
sleeps sometimes.

537
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,670
The safety of His Excellency

538
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,560
has been ensured.

539
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,720
What you have done

540
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,860
will make everyone in Yanbei

541
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,770
proud of you!

542
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,080
It’s enough.

543
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,670
We’re tired.

544
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,470
We should go back to Yanbei.

545
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,810
Your families need you.

546
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,520
We don’t have any families now.

547
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,300
Yeah. Yeah.

548
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,860
His Excellency has abandoned us.

549
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,500
We are traitors of Wei

550
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,000
as well as betrayers of Yanbei.

551
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,890
Where can we go?

552
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,370
I’d rather die in wars

553
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,780
and end my life with honor!

554
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,340
Yes! Yes! Yes!

555
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,870
Die in the war! Die with honor!

556
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,140
Do not believe

557
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:09,800
ridiculous rumors!

558
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:11,940
But His Excellency did not take us.

559
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,130
He locked the gate

560
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:14,060
and left us there.

561
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,140
We all saw that

562
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,190
with our eyes.

563
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,040
He did not abandon you!

564
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,870
He sent me to save you.

565
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,830
You alone?

566
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:22,690
Yes.

567
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,680
Just me alone.

568
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,590
But I did it!

569
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,590
I saved you!

570
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,330
This is the fact.

571
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:31,650
Undoubted fact.

572
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,360
I am telling you.

573
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,860
Do not hesitate anymore.

574
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:38,880
You risk your lives

575
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:40,540
to protect your home,

576
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,280
everyone in Yanbei remembers your loyalty!

577
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:47,440
Everybody, go back with me.

578
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:00,720
I’d like to follow you, Ms. Chu.

579
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,490
We will follow you!

580
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:07,210
We will follow you!

581
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,420
My rabbit’s tail.

582
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,280
