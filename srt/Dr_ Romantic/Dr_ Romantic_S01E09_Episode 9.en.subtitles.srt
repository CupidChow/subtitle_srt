1
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,065
You're back already.

2
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,151
I heard you were being investigated.

3
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,986
I don't think it's over already.

4
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:30,989
I told you so.

5
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:33,742
You're not good enough
to operate on Chairman Shin.

6
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:35,827
Look how it ended.

7
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:37,662
Because you were stubborn,

8
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,998
you're going to lose
another one of your favorite pupils.

9
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,377
You little...

10
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,129
Teacher Kim.

11
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,801
You have a visitor.

12
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,344
A visitor?

13
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:00,643
Hi.

14
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,187
Teacher Kim.

15
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,189
I'm here.

16
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,693
You said I should be hospitalized.

17
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,614
Just as you ordered,

18
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,909
I delivered your message to him.

19
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,957
Why are you still standing there?

20
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,752
Show me the way to my room.

21
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,765
When did I ever tell you
to go out of your way for me?

22
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,978
I'm sorry, Chairman Shin.

23
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,731
I'm afraid there's been a mistake.

24
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,692
You're not ready to get hospitalized.

25
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,069
What?

26
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,280
-Teacher Kim.
-I know you came a long way,

27
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,366
but I'm afraid you'll have to head back.

28
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,744
-As soon as we're ready, we'll--
-What are you doing right now?

29
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,378
Didn't I tell you that you're suspended?

30
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,713
He's suspended?

31
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,800
-Hold on.
-Until the investigation is over,

32
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,136
you can't perform
any kind of medical treatment.

33
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,054
If you fail to comply with this order,

34
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,056
you may be put at a greater disadvantage.

35
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,558
And who exactly are you?

36
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,601
What do you mean he's suspended?

37
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,353
Who says?

38
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,063
I can explain, Chairman Shin.

39
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,691
-The thing is--
-Teacher Kim.

40
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,568
You explain.

41
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,821
Explain this situation.
Who are those people?

42
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,199
The hospital is under investigation,
Chairman Shin.

43
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,909
Hey, Dong-ju.

44
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,705
The main hospital sent down
investigators here for some reason.

45
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,415
I don't understand the reason

46
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,001
behind their hostile attitude
towards the medical staff here.

47
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,460
Shut it.

48
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,337
Why should I?

49
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,507
We're the ones being
investigated unjustly.

50
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,633
Kang Dong-ju.

51
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:58,887
Chairman Shin.

52
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,931
You're the chairman of
the foundation of Geosan Medical Center.

53
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,644
May I file a complaint to you

54
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,855
regarding this unreasonable treatment

55
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,400
from Geosan Medical Center?

56
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:20,825
Ms. Ju.

57
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,911
Yes, Chairman Shin.

58
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,078
Call President Do.

59
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,205
-Chairman Shin.
-Bring him here

60
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:29,417
and get him to explain
this situation himself.

61
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,711
-Now!
-Yes, Chairman Shin.

62
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,554
Tell me what I did wrong.

63
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,432
Why did you get Chairman Shin
involved in this?

64
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:48,102
I couldn't just let them
do this to Seo-jeong.

65
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,981
I was looking for someone
who could bring us a solution.

66
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,276
And you thought that person
was Chairman Shin?

67
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,904
The only person who has
the upper hand on President Do

68
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,822
is the chairman of the foundation.

69
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,243
And Chairman Shin is

70
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,744
on your side.

71
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,499
I knew that you were an idiot,

72
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,503
but you are dumber than I thought

73
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,838
and clueless of how this world works.

74
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:17,715
What?

75
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,384
I see.

76
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,303
Chairman Shin is asking for me?

77
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,888
He is,

78
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,808
but you don't have to come down here.

79
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,184
You can leave it to me.

80
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,561
I'll see how things go
and try to sort it out.

81
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,564
That's unnecessary.

82
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,024
Pardon?

83
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,860
What do you mean?

84
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,698
They had no intentions of
making this into a big deal.

85
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,408
You did them a favor

86
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:46,536
and handed over what they wanted
on a silver platter.

87
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,165
I've been wondering

88
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,836
how I was going to confront that
old man with this issue, anyway.

89
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,713
This is good for me.

90
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,631
They made it easier for me.

91
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,717
I just need to report the facts.

92
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,719
Who knows?

93
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,888
Maybe it's better for you this way.

94
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:09,600
President Do will be glad of your service.

95
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,521
Seo-jeong is screwed though.

96
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,648
Don't you think that's a bit harsh?

97
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,233
She's screwed?

98
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,068
You don't have the slightest clue

99
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,154
of what kind of a man President Do is.

100
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,323
That man.

101
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,367
He will do just about anything

102
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,995
to get what he wants.

103
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,541
And Chairman Shin appointed
such a man as the president

104
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,960
just to play his own game.

105
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,546
Do you think he is on my side?

106
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,548
Don't be absurd.

107
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,635
All he wants is just my operation.

108
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,678
That's it.

109
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,514
You idiot.

110
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,043
President Do

111
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,712
is on his way here.

112
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,341
What are you going to do?

113
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:25,927
I will just hold out.

114
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,720
If they want,

115
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,389
they can bite me.

116
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:32,934
There is

117
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,936
not much I can do for you.

118
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,276
Eat this when you get
the munchies or something.

119
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,164
How did you first come to know Dr. Bu?

120
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,751
Did someone introduce him to you?

121
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,379
He saved my life twice.

122
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,549
Can you explain that in more detail?

123
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,468
One time,

124
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,721
he saved me when I got lost
in the mountains.

125
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:12,765
Later on,

126
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,725
he treated my wrist injury

127
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,437
which could've been a death sentence
to me as a doctor.

128
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,148
He saved me twice.

129
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,233
No.

130
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,777
There is one more thing.

131
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,449
He just saved me again
in the operating room.

132
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:33,453
So I'd say he saved my life three times.

133
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,625
Do you still feel like killing yourself?

134
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:48,050
I'm asking you if you still feel suicidal.

135
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,889
Times of disregarding wounds.

136
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,352
People are willing to

137
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:02,356
disregard other people's wounds
for their own interests.

138
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,776
In order to keep their prestige,

139
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:09,155
people never care
about other people's pain.

140
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,740
And...

141
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:15,203
I'm asking you if you still feel suicidal.

142
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,039
It's your fault.

143
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:21,209
I died because of you.

144
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:28,049
People can't even look after
their own wounds.

145
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,175
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,062
They all turn their faces away

147
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,731
from the reality or their wounds

148
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:47,026
in the name of self-defense.

149
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,270
The investigation itself
is very irritating.

150
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,355
Then Chairman Shin and
President Do are here now.

151
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,856
What is going on?

152
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,609
Do you think Chairman Shin
called President Do

153
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,861
to give him an earful?

154
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,030
I don't know.

155
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:36,993
I heard Teacher Kim was suspended

156
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,203
because of Dr. Yun. Is that right?

157
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,046
You should get back to work.

158
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,049
The situation is bad as is.
Stop making a fuss.

159
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,134
Okay.

160
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,270
Don't concern yourself too much about it.

161
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,983
Just do your job as if
nothing ever happened.

162
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,152
Okay?

163
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,632
I don't know what the fuss is all about.

164
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,343
I told you to send some devices
to this hospital.

165
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,095
I didn't say anything
about the investigation.

166
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,014
Please don't get me wrong, sir.

167
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,851
I just tried to honor your wish,

168
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,811
doing my utmost

169
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,106
for your operation by sending
competent doctors to this hospital.

170
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,442
-But...
-But?

171
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,444
I was reported

172
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,614
that the whole situation at the hospital
was a mess.

173
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,036
Go on.

174
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,121
Because of lax security,

175
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,667
an armed man even walked
into an operation room.

176
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,043
That's not it.

177
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:13,005
He left the patient alone
with that man after the surgery.

178
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,717
Fortunately, no one got hurt
thanks to Teacher Kim.

179
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,513
He is even accused of
overtreating a patient

180
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,390
who can't afford to pay.

181
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,308
Saving the patient comes first.

182
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,395
Medical bills come next.

183
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:30,022
How do you explain the fact
that the doctor

184
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,566
who suggested the expensive treatment

185
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,069
has a history of PTSD?

186
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,862
PTSD? What is that?

187
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,949
It means post-traumatic stress disorder.

188
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,283
Dr. Yun

189
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,537
completely recovered two years ago.

190
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,999
I heard that she recently took
an overdose of nervous sedative.

191
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,503
President Yeo and Dr. Bu

192
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,172
overlooked the fact,

193
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,174
knowing all about it.

194
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:02,054
It is a dereliction of duty.

195
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,345
Stop beating around the bush
and get to the point.

196
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,931
What is it you really want?

197
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,225
What I'm saying is that
I can no longer overlook

198
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,311
any unreasonable medical treatment

199
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,689
happening in this lousy hospital.

200
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,192
I can't let them

201
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,736
operate on you in this mess.

202
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,071
Please reconsider your decision

203
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,574
on Dr. Bu operating on you.

204
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,242
That was it.

205
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,078
You want to stop Teacher Kim
from operating on him.

206
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,456
Is that why you are making all the fuss?

207
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,790
Watch your mouth!

208
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,084
Stop it. That's enough.

209
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,588
-Chairman Shin.
-It's about my surgery,

210
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:21,008
and it is my decision.

211
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,886
So that's the end of the matter.

212
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,515
I will have the operation here

213
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:31,560
as I planned. End of discussion.

214
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:36,190
Just fire the doctor with PTSD

215
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,069
and knock it off.

216
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,364
That's my answer to the question.

217
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,908
No, sir. Dr. Yun is--

218
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,744
Just do as I say, President Yeo.

219
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,539
Gosh.

220
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:56,961
Chairman Shin, you are not
getting the point.

221
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,922
What did you just say?

222
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,676
It's me who President Do wants to fire.

223
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,969
That's the point.

224
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:06,845
Isn't that right?

225
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,097
At least,

226
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,433
you should bear the responsibility

227
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,185
for having the doctor with PTSD here.

228
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,771
Do you have the medical diagnosis already?

229
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,148
Does it say she has PTSD?

230
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:21,652
Or is the interview just out of formality

231
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,737
when the diagnostic results
have already been decided?

232
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,199
She won't get away

233
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:28,993
with the overtreatment either.

234
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,538
What ER doctors do is

235
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:35,249
saving a life no matter what it takes.

236
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,544
Blaming them for overtreatment

237
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,089
is like blaming someone
for opening a parachute

238
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,216
when a plane is crashing.

239
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,134
So what?

240
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:49,305
Do you even know
the size of hospital deficits every year?

241
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,808
Don't try to give a lecture
on business to a doctor.

242
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,643
Doctors can't make a living

243
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,021
just with his skills anymore.

244
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,523
There are doctors

245
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,859
only when there is a hospital.

246
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:09,199
How could you say that
as the president of a hospital?

247
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,744
You said that in the wrong order.

248
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,873
There are doctors
only when there are patients.

249
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,833
That's the basic principle.

250
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,585
You think?

251
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,631
I wasn't aware that the basic principle
is that important to you.

252
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,178
Sure. Let's do that.

253
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,974
I will proceed with the investigation

254
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,226
per our hospital policy.

255
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,271
Also, the doctor
who is assumed to have PTSD

256
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,856
will be held responsible

257
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,108
according to our principles.

258
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,819
President Do.

259
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,780
As the person in charge
of Geosan Medical Center,

260
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,075
I must do this by the rules
and principles of our hospital

261
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:55,287
for the discipline
of our hospital community.

262
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,802
Are you all finished talking?

263
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,264
Make sure you catch something.

264
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,599
I don't care how long it takes.

265
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,559
Yes, President Do.

266
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,533
What is it?

267
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,326
I'm sorry.

268
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,870
I keep disappointing you.

269
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,249
I became a doctor

270
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,712
because I wanted to be recognized by you.

271
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,756
You are the one

272
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,052
who gave me the dream to become a doctor.

273
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,679
And so ungratefully,

274
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,223
you betrayed me.

275
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,737
Teacher Kim,

276
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,989
it's your turn to back down.

277
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,035
I understand that you think
dearly of your colleagues.

278
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,204
But will you shut this place down

279
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,790
just because of her?

280
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:25,669
What should we do?

281
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,007
I don't think we have a way around this.

282
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,447
Why does it have to be Yong-ju?

283
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,033
Why were you hiding behind him?

284
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,868
There was an accident,

285
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,121
and he helped me.

286
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,123
Did you hide your PTSD symptoms

287
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:04,625
because he told you to?

288
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,003
I was treated for three years,
and I believed I was fully recovered.

289
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,756
I'm asking about what he said
to brainwash you!

290
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,513
Teacher Kim didn't do anything wrong.

291
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,600
Things got out of hand all because of me.

292
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,686
It's because I wasn't good enough.

293
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:26,730
So...

294
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,776
if anyone has to be responsible,
that will be me.

295
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,571
I will...

296
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,535
quit.

297
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,416
This is unfortunate.

298
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,460
I thought of you

299
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,672
like my own daughter.

300
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,883
I guess that wasn't your case.

301
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,179
If you really needed help,

302
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,682
you should've asked me.

303
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:03,767
President Do.

304
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,435
We will continue our investigation,

305
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,397
and we'll process everything
according to the rules.

306
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,483
I'll take this moment

307
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,903
as the end of our relationship.

308
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,607
Are you looking for something?

309
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,193
Can I help you?

310
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,653
No, thanks.

311
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,743
Well...

312
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,953
Have you seen Dr. Yun?

313
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,496
Dr. Yun?

314
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:12,544
She was here early in the morning,
but I haven't seen her since then.

315
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,087
Oh, I see.

316
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:16,924
Thanks.

317
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,383
Excuse me, Dr. Kang.

318
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,890
Do you want me to call you

319
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,558
when Dr. Yun gets here?

320
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,728
Will you do that?

321
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,188
Thanks.

322
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,090
Excuse me. Have you seen Dr. Yun?

323
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,549
No, I haven't.

324
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,218
Oh, really?

325
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,396
Dr. Yun.

326
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,690
Is he getting any better?

327
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,899
No.

328
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,986
We still have to wait and see.

329
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,449
How long do we have to wait?

330
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,954
It feels like I'm holding
onto a hopeless situation.

331
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:33,292
The treatment and ICU costs are
extremely high.

332
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,878
I don't want my children to be burdened.

333
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,715
I know things are hard,

334
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,551
but please don't give up.

335
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,595
Please keep saying
positive things to the patient.

336
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,564
Am I

337
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,150
doing the right thing?

338
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,780
Was Dr. Yun here by any chance?

339
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,159
I think I saw her at the ICU.

340
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,660
I'm not sure if she's still there.

341
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,579
I see.

342
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:36,188
These patients are hanging
between life and death every day.

343
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,398
But is everything we do

344
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,859
always correct?

345
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,916
Seo-jeong. What brings you here?

346
00:22:57,584 --> 00:23:00,378
Am I perfectly prepared

347
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,424
to take the responsibility
of a person's life?

348
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,802
What are you talking about?

349
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,970
What do you mean Seo-jeong is missing?

350
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:12,224
I've searched the entire ground,
but I still haven't seen her.

351
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,767
She won't pick up her phone.

352
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,102
I think she heard

353
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,647
about your suspension
at the emergency room.

354
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:22,859
-Teacher Kim.
-Hey.

355
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:25,570
Seo-jeong just stopped by my restaurant,

356
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,364
and she asked me to give you this.

357
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,703
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

358
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,248
A letter of resignation?

359
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,669
-When was she there?
-It's been about 10 minutes.

360
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,713
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING

361
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,307
TEACHER KIM

362
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,615
Where are you headed?

363
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,745
Your call cannot be connected...

364
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,330
Is she not picking up?

365
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,957
She probably won't.

366
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,794
She must've been determined
when she wrote this resignation.

367
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,299
You go find her.

368
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,384
How would he find her?

369
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,720
We have to look for her
no matter where she went.

370
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,013
I have a condition.

371
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,807
You have to bring her back within today.

372
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,893
If you don't,

373
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:41,313
I'm processing her resignation.

374
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:42,856
Do you understand?

375
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,784
Dr. Kang, I'm glad to see you.

376
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:55,827
Your car has

377
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,079
-just arrived.
-That's great.

378
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,414
Well...

379
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:02,209
I have to go now. Let's talk later.

380
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,335
The car is...

381
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,420
It's brand new.

382
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,797
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

383
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,817
JEONGSEON INTERCITY BUS TERMINAL

384
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:30,946
We're here.

385
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,822
Where are you planning to go?

386
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,158
I'm not sure.

387
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,703
I don't really know
now that I'm actually here.

388
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,500
I haven't been to Seoul for a while.

389
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,837
Maybe I should go sightseeing
by the East Sea.

390
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,881
Isn't there anywhere you want to go?

391
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,633
No, there isn't.

392
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:55,428
-Anyone you want to see?
-Nobody at all.

393
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,138
What a sad life you're living.

394
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,349
I know.

395
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:02,519
It is a sad life.

396
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,605
The more you know about me,
it gets even sadder.

397
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:10,193
Stop saying things like that.
You'll scare people away.

398
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:14,197
I'd rather be scary
than people taking me lightly.

399
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:19,202
I could give you a ride to Seoul
if that's where you're headed.

400
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,913
Aren't you going back to the hospital?

401
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,748
I'm taking a day off.

402
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:24,833
A day off?

403
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,293
What?

404
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,253
Dr. Do is taking a day off?

405
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,754
Yes, apparently.

406
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,092
Then get Dong-ju to do it.

407
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:37,429
Dr. Kang was on call last night.
He's not at work today.

408
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,306
Then get Teacher Kim.

409
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,183
Did you forget?

410
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:47,397
Teacher Kim is suspended as of today.

411
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,481
Are you saying that

412
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,943
I'm the only general surgeon here
at the moment?

413
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,278
I guess so.

414
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,155
It looks like that's the case.

415
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,366
Over here, Dr. Jeong.

416
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,455
-Are you okay?
-It hurts.

417
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,623
-Please hang in there.
-It hurts so much.

418
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,125
Over here, Doctor.

419
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,143
TICKET

420
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:27,937
BUS FARE AND SCHEDULE

421
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,482
The number you have dialed
is not available.

422
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:31,566
Seo-jeong?

423
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:34,444
I don't know.
I haven't seen her for five years.

424
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:35,445
Dr. Jeong!

425
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,113
Did you take CT scan
of the RLQ pain patient?

426
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,115
I have a patient right now.
I'll talk to you later.

427
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,492
I'll go check on it.

428
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:53,963
JERK

429
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:01,971
JERK

430
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:05,100
In-beom. It's me, Dong-ju.

431
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,186
I'm listening. What is it?

432
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:12,232
You and Seo-jeong knew each other
in the old days, right?

433
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,651
I'm looking for her right now.

434
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,987
Do you know where she might be?

435
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,365
She's with me.

436
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,244
She can hear you right now.
You can talk to her.

437
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,166
Where are you right now?

438
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,252
We're on our way to Seoul.

439
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:35,171
Return to the hospital right now.

440
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,423
I don't think I can do that.

441
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,925
We're on the expressway already.

442
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,056
Are you listening, Seo-jeong?

443
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:49,644
I know you're going through
a rough time right now,

444
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,688
but you can't just hand in
a letter of resignation.

445
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,523
You wrote a letter of resignation?

446
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:58,319
Come back right now. Come back, Seo-jeong.

447
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,237
Seo-jeong.

448
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,306
Hey.

449
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,975
Why did you tell him I'm with you?

450
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,810
You didn't say I couldn't tell him.

451
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,271
And why would you tell him
we're going to Seoul?

452
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,689
Because he asked me where I was.

453
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,566
Oh, my goodness.

454
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,653
Why did you write a letter of resignation?

455
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:44,032
It's none of your business.
Just keep driving.

456
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,326
You're really scary, Sister.

457
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:49,037
I'm seriously not your sister.

458
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,165
Seoul? Where in Seoul?

459
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:53,750
I don't know the details.

460
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,419
I'm following her to Seoul as we speak.

461
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:59,422
Don't you think you'll be late
if you make the round trip?

462
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,466
I have to do everything I can for now.

463
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,009
Okay, then.

464
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:05,970
By the way, it's a total chaos here.

465
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:09,849
We all forgot about it
with President Do on our backs,

466
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,143
but today is Friday.

467
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:15,396
Where's the suture set
and Lidocaine I asked for?

468
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,027
It's only been 10 seconds
since you asked for them.

469
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,529
Gosh.

470
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,615
What kind of a senior doctor
stitches up wounds?

471
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,492
You should loosen the tie.

472
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,537
Do head nurses have a say
in doctor's ties?

473
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:34,707
Mr. Park.

474
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,085
Are you okay?

475
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,586
Please lie down.

476
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,840
Did you eat something that's been spoiled?

477
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:46,052
I had rice and soup in the morning.

478
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,555
I must have scarfed it down.

479
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,598
My stomach hurts so much.

480
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,016
Did you have diarrhea?

481
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,145
My stomach is rumbling, but I haven't yet.

482
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,607
I threw up several times.

483
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,776
Is there anywhere else that hurts?

484
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,403
My chest does.

485
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,029
Excessive vomiting

486
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,073
can cause pain in the esophagus.

487
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:10,410
I'll give you some injection
for acute gastritis.

488
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:13,288
Please give this patient
metoclopramide IV and hydration.

489
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,289
Yes, Doctor.

490
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,254
It's okay. I can do it.

491
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:22,338
I'll do it.

492
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,674
You should give her that injection.

493
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:25,925
Thank you, Yeon-hwa.

494
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,189
-What are you doing?
-What?

495
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,027
I thought she had something on her neck.

496
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,864
It's a traffic accident patient.

497
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,991
She's bleeding on the forehead
and the right calf.

498
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,577
The blood pressure is 90 over 60
and dropping fast.

499
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,163
I'm going to go insane.

500
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,206
Doldam Hospital emergency room.

501
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,083
Yes. Okay.

502
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,252
An attempted suicide patient
is arriving in five minutes.

503
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,795
He jumped into a river.

504
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:04,672
What?

505
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,397
Ms. Woo?

506
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:23,858
What are you doing here?

507
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,402
Nothing.

508
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:28,696
I'm sorry.

509
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,050
Are you not working today?

510
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:52,720
The investigators from the main hospital
told me not to.

511
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,931
You do know that today is Friday, right?

512
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:02,063
There are emergency specialists
from Geosan Medical Center here.

513
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,733
There's even a chief surgeon.

514
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,069
What are you so worried about?

515
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,654
They're doctors, too.

516
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:13,199
It's a fall patient.
He's losing consciousness.

517
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,283
Doctor.

518
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,744
Over here, Doctor.

519
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,706
You call yourself a doctor?

520
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,457
Get yourself together!

521
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:28,381
Do you think Dr. Yun will come back?

522
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:46,149
I do have a strategy.

523
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:52,905
I'm so happy.

524
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,076
It feels like my body is releasing
endorphins just by looking at them.

525
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:14,260
Look at you being all formal
with your fork.

526
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,638
That is no way to treat pizza.

527
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,349
Hold it in your hand

528
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,018
and stuff your mouth.

529
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:24,979
Got it?

530
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,691
You're a mama's boy, aren't you?

531
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,819
I bet you've never played with dirt
when you were young,

532
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,614
let alone running away from home
or rebelling against your parents.

533
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:38,034
"What is rebelling? How do you do that?"

534
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,953
-Are you always so talkative?
-Who? Me?

535
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:46,250
No, I'm on the quiet side.

536
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:49,003
You've been talking by yourself
all this time.

537
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,631
That's because you're not saying anything.

538
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,466
I didn't want to kill the mood.

539
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,469
I was being considerate
not to make you feel uncomfortable.

540
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,262
Are you sure
it's not because you're anxious?

541
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,891
Why would I be?

542
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,018
Isn't the resignation letter you wrote

543
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,354
bothering you right now?

544
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,357
The call from Dong-ju is bothering you.

545
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,401
The fact that you're with me here
is also bothering you.

546
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,487
You're just filling the silence

547
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:17,031
not to show that these things
are bothering you.

548
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,368
Forget it. Let's eat.

549
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,585
Yes, I'm extremely bothered.

550
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:33,297
I feel awful because
I left my closest group of people

551
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:37,301
with just a letter of resignation
and without saying goodbye.

552
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,348
Why did I do that?

553
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:46,769
I should've hung in there
and begged for mercy.

554
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,605
Why did I turn in a resignation letter?

555
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:54,026
The only place I can go is
Doldam Hospital.

556
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,448
Really,

557
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,578
the only place I can
go to is Doldam Hospital.

558
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,500
Exactly.

559
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,919
Why did you run away out of fear?

560
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,672
Nothing is decided yet.

561
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,467
It's not like the neuropsychiatrist
made a diagnosis,

562
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,387
and that cardioplegic patient
did not die yet.

563
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,015
Am I wrong?

564
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,486
PRESIDENT DO'S SON

565
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,451
JERK

566
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,496
PRESIDENT DO'S SON

567
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,500
JERK

568
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:55,630
Hello?

569
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,714
Where are you?

570
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,925
Are you still with Seo-jeong?

571
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:01,636
Let me talk to her.

572
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,138
Put her on the phone!

573
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,934
I can't do that.

574
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,061
What?

575
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,980
She left before finishing her food.

576
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,566
She said she had to do something.

577
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,741
GEOSAN MEDICAL CENTER

578
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,291
Hello, Doctor.

579
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,711
What brings you here?

580
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:39,757
I came here to answer
that unanswered question.

581
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,634
Then you're a bit too late.

582
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,720
I just sent my diagnosis to President Do.

583
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,974
Not even once.

584
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:52,728
Not ever.

585
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,941
I never thought about killing myself.

586
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,363
Even when my mom died,

587
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,161
even when I got
into the accident with Dr. Moon,

588
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,664
I...

589
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,293
wanted to live.

590
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,797
That's why I was distressed.

591
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,179
It wasn't about the guilt
of surviving everything by myself.

592
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:31,767
I wanted to live.

593
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:35,604
I wanted to live despite all that.

594
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:39,984
That's why I felt sorry.

595
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:50,536
Dr. Yun. Why did you become a doctor?

596
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:58,919
I thought...

597
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:05,134
I would be recognized
if I became a doctor.

598
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,929
Did you ever want to quit being a doctor?

599
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:14,226
Every single moment.

600
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,980
Every single time

601
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,276
I make a decision for my patients.

602
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,405
I see.

603
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,410
Could you

604
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,165
give this to Teacher Kim
of Doldam Hospital?

605
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,668
GEOSAN MEDICAL CENTER

606
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:43,005
That's my diagnosis about you.

607
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,175
I thought I would
pass this onto them as well.

608
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:47,968
Goodbye.

609
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,902
Above patient's symptoms show

610
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:07,446
that she suffers
from an acute stress disorder

611
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,407
which was caused by recent events.

612
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,575
Symptoms do not show

613
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:14,412
signs of PTSD per DSM-5.

614
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,831
Further observation is not necessary.

615
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:17,915
You idiot!

616
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,842
I gave the diagnosis to her.

617
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:31,470
Thankfully, those were
the answers I wanted to hear.

618
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,141
I almost lost my conscience as a doctor.

619
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,687
How is Hyeon-ji doing?

620
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,985
Do you still remember my kid's name?

621
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:47,111
Of course.

622
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,238
She was

623
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,949
the youngest patient of mine.

624
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,870
You know, about that Doldam Hospital.

625
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:59,748
I think I know why
you are at that hospital.

626
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,376
Please make the right assessment.

627
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:04,837
Seo-jeong's life

628
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:08,007
as a doctor is in your hands.

629
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,801
Please make the correct assessment

630
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:13,554
without the outside pressure
from President Do.

631
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,974
Dr. Yun is absolutely needed
at Doldam Hospital's ER.

632
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:20,102
Please do not ruin her life

633
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,438
with your nonsensical diagnosis.

634
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:25,649
Look at these.
These are letters of gratitude

635
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:26,984
from Dr. Yun's patients.

636
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,404
I thought they could help
with your diagnosis.

637
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,700
Please make the right assessment.

638
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:39,371
If you make any weird diagnosis,
I am writing a petition right away.

639
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,290
I hope you could make

640
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:44,293
the right diagnosis
as a respectable doctor.

641
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:47,254
Well, I guess so.

642
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,008
They are all very feisty.

643
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:55,596
Please do not lose against

644
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:58,265
President Do this time.

645
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:03,562
Bye.

646
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:15,199
SYMPTOMS DO NOT SHOW
SIGNS OF PTSD PER DSM-5

647
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:30,756
Thank you.

648
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:37,406
How did you find me?

649
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,075
An informer told me.

650
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,162
What about you?

651
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:47,541
Are you finished here?

652
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:50,753
Yes.

653
00:43:58,886 --> 00:43:59,928
That's good, then.

654
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,474
Let's go.

655
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,152
Are you coming?

656
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,332
-Are you crying?
-No.

657
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:32,419
It's because of the cold air.

658
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:37,716
Do you know how your eyes
tear up when you are

659
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:42,971
suddenly exposed
to a bright light or the cold air?

660
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:44,973
It's exactly that.

661
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,562
My goodness, it's so cold.

662
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,731
Isn't it?

663
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,739
Look.

664
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,209
Is this the first snow?

665
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,129
I guess so.

666
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:17,464
It's so pretty.

667
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,593
I guess so.

668
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:57,671
Your hand is cold.

669
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,592
I'll hold your hand

670
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,386
until it gets warm.

671
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,183
Would that be okay?

672
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,302
By the way,

673
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,307
isn't today Friday?

674
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,820
Why did you take me to the hospital?

675
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,907
Just let me die.

676
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:11,161
A jerk like me should die.

677
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,038
You're ridiculous!

678
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,540
I just saved your life.

679
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,460
I can't think of anything.

680
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,380
I want to draw anything.

681
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:24,341
I haven't been able to draw
for the past three years.

682
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:28,345
So you're the one who saved me.
You should've let me die.

683
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:30,097
In-su, help me.

684
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,182
Please stop it.

685
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,101
Mr. Gu.

686
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:36,061
Please let go of him.

687
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,528
Didn't I tell you

688
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:47,864
that you shouldn't wear a tie
in the emergency room?

689
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,450
-Dr. Jeong.
-Yes?

690
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,410
You treat him.

691
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,997
I can't stand it anymore!

692
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:58,000
-Please calm down.
-Let go of me.

693
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:01,753
Dr. Song, Teacher Kim is
in the ICU right now.

694
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,797
What is he doing there?

695
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:04,881
He's just

696
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,467
sitting there.

697
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,054
What should I do?

698
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,180
What do you mean?

699
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,891
He's just sitting there.
What do you want me to do?

700
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:16,226
-Ms. Ji.
-Yes?

701
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,061
You don't see what's going on here?

702
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,147
Can't you see how chaotic it is?

703
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,733
No one is helping.

704
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:45,297
Ma'am.

705
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,798
It hurts so much.

706
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,640
I really think she has aerodermectasia.

707
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:57,267
AERODERMECTASIA: PRESENCE OF AIR IN THE
TISSUES JUST UNDER THE SKIN

708
00:48:57,351 --> 00:49:01,521
-Miss, please help me!
-What's wrong, Ma'am?

709
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:02,606
Can't you breathe?

710
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:04,066
Please.

711
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:07,778
Doctor!

712
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,365
Doctor!

713
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:14,034
What should I do?

714
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:16,787
Miss.

715
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,632
What should I do?

716
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:26,106
Yeon-hwa.

717
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,442
Mr. Park.

718
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,528
Go bring Teacher Kim.

719
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:36,950
He's probably in the ICU.
Bring him here right now.

720
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:37,909
Hurry.

721
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:48,754
It snowed in Seoul, Gyeonggi Province
and Gangwon Province

722
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:50,589
for the first time this year.

723
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:52,841
It stopped snowing in an hour,

724
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:55,844
but the cold wind starts to blow
this evening,

725
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:58,305
-and the temperature will drop.
-I'm glad it's not a heavy snow.

726
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,681
-Aren't you?
-As the road may freeze,

727
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:03,310
-please be careful when driving.
-This could be more dangerous.

728
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:06,688
-The road becomes like an ice rink.
-The temperature will be between...

729
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:18,366
LOST PROPERTY PROCESSING VEHICLE

730
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,836
I hate when it snows.
It makes our work even harder.

731
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,963
Let's hurry up and go home.

732
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,675
It's so slippery here.

733
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,385
Be careful.

734
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:39,930
The road is so slippery.

735
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:12,879
In the emergency room?

736
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,465
Yes, Doctor. We have a problem
in the emergency room.

737
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:16,883
I think you should come.

738
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,023
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

739
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,035
I think she has aerodermectasia.

740
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:47,455
Did you say she did this?

741
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:48,540
Yes, I think so.

742
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:54,045
Where were the doctors
while she was doing it?

743
00:52:59,175 --> 00:53:01,678
Please give her antibiotics first.

744
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,221
Call Dr. Song.

745
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,307
Call Dr. Nam and tell him

746
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,684
we have an emergency surgery
for a Boerhaave's syndrome patient.

747
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:08,977
Yes, Doctor.

748
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,771
-Please calm down.
-Can anyone help us?

749
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,357
-Please lie down.
-Let me die. I should die.

750
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:17,444
Hey! Be quiet!

751
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:20,906
I can't treat other patients
because of you.

752
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:24,993
Sir, hello.

753
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:29,623
Get treated and just go home. All right?

754
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:30,707
Yes, sir.

755
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,338
What just happened?

756
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:39,424
He comes to the emergency room
quite often.

757
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:41,551
I heard he's a webtoon artist,

758
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,470
but I haven't seen his webtoon before.

759
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:46,890
Oh, no. What should I do?

760
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,477
I think I need you to disinfect this cut.

761
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,939
Please bring me a dressing set.

762
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:08,078
-Ms. Woo.
-Yes?

763
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:12,082
Could you explain what happened
with the patient?

764
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:18,964
We'll be there in 20 minutes.

765
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:22,008
What will Teacher Kim say?

766
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,636
It's obvious.

767
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:27,514
You stupid brat.

768
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:31,226
You're so weak-minded.

769
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:35,271
How can you be a doctor?

770
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,816
Can you still call yourself a doctor?

771
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,486
No. You're an orderly.

772
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,863
As a mere orderly,

773
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,700
how dare you run away after leaving
just your resignation letter behind?

774
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:48,952
What are you doing?

775
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:51,162
I sounded like him, right?

776
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:56,876
Never do that again, Seo-jeong.

777
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,464
Never disappear again
without telling me anything.

778
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:05,260
Don't do that. Okay?

779
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,389
You're acting up again.

780
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,433
Promise me.

781
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:20,316
Fine. You can talk to me like that.

782
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:22,819
Just for today.

783
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:28,950
No!

784
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,664
I heard you are Chinese.

785
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:36,249
Is that right?

786
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,377
-Yes.
-Are you a medical student?

787
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:41,379
Ms. Woo.

788
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:45,050
We are not scolding you.
We are just trying to grasp the fact.

789
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:48,011
We need you
to answer our questions honestly.

790
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:54,184
Teacher Kim.

791
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:56,895
Dr. Song is not answering the phone.

792
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:02,692
He's not answering his phone,
and he's not in the hospital.

793
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:06,446
Please go downtown.

794
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:09,324
I think he's left for the day.

795
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:11,951
What?

796
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:14,370
How is that even possible?

797
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:16,915
He knows the situation at the hospital.

798
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:18,750
How could he leave like that?

799
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:39,896
I will

800
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:41,898
perform the surgery.

801
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:43,942
Go prepare for the operation.

802
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:45,318
Will you be okay?

803
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:48,863
It doesn't matter if I'm okay or not.

804
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:50,698
Please get ready.

805
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:58,331
You just violated our instructions.

806
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:01,543
We clearly told you

807
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:05,421
it could cause you harm
in some way if you did so.

808
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,260
Mr. Park.

809
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:13,638
Transfer the patient to the operating room

810
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,598
and prepare for the operation.

811
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:16,683
Yes, Doctor.

812
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:20,019
Stop it right now.

813
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:23,231
What if something goes wrong
with the patient?

814
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:24,816
-Step aside.
-It seems you are

815
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:27,235
trying to use the patient as an excuse.

816
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:28,486
You can't do that.

817
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,738
I told you to step aside.

818
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:32,449
And I said, no.

819
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,367
You jerk.

820
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:00,435
Seo-jeong, are you all right?

821
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:02,687
-Did you get hurt?
-No.

822
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:05,106
I'm okay. I didn't get hurt.

823
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,859
What about you? Are you okay?

824
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:10,820
Stay in the car.
I will go see what happened.

825
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,214
What's wrong? What happened?

826
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:14,926
