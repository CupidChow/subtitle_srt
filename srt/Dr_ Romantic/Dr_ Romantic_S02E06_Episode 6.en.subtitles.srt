A gunshot victim from area 14.

3
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,212
Officer down.

4
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,548
A gunshot patient.

00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,133
A gunshot victim from area 14.

00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,384
Officer down.

00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:03,855
Sir.

9
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,566
Yes, Jung-bae. I'm right here.

10
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,234
Stay with me a little longer.

11
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,028
We're almost at Doldam Hospital.

12
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,696
Stay with me, kid. Okay?

13
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,823
No.

14
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,366
Hey, Jung-bae.

15
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,785
Jung-bae!

16
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,286
Excuse me.

17
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,080
Can you hurry? Hurry up!

DOLDAM HOSPITAL

19
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:35,929
Move him!

20
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,555
Jung-bae, wake up!

21
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,308
Wake up, Jung-bae!

22
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,060

DOLDAM HOSPITAL

25
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,398
Get him in there!

26
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,150
-Over here!
-Boss!

27
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,693
Wake up, boss!

28
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,028
Move out of my way!

29
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,446
-Move it!
-Move over!

30
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:54,906
Darn you! Let me in!

31
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:55,949
-Boss!
-Boss!

32
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:56,991
-Let go!
-Let me in!

33
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,202
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

34
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,037
-Boss!
-Hey, Jung-bae!

35
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,248
Jung-bae, wake up!

36
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,541
Patient incoming!

37
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,459
Mom, I have to go. Okay?

38
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,627
-Boss!
-Boss!

39
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,920
Boss, wake up!

40
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,505
There's a gunshot patient!

41
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,298
His vitals?

42
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,134
Before transfer, a BP of 80 over 40

43
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,426
and a 130 bpm heart rate.

44
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,220
-Move to bed three.
-Got it.

45
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,764
Do the triage procedure

46
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,349
-and put a card up.
-Yes, ma'am.

47
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,643
The patient was stabbed in the chest!

48
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,020
-In the chest?
-Yes.

49
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,314
His BP is 90 over 40,
and heart rate is 130 bpm.

50
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,441
Did you remove the knife
when you found him?

51
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,110
The knife wasn't there then.

52
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,194
To the hybrid room.

53
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,572
Boss. Don't worry, boss!

54
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:37,657
This way.

55
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,244
-Boss!
-Boss!

56
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,328
Boss. Boss?

57
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,164
-Where's my boss?
-Boss!

58
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,290
-Boss.
-Boss!

59
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,207
Excuse me, stop.

60
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,042
-Where is he?
-Boss!

61
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,544
Where is he?

62
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:50,712
Where's our boss?

63
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,589
-Boss!
-Where is he?

64
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,841
Man, they're here again.

65
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,596
Mr. Gu, you need to hurry.

66
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,097
ADMIN OFFICE

67
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,279
Where are you?

68
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,657
Come to my office immediately.

69
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,737
Hey, Mr. Jang.

70
00:03:58,696 --> 00:03:59,530
I found these.

71
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,659
Later. We need to take care
of the emergency.

72
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,620
Where is he?

73
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,458
Establish both lines.
Drop two liters of warm saline.

74
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,753
I need a central venous catheter!
Bring five packs and five more RBCs.

75
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,004
-Yes, sir.
-Doctor Yoon!

76
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,381
Get his pulse back!

77
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,423
Yes, coming!

78
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:19,884
Scissors, please.

79
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,179
-And his central line?
-Warm saline till we get blood.

80
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,139
-Nurse Um, warm saline.
-Okay.

81
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,397
Bring lots of gauze!

82
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,732
EB! Bring a lot of EB! Hurry!

83
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,775
What's going on?

84
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,026
Vitals?

85
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,569
He's at 80 over 40, 130 bpm.

86
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,738
-Let's see his echocardiogram.
-Okay.

87
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,283
Bring the chest portable.

88
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,743
Establish both lines
and put him on warm saline.

89
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,828
Six liters of oxygen.

90
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:47,829
Got it.

91
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,414
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY

92
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,624
What? Cardiac tamponade?

93
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,043
CARDIAC TAMPONADE: HEART COMPRESSION

94
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,003
Pericardiocentesis.

95
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,462
-Prep the central lines.
-Okay.

96
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:57,839
Yes.

97
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,300
The gunshot wound patient got here.

98
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,304
There's the small bowel.

99
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,224
Resection from here to here.

100
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:09,934
And we'll do

101
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,853
an end-to-end anastomosis.

102
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:12,770
Yes, sir.

103
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:14,689
His vitals all right?

104
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,233
Bleeding's been treated,
so he's stabilizing.

105
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,944
You can wrap up the rest of the surgery.

106
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,196
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

107
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,455
Bovie, please.

108
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,084
-What are they doing?
-What's happening?

109
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,461
Move aside.

110
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,628
Oh, gosh.

111
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:41,924
Goodness.

112
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:42,925
What are they doing?

113
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,469
-Boss.
-What are they placing?

114
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,012
What are we going to do?

115
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:48,973
What's his BP?

116
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,099
He's at 80 over 40.

117
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,393
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY

118
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,520
-What?
-What is that?

119
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,521
What's she doing?

120
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,231
-What's she doing to him?
-Goodness.

121
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,858
-Man.
-What's she doing?

122
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,110
What's that brat doing to our boss?

123
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,904
She just pierced his chest

124
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,655
with a long metal skewer.

125
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:10,912
What is that?

126
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:11,913
Boss!

127
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,165
Please move aside.

128
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,209
What is this little jerkâ€¦

129
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,048
You're disturbing his treatment.
Please move aside.

130
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,926
This way, sir.

131
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,345
-Oh, that way?
-Yes.

132
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,348
Why is there a bear at the hospital?

133
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,437
The chest portable.

134
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:37,980
I just asked,

135
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,816
where are your doctors?

136
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,901
As you can see, they're doing

137
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,903
their best to treat them inside.

138
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,321
Not those little kids!

139
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,365
I meant Doctor Kim! Where's Doctor Kim?

140
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:50,076
He's operating at the moment, Detective.

141
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,285
Our new recruit is

142
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,664
about to pass away from the gunshot wound!

143
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,333
Will you just bring Doctor Kim right now?

144
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,210
We can't let you do that.

145
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,633
Our boss is on the brink of death too.

146
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,886
You can't steal Doctor Kim like that.

147
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,180
There's a proper order for everything.

148
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,557
Move, you jerks.

149
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,226
There are times when we can move
and times when we can't.

150
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,727
I don't care right now.

151
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,146
All right.

152
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,899
I don't care about anything either.

153
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,484
Do you all want to die?

154
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,777
-Sir, calm down.
-Let go!

155
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,695
Hey, calm down.

156
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,281
Boys.

157
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,824
Did you just hear that?

158
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,161
Let's all die here tonight

159
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,663
along with our big boss.

160
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,165
Yes, sir!

161
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,666
-I'll kill you.
-How dare you?

162
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:39,709
Get lost, you jerk.

163
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,586
-Don't touch him!
-Move!

164
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,129
Lower your head!

165
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,590
You can't do this here! Please calm down.

166
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,133
-You jerk!
-How dare you!

167
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,676
What are you all doing?

168
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,433
WE HOPE TO SEE YOU HEALTHY

169
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,645
Goodness. Doctor Kim.

170
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,109
What's all this ruckus?

171
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,361
Don't you know this is a hospital?

172
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:08,863
It's Jung-bae.

173
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,324
He was shot.

174
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,202
Was it Detective Shin

175
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,745
who was shot with a gun?

176
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,330
Our bossâ€¦

177
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,832
was stabbedâ€¦

178
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,667
He was stabbed in the chest.

179
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,212
Soo-chul was stabbed again?

180
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,509
Why do you never fight fairly

181
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,552
with just your bare hands?

182
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,721
Why in the world would you fight

183
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,264
with something that dangerous?

184
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,016
We're already busy as it is!

185
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,644
Exactly, Doctor Kim.

186
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,604
And it's Friday, our busiest day.

187
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,231
These jerks

188
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,525
got drunk and got into a gang fight!

189
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,109
No, I said it's not like that.

190
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,529
The Starfish Gang started the fight!

191
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,239
-What was that?
-It was them!

192
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,490
-What are you doing?
-Hey!

193
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,616
-Don't touch him!
-Move!

194
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,117
Stop it, you two. Be quiet!

195
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,537
Shut it before I rip both of your mouths.

196
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,623
-Mr. Jang!
-Yes.

197
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,583
Get rid of all of them.

198
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,502
Goodness.

199
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,420
I'm sick and tired of all of you.

200
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:08,548
Move.

201
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,386
You heard him.

202
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,680
You can all calm down.

203
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:20,059
Those of you in this particular industry
can go to the waiting room in the lobby.

204
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,437
Detectives, you can go
to the ER waiting room.

205
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:24,981
Thank you very much.

206
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,528
Doctor Kim?

207
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,614
WE HOPE TO SEE YOU HEALTHY

208
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,706
Goodness, those jerks.

209
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,377
How's the gunshot patient?

210
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,713
I got his pulse back.
We have him on warm saline.

211
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,007
It looks like the wound
is around his liver.

212
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,800
What about the exit wound?

213
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,469
Why? You didn't see any?

214
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,512
No.

215
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,307
I checked his back too,
but I found no exit wound.

216
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,143
His heart rate's dropping, Doctor Kim.

217
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,937
He's in PEA. He's in PEA!

218
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,064
Give him epinephrine.

219
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,775
-And intubate him too.
-Doctor Kim.

220
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,320
I think he has
a penetrating injury in his heart.

221
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:13,988
-Is it cardiac?
-Yes.

222
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,324
I drew blood five times,
but it keeps seeping.

223
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,366
His vitals?

224
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,076
His initial systole was 80.

225
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,370
I did a pericardiocentesis,
so it went to 100.

226
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,455
But it's at 90 now.

227
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:23,706
Should we get to the OR?

228
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,167
Okay. Fix the 22 cm right here.
Take this out.

229
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,419
Nurse Um.

230
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,463
Can you call OR one and ask

231
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,173
how much longer they'll be?

232
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,382
Please hurry up and ask.

233
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,425
Yes, Doctor Kim.

234
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:41,932
What's going on?

235
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,684
An emergency operation?

236
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:44,727
Follow me.

237
00:10:58,783 --> 00:10:59,659
Hey.

238
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,494
Where's my husband?

239
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,870
Where is he?

240
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,248
Doctor Kim just went in.

241
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:07,750
He'll be fine.

242
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,251
Oh, noâ€¦

243
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,052
Let's check his rhythm.

244
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,639
His pulse came back. He has ROSC.

245
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,849
ROSC: RETURN OF SPONTANEOUS CIRCULATION

246
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,268
-Where's the blood?
-It's right here.

247
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,855
Set up the RIS and give him blood.

248
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,024
-And get the OR ready.
-Yes, sir.

249
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,609
Take the patient

250
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,361
to OR two right now.

251
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,197
Wait. Everyone, stop.

252
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,247
He a gunshot patient?

253
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,373
Yes.

254
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,084
He was in arrest,
so he needs emergency surgery.

255
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,002
Does he have to be operated on?

256
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,591
"Does he have to be"?

257
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,343
What do you mean?

258
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,387
If he had arrest with a gunshot wound,

259
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,765
it means there is
severe damage to his major organs.

260
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:05,766
So what?

261
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,518
A doctor shouldn't continue

262
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,521
to work on a patient
whose condition is beyond our control.

263
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,606
You should look after

264
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,734
patients that you can save.

265
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,318
It looks like

266
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,320
that patient is in need of a CS.

267
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,905
CS: CARDIAC SURGERY

268
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,456
Mom.

269
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,623
Mom.

270
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:30,833
Dad.

271
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,334
Mom.

272
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,837
Mom.

273
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,799
Doctor Seo is wrapping up.

274
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,427
He'll finish in 15 minutes
and clean out the OR.

275
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,723
All right. Move the gunshot patient
to OR two right now.

276
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:46,682
Yes, sir.

277
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:48,642
Doctor Kim.

278
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,395
What about the penetration wound patient?

279
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:55,983
Open him up

280
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,651
and put staples on him for now.

281
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,738
Me? Right here?

282
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,240
Are you insane?

283
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,534
You're asking a kid
who can't perform surgery

284
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,077
because of nausea to do what?

285
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,078
And right here?

286
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,705
The bowel perforation case

287
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,040
in OR one is almost done,

288
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,500
so control his bleeding

289
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,460
just until we get him into the OR. Okay?

290
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,669
Doctor Bu Yong-ju.

291
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,546
You might lose both patients like that!

292
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,173
You're way too loud.

293
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,592
Someone told me that

294
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,929
the moment you give up,
you begin to look for excuses,

295
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,182
but when you think you can do it,
you'll find a way to do it.

296
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,143
If you're that worried,

297
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,854
you can work on the gunshot patient.

298
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,524
I thought you were an HPB specialist.

299
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:37,900
Right?

300
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,152
It's a great chance for you to show off.

301
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,738
Stop looking for excuses to run away.

302
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,492
-Hey, Runner.
-Yes?

303
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:47,701
Can you do it?

304
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,705
Yes, I can do it.

305
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,341
Let's go.

306
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,021
Hey.

307
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,565
Make a wise decision.

308
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:21,527
If something goes wrong,
only you will be responsible for him.

309
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,070
Okay?

310
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,034
Are you really going to do it?

311
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,080
Please prepare for sedation.

312
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,331
I'll be back soon.

313
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:46,802
Cut.

314
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,137
Cut.

315
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:52,892
We're done.

316
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,060
You can take the patient to the ICU.

317
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,855
Great work, Doctor Seo.

318
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,106
Then I'll go work on

319
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,858
the gunshot patient.

320
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,446
One second.

321
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:12,036
You shouldn't make such a mistake
after performing good surgery.

322
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,081
Nurse Park.
Please take the patient to the ICU.

323
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,792
Let's go, Doctor Seo.

324
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,755
Great work.

325
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,525
Doctor Cha Eun-jae?

326
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,319
You're the oneâ€¦

327
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,239
who put that skewer into our boss's chest,

328
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,615
aren't you?

329
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,534
What's this about?

330
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,244
What is it?

331
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,581
If, out of a million chances,

332
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,167
anything happens to our boss,

333
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,669
then I willâ€¦

334
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,966
kill you and kill myself too.

335
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,262
Pull yourself together

336
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,472
and do your best.

337
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,975
Got it, Doctor?

338
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,151
Move aside.

339
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,696
The patient will be in danger if we delay.

340
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,700
Aren't you going to move?

341
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,714
Put all the blinds down!

342
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,433
If you can't do it, don't.

343
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:40,976
Don't strain yourself.

344
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,811
Doctor Kim told me to do it.

345
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,772
And if he told me to do it,

346
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,399
that means he believes I can do this.

347
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,860
Aren't you scared of Professor Park?

348
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,111
I am.

349
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,490
But at Doldam Hospital,
my boss is Doctor Kim.

350
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,284
His order is my priority.

351
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,244
That's how I can survive.

352
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,455
He's the boss of a gang.

353
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,624
If anything goes wrong, your life will be

354
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,668
like a "Bridge over Troubled Water."

355
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,222
Man, you're driving me insane.

356
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:33,070
I thought Mad Whale was
the only one who did open-heart in the ER.

357
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:39,660
What did I do so wrong in my past life
that I got involved with the two of them?

358
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,121
Give me the Betadine.

359
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,751
Drape, please.

360
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,223
Scalpel.

361
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,610
Bovie.

362
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,450
Sternal saw.

363
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,828
STERNAL SAW: A STERNUM CUTTER

364
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,083
Give it to me.

365
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,857
-What's that?
-What's she doing?

366
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,193
-What's that?
-What's going on?

367
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,277
Sir.

368
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,328
Sternum retractor.

369
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,227
We're about to see a lot of blood.

370
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:32,147
Get a lot of gauze ready
and get the suction and a stapler too.

371
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,399
Scissors.

372
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,662
-Darn it.
-Gauze.

373
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,293
Please.

374
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:55,671
Please.

375
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:58,840
Not yet?

376
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,304
Hey, not yet?

377
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,937
I found it. Right here.
Give me the stapler.

378
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,526
Stay calm, Eun-jae.

379
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:28,787
Are you done?

380
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:31,873
How are his vitals?

381
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:32,916
He's at 90 over 40

382
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,917
and 100 bpm.

383
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,629
Yes.

384
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,131
We're done.

385
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,633
My gosh.

386
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,721
Doctor Cha, it's the OR.

387
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,348
Yes?

388
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,349
What happened?

389
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,810
There was an open wound in the RV
about 1 cm long.

390
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,854
I stopped the bleeding with a stapler.

391
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:54,896
Suction.

392
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,484
Get that patient to OR one right now.

393
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,194
Yes, sir.

394
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,073
Shouldn't you head over there too?

395
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,493
If there's an RV wound,
Doctor Cha can't do that herself.

396
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,204
Let's focus on finding the bullet first.

397
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,917
I can barely see anything
because of all the bleeding.

398
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:17,878
Pringle.

399
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,633
Hold this.

400
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,806
-Boss.
-Move aside.

401
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,807
-Go!
-Coming through.

402
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:31,975
-What's going on?
-Move.

403
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,018
-Boss!
-What happened?

404
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,269
-Boss!
-Move aside.

405
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,479
-Boss!
-What's going on?

406
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,646
-Goodness.
-Boss!

407
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,315
What happened?

408
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,067
This is killing me.

409
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,902
Great work, Doctor Jung.

410
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:43,904
You did very well.

411
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,739
I think I'll die of a heart attack

412
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,949
before I die from overwork.

413
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:50,827
You should get some rest.

414
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,496
Starting now, I'll manage.

415
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,164
We have a patient!

416
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,140
This place is so chaotic.

417
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,351
There are no rules, principles,

418
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,394
or a manual.

419
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,020
Everything is a mess.

420
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,775
Anyway, where's Professor Park?

421
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,414
I thought you were an HPB specialist.

422
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,958
It's a great chance for you to show off.

423
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,627
Stop looking for excuses to run away.

424
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,299
Come out!

425
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,351
Long forceps.

426
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,492
His liver is more damaged than I expected.

427
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,995
The other patient went into OR one.

428
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:17,164
They asked if they can anesthetize him.

429
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:38,810
Yes.

430
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,353
This is Park Min-gook.

431
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,147
How long are you going to

432
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,607
stand around and watch?

433
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:48,528
I took out the bullet and moved on
to segmentectomy of segment seven.

434
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,864
I did the Pringle maneuver
seven minutes ago,

435
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:53,909
and there's a CS patient
waiting for a doctor in OR one.

436
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,036
Are you asking me for a favor?

437
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:56,953
No.

438
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,956
I'm telling you to fulfill your duty.

439
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:09,466
What?

440
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,718
He just left. What do we do?

441
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:18,934
Tell OR one

442
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,685
to start anesthetizing him.

443
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:21,895
Yes, sir.

444
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:23,772
What about this surgery?

445
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,106
I'll do it.

446
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,901
It's too dangerous for a second year
to work on a liver.

447
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,403
I'm not looking down on you, Doctor Seo.

448
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:33,406
I'm saying you need more experience
to perform this surgery.

449
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,034
That's why I called the experienced guy.

450
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,911
He just left, Doctor Kim.

451
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,247
I'll just do it. Please let me do it.

452
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,164
I can do it.

453
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,923
We're changing hands.

454
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,384
Starting now,

455
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,178
Doctor Park Min-gook is the lead surgeon.

456
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,475
Save his life.

457
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,702
-How long has the Pringle been there?
-13 minutes.

458
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:19,619
Large tape.

459
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,666
Bovie.

460
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,461
Pringle off.

461
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,508
-Suction.
-CUSA.

462
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,435
RESTRICTED: OPERATING ROOM

463
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,477
What?

464
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,729
He's in the OR?

465
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:47,063
Professor Park?

466
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:49,566
I called just in case,
and I heard he went in.

467
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,067
That can't be right.

468
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,737
He went in by himself without calling me?

469
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,156
His first assistant is Doctor Seo.

470
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:58,867
Seo Woo-jin?

471
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,371
We need to find Glisson's capsule
to segment seven, cut it

472
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,749
to control the bleeding,
and get a clear view.

473
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,375
Bulldog clamp.

474
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,384
Segment seven seems to be changing colors.

475
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,594
We got the right part.

476
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:19,512
Bovie.

477
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:21,890
CUSA.

478
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,145
Since we found the Glisson's
to segment seven,

479
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,438
we'll clip it all at once.

480
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,023
GLISSON'S CAPSULE: CAPSULE OF THE LIVER

481
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,233
I can see the veins.

482
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,277
Vascular stapler, please.

483
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:45,955
You've got some skills.

484
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,541
Yes, I guess.

485
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:50,293
Good.

486
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,629
Let's control the bleeding
and finish this.

487
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,005
Bovie.

488
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:23,827
Darn it.

489
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,583
It's not completely penetrated.

490
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,961
I think it's just stuck in the scapula.

491
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,088
Should we repair it in the ER?

492
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:38,007
Come on, it's an open fracture.
He needs to be in the OR.

493
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:39,843
We need to see

494
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,679
if there's any damage to his thigh area.

495
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,681
There's no OR available now, Doctor Bae.

496
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:45,598
Really?

497
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,435
Since his vitals are stable,

498
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,395
let's wait and go once an OR's ready.

499
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,396
Forget it.

500
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:52,897
Just take it out.

501
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,817
This isn't my first time
getting hit with a hatchet.

502
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,818
I'm sorry, sir.

503
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,195
It may be uncomfortable,
but give us a moment.

504
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,488
Hey.

505
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,742
I have no time to sit around.

506
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,536
Take this out

507
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,497
or get me to another hospital.

508
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,124
-Come on.
-Well,

509
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,084
we can't stop you from

510
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,502
going to another hospital.

511
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,005
But if that hatchet comes out

512
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,965
while you risk the journey,

513
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,009
you could have excessive bleeding,

514
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,178
which may even lead to death.

515
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,054
I'm telling you ahead of time.

516
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,641
Do you still want to leave?

517
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,146
Excuse me, sir.

518
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,899
It must hurt. You should lie down.

519
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,859
We'll take it out once we have an OR.

520
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,196
Be gentle.

521
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:43,114
Don't let the hatchet come out.

522
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,701
Please be careful.

523
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:50,622
I'll be gentle.

524
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:51,956
That's it. Good.

525
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,208
That's good.

526
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:54,542
Great job.

527
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:57,670
All right.

528
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,349
I'm sorry.

529
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,686
I couldn't protect him.

530
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:19,943
Mom.

531
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,362
Dad.

532
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:23,863
Mom.

533
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,240
Mom.

534
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,491
Mom.

535
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,076
Mom.

536
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:28,993
Mom.

537
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,245
Gosh, darn it.

538
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,790
Staple remover, please.

539
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,177
There's no bleeding.

540
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,012
There's no contamination either.

541
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,222
PRESENCE OF IMPURITIES

542
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:52,559
Soo-chul. You're lucky.

543
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,019
Dr. Runner here performed

544
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,438
an excellent emergency treatment.

545
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,569
I'm pretty good
when I set my mind on something.

546
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,196
Are you nauseated?

547
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:06,948
No.

548
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:08,783
And no hyperpnea?

549
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,703
No. I'm completely fine.

550
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:12,912
Suture.

551
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:14,789
Pardon?

552
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:16,875
Suture!

553
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:19,794
Suture, please.

554
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,380
Good.

555
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:27,969
My gosh, man.

556
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,346
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

557
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,724
Where in the world is that woman?

558
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:07,216
Soo-jinâ€¦

559
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:21,022
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

560
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:25,652
Mr. Jang.

561
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,195
What is this?

562
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,280
It was on the chair in the waiting room.

563
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,449
It looks like Mr. Yeo's hat.

564
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,992
Why is Mr. Yeo's hat here?

565
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,118
And this.

566
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:36,663
What?

567
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,010
-Great job.
-Great work.

568
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:51,928
Great work.

569
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:52,929
-Okay.
-Great work.

570
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:54,806
-Great work.
-Goodness.

571
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:58,935
Cut.

572
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:00,687
How are his vitals?

573
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,195
Doctor Kim is overdoing it again.

574
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,781
I'm so glad Professor Park

575
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,616
switched with him in the middle.

576
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,452
And he's pretty talented too.

577
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,998
If we have a surgeon like him
here at Doldam Hospital,

578
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,625
it'll be less strain on Doctor Kim.

579
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,545
He still can't be the president.

580
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,215
Mr. Yeo is still going strong.

581
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,677
And even if he is to retire,

582
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,929
I believe Doctor Kim is

583
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,390
the only one who can replace him.

584
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:09,213
So?

585
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,340
Did the surgery end well?

586
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,219
The patient is in the ICU.

587
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:17,513
That's good, then.

588
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,058
What were you going to do

589
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,392
if I hadn't come in?

590
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,186
What do you think?

591
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,898
I'd have jumped between the two ORs
and somehow finished both surgeries.

592
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,651
Have you always made

593
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:32,570
such dangerous

594
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,113
and risky decisions?

595
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,074
That's the thing about this hospital.

596
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:38,284
We get swarmed by patients

597
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,244
who need emergency operations,

598
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,246
and I must make a judgment call

599
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,165
depending on each situation.

600
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:45,458
At times,

601
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,002
I need to be ready to take a risk.

602
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,880
So how many patients have you killed?

603
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:56,719
Soâ€¦

604
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,597
there are many more patients

605
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,973
we have saved.

606
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,352
You are

607
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,270
a more dangerous man than I thought,

608
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:07,730
Doctor Bu Yong-ju.

609
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,191
That's why I told you

610
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:13,027
this isn't an elegant place

611
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,696
where you can operate
with classical music playing.

612
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,032
Don't get carried away.

613
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,118
You should stop now and go back.

614
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,037
I have a different opinion.

615
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,707
After seeing this situation,

616
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:30,044
I can see what this hospital needs.

617
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:32,964
I must straighten out this system

618
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,632
that rolls around spontaneously

619
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:37,009
without any set manual.

620
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,305
And, Doctor Bu, to do thatâ€¦

621
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:46,727
I need to keep that wild behavior
of yours under control.

622
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,568
Doctor Kim.

623
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,279
That's whatâ€¦

624
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,323
everyone calls me around hereâ€¦

625
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,034
Doctor Park.

626
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,090
RESTRICTED: OPERATING ROOM

627
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,427
Professor Park Min-gook

628
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,387
has done a great job on his surgery.

629
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,016
That's him.

630
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,728
-Doctor, thank you so much.
-Sure.

631
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:29,896
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

632
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:30,855
-Sure.
-Thank you.

633
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,565
We were really worried.

634
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:33,941
Goodness.

635
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,318
Thank you.

636
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,197
Thank you so much.

637
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,753
What are you doing here?

638
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:54,921
Hey, Moon-jung.

639
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,298
-Do you have another surgery?
-Yes.

640
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,469
The patient with the hatchet wound.

641
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,429
It's an open fracture.

642
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,349
Gosh, this place is utter chaos.

643
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,976
I thought this small-town hospital
would be dead quiet.

644
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,063
I thought the same thing
when I applied for a position here.

645
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,690
I thought I'd have more time for hobbies.

646
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,610
But it's more chaotic
than most trauma centers.

647
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:18,527
You're right.

648
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:22,323
But being insanely busy comes with perks.

649
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,700
Your mind becomes less crowded.

650
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,744
No time for useless thoughts.

651
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:30,164
And who knew I'd fix my OR phobia here?

652
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,001
Any side effects? None?

653
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,003
None.

654
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,839
Other than the sudden onset of hunger.

655
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,470
Let's grab a bite to drink sometime.

656
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,143
Hello, Moon-jung.

657
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,606
I recently joined the Bone Club.

658
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,734
People call me Delicate Phalanx,
but my name is Cha Eun-jae.

659
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,111
And?

660
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,863
I have some questions about the bones

661
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,615
that I've been studying.

662
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,701
When you have some time,

663
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,577
can we grab a bite to drink?

664
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,332
-Grab a drink or a bite to eat?
-Sorry?

665
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,047
Let me know when you decide.

666
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,843
Let me know when you decide.

667
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,555
RESTRICTED AREA: OPERATING ROOM

668
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,809
What was that about?

669
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,570
Check his Hemovac often.

670
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:43,863
Sure, no problem.

671
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,641
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

672
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,435
My gosh.

673
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,608
He hasn't woken up from anesthesia yet.

674
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,610
He needs to rest until--

675
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:23,569
Guys.

676
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:24,820
Yes, boss!

677
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,700
To Doctor Cha Eun-jaeâ€¦

678
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,369
bow.

679
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,828
Doctor Cha Eun-jae!

680
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,246
Thank you!

681
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,503
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

682
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,842
Doctor Kim told me everything.

683
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,053
He said that you, Doctor Cha,

684
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,597
saved our big bossâ€¦

685
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,395
You saved our boss's life.

686
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:02,233
Well, I didn't exactly save his life.

687
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,986
I just performed an emergency procedure
and stopped the bleeding.

688
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,239
We will repay you

689
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,491
for the rest of our lives.

690
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:15,204
-Pardon me?
-From now on, you, Doctor Cha,

691
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:18,040
are the number two here,

692
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,918
with Doctor Kim being the number one.

693
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,003
Wellâ€¦

694
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,380
If you ever have a problem

695
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:27,425
or any difficulties while you're here,

696
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:30,010
please don't hesitate

697
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,512
to get in touch with me.

698
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,769
Very well.

699
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,105
Rest up, Doctor Cha.

700
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,607
Rest up, Dr. Cha!

701
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,278
-You can pass.
-I'm going this way.

702
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,405
-I see. Go on, then.
-Okay.

703
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,305
The surgery went well.

704
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:18,142
We'll observe you for a day or two
and move you to the ward.

705
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,894
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

706
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,563
Why did you save me?

707
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,107
You should'veâ€¦

708
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,194
You should've just left me to die.

709
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:30,946
Whyâ€¦

710
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:33,449
So you'd suffer.

711
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,079
If you just die, you'll never realize

712
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,332
the weight of what you did.

713
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:46,837
A family suicide?

714
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:51,842
Don't fool yourself.

715
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,428
Your powerless children

716
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:58,057
were victims of your violence,
and you committed murder.

717
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,646
Don't blame it on your financial problems

718
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:05,231
or depression. You'reâ€¦

719
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,029
You're just a weak, cruel man.

720
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:14,615
Do you understand?

721
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,416
Beat yourself up and suffer forever.

722
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,168
Live in pain.

723
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,674
Pay for it for the rest of your life.

724
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,093
Only thenâ€¦

725
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,222
will it be fair for your dead child.

726
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,322
Aren't you hungry?

727
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,117
Everyone's gathered for some food.

728
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,285
Do you want to join?

729
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,161
No, I'm not hungry.

INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

732
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:58,469
It's okay.

733
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,767
You'll get better.

734
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,280
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

735

JEONGSEON LAKE

736
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:24,620
Seo Woo-jin, that punk, wouldn't come out.

737
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:28,666
What should we do, boss?
Shall I go in and drag him out?

738
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,250
Just leave him be.

739
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,253
He'll do anything if he's willing to die.

740
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:37,383
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

741
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,807
I have no idea what's going on.

742
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,184
I tried calling him, but no answer.

743
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:48,852
What is he thinking?

744
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:53,315
Did President Yeo say anything to you?

745
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:56,402
Who else knows about this letter?

746
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,779
Right now, it's just you and me.

747
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,573
And Mr. Lee, who found the letter.

748
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,412
For now, don't tell anyone about this.

749
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,998
Everyone is already exhausted.

750
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,001
We'll break the news tomorrow.

751
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:14,420
Even Ms. Oh?

752
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,799
Yes, let's not tell her yet.

753
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:21,510
I'm really worried.

754
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:25,139
When she finds out,
she'll be more upset than anyone else.

755
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:38,736
The situation called for it.

756
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,406
-Still, you should've--
-Cut it out.

757
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:43,991
I don't want to hear it.

758
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,368
-Gosh.
-Seriously?

759
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:47,703
Come on.

760
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,040
Are you going to do it?

761
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,250
Hey!

762
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,169
-Call Doctor Kim!
-Do it!

763
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:56,670
What are you doing here?

764
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,215
I'm just enjoying the laughter.

765
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:02,634
Gosh!

766
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:03,677
I must say,

767
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,179
it's nice to be young.

768
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,431
I thought they'd pass out from exhaustion.

769
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:11,685
Shall we have just one drink?

770
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,270
I'd love that.

771
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,105
I'll get ready to leave.

772
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,398
Are you an idiot?

773
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:22,237
-I'll be nice.
-Because you ateâ€¦

774
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,152
What?

775
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,822
Gosh.

776
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:07,783
What should I do?

777
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,701
Do I have to go into town?

778
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,204
It's freezing.

779
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:30,514
I'm sorry! My gosh.

780
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,849
I didn't see it coming.

781
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:33,767
What is wrong with you?

782
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:42,693
Eun-jae?

783
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,070
Woo-jin?

784
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,543
Good morning.

785
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,253
Good morning, Ms. Oh.

786
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,546
Where's President Yeo?

787
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:03,714
He's not here yet.

788
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:06,091
He's slightly later than usual.

789
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,343
He should have days like this too.

790
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,095
He works way too hard.

791
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,848
Wait, what is that?

792
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,558
Vitamins.

793
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,101
I thought he'd be rested

794
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,352
after his vacation,

795
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:19,438
but he still looks quite tired,

796
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,189
so I got him some vitamins.

797
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:22,566
Go on up.

798
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:23,817
All right.

799
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,907
Nurse Um.

800
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:31,783
Have you heard?

801
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:32,868
About what?

802
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:36,330
I heard we might have a new president.

803
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:37,664
What?

804
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,125
Who said that?

805
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,793
That's a load of rubbish.

806
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:45,589
Mr. Lee from the admin office.
He heard it from someone.

807
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,226
PRESIDENT YEO UN-YEONG

808
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,993
ONLY WATER ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS

809
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:19,748
Mr. Jang.

810
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:23,627
Mr. Jang!

811
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:29,549
Do you know
if something happened to President Yeo?

812
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:34,262
If something happened to him?
What do you mean?

813
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,932
I found this in his office just now.

814
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:39,017
Where is Doctor Kim?

815
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:40,310
Is he here now?

816
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:43,313
I think he slept in his office last night.

817
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:52,239
ONLY WATER ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS

818
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:57,035
I went to President Yeo's office just now
and found this stuck on a flowerpot.

819
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:01,248
OVERWATERING CAN MAKE THE ROOTS ROT

820
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,833
ONLY WATER ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS

821
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:09,381
His desk and the entire office
were cleaned out,

822
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:12,092
as if he went somewhere far away.

823
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:14,845
Doctor Kim.

824
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,681
Doctor Kim! Do you know what's going on?

825
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,719
EVERY BEGINNING HAS AN END

826
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:57,804
Leaving like this

827
00:50:58,638 --> 00:50:59,723
was probablyâ€¦

828
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,517
easier for him.

829
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,188
Take care, everyone.

830
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:10,525
Always keep the Doldam spirit in mind
and be yourselves.

831
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:18,033
He won't answer.

832
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:19,576
I tried calling him a few times.

833
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:21,578
Please leave a message after the tone.

834
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:25,832
Ms. Oh.

835
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,293
Please leave a message after--

836
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:30,378
Ms. Oh.

837
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,256
Still, this is just wrong!

838
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:34,883
Doctor Kim.

839
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:37,469
Weâ€¦

840
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,597
You see, President Yeoâ€¦

841
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,017
We cannot let him go like this.

842
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:46,520
Right, Doctor Kim?

843
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:49,898
Gosh, howâ€¦

844
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,525
how could he do this?

845
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:54,528
He left without a word,
without saying goodbye!

846
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,029
He just left us this letter!

847
00:51:58,448 --> 00:51:59,282
Doctor Kim.

848
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:00,617
What's going on?

849
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:02,661
What happened to President Yeo?

850
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,008
Let's talk.

851
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,552
-I have nothing to say.
-Wait.

852
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:24,015
That man in the car earlier.

853
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:27,561
He's the guy
who came to see you yesterday, right?

854
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:35,235
Are you being threatened?

855
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,362
What do you mean?

856
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:40,448
I actually saw you that night.

857
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,492
You were with those men.

858
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:56,923
This looks like ten million won.

859
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:58,341
Woo-jin.

860
00:52:58,633 --> 00:52:59,885
Is this a joke or what?

861
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,845
When will you pay off 70 million won?

862
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:03,263
Why is it 70 million won?

863
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,516
This ten million won
should bring it down to 40 million.

864
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,685
Hey, don't forget the interest.

865
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:12,647
Those men

866
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:15,233
are like loan sharks, right?

867
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,943
I said it's none of your business!

868
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,112
You should just call the police.

869
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:22,490
They show up late at night
and even come to your work to harass you.

870
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:23,909
I heard that's illegal.

871
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,578
Just report them to the police

872
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,496
so they can't harass you again.

873
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:32,375
Shall I call the police for you?

874
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,422
Hey, verbal threats are just as bad

875
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:38,757
as physical violence.

876
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,884
It's simply not acceptable.

877
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:42,469
It's considered a crime, okay?

878
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:53,480
What? Why? What is it?

879
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,107
Do you have a crush on me?

880
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:57,943
Whatâ€¦

881
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:02,989
You lunatic. What the heck?

882
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:05,408
If that's not the case,
mind your own business.

883
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:07,869
I'll take care of it, so stay out of it.

884
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:23,176
Darn it.

885
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,423
Am I the only one who's angry?

886
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:05,218
It must've been a tough decision for him.

887
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:08,680
And it's hard for me
to accept his decision.

888
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:11,599
I'm trying to understand him,
but this is just wrong.

889
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:14,811
Nevertheless, he decided to do this,

890
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,647
and I'm sure he had his reasons.

891
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:19,357
President Yeo and Doctor Kim.

892
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,067
Are you sayingâ€¦

893
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:23,987
Doctor Kim knew about it?

894
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:27,032
Knowing him, he wouldn't be so calm now

895
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:28,742
if he didn't know about it.

896
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:29,868
He would've grabbed

897
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:33,038
Do Yun-wan by the collar
or beaten him up already.

898
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:39,461
And I should point out
that neither President Yeo nor Doctor Kim

899
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,338
has made a decisionâ€¦

900
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,424
that let us down.

901
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:47,844
And they've never made a decision
that we couldn't follow.

902
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:51,973
When the time comesâ€¦

903
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:56,144
they'll tell us why this decision
had to be made.

904
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:57,896
Let's be patient

905
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,190
and wait until then, okay?

906
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:11,785
So?

907
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:14,621
Have you figured out a wayâ€¦

908
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:16,790
to push out Bu Yong-ju?

909
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,459
Perhaps.

910
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:21,294
That's an ambiguous answer.

911
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:24,339
At Doldam, it's nearly impossible to win

912
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:25,423
against that man.

913
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,634
Howeverâ€¦

914
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,345
we can disparage

915
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,764
what he believes is right.

916
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:35,975
How, exactly?

917
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,190
-You mean now?
-Yes, now.

918
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:44,317
They're emptying President Yeo's office.

919
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:45,652
Darn it.

920
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:48,321
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

921
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,160
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

922
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:56,871
No, this isâ€¦

923
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,128
What do we do, Nurse Um?

924
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,921
What Mr. Lee said must be true.

925
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:07,465
Gosh, this is crazy.

926
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:19,227
Nurse Park.

927
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:22,147
Did you know
that President Yeo was resigning?

928
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,065
No, I didn't know.

929
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:29,487
Must we keep it from everyone
even in this situation?

930
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,531
You promised that you would.

931
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:34,659
Nurse Um said he just left a letter

932
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:36,244
and nothing else.

933
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:39,622
Ms. Oh seems quite upset because of that.

934
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:43,585
Now that all of this has happened,
it's pointless to keep it a secret.

935
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:48,256
Wouldn't it be better
to just tell them the truth?

936
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,425
About what?

937
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:58,475
What are you talking about?

938
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:04,147
Nurse Park.

939
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,257
Who's there?

940
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:35,637
Is someone in there?

941
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:38,139
Are you in pain?

942
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:40,725
Hello?

943
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,071
Where is he now?

944
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:55,615
No.

945
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:56,950
Don't.

946
00:58:58,326 --> 00:58:59,494
That scumbag.

947
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,714
You.

948
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,216
Wake up.

949
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:17,053
-What's going on?
-Did you hit your wife?

950
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:24,143
Goodness.

951
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,064
Mind your own business.
Just go do your work, okay?

952
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:30,567
Hey!

953
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,362
Violence is simply unacceptable.
And exercising violence

954
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:36,155
against those who are weaker than you

955
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:37,657
is the worst.

956
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:40,451
You can't get lower than that!
Do you understand?

957
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:42,036
Goodness gracious.

958
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,580
Are you out of your mind?

959
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,125
Did you just push me?

960
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:48,918
Yes, I did.

961
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,795
Got a problem with that?

962
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:53,047
What will you do?
What can you do about it?

963
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:54,674
We have a disturbance by the ICU.

964
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:56,092
Please come quickly.

965
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:58,177
Does being a doctor give you the right?

966
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,887
Sir, please.

967
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:01,014
Let go. I said let go!

968
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:02,974
I don't get it.

969
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:04,601
Why stick your nose

970
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,519
in other people's business?

971
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,896
You hit your wife.

972
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,106
Did you not?

973
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:11,941
Whether I hit my wife or not

974
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,484
is none of your concern.

975
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:15,278
Who do you think you are?

976
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:17,447
-How dare you.
-Sir, please.

977
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,824
-Sir.
-Who are you to patronize me?

978
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:21,117
-You littleâ€¦
-Gosh!

979
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,076
-Sir.
-Hey.

980
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,037
-Calm down.
-Who do you think you are?

981
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:25,413
What now?

982
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:32,962
Ma'am, please don't.

983
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:34,464
Eun-jae.

984
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:31,396
Eun-jae. Cha Eun-jae!

985
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:34,065
Cha Eun-jae. Eun-jae!

986
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:36,859
-I need gauze. A lot of it.
-Yes, Doctor.

987
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,028
Eun-jae, stay with me.

988
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:40,822
Eun-jae!

989
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:14,689
Oh, dear.

990
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:17,108
Goodness.

991
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,444
Have you caught anything?

992
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:22,530
You know how winter fishing goes.

993
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:35,084
It's time you quit this.

994
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:37,462
It's bad for you.

995
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:42,508
You and I both know that worrying about it

996
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:44,135
is pointless.

997
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:55,605
Make sure you always take this on time.

998
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:02,320
How's the new president?

999
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:06,616
He and the staff

1000
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,827
finally got acquainted yesterday.

1001
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:46,906
I am Park Min-gook,

1002
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,992
the new president of Doldam as of today.

1003
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:53,454
NURSING DEPARTMENT

1004
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,039
During the past week,

1005
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:57,583
I learned a lot about how much improvement

1006
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:01,295
Doldam needs in terms of its facilities
and working environment.

1007
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:05,174
And that is why
I was so deeply moved by your hard work

1008
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:07,218
to save the lives

1009
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:09,095
of your difficult-to-treat patients

1010
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:10,596
despite your circumstances.

1011
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:13,266
During my time here,

1012
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,018
I can promise you this one thing.

1013
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,980
Improvement in your working conditions.

1014
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:20,982
First and foremost,

1015
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:22,900
everyone will receive

1016
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:25,528
a five percent raise.

1017
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:27,154
Your overtime pay

1018
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:31,033
will also be increased by five percent.

1019
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:33,536
-Seriously?
-My gosh!

1020
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:34,620
-Gosh.
-Wow.

1021
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:35,746
-Amazing.
-For real?

1022
01:04:36,914 --> 01:04:37,874
Five percent?

1023
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:40,293
And that applies to all employees?

1024
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:41,752
Yes, that's correct.

1025
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:45,548
When I was offered this position,

1026
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:47,967
my first condition of acceptance

1027
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:50,970
was raising everyone's pay.

1028
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:53,431
The board has already approved it,

1029
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:56,559
so the raise will take effect this month.

1030
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,185
-Nice!
-Yes!

1031
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:05,735
All right.

1032
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:08,237
As the president of Doldam Hospitalâ€¦

1033
01:05:09,113 --> 01:05:12,700
I will continue to do my best
to further improve your working conditions

1034
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:14,785
and to save the hospital

1035
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:18,122
from being in the red.

1036
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:22,543
All right. I hope we can all get along.

1037
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:24,503
-Of course!
-Welcome!

1038
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,255
-Welcome!
-Thank you!

1039
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:34,388
Gosh, five percent?

1040
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:36,474
Park Min-gook! Park Min-gook!

1041
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:38,559
Park Min-gook! Park Min-gook!

1042
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:39,685
Park Min-gook!

1043
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:44,190
He's extremely clever.

1044
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:47,026
So it seems.

1045
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:49,028
He's also prudent.

1046
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,530
And he seems to be a man of principle.

1047
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:54,325
PRESIDENT PARK MIN-GOOK

1048
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,003
In a way,

1049
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:09,548
he might be tougher than Do Yun-wan.

1050
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:10,841
PRESIDENT PARK MIN-GOOK

1051
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:14,345
Will you be able to handle him?

1052
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:19,642
Well, I guess we'll find out.

1053
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:22,853
Right.

1054
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:27,608
After all, you're the one who's willing
to take on this tough battle.

1055
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:05,312
How about you replace the fellows first?

1056
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:06,605
Seo Woo-jin, right?

1057
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:09,066
Now everyone knows about your debt.
How embarrassing.

1058
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:10,735
Leave, you scumbag!

1059
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:11,777
No!

1060
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:14,613
-You could get fired.
-I'm prepared for that.

1061
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:16,073
What if I refuse?

1062
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:18,826
Then Doctor Cha will suffer.

1063
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:22,204
That female doctor provoked me first.

1064
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:24,123
Do you agree with your husband?

1065
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:26,542
Stay with me, Eun-jae.

1066
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:27,460
Eun-jae!

1067
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:30,713
Eun-jae was trying to help, and youâ€¦

1068
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:35,509
-Ms. Oh.
-We must avoid the possible risks.

1069
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:37,762
-That's my principle as a doctor.
-"Principle"?

1070
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:39,764
Give me a break.
