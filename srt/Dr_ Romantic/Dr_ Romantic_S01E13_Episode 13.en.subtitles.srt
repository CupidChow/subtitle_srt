1
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,984
-What brings you here?
-It's about

2
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,486
Chairman Shin's heart operation.

3
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,698
May I be the first assistant?

4
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,037
Times of needs.

5
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:39,205
Make sure you are

6
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,666
a part of that operation.

7
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,169
Tell me everything that happens

8
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,921
in that operating room.

9
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,048
The others' needs are prioritized

10
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:52,093
over one's own decisions.

11
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,472
Do you have experience
in cardiothoracic surgery?

12
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,016
Before you even realize
what you really want

13
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:01,519
the world forces you to

14
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,104
adapt to its standards.

15
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,065
When I was an intern,

16
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,609
I have participated
in a heart transplant operation once.

17
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,319
It makes you add things.

18
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:12,447
I've also been
in an aortic dissection once,

19
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,532
in a cardiovascular
bypass operation four times,

20
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:15,784
Things get exaggerated.

21
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,160
ECMO operation once,

22
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,121
and VAD operation twice.

23
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,999
Sometimes, you exaggerate the facts
with lies.

24
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,292
It sure is

25
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,670
good to have a powerful dad.

26
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,591
You're more experienced than I thought.

27
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:34,552
Back then, I couldn't decide whether

28
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,597
I should be a general surgeon
or a cardiothoracic surgeon.

29
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,183
If you take the first assistant,

30
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,769
that will exclude Dr. Yun.

31
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,271
Do you understand that?

32
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,108
Is there

33
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,235
any way I can participate?

34
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,281
In the end,

35
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,536
it requires you to make others
fall in despair.

36
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,788
This is the world we live in.

37
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,586
When do you plan to operate
on Chairman Shin?

38
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,046
I made a request

39
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,465
to the manufacturer for the parts I need.

40
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,217
They told me that it'll be

41
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,970
either this weekend or early next week.

42
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,765
Do you have an operation team
in your mind?

43
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,016
I'm not sure.

44
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,728
Our only cardiothoracic surgery doctor
is not in a good condition.

45
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,984
You said it won't be a difficult operation

46
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,986
because you only need
to change the batteries.

47
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,990
There might be something wrong
with the artificial heart itself.

48
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,659
I see.

49
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,870
Recently,

50
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,373
there had been many reports made

51
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:48,167
on the defects
of Chairman Shin's artificial heart.

52
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,378
Have you come up
with a specific operation schedule?

53
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,214
I have to take many variables
into account.

54
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,341
It'll probably take ten days.

55
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,343
What? Ten days?

56
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,560
Do you think she got it?

57
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,899
I think so.

58
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,963
9 DAYS LEFT

59
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,722
8 DAYS LEFT

60
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,617
-Dr. Yun.
-Yes?

61
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,410
You got a parcel.

62
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,372
Thank you.

63
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,915
It got here faster than I thought.

64
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,166
What's in there?

65
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,210
7 DAYS LEFT
FROM JK MEDICAL TO YUN SEO-JEONG

66
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:48,663
6 DAYS LEFT

67
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,716
Purse string suture?

68
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,842
Have you done it before?

69
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,427
PURSE STRING SUTURE: TYPE OF AORTORRHAPHY

70
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,512
We use it to finish off
an acute appendicitis operation.

71
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,638
Is it difficult?

72
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,099
The suture method itself isn't too hard,

73
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,685
but you need to be careful
because serosa is very thin.

74
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,814
The serosa is about 2 to 3mm thick
and you need to suture that.

75
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,276
-That's very thin.
-You need some experience.

76
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,905
Well, I guess being experienced
is a part of your ability.

77
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,616
What about veins? Have you ever
done it on veins before?

78
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,494
Veins?

79
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,501
No, you need to relax.

80
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:40,173
When you suture organs, you have
to use the right amount of pressure.

81
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:44,177
If you use too much pressure,
it rips, but if you don't, it won't work.

82
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,970
I know that much.

83
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,225
Do you want to do this alone?

84
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,855
No, Dr. Kang. Please continue.

85
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,440
Listen.

86
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,109
Now, the essence of purse string suture is

87
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,154
to stitch up as thin as you can.

88
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,114
You must stick a needle
into the blood vessel

89
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,533
and pull it out right before
you reach intima.

90
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,286
What if I cut through the endoderm?

91
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,455
General surgeons like me can
wash out the excrement

92
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,457
from the bowel.

93
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,167
But for cardiac surgeons...

94
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,628
The pressure in the aorta

95
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,547
will cause blood
to shoot out to the ceiling.

96
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,674
My gosh.

97
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,556
What? Does your hand still hurt?

98
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,391
It's usually fine.

99
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,437
But it does get a bit stiff
when I get too focused or stressed out.

100
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:38,481
Let me see that.

101
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,526
You go from here

102
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,945
to here.

103
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,823
Use your wrist to snap out.

104
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,199
-Let me try.
-Okay.

105
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,284
Like this.

106
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:55,915
-Like this.
-No, it has to be thinner here.

107
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,376
-Like this.
-And snap.

108
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:05,633
Go in as thin as you can
and turn out right before the intima.

109
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,219
Like this.

110
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:12,682
That's it.

111
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,142
-Like this?
-Okay.

112
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,351
Good.

113
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,520
Like this.

114
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,107
You're good.

115
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,192
One more time.

116
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,739
Go in a little harder.

117
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,283
-Okay.
-That's it.

118
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,953
-You're great.
-It was okay, right?

119
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,589
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

120
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,077
Manager Jang.

121
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:16,996
What's going on?

122
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,789
Teacher Kim is finally

123
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,752
about to announce the staff members
of his operation on Chairman Shin.

124
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,346
As you all know,

125
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,098
Chairman Shin will be hospitalized here
as of tomorrow.

126
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:40,269
We'll get prepared for the operation
to change the batteries,

127
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:44,273
but things may change anytime
after we conduct some examinations.

128
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:45,942
So remember that.

129
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,445
I'll hold a conference about the operation

130
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,406
every day at 8 p.m. starting tomorrow.

131
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,117
Make sure all of you are prepared.

132
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,285
Then

133
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,872
who will be the first assistant
of this operation?

134
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,843
The first assistant of

135
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:14,971
Chairman Shin's operation is

136
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,153
Yun Seo-jeong.

137
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,239
You'll take the position.

138
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,163
That's all.

139
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,700
Everyone, today is the day!

140
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,662
The chairman of the foundation,

141
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,832
the hidden sponsor of Doldam Hospital,

142
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,959
Chairman Shin will be

143
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,879
hospitalized here at our hospital.

144
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:33,716
It's such a historical day.

145
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,094
Congratulations.

146
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,194
Make sure you clean this place
as if you're cleaning your own home.

147
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,613
Put all of your efforts in.

148
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,490
-Yes, sir.
-The chairman will be here.

149
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:01,327
What on earth is going on?
Just keep everything as it is.

150
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,204
But it's him who's coming.

151
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,875
What do you think

152
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,920
about laying out a red carpet
from the door to lobby?

153
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,755
I think it's overdoing it.

154
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,382
Is that so?

155
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,759
Be careful.

156
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,970
Make sure it looks artistic.
Turn the lights on.

157
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,222
Yes, sir.

158
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,017
That's great.

159
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,978
Think of it as a Christmas tree
at your own house.

160
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,191
Is it Christmas already?

161
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,151
So...

162
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:39,156
For the time being, I will be in charge
of Chairman Shin as a cardiac surgeon

163
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,617
and not as an emergency medical personnel.

164
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,452
Congratulations, Dr. Yun.

165
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,455
I guess reading those books
on artificial hearts paid off.

166
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,207
-Did you notice?
-Of course, I did.

167
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,918
-It's so awesome.
-Congratulations.

168
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,211
Thank you.

169
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,004
You'll still visit
the emergency room sometimes?

170
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,799
What do you mean, sometimes?
I will be around.

171
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,050
Well then, you should

172
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,095
-treat us food!
-Treat us food!

173
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,681
-Treat us food!
-All right!

174
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,277
Yes, Kang Dong-ju speaking.

175
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,280
Come to my room for a second.

176
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:20,990
Yes, sir.

177
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,470
We tried to put everything together
for you, Chairman Shin.

178
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:46,348
If you ever need anything else,
please do let me know.

179
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,685
I am Jang Gi-tae,
the manager of Doldam Hospital.

180
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,520
MANAGER JANG GI-TAE

181
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,194
This is enough.
Thank you for your kindness.

182
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,070
Sure.

183
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,864
Who's this?

184
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,034
-Are you my doctor?
-I am

185
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,496
Song Hyeon-cheol, the chief surgeon
from the main hospital. We've met before.

186
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,624
And this is Doctor Do In-beom.

187
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,751
He's President Do's son.

188
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,256
-Hello, Chairman Shin.
-Is this young man

189
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,593
-my doctor?
-No, he's not.

190
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,388
We just came by
to say hello to you, Chairman Shin.

191
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,681
So what?

192
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:32,061
Where is my doctor?

193
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,189
What happened, Manager Jang?

194
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:38,359
Why isn't his doctor here?

195
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,071
I'm here.

196
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,534
Hello, Chairman Shin. I am Yun Seo-jeong.

197
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,411
I am your doctor.

198
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,206
A woman?

199
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,585
Don't you have

200
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,255
any male doctors?

201
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,216
-Chairman Shin.
-Where's Teacher Kim?

202
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,386
Tell him to come immediately.
How dare he do this?

203
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:09,181
He must know that I'm here.
How can he not show up yet?

204
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,850
-Call him immediately!
-Okay.

205
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,861
Put some time aside tonight.

206
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,571
What is it?

207
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,449
I have to hold a video conference

208
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,410
with some doctors in Cleveland

209
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,787
regarding artificial hearts.

210
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,415
I have a lot of materials to cover.

211
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,292
Okay.

212
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:40,337
Teacher Kim. You have to go see
Chairman Shin immediately.

213
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,547
There is a problem.

214
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,558
Hey. Why are you here?

215
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,436
He's the chairman of the board.
Of course I have to be here.

216
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,479
I'll give him my regards

217
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,149
and introduce myself to him.

218
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,737
I'm worried Dr. Yun might not
handle the operation very well.

219
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,865
Perhaps you should consider replacing her.

220
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,289
What are you standing there for?

221
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:16,916
I said, get out.

222
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,878
I'll give you an explanation
of the tests you'll undergo.

223
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,671
Hey, lady doctor.

224
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:26,383
You will go under a blood test
and an X-Ray scan today.

225
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,426
Did you not hear me?

226
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,428
You will have to go on a fast
starting this evening,

227
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,513
and we'll do a CT scan on you
tomorrow morning.

228
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,391
I said, I will talk to Teacher Kim.

229
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,518
Bring him here.

230
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,062
Teacher Kim

231
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:41,649
has many things to do
for preparing the operation.

232
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,401
Simple tests like these
can be done under my supervision.

233
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,319
Like I said,

234
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,947
I don't feel comfortable

235
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,156
with a female doctor.

236
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,369
So am I, Chairman Shin.

237
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,373
-What did you say?
-Put yourself in my shoes.

238
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,459
If I said I felt uncomfortable
treating you because you're a male,

239
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,294
would you feel pleased?

240
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,838
Then let's call this off.

241
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,507
Get me a new doctor.

242
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,342
That can't be done.

243
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,387
I'm a doctor and you're a patient.

244
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,765
If you have any complaints
in the future regarding the treatment,

245
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,433
I'd be happy to oblige,

246
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,811
but if you make complaints
regarding any other issues,

247
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,563
I'll disregard them.

248
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,815
What did you say?

249
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,733
What are you talking about?

250
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,153
Are you joking around with me?

251
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:31,198
I'm trying not to be intimidated by you.

252
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:36,537
If I don't, I won't be able to
proceed with the treatment.

253
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,128
When did you start coughing?

254
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,588
When people get old,

255
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,716
coughing comes naturally.

256
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,342
When it started is none of your business.

257
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,469
I understand.

258
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,597
Please change into a hospital gown.

259
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,518
Please check his temperature

260
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,645
-and take his blood sample.
-Yes, Doctor.

261
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:03,897
Until later, then.

262
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,825
Teacher Kim.

263
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,953
Have you gone out of your mind, Dr. Yun?

264
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,121
Disregard him?

265
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,749
He's not someone you can disregard.

266
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,625
What was I supposed to do, then?

267
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,336
Should I sue a patient
for sexual discrimination?

268
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,463
Seriously?

269
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,756
Do you think

270
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,675
you can run the tests on him
without any problem?

271
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,761
I'll finish running the tests in two hours

272
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,763
and get him to rest.

273
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:39,266
Is there anything I should take care of?

274
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,517
There isn't.

275
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,728
-Off you go, then.
-Okay.

276
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,818
Is that all you have to say?

277
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,820
Didn't you see how rude she was
to Chairman Shin?

278
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:52,988
Look.

279
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,240
The moment a doctor gets
intimidated by the patient,

280
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,951
the whole medical treatment
goes down the drain.

281
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,704
She's doing everything by the books.

282
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,334
-Teacher Kim.
-Yes?

283
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,835
Shouldn't you pay him a visit?

284
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,337
He's looking for you.

285
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,381
I'm very busy right now.
Tell him I'll come by later.

286
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:12,925
Gosh.

287
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,177
We shouldn't neglect a VIP patient.

288
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,888
Oh, my goodness.

289
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,395
This is Dr. Kang.

290
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:26,980
We have an emergency patient.

291
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,025
It's a 7-year-old boy with
a 10cm-long lacerated wound on this head.

292
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,987
I'm on my way.

293
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,537
What?

294
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,497
He's refusing to be tested?

295
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,126
Yes. He keeps asking for Teacher Kim.

296
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,173
-Did you take his blood?
-He won't let me.

297
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,969
His body temperature is 38.3 degrees.

298
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,428
Give me that.

299
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,853
I'm going to take your blood,
Chairman Shin.

300
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,237
When did the coughing get more severe?

301
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,949
It became more frequent last week.

302
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,409
Does he have phlegm?

303
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,661
I think so.

304
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,663
Have you checked the color of it?

305
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,338
What do you think you're doing?

306
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,383
I was watching that.

307
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,676
What are you doing right now?

308
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,469
I'm treating a patient right now.

309
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,722
You can keep watching after I'm done.

310
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,766
I told you I don't want to be
treated by you.

311
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,269
Bring me Teacher Kim, right now.

312
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,190
Do you know how much money
he took from me?

313
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,735
I'm not going to let someone
like you be my doctor.

314
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,196
Someone like me
is more than capable of doing this.

315
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,573
So let me listen to your chest.

316
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:03,160
Get Teacher Kim to do it!

317
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,996
You might have pneumonia, Chairman Shin!

318
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,416
-What?
-If that's the case,

319
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,502
you need to take antibiotics right away.

320
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,338
Otherwise, you can't go
under general anesthesia.

321
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,381
That means no operation for you.

322
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,467
But...

323
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,927
Not only that,

324
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,679
Teacher Kim will be furious with me.

325
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,474
He'll call me an idiot who couldn't
even diagnose pneumonia

326
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,392
and a quack who is worse than bacteria.

327
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,436
Well, that's--

328
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,646
You've never heard

329
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,981
Teacher Kim ranting, have you?

330
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,860
The worst thing in the world is
to be scolded by Teacher Kim.

331
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,070
That being said,

332
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,407
please cooperate with me.

333
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,910
I'm begging you.

334
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,664
My gosh.

335
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,290
I'll start with the auscultation.

336
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,587
Take a deep breath.

337
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,133
Exhale.

338
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,595
One more time.

339
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,180
Inhale.

340
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,018
Once more.

341
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,229
Let me take a look at your wound.

342
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,898
No!

343
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,608
-It won't hurt if I--
-No.

344
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,654
He fell from the slide at a playground.

345
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,532
Did you fall on your head?

346
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,616
He must have.

347
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,410
I don't know for sure.

348
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,120
I didn't see him fall.

349
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,788
Are your parents not here?

350
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,415
They're both working right now.

351
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,918
My mom said she can be here after 7 p.m.

352
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,339
Please let me take a look.

353
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,634
-No.
-Good boy.

354
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,014
Do you

355
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,016
want this candy?

356
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,811
What's wrong? Don't you like sweets?

357
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,397
I want two.

358
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,359
If you let us treat you.

359
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,445
Surprise.

360
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,363
I'll give you two more.

361
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,868
Can we take a look at it now?

362
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:10,746
Here you go.

363
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,250
You're good at this.

364
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,169
This is nothing.

365
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,964
Can I take a look at you now?

366
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,342
Good boy.

367
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,470
It'll sting a little.

368
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,098
I'll have to stitch up the open wound.

369
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,349
Then a brain CT, please.

370
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,060
Yes, Doctor.

371
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,562
Let's see.

372
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,814
Good boy.

373
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,070
Are you not feeling well?

374
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,574
I'm just a bit tired.

375
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,618
Should I page a different doctor?

376
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,704
It's okay. I'll do it.

377
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,668
He's been overdoing himself all this time.

378
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,046
He has.

379
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,380
It's an emergency patient!

380
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,050
Su-jeong!

381
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,636
Don't die. Don't die on me.

382
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,762
This way.

383
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,388
-Move away.
-Don't die.

384
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:14,392
-What happened?
-She became unconscious from pills.

385
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:16,770
-One, two, three.
-Two, three.

386
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:19,981
Excuse me!

387
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,192
What's wrong with him?

388
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,860
My son is running a high fever.

389
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,362
Please come this way.

390
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,120
Ms. Eom.

391
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,969
-He has pneumonia?
-Yes.

392
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:52,180
His chest sounds are not good
and his temperature is 38.7 degrees.

393
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,016
We're running tests
on sputum smear and blood culture.

394
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,935
Follow guidelines
for Community-Acquired Pneumonia

395
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,520
and give him triaxone and azithromycin.

396
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,771
Yes, Doctor.

397
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,357
There's something else.

398
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:05,777
Here.

399
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,198
This is a different model
of artificial heart

400
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,367
than the one in Chairman Shin.

401
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,829
Chairman Shin's artificial heart
is Model A.

402
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,623
That model is reported to have a defect.

403
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,458
I heard it could get discontinued soon.

404
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:21,668
Are you considering

405
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:25,589
the replacement of his artificial heart?

406
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,049
Go over the data thoroughly.

407
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,678
We'll talk about the details
at the conference meeting at 8 p.m.

408
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,138
Okay.

409
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,449
This is going to be tough.

410
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,535
In-su, are you leaving already?

411
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,745
Is it already 6 p.m.?

412
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,955
Not yet.

413
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,833
But my wife and mother-in-law
are here already.

414
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,251
So I'm leaving a bit early today.

415
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,338
You should still stay here until 6 p.m.

416
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:09,925
Chairman Shin shows signs of pneumonia,
so I'll be busy until then.

417
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:13,345
Actually, I asked Dong-ju
to take care of the emergency room.

418
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:17,390
I'm sorry. My mother-in-law is so fussy.

419
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,768
See?

420
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,228
That's her.

421
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:25,357
I will come back as soon as I can
after dinner. I'm sorry.

422
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,817
Hello? Are you here?

423
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,194
Okay. I'll be there.

424
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:34,908
Gosh. Dong-ju and I are such pushovers.

425
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,376
Don't even ask.
I won't fill in night duty for him.

426
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,712
Dong-ju has been on night duty
for three days in a row.

427
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,798
Don't you feel sorry for him?

428
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:52,050
No. Not at all.

429
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:55,178
I will be right back after checking
Chairman Shin's condition.

430
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,554
Can't you do that for me?

431
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,974
I said, no. I have a lot to do.

432
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,977
Okay. You are so cheap and nasty.

433
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,271
Hello?

434
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,898
I will be there in a second.

435
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,652
Don't ever ask me
to fill in night duty for you.

436
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:11,945
I will never do it.

437
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:32,674
What?

438
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,843
He's not just changing the batteries,

439
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,636
but replacing the artificial heart?

440
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,347
I guess that's the plan.

441
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,934
That lunatic.
He's really going to create a fuss.

442
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,981
It seems difficult to go ahead
with the surgery, though.

443
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:51,151
Apparently, Chairman Shin is
showing signs of pneumonia.

444
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:55,780
I think they'll have to postpone it
a few days because of inflammation.

445
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:59,242
Okay. Keep me updated on what's going on.

446
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,788
Replacing the artificial heart?

447
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,793
Su-jeong, are you all right?

448
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,296
Wake up, Su-jeong. I'm sorry.

449
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,465
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

450
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:15,925
What medication did she take?
Do you have them with you?

451
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,135
Yes.

452
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:18,845
There you are.

453
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,307
She took a handful of them.

454
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,899
What's your relationship with her?

455
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,359
I'm her boyfriend.

456
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:36,112
Actually, we had a little fight.

457
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,239
That's why...

458
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,284
Okay.

459
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:44,746
Can you please wait outside
while I check her condition?

460
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,082
This way, please.

461
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,751
Su-jeong, please don't die. Hang in there.

462
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,465
Miss, please get up now.

463
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,221
Open your eyes.

464
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,515
Your boyfriend is not here.

465
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,440
You should be honest with me now

466
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,943
so that I can treat you properly.

467
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,571
How many pills did you take?

468
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,534
Are you going to tell my boyfriend
about that?

469
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,204
No, I won't.

470
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,248
Two.

471
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,419
I took the medication
because I had a stomach pain.

472
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,003
Then why did you lie to him?

473
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,714
We just had a little fight,

474
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:39,467
and I messed with him in a fit of temper.

475
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,512
I didn't lie to him, though.

476
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,848
It is true that I had a stomach pain.

477
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:48,101
Even so, you are not supposed to do this.

478
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:49,352
Do you understand?

479
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:51,688
I'm sorry.

480
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:55,066
I will give you some fluid.
Get some rest before you go home.

481
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,192
Okay.

482
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,947
Is she okay? Is she dying?

483
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,241
It won't affect her life.

484
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:06,369
I will give her some fluid
so that she can get some rest.

485
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,537
Thank goodness.

486
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,081
Thank goodness. Su-jeong.

487
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,917
Su-jeong, I'm really sorry.
I won't do that again.

488
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:15,086
Su-jeong, I'm sorry.

489
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,176
-Get her some fluid.
-Yes, Doctor.

490
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:25,096
There's a patient with high fever.
The whole family doesn't look good.

491
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:26,639
Okay.

492
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,058
-Ms. Oh.
-I'm coming.

493
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:34,898
What's the matter?

494
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,816
The coughing started
to get worse since last night.

495
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,447
Excuse me.

496
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:48,036
He's not getting better even
after taking the medication.

497
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:55,251
All the family members are coughing.
How long has it been?

498
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:58,213
I've been coughing and feeling chilly
since three or four days ago.

499
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,507
I thought I'd get better.

500
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,092
But my wife and son picked up
a cold from me instead.

501
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,304
Let me listen to his chest first.

502
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:09,766
Okay.

503
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:12,185
Take a deep breath.

504
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:24,697
The lung doesn't sound so good.
We should X-ray his lungs.

505
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,200
Isn't it just a cold?

506
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,455
I need to check your condition, too.

507
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,541
Please sit on the bed behind you.

508
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,094
Breathe in deeply.

509
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:56,396
Have members of your family
traveled abroad recently?

510
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,064
No, I just went

511
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:00,608
on an overseas business trip
for about two months.

512
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:03,903
-Which country?
-Saudi Arabia.

513
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,158
Saudi Arabia?

514
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,036
When did you come back?

515
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,166
About...

516
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,128
four days ago.

517
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:32,599
You don't think...

518
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:09,177
Ms. Oh. Can I see you for a moment?

519
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,434
Just listen.

520
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:17,977
As of now,

521
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,812
we'll lock down the emergency room.

522
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,650
Dr. Kang, what are you talking about?

523
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,902
We have suspected cases of MERS.

524
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:31,532
Isolate the suspected patients
in the hybrid room

525
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,993
and close down the emergency room
according to the manual.

526
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:37,080
Prepare protective films
to block the entrance of the hybrid room.

527
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:40,083
And make sure to have enough N95 masks,
disposable gloves, and gowns.

528
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,417
Pull yourselves together.

529
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:45,505
The faster we move,
the less serious it gets. Okay?

530
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:48,049
Put on the protective gears first.

531
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,097
EMERGENCY ROOM

532
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,270
Hello? Teacher Kim speaking.

533
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:06,859
What?

534
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,783
EMERGENCY ROOM

535
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,340
HYBRID ROOM

536
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:40,184
Please stay in the hybrid room
until further notice.

537
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:00,997
What is going on?

538
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,707
Family members of a man back
from Saudi Arabia

539
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,292
has a high fever and are coughing.

540
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,960
They are suspected MERS cases.

541
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,130
Dr. Kang Dong-ju just ordered
to shut down the emergency room.

542
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,673
How many are in the emergency room?

543
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,425
The number of patients is unclear,

544
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,052
but the number of medical staff are five

545
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,637
including Dr. Kang, Ms. Oh,
Mr. Park, and Ms. Eom.

546
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,223
We gave them two boxes of
bottled water, and N95 masks.

547
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,734
Hurry.

548
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,904
Report to the public health center
and Center for Disease Control.

549
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:36,699
Ask the public health center
for protection suits.

550
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:37,742
Okay.

551
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:41,996
Also, discharge the patients
who may leave the hospital

552
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,956
and contact the hospitals designated
for MERS, too.

553
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,208
I will do that.

554
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:47,543
Hurry.

555
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:49,545
Teacher Kim.

556
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,297
I'm sorry.

557
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:56,052
What happened? Is something going on?

558
00:34:58,554 --> 00:34:59,722
We're in trouble.

559
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:03,267
There is a suspected patient of MERS
in the emergency room.

560
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:13,778
His temperature is dropping.
It's at 37.8 degrees.

561
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:18,324
We have to see the results
to discern what caused this,

562
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:21,077
but I started administering
experiential antibiotics.

563
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,580
If this works,
you'll feel better very soon.

564
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:27,667
If it doesn't, we'll check
the test results

565
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,585
and switch the antibiotics.

566
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,129
Why is

567
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,006
Teacher Kim nowhere to be seen?

568
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,135
He called me here,

569
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,554
but he's so busy minding his own business.

570
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,014
Why would a doctor be busy?

571
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,266
It's because of his patient.

572
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,393
Teacher Kim is

573
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,271
really busy right now
to prepare for your operation.

574
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,190
You surely do talk a lot.

575
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,651
You should have been a newscaster

576
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,570
instead of a doctor.

577
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,572
You would have been good at that.

578
00:35:58,614 --> 00:35:59,740
My gosh.

579
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,786
Actually, I really don't talk that much.

580
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,790
I am very introverted, Grandpa.

581
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,667
What did you say?

582
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,961
I meant Chairman Shin.

583
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,549
We just installed
a brand new air purifier.

584
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,551
It also emits hot air.
You can keep that in mind.

585
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,762
It's not that hard to operate.

586
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,942
DOLDAM HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM
CODE GREEN

587
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,446
I have to go.

588
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,281
Get some rest, Grandpa.

589
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,618
I mean Chairman Shin.

590
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:57,506
She's a bit of a fool.

591
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:58,966
Yes, I understand.

592
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:01,928
What's going on?

593
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,846
What's with the Code Green?

594
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,348
There is a suspected patient

595
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,475
of MERS in the emergency room.

596
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,896
The orders are to remain in your post

597
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:14,106
until further instructions.

598
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:17,401
And you are to be extra careful

599
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,694
as Chairman Shin's doctor.

600
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:22,615
Dong-ju was in the emergency room,
so I asked him to cover for me.

601
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,409
Dr. Yun, are you listening?

602
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:29,789
Dong-ju was in the emergency room,
so I asked him to cover for me.

603
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,499
Dr. Yun.

604
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,057
Dong-ju.

605
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:18,921
Dong-ju.

606
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,182
Dong-ju.

607
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,438
Get away from the door.

608
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,405
Do not come anywhere near
the emergency room, Seo-jeong.

609
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,489
Are you...

610
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:47,783
okay?

611
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,329
Why do you look so sick?

612
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,914
I'm fine.

613
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,586
So stay away from here.

614
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,087
Dong-ju.

615
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,297
Dr. Kang.

616
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:07,803
Go.

617
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,693
Dong-ju!

618
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,795
Did you call the public health center?

619
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,088
Did you ask for protection suits?

620
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,589
Actually, Teacher Kim...

621
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,800
They won't pick up.

622
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:52,264
JEONGSEON PUBLIC HEALTH CENTER

623
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,521
It looks like

624
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,022
everyone has gone home.

625
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,152
What about the Center for Disease Control?

626
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:07,154
I called, but they only told me

627
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,074
to move the patients
to a designated hospital.

628
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,118
Call them again.

629
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,369
-Hurry!
-Okay.

630
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:15,996
Yes.

631
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,957
I heard about it.

632
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:19,875
But

633
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,961
are you sure the patient has MERS?

634
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:23,879
You people are the ones

635
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,965
who have to make the diagnosis!

636
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,216
Exactly.

637
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,845
So send the patients
to the designated hospital.

638
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,263
We have given those hospitals

639
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,973
everything they need,

640
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,099
so if you send them over--

641
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,183
We have

642
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,852
three patients here.

643
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:40,563
How are we to send all of them?

644
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,523
If the public health center can't,

645
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,442
you can just call 911.

646
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,069
There is only one ambulance
which is designated

647
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,863
for this entire area.

648
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,906
How are we supposed
to go back and forth three times

649
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,326
to Gangneung, which is two hours away?

650
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,996
Do you want us to do that all night long?

651
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:00,291
If one ambulance is not enough,

652
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,460
you can call a private ambulance.

653
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:03,794
Stop talking

654
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,045
nonsense already!

655
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,007
All of the emergency crew members
must wear protection suits

656
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:11,177
to transfer the suspected patients
of MERS.

657
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,678
We don't even have

658
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,805
any protection helmets,

659
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,807
let alone a protection suit.

660
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,685
How can you tell us
to call a private ambulance?

661
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,395
Yes, Doctor.

662
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,647
Like I said,

663
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:27,359
we have given everything you need
to the designated hospital.

664
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,320
You just have to transfer them there.

665
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:32,448
Transportation itself is
the big problem here!

666
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:33,866
The transportation!

667
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,160
Why can't you understand?

668
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,704
You are the central control center!

669
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:39,872
Understanding is...

670
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,584
Did you just talk down to me?

671
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,336
Hey.

672
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:46,337
We need to find

673
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,630
a way to work around this.

674
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:50,591
Screaming at me
won't solve any of these problems.

675
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,843
Forget about it.
I'm hanging up, you idiot!

676
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,805
You are unbelievable. Hello?

677
00:41:58,432 --> 00:41:59,683
Doldam Hospital?

678
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,018
Who does he think he is?

679
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,144
Teacher Kim.

680
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,479
I just discharged

681
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,773
everyone on the second floor
who can leave.

682
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,526
You can take charge of the emergency room.

683
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,027
I'll take care of the second floor.

684
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,612
-Please.
-Sure.

685
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,114
Teacher Kim.

686
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,243
Hey, why are you down here?

687
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,955
Didn't you hear what I said
about keeping your post?

688
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,665
What will happen to those people

689
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,458
in the emergency room?

690
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,293
What's your plan?

691
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,552
We're trying to reach
the public health center.

692
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,137
You should keep your post upstairs.

693
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:48,899
Emergency room.

694
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:52,486
How are things going in there, Ms. Oh?

695
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:56,323
Teacher Kim.

696
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,412
The possible MERS patients were

697
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,455
moved to the hybrid room.

698
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,916
We have sealed the room
with a plastic curtain.

699
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:07,918
What about other patients?

700
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,337
We have not informed them
about the situation yet.

701
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:13,799
I thought it would cause
a big turmoil if they find out.

702
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:16,885
I think you should still
tell them about it.

703
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,848
Get blood samples
of the suspected MERS patients

704
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:24,101
and take the samples
of their sputum as well.

705
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,604
Leave it out the back door,

706
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:29,315
and we'll take it from there.

707
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,108
After that,

708
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,486
the emergency room will be

709
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,449
completely quarantined.

710
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,165
And it will remain sealed

711
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,626
until we have a definite diagnosis.

712
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,047
I understand.

713
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,219
Don't worry too much

714
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,306
about this place, Teacher Kim.

715
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,976
I'll do my best.

716
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,194
Well...

717
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:38,759
KANG DONG-JU

718
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,513
SEO-JEONG

719
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:46,642
SEO-JEONG

720
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:51,772
Aren't you going to answer it?
It's from Dr. Yun.

721
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,274
Mr. Park and I will

722
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,152
take charge of the hybrid room for now.

723
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,154
No. I'll go with you.

724
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:00,739
I'll go with Mr. Park.

725
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:03,826
-Would that be okay with you?
-Of course.

726
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:06,954
I have a very strong
immune system, Ms. Oh.

727
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,206
Let's go in.

728
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,257
What's going on?

729
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:20,801
Are we in danger?

730
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:28,767
Sir.

731
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:32,229
You have heard of MERS, right?

732
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,316
Doctor.

733
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:39,319
Are you saying that we have MERS?

734
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,739
The symptoms of MERS are similar
to those of a cold.

735
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,575
It's hard to tell them apart.

736
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:49,621
Since your husband traveled
to the affected country,

737
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,999
we have every reason to doubt it.

738
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,208
My goodness.

739
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,753
Are we going to die?

740
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,173
Not all MERS patients die.

741
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:03,218
Besides, we don't even have
a definite diagnosis.

742
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,262
Please don't worry too much.

743
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:07,931
We'll run some basic tests.

744
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:11,894
You will get a blood and sputum test
and a chest X-ray.

745
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,857
Please give them bottles
for sputum samples.

746
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:20,027
Let's run CBC, blood chemistry test, ABGA,

747
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,321
and take a chest X-ray for each of them.

748
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:23,572
Yes, Dr. Kang.

749
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:29,995
Please take this.
It's for your sputum sample.

750
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:33,790
SEO-JEONG

751
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,710
The number you have dialed
is not available at this moment.

752
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:53,852
Ms. Oh, Dr. Kang isn't looking so well.

753
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:56,313
I think he needs to take some rest.

754
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:15,123
What's going on? What's going on
in the emergency room?

755
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:29,304
Excuse me, ma'am. We are closed for today.

756
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,806
Please come back--

757
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:33,976
I heard that my children are
in this hospital.

758
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:35,769
He's a seven-year-old boy.

759
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:39,731
I heard he hurt his head
and came to the emergency room here.

760
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:41,608
In our emergency room?

761
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:47,698
What are you talking about?
We can't go home now?

762
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:51,118
-Why can't we go outside?
-Sir.

763
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:55,372
There are possible MERS patients in there.

764
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:56,290
What?

765
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:58,292
MERS?

766
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,799
MERS?

767
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:09,928
Are you saying
that those people have MERS?

768
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:10,846
All of them?

769
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,890
We're not sure yet.
They might not have it.

770
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:17,269
So please go back to your bed
and follow our instructions.

771
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:19,229
This is completely ridiculous.

772
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,607
You should have let us go first.

773
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,984
How could you lock us all in here?

774
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,652
Do you want all of us to die together?

775
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,237
People from the public health center

776
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,740
will come and take each of you home.

777
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:33,994
Until then, you are not allowed
to leave this hospital.

778
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,288
Gosh. I can't believe this.

779
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:44,296
Honey.

780
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:45,631
Seriously!

781
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,345
Sir.

782
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:52,721
Sir!

783
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:55,223
Sir, please stop it.

784
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:57,851
That's enough already!
Please go back to your bed.

785
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,686
Let go of me.

786
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:01,313
I said, let go!

787
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:05,525
Why should I stay with MERS patients?

788
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:08,403
Move away. Open the door!

789
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,572
There are also children in here.

790
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:13,659
Please don't arouse anxiety
by raising your voice.

791
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,577
Follow our instructions for now.

792
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,371
Open the door right now!

793
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:23,794
I'm sorry, sir. Please stop making
a scene and go back to your bed.

794
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:25,379
-You might cause a bigger turmoil.
-Gosh.

795
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,297
-Do you understand?
-Damn you.

796
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,465
Honey!

797
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,970
-Honey.
-Su-jeong.

798
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:39,017
Su-jeong, what's wrong?
What is the matter?

799
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:41,728
Ma'am, what's wrong? Where does it hurt?

800
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:43,855
My stomach. Oh, no.

801
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:45,857
It hurts so much.

802
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:47,943
Please lie on your back for me.

803
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:49,736
With your knees bent.

804
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:53,699
I'll press your abdomen for a second.

805
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:58,578
-Does it hurt here?
-A little bit.

806
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:03,208
When you press there,
the right side hurts even more.

807
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:05,836
Rovsing's Sign?

808
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:09,005
How about here?

809
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:12,968
This time, I'll press your abdomen
a little longer.

810
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:14,261
Please hang in there.

811
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,071
What? Acute appendicitis?

812
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:35,782
Yes, she has severe rebound tenderness

813
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:38,034
and shows Rovsing's sign
and Dunphy's sign.

814
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,911
First, check her OP lab.

815
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:41,913
-Please check her OP lab.
-Yes, Dr. Kang.

816
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:45,792
Can she wait for the protection suit?

817
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:48,587
I'm not sure yet.

818
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,798
I think I'll have to see.

819
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:55,343
Let me know if she's about
to fall into a critical condition.

820
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:56,470
Yes, sir.

821
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:07,272
Ms. Oh, please administer
one ampule of tramadol by IV.

822
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:08,565
Yes, Dr. Kang.

823
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:13,528
Dr. Kang.

824
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,501
You startled me.

825
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,669
We have an acute appendicitis patient
in the ER.

826
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,713
Get ready for a surgery.

827
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,423
My shift is over.

828
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,468
It can worsen the situation
if she doesn't get a surgery.

829
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,720
Let's prevent it while we can.

830
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:41,306
You know the situation we're in right now.

831
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:44,726
Why would I cut open the abdomen
of a possible MERS patient?

832
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,437
It's not contagious because
the incubation period hasn't passed.

833
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:49,689
There is a zero percent chance
you'll get MERS.

834
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:53,235
Still, I don't want to do that.
I refuse to perform that surgery.

835
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,530
-Hey!
-Gosh.

836
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,114
Doctors are humans, too.

837
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:01,326
Doctors get sick,
and we can get MERS, too.

838
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:04,204
If we're unlucky, we can die from it.
You know that?

839
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:09,251
I have my rights to protect my own life.
You should know that.

840
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,086
Right.

841
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,172
You are absolutely right
about everything you said.

842
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,675
That's why you should get ready, you jerk!

843
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,557
Darn it!

844
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:28,270
At least give me a protection suit!

845
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:29,563
Teacher Kim!

846
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:30,647
Teacher Kim!

847
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,107
What now? What is it?

848
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,692
Dr. Kang Dong-ju is...

849
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:38,864
Dr. Kang, are you okay?

850
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:44,494
I'm fine. I'm all right.

851
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:48,123
You can't go on like this.
Please go take a rest, Dr. Kang.

852
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:50,750
It's not that bad, Ms. Oh.

853
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,145
-Dr. Kang!
-Dr. Kang!

854
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,071
Dr. Kang, wake up.

855
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,328
Dr. Kang.

856
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:29,539
Dong-ju!

857
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,419
Dong-ju!

858
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,679
No, Teacher Kim. You can't go in there.

859
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,224
Dr. Kang, wake up.

860
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:49,351
Dr. Kang.

861
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:56,608
Hello?

862
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:59,402
Teacher Kim, Dr. Kang is unconscious.

863
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:02,238
His pulse is weak, and he has a fever.

864
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:04,824
What should we do, Teacher Kim?

865
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:06,576
Please give us an order.

866
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:13,375
Put him on a bed
and check his vital signs.

867
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:18,421
I will call you right back.

868
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:20,799
-Let's move him to a bed.
-Yes, Ms. Oh.

869
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:33,853
I knew it.

870
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:38,316
I knew one of us would end up
dying because of him.

871
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:47,909
Mr. Gu.

872
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,414
Bring me N95 masks and gowns.

873
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,333
I will go in.

874
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,348
What did you just say?

875
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,268
Did Dong-ju pass out?

876
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:14,853
Yes.

877
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,813
He seems to be in a critical condition.

878
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:22,444
So who went into the emergency room?

879
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,696
No one.

880
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:25,905
No one?

881
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,908
Are you saying there is
no doctor in the ER?

882
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,911
What about Dong-ju?

883
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,289
Who is taking care of him?

884
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:36,750
Hold yourself together, Dr. Kang.

885
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:40,295
Dr. Kang.

886
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:41,838
Dr. Kang.

887
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,799
His vital signs are not good, Ms. Oh.

888
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:48,803
Dr. Kang.

889
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:55,977
You can't do that, Teacher Kim.

890
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:57,645
President Yeo.

891
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:01,191
There's no time for this.

892
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,985
You are the control tower
of this hospital.

893
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,196
You can't just get carried away
by your feelings

894
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:07,739
and go into the emergency room now.

895
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:09,574
What about the public health center?

896
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:11,868
Our staff are on the way.

897
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:13,828
Dr. Song.

898
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:16,247
Do the operation as soon as
we get the protection suits.

899
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:19,334
What are you talking about?
I'm not performing the operation.

900
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:21,252
Don't be so selfish.

901
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,962
Do you still call yourself a doctor?

902
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:27,008
A young doctor
is lying in the bed right there.

903
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:29,636
How dare you say such a thing?

904
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,893
Gosh.

905
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:38,520
Please think it all through once again.

906
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:41,106
You can't do this with
Chairman Shin's operation ahead.

907
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,150
Do you know what they say
about this situation?

908
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:46,277
For patients,

909
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:50,365
it's not the order of arrival.
It's the order of emergency.

910
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,827
The emergency patient here
is not Chairman Shin.

911
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:55,453
They're in the emergency room.

912
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:00,750
I will get in there.

913
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:06,506
I will get in the emergency room.

914
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,385
I will get in there.

915
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:12,804
Please let me.

916
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:14,305
Dr. Yun.

917
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:15,557
I told you

918
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:18,017
to keep your position.

919
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:19,853
Just go.

920
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:22,230
I've completed the change-over already.

921
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,534
I'm Do In-beom, sir.

922
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,953
I will be taking care of you

923
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,705
on behalf of Dr. Yun Seo-jeong.

924
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,421
What?

925
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,715
Who told you to do so?

926
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:50,508
Do you think you're the boss?

927
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,886
An emergency medicine specialist
should be in the emergency room,

928
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,304
not a surgeon.

929
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,723
I know you are a surgeon
with triple board,

930
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:59,809
but the doctor who has to be in there

931
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,145
is me.

932
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:08,610
If the patients are

933
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:10,445
confirmed to contract MERS,

934
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:14,282
you will be excluded
from the CS operation.

935
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,577
Are you sure you've thought about that?

936
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:20,455
Yes, I have.

937
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:32,926
I will

938
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:34,969
go in.

939
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:37,805
Please let me.

940
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:42,727
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER
