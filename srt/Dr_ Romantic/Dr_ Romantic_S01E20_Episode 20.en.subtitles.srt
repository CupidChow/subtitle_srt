1
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,197
THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL ARTIFICIAL HEART
REPLACEMENT SURGERY IN KOREA

2
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,866
"The first

3
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:37,579
successful artificial heart
replacement surgery in Korea."

4
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,254
Why are you here?

5
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:49,883
I thought it was a party
for the artificial heart implant.

6
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:52,135
I should be here.

7
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,766
We are the heroes
and heroines of this surgery.

8
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,106
What's the meaning of this?

9
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,317
So what?

10
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,361
-Are you trying to fight me?
-What's wrong?

11
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:12,989
Are you scared?

12
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,495
The way things are turning out
seems to be serious.

13
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,871
I agree.

14
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,749
It seems Teacher Kim will
pick a fight with President Do.

15
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,960
Do you think I should call the police?

16
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,046
Keep quiet, you two.

17
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,590
Excuse me.

18
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,100
Teacher Kim, go get them!

19
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,371
I'm watching you.

20
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:03,873
I just said hi.

21
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,336
It's a surprise that you are here,

22
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,672
Anyway, I'm glad you came.

23
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,385
You made an appearance at this party

24
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,596
because you want to get credit
for the surgery.

25
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:20,974
I will give you credit for that.

26
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,061
What nonsense is this?

27
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,313
We don't need to fight anymore.

28
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,025
I'm still the top figure in this hospital.

29
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,277
And

30
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:36,156
you are the best surgeon who is back
after many storms of life.

31
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,615
Moreover, you have

32
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:42,537
successfully performed
the heart surgery on the chairman.

33
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,915
Now that the dramatic conditions
are all set,

34
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,002
we are just ready to go.

35
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,343
Act wisely. You should

36
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,929
pursue symbiosis instead of division.

37
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,932
Symbiosis, my foot.

38
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,270
Do you even know what symbiosis means?

39
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,771
It's a win-win situation.

40
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,065
It's like killing two birds
with one stone.

41
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,817
Basically

42
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,695
you should make a decision
for both our sakes.

43
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:18,698
But you will keep
all the birds to yourself.

44
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,868
It means extinction, not symbiosis.

45
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,202
What?

46
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,412
Then again,

47
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,458
you're not the only scumbag here.

48
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,961
I am also a scumbag for closing my eyes,

49
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,757
closing my ears, and shutting up

50
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,927
for you to live a comfortable life.

51
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,055
-What did he say?
-Who is that?

52
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,393
Please watch your language, Bu Yong-ju.

53
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,687
This is a public place.

54
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,022
Until now,

55
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:56,194
I thought it's the best for me
to stay away from guys like you.

56
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:02,200
I thought you would
fall in grave peril after a while.

57
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,077
I wanted to not care.

58
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,704
I thought I'd just live my life

59
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,957
instead of caring about yours.

60
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,292
I was too tired to do that,

61
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:15,380
and I was also busy
making a life for myself.

62
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,548
That's why I shut my ears
and closed my eyes

63
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,260
about the things you have done.

64
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:24,264
That's why I stayed silent and ignorant.

65
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,640
However,

66
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,143
I don't think I can let this go on.

67
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,772
That's why

68
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,484
I won't do that from now on.

69
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,860
If you won't,

70
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,321
what can you do?

71
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,620
First.

72
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,166
Something I couldn't correct 14 years ago.

73
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,671
Let's start from there.

74
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,391
THE LIST OF PEOPLE WHO PERFORMED
GHOST SURGERY

75
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,692
Do you think you can tie me down

76
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,778
with these documents
that have no legal power?

77
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:24,782
At least it can work as an obstacle
for you to be reappointed.

78
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,660
Morally and ethically.

79
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,128
What?

80
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,089
Are you scared now?

81
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,145
Trauma center.

82
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,149
Is that all you want?

83
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,153
-What?
-Once I become reappointed,

84
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:05,031
I will seriously consider
turning Doldam Hospital

85
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,283
into a trauma center.

86
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,453
I'll get all of my connections
and see if you can get

87
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,080
any government support--

88
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:15,166
Do you not even understand
what I'm saying?

89
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,504
How dare you try to bargain your way out?

90
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,339
Isn't this what you want?

91
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,008
That's why you're threatening me.

92
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,345
You leave me speechless.

93
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,388
Hey.

94
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,766
Do you know

95
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,895
what kids nowadays
say about guys like you?

96
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:37,980
Dead end.

97
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,316
It means you got no way out.

98
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,819
So what do you want?

99
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:45,947
-What is going on?
-Did he just shout at him?

100
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,283
Tell me what you want.

101
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,578
Just

102
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,664
shut up

103
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,750
and step down quietly!

104
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,468
Don't stay in your post in such disgrace.

105
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,431
Then clean up

106
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,392
after yourself.

107
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,061
Understood?

108
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,420
Doctor.

109
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,092
Your artificial heart
replacement surgery was the best.

110
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,636
I really respect you.
Will you return to Geosan Medical Center?

111
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,263
Doctor, may I get an autograph?

112
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,264
Forget about it.

113
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,892
-I have to go.
-Can I take a picture with you?

114
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,352
I have to go.

115
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,941
No, I have to go.

116
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,235
-Just one picture.
-Let me go.

117
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,738
My goodness, move.

118
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,909
-Please.
-I respect you, Doctor.

119
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,911
Everyone, move away.

120
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,751
I'm fed up with you.

121
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,670
How can you do this to me?

122
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,840
This is what justice looks like, you scum!

123
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,217
What did you say?

124
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,056
You scum!

125
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:40,895
Oh, no.

126
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,695
Father!

127
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,631
Teacher Kim!

128
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,926
Father.

129
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:18,140
Teacher Kim!

130
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,104
Teacher Kim.

131
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,730
Teacher Kim.

132
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,164
What's the case?

133
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,376
Oh, Dr. Yun.

134
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,920
-Mr. Nam.
-It's been so long.

135
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,590
-Dr. Kang is here, too.
-Yes.

136
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,675
Is someone hurt?

137
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,927
He's the chief surgeon of Doldam Hospital.

138
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,722
He hurt his head and hand
at the celebratory event.

139
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,932
I see. This way.

140
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:05,730
Hey.

141
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,608
This is how far we go.

142
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,820
Oh, it's not our hospital. I forgot.

143
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,160
Aren't you Dr. Yun?

144
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,786
Hey, Dr. Lee.

145
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,123
-It's been a while.
-What brings you here?

146
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,792
Well, it's...

147
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,046
This is Dr. Bu Yong-ju.

148
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,175
An ice sculpture came down on him
and he hurt his head

149
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,760
and his hand.

150
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,345
Let me take a look.

151
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,598
His head injury isn't too severe,

152
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,558
so let's take an X-ray of his wrist first.

153
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,771
Don't you know him?

154
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:49,899
He's Dr. Kang Dong-ju.
He used to be a surgeon here.

155
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,692
I think I heard of him.

156
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,362
You're two years junior, aren't you?

157
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,407
Let's get that X-ray first.

158
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,617
Okay.

159
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,870
-Mr. Nam, please proceed it.
-Okay.

160
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,540
Where's that patient?

161
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,002
RESTRICTED AREA

162
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,135
THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL ARTIFICIAL HEART
REPLACEMENT SURGERY IN KOREA

163
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,491
THE LIST OF PEOPLE WHO PERFORMED
GHOST SURGERY

164
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,041
President Do, please.

165
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,544
Why don't you take a CT scan and an X-ray

166
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,629
of your shoulder and head?

167
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,923
I'm fine. Get to the treatment.

168
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:57,967
Yes, sir.

169
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,019
Never mind, get out.

170
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,814
-But you're bleeding, President Do.
-Forget about it and leave!

171
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,611
Everyone, please leave.

172
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,338
Give me your hand.

173
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,271
I'll disinfect the area first.

174
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,368
Teacher Kim.

175
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,621
Are you okay? Are you awake?

176
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:09,705
Teacher Kim.

177
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,790
Where am I?

178
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,335
We came to Geosan Medical Center's
emergency room.

179
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,379
You got hurt because of the ice sculpture.

180
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,219
I applied an ice pack
because it's really swollen.

181
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,059
I have the result of his X-ray.

182
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,644
-How did it turn out?
-How did it turn out?

183
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,106
Guys.

184
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,109
Wait outside the room.

185
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,236
-Teacher Kim.
-Teacher Kim.

186
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,739
I will hear the result. Step outside.

187
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,743
Now.

188
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,247
How did it go? How's Teacher Kim?

189
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,375
We just got the result of his X-ray,
but he wants us to wait outside.

190
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,418
But you can't leave him alone in there.

191
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,420
You should hear the result with him.

192
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,340
That's what I wanted to do,

193
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,676
but he doesn't listen to me.

194
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,888
I guess it will take a while.

195
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,599
I think you should go for dinner first.

196
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,395
-Okay then.
-Don't be absurd.

197
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:17,231
How can we eat dinner
when someone is injured?

198
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,661
He doesn't look good.

199
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,789
Is something wrong?

200
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:40,754
Hello.

201
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,133
-Dr. Yun.
-Yes?

202
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,224
Ms. Jin.

203
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,573
I saw you came here with Dr. Kang Dong-ju.

204
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,327
Right. I work with him at Doldam Hospital.

205
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,579
I see.

206
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,333
You suddenly disappeared
after the accident five years ago.

207
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:21,086
I've been wondering about you since then.

208
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,466
I have

209
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,347
been doing pretty well.

210
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,684
I met nice people at a good hospital.

211
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,437
I even met a nice mentor.

212
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:42,024
And you met Dr. Kang again there. Right?

213
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:47,279
All the nurses in the emergency room
knew that

214
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:51,659
Dr. Kang had a huge crush on you.

215
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,370
Really?

216
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,374
I got a call.

217
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,376
GEOSAN MEDICAL CENTER EMERGENCY ROOM

218
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,670
Is he your son?

219
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,048
Yes.

220
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,469
He's five years old.

221
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,391
He looks like his father.

222
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,687
He must be so cute.
He's only five years old.

223
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,901
I want you to be happy.

224
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,450
Thanks.

225
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,411
I hope you are happy, too.

226
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:38,789
Thanks.

227
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,848
I want you to come back
to Geosan Medical Center.

228
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,226
Despite all that happened,

229
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,398
I bet you've learned a lot

230
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,234
by taking part in the artificial
heart replacement surgery.

231
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,570
That's enough.

232
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,197
-Come back to Geosan Medical Center.
-I think

233
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,367
I'm very lucky

234
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,579
that I'm your son.

235
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:21,832
I was proud

236
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,377
to be called as your son
rather than my name.

237
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,465
Your name gave me

238
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,509
good qualifications.

239
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,474
After I was transferred
to Doldam Hospital,

240
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:42,853
I was called by my name
for the first time.

241
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,318
At first, I was confused

242
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,237
and felt bad about that.

243
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:59,078
Your name didn't work there.

244
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,712
I felt that way at first.

245
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,718
But it made me

246
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,014
see who I really am for the first time.

247
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,436
I could see what my life was like

248
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,148
without your name.

249
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,692
I realized what it was.

250
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,741
What are you trying to say?

251
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,628
I want to

252
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,799
live up to my name for a while.

253
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,761
I want to be myself.

254
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,264
Not your son.

255
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,476
I want to live as Do In-beom.

256
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,728
Are you saying

257
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,439
you want to stay at Doldam Hospital?

258
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,567
Yes, I am.

259
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,569
Stop talking nonsense and come back.

260
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,446
No.

261
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,365
I won't do that.

262
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,584
Are you

263
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,754
trying to

264
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,426
disobey your father?

265
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,347
I'm just saying

266
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,767
everything in my house is my business.

267
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,313
Father.

268
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,820
Make sure to take anti-inflammatory pills.

269
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,535
Come over here now.

270
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,668
In-beom.

271
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,504
In-beom!

272
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,671
This is good.

273
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,174
Pizza tastes pretty good with beer.

274
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,968
I'm glad you like it.

275
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,803
Don't worry about Teacher Kim.

276
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,013
Being worried about him
wouldn't make things better.

277
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,100
How can I not worry about him?
He's a surgeon, and he hurt his wrist.

278
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,229
It won't be a big deal.

279
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,398
Don't worry. Let's just eat.

280
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,526
That's what I'm saying.
The power of optimism.

281
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:21,405
Skipping a meal is no good
for people at our age.

282
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,407
Your blood sugar will drop,

283
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,492
and you will have a nervous temperament.

284
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,120
Try this. It's pretty good.

285
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,670
By the way, it's taking quite a while.

286
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,048
I know. Do you think it's serious?

287
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,768
What do you think?

288
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,687
It's taking so long.

289
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:57,149
-Is it that bad?
-Do you think so?

290
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,992
Did you see that? He's a neurosurgeon.

291
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,619
I did. Was there an orthopedist, too?

292
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:10,912
Yes, there was.

293
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,956
Why were they here?

294
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:16,418
-Is he seriously injured?
-Don't say that.

295
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,712
I'm sure it's just a simple contusion.

296
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,257
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

297
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,137
How is Teacher Kim?

298
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,555
Is his wrist okay?

299
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,682
Go ask him yourself.

300
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:34,811
I'm not supposed to say
anything about a patient.

301
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,632
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

302
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,177
Do we have a patient early in the morning?

303
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,097
We have an emergency patient.
He's looking for Teacher Kim.

304
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,307
He says he's a singer.

305
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,683
Singer who?

306
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,686
He says his name is Nam Jin or something.

307
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,021
Nam Jin?

308
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,484
Is Nam Jin in our hospital?

309
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,530
Who's Nam Jin?

310
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,573
Well, I'm not sure.

311
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,701
How may I help you?

312
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,454
Are you Teacher Kim?

313
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,956
No, I'm not.

314
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,833
But I'm also a chief surgeon.

315
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,086
May I take a look at the patient?

316
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,381
He's a bit shy.

317
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,591
It has to be Teacher Kim.

318
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,927
I'm just as good as Teacher Kim.

319
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,512
-Let's take a look.
-Hey.

320
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,140
We'll wait around until Teacher Kim comes.

321
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,976
Is it really that singer, Nam Jin?

322
00:23:58,687 --> 00:23:59,896
Nam Jin?

323
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,732
-Is the singer Nam Jin here?
-Yes.

324
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,734
He's asking only for Teacher Kim.

325
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,194
He's here, right?

326
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,531
This is Teacher Kim.

327
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,492
-May we see the patient now?
-Oh, it's you.

328
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:16,288
Please do take a good care of him.

329
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,708
Hey, Teacher Kim is here.

330
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,134
I thought it was Nam Jin.

331
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,261
I look just like him, don't I?

332
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,805
He's Nam Jin's cover singer,

333
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,640
Neom Jin.

334
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:39,644
His illness kicked in again
while he was doing a show.

335
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:40,979
My gosh.

336
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:44,983
It's the famous Teacher Kim.

337
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:50,363
I went into a relapse.

338
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:54,576
I can't even sit right anymore.

339
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,619
My goodness.

340
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,163
What is it? What's your illness?

341
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,497
Look at me.

342
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,417
I'm sitting on my side.

343
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,628
I'm suffering from hemorrhoids.

344
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,257
How long has it been?

345
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,677
-How long?
-It's been about two to three years--

346
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,721
No, not you.

347
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:18,475
This guy. You have a bad case of jaundice.

348
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:19,601
What?

349
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,686
Me?

350
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:25,023
He's always been that yellow.

351
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:28,777
-He's born yellow.
-Haven't you been

352
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,028
very tired recently?

353
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,239
Well, my job itself is
something that's restless

354
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,824
and something very tiring.

355
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,618
Excuse me for a second.

356
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,286
Can you look above?

357
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,374
When did you eat last?

358
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:46,044
I had some bread and milk yesterday night.

359
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,379
You idiot.

360
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,423
This is all
because you had too much banana milk.

361
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,426
Other than that. What else did you eat?

362
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,136
Just water.

363
00:25:56,304 --> 00:26:00,183
I was out of my mind because he was
very hurt since this morning.

364
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,309
Ms. Oh.

365
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,187
Can you take his blood test?

366
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,981
Also, take an X-ray, an ECG,

367
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,358
and a CT scan of his abdomen.

368
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,860
-Yes.
-Wait, me?

369
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,320
I'm more concerned about--

370
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,031
No, we'll see the result
of your blood test first.

371
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,950
We'll talk after that.

372
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,327
-And Dr. Song.
-Yes?

373
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:23,456
You can take that Nam Jin guy.

374
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,334
Wait, was it Neom Jin?

375
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,004
This is annoying.

376
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,715
My goodness.

377
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,467
-Follow me.
-Okay.

378
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,636
I'll be back, then.

379
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,472
-Hey.
-My gosh.

380
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:43,476
Excuse me, take a look at me.

381
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,644
Sure.

382
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,699
What are you doing?

383
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,411
You've been doodling since this morning.

384
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,663
I'm drawing a picture.

385
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,374
-A picture?
-Yes.

386
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:11,254
I used to be a webtoon artist.

387
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,631
I thought I'd draw

388
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,217
at least one more cut
while I have the strength.

389
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,057
I don't know when I'll die soon.

390
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,226
So I don't know

391
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,813
what my last webtoon will be.

392
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,531
Chairman Shin, are you up?

393
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,742
-Yes.
-How are you feeling today?

394
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,661
Oh, very well.

395
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,205
Good, very good.

396
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:47,707
We'll move you to a regular ward today.

397
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:48,875
Really?

398
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:52,420
My goodness. That's good news.

399
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,131
Yes.

400
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,052
You know what?

401
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:02,138
What about that young man?

402
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:05,350
Is he waiting for a heart implant as well?

403
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,105
Yes, but...

404
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,400
he can't get an implant right away.

405
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:14,651
Why not?

406
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:18,571
Most patients with cardiac failure
due to dilated cardiomyopathy

407
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:22,033
tend to have pulmonary hypertension.
In that case,

408
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,537
there's a high chance the implant
will fail. So we put LVAD on them

409
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,164
to drop their pulmonary hypertension.

410
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,667
Then he can do that. Can't he?

411
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,669
Why is he still there?

412
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,672
The surgery costs a fortune.

413
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,467
Not everyone is like you.

414
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,636
It's not a surgery everyone can receive.

415
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,946
Sir, the patient has a side effect.

416
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,116
-What did you give her?
-Diclofenac.

417
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:05,368
Doctor, I can't breathe.

418
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,411
Give her 7L of oxygen

419
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:08,621
and hydrate her with a full drop.

420
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:09,831
Let's check her vitals.

421
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,791
It's 100 over 60, pulse 110.

422
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,376
Can you breathe in?

423
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,421
Give her 0.3ml of epinephrine.

424
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,339
Peniramin and dexamethasone,
one ampule each.

425
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,592
-What is it?
-A side effect of diclofenac.

426
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:21,634
Anaphylaxis?

427
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,846
She's not in shock,
but she really can't breathe.

428
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,474
Ma'am, can you open your mouth?

429
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,520
-Prepare intubation just in case.
-Okay.

430
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,856
It could have been really bad.

431
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,027
Did you treat the patient?

432
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:40,820
I did.

433
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,156
Dr. Woo. Did you check for her allergies?

434
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,282
Allergies?

435
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,493
Yes. I think so.

436
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,286
You think so?

437
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,413
If you did, you did.
If you didn't, you didn't.

438
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,332
Well...

439
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,294
Do you have any allergies or side effects?

440
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,879
None.

441
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,507
I never even catch a cold.

442
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,008
I did check.

443
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,009
Are you sure?

444
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:06,471
Yes. The patient said
she doesn't have any allergy herself.

445
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,431
Then why didn't you put it in her chart?

446
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,392
I was about to do it.

447
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,646
I asked her to do something, Dr. Do.

448
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:19,234
How can you become a doctor
when you don't know the basics?

449
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,735
If you've seen a patient,

450
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,988
you should write it down first
before you give an order.

451
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,366
You don't even remember
what you just checked.

452
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:29,911
She's more flustered
because you're cornering her.

453
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:41,840
Don't do it, In-beom.

454
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,341
Stop it.

455
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:46,594
What does that look like?

456
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,347
Is that pancreas head cancer?

457
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,516
What kind of a surgery can you do now?

458
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,768
Whipple's operation?

459
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,688
WHIPPLE'S OPERATION:
SURGERY TO REMOVE PANCREATIC TUMORS

460
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,858
From the head of his pancreas,
we'll cut through biliary tract,

461
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,693
gall bladder, and duodenum at once.

462
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,404
This is the essence of general surgery.

463
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,030
Have you done it?

464
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,950
I've assisted it a few times
before I passed the board.

465
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,036
Do you want to do it?

466
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,291
-Me?
-Yes.

467
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,003
What about you?

468
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,965
It'll be another two to three weeks
until my wrist is fully healed.

469
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:28,303
No, I think it can take
a bit longer than that.

470
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,764
As you can see from his blood test,

471
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,683
his jaundice level is too high.

472
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,603
You're right. It's over ten.

473
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:40,565
I don't think we can push back
his surgery for more than a week.

474
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:43,318
I will guide the surgery.
Do you want to do it?

475
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,654
Or should I let In-beom take it?

476
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,240
I'll do it.

477
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,034
Okay.

478
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,662
I'll give you three days
to get ready. That's all.

479
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:55,914
Yes.

480
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,722
Teacher Kim.

481
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,809
Doesn't it seem like
he's hiding something?

482
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,436
Hide what?

483
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,315
He did say his wound is
a simple contusion.

484
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,652
But I'm afraid
it may be a bit more severe.

485
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,530
You think?

486
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,551
-I'll get that, Teacher Kim.
-Sure.

487
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,637
Did you want to see this?

488
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,808
Did Chairman Shin
move to the regular ward?

489
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,893
-Yes, he did.
-Okay.

490
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,397
Make sure you check in on him often

491
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,774
and see how he does.

492
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,359
Yes, I will.

493
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,947
Well, anyway, Teacher Kim.

494
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,908
-Can you turn the page?
-Yes.

495
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:19,914
Did patient Jung Jin-yeong's infection
get treated?

496
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:24,669
The infection is not getting
any better because of the tube.

497
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:28,631
The fever even went up to
38 degrees yesterday.

498
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:29,716
I see.

499
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,722
-Teacher Kim.
-I'm okay.

500
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:43,104
You keep staring at my wrist.

501
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:45,690
It's okay.

502
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:51,654
Can you tell me how serious it is?

503
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,532
-I can't.
-Teacher Kim.

504
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,244
If I say it's okay, it's okay.

505
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,246
Do you understand?

506
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,208
Is it okay?

507
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,586
Do you think

508
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:09,005
my wrist will be fine?

509
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:11,799
The X-ray shows that the bones
are knitted together well.

510
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,510
All you need is rehab exercise.

511
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,054
Then

512
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,973
can I work as a doctor?

513
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,477
Is it really okay?

514
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,563
If I say it is okay, it is okay.

515
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,150
Let me see.

516
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,159
I'm sorry.

517
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,913
It's okay. Take your time.

518
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,414
I'm sorry.

519
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,083
I'm really sorry, Teacher Kim.

520
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,751
It's okay. Stay calm.

521
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,212
Are you okay?

522
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,399
I said it's okay.

523
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,903
Okay. I understand.

524
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,488
Okay.

525
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:16,989
You can go now.

526
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,242
Okay.

527
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,502
-Teacher Kim.
-What?

528
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,047
After I get on
the emergency medicine board,

529
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,633
can I work with you at this hospital?

530
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,969
We will talk about that
after you get on the board.

531
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,266
It's done.

532
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,646
CERTIFICATE OF MEDICAL SPECIALIST

533
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:50,523
YUN SEO-JEONG,
EMERGENCY MEDICINE SPECIALIST

534
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,067
Can I work at Doldam Hospital now?

535
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,281
Teacher Kim.

536
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,909
I'm thinking about getting
on the double board.

537
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,452
-Cut.
-Cut.

538
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,790
What do you think is better for me?
GS or CS?

539
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,084
-Cut.
-Cut.

540
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,753
Stop being silly

541
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,380
and stick to your job.

542
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:16,799
Finish it off.

543
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,801
Yes, Teacher Kim.

544
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,473
I guess cardiothoracic surgery
would be better. Don't you think?

545
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,726
Just stay focused.

546
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,187
Okay.

547
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,066
I'll choose cardiothoracic surgery.

548
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,411
Why are you doing this every time?

549
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:48,873
I'm doing this because you are being mean
to her every time in front of patients.

550
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,708
Do you think I'm doing this for no reason?

551
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:53,711
I just want to teach
my junior doctor a lesson.

552
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:56,547
If so, you can do that in private.

553
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,634
Look at you.
You are trying to lecture a doctor.

554
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:02,261
I can lecture a doctor
if he does something wrong.

555
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,639
-What did you say?
-Stop it, Mr. Park.

556
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,225
What are you doing?
Why are you two having an argument?

557
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:10,770
Are you having an argument with him?
What's wrong?

558
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,146
What happened?

559
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,983
I feel so uncomfortable around him
that I can't even do my job.

560
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:19,070
He doesn't allow me
to teach my junior doctor.

561
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:20,905
He doesn't follow my order.

562
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,907
And he even lectures me
about the way I work.

563
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,283
Did you do that?

564
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:27,453
He keeps bullying other people
whenever he has a chance.

565
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,705
Is that true, In-beom? Did you bully him

566
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,624
whenever you had a chance?
Why did you do that?

567
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:35,294
Look. I did that to Dr. Woo, not you.

568
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:36,837
Dr. Woo?

569
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:40,258
To put it crudely,
it's none of your business

570
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,926
even if I bully Dr. Woo.

571
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,804
Are you her brother or something?

572
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,597
Or her boyfriend?

573
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,274
Well

574
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,693
that's not true.

575
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,867
-What do you think you are doing?
-What?

576
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,745
I'm saying there's no need to fight,

577
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,164
but he keeps provoking Dr. Do.

578
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:15,626
I guess there's something going on,
don't you think, Ms. Oh?

579
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,714
I think so. What do you think that is?

580
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,507
I'm sorry.

581
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,510
Do you like Dr. Woo by any chance?

582
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,053
What did you say?

583
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:29,765
What? That's not true.

584
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,476
There is nothing going on
between Mr. Park and me.

585
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,769
Then why would he

586
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:37,023
get all worked up at In-beom?

587
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,110
-Don't you think that's weird?
-Well...

588
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,487
I'm not sure.

589
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,325
Well, do you like In-beom?

590
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,160
What?

591
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:52,330
Are you in a love triangle?

592
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,622
I can't believe this.

593
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,041
That's ridiculous.

594
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,751
Then why are you

595
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,253
picking on Dr. Woo
about every single thing?

596
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,047
I'm just doing the same thing

597
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,215
for you and Dr. Yun.

598
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:07,928
That's just my character.
That's what I do.

599
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:12,016
So, are you saying that you don't
have any feelings for Dr. Woo?

600
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:15,311
I don't have any feelings for her.
She's not even my type.

601
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:18,230
I'm telling you. That's not true.

602
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:21,150
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure.

603
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,070
In fact,

604
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:29,325
I like someone else.

605
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,576
Someone else?

606
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:32,828
-Who is that?
-Who is that?

607
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:37,458
It's a surprise
that you have an ideal type.

608
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:40,544
Who is your type?

609
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,297
You don't want to know that.

610
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,884
Gosh. Just tell me. Who's that?

611
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,346
Yun Seo-jeong.

612
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,640
Dr. Kang Dong-ju.

613
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:05,945
I see.

614
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,573
What did you just say?

615
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:11,450
Are you kidding me?

616
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,165
Seo-jeong, I need to talk to you.

617
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,042
Okay. I have something to tell you too.

618
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,470
I found out whom In-beom likes.

619
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,556
Who is that?

620
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,433
It's you.

621
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,644
He is out of his mind.

622
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,524
I also figured out the person
whom Yeon-hwa likes.

623
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,734
Who is that? Is it In-beom?

624
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,403
-Is it Mr. Park?
-It's you.

625
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:49,989
Me?

626
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,540
Do you think it can be a problem for us?

627
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,712
No. Not at all. What about you?

628
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,630
Me neither.

629
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,593
Okay then. I should go.

630
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,678
Seo-jeong.

631
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,013
What?

632
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,018
I love you.

633
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,022
Okay.

634
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,335
President Do.

635
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,020
The figures are all good.

636
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:06,649
You may be walking
out of the room next week.

637
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,359
I heard you picked a fight

638
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,278
with President Do.

639
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,658
Is that why you hurt your wrist?

640
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,785
You sure find things out quickly.

641
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,120
Is it that hard for you

642
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,540
to settle your scores with him?

643
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,834
You two are old enough to stop that.

644
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,628
Haven't you had enough of it?

645
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:31,048
It's not about my personal feelings.

646
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:34,760
It is a matter of right and wrong.

647
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,762
Are you saying

648
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,847
you are right and he's wrong?

649
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:42,434
It's not that who's right and who's wrong.

650
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,728
I'm just saying

651
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:48,148
there are things we should do
and we shouldn't do

652
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,483
as a doctor.

653
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,781
Chairman Shin, President Do is here.

654
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:02,746
What brought you here?

655
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,082
There's something
I'd like to discuss with you.

656
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,961
Chairman Shin, I should be going now.

657
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:10,045
Okay.

658
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,262
What's the matter?

659
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,352
-What are you doing?
-Please help me, Chairman Shin.

660
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,314
You're well aware

661
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:31,984
of how much I sacrificed
for Geosan Medical Center.

662
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:34,695
I have been more loyal

663
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:38,407
than anyone else
to you and the foundation.

664
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:41,744
-President Do, listen.
-It's not fair.

665
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,829
The evidence of the ghost surgery
that Yong-ju showed

666
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,664
doesn't have legal force.

667
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:48,292
Besides, there's no way
he can prove that it's true.

668
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,753
Whatever he tells you,

669
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,296
it's all a false accusation.

670
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:53,672
Everything he says is

671
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:56,634
his suspicion, assumption,

672
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,761
and speculation.

673
00:43:58,844 --> 00:43:59,928
Listen to me.

674
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,183
Teacher Kim didn't say anything to me.

675
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,188
What are you talking about?

676
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:14,485
What is the ghost surgery
and what doesn't have legal force?

677
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:17,946
Did you

678
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,825
do something illegal? Did you?

679
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,995
Tell me right now!

680
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,889
To Doldam Hospital!

681
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,683
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

682
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,438
It feels so nice.

683
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,778
Everyone, may I have your attention?

684
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:01,782
This is a very happy event
for Doldam Hospital.

685
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,284
We gathered to celebrate
the successful heart surgery

686
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:07,955
of Chairman Shin in hopes of
continued success of our hospital.

687
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:12,209
Please drink as much as you want
and enjoy yourselves.

688
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:17,339
-Was it nice, President Yeo?
-It was perfect.

689
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,552
That was exactly what I wanted to say.

690
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,724
I wish all of you health in this new year.

691
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,143
Let's make it work.

692
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,103
To all of you.

693
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:32,938
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

694
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:36,942
Here is your budaejjigae.

695
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,864
When did you cook all this?

696
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:43,907
You made fried chicken,
seasoned sea snail, and jokbal.

697
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,742
I cooked the budaejjigae myself.

698
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:48,370
As for fried chicken,
seasoned sea snail, and jokbal,

699
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:51,707
I got them delivered from a restaurant.
So they would taste good.

700
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,083
-Thank you for this.
-Thank you.

701
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:56,295
-Thank you for this.
-Thank you for the food.

702
00:45:56,378 --> 00:46:00,757
If you need a digestive medicine,
just let me know.

703
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:05,637
I prepared this
for our female staff members.

704
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:08,390
Here you go, Dr. Yun.
This will help you become prettier.

705
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,601
Thank you, Manager Jang.

706
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:11,977
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Manager Jang.

707
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,103
You're welcome.

708
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,271
That's very thoughtful of you.

709
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:17,232
Why is Teacher Kim not here?

710
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:18,817
Is he not coming?

711
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,572
-I forgot about him.
-Oh, my.

712
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,584
Please call me when we have
an emergency patient.

713
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:36,960
Yes, Teacher Kim.

714
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,644
You got me good.

715
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,229
Wouldn't you say so?

716
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:57,689
Let me ask you just one thing.

717
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,817
Why are you living like this?

718
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,529
A talented doctor like you

719
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,531
working in such a remote area,

720
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,783
trying to open
an unprofitable trauma center.

721
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:17,376
Gosh. President Do.

722
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:22,214
How many people do you think

723
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:25,217
die on the street while
wandering around to find a hospital?

724
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,055
Most of them are the poor and vulnerable.

725
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:33,016
-Do you even know that?
-So what?

726
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:36,562
Opening a trauma center here

727
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:38,313
wouldn't make any difference.

728
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:42,609
Anyone within one-hour distance
from this hospital

729
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,779
would never die on the street again

730
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,198
while looking for a hospital.

731
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,242
That's inspiring.

732
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:54,871
But one person alone
can't change the world.

733
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:57,874
Are you being a doctor
to change the world?

734
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,418
I'm not.

735
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,211
What did you say?

736
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:05,007
I am doing my job as a doctor

737
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:07,009
to save other people.

738
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,469
To a person who is dying,

739
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:12,556
I'm the only hope at that moment.

740
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:15,350
If I step back, that person would die.

741
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:18,061
If I don't give up

742
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:22,149
and try a little bit harder,
that person would live.

743
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,359
That's crazy.

744
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:26,570
I can't believe

745
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:29,531
you have such an idealistic dream
at your age.

746
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:35,579
People call that swaggering.

747
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:38,540
The fancy word to describe it is

748
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:41,918
romantic.

749
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,171
Romantic.

750
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:48,216
Romantic.

751
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,388
How many doctors would
agree with that rubbish?

752
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:56,350
How many doctors would
stay at this hospital

753
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:59,227
where they work so hard
and get paid so little?

754
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:00,812
Right?

755
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,648
I believe

756
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:06,693
that there are more young doctors

757
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,947
who want to become a good doctor

758
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,158
rather than a doctor who runs after money.

759
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:19,748
Oh, right.

760
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,585
That includes In-beom.

761
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,226
The law of conservation of romance.

762
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,398
-Cheers.
-All right.

763
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,983
Everyone, please pay attention.

764
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,652
I will sing a song for you.

765
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,028
Go, Dr. Yun!

766
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:53,990
All of you, step forward.

767
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:04,167
There are things that most people
believe don't exist

768
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,628
even though they know of their existence.

769
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:07,713
My goodness.

770
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:10,882
Still, they hope someone could
preserve those things.

771
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,634
They're beautiful values.

772
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:21,059
Those who know how to have fun
are good at their jobs, too.

773
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,310
You're right.

774
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:25,105
By the way, it's not hectic today.

775
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,858
I was worried they might page us.

776
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:30,110
Don't say such a thing.
It might come true.

777
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,872
Hello? Oh Myeong-sim speaking.

778
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:47,627
I understand.

779
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:53,049
A bus got rolled over on Route 36.

780
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:57,137
It even caught fire.
More than ten people were injured.

781
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:08,315
Gosh. Seriously.

782
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:20,827
President Yeo, are you going, too?

783
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,205
Gosh. I can't believe this.

784
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:05,664
Attention.

785
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:09,459
Six patients will be transferred
to our hospital.

786
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,503
Two of them have burn injuries.

787
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,129
The rest are severely injured

788
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:16,007
with possible multiple fractures
and intestinal injuries.

789
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:19,511
Stay focused, everyone. Okay?

790
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,012
-Yes, Teacher Kim.
-Yes, Teacher Kim.

791
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:55,589
Life is about turning
into different roads.

792
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:59,259
Whether you want it or not,

793
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:03,597
you have to face the reality
which is placed in front of you.

794
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:06,349
Patient coming in!

795
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:19,821
You can't find the right answer
every single time.

796
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:21,990
But Teacher Kim

797
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,034
always said this.

798
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:27,495
Do not give up asking the questions

799
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:31,917
about why we live and what we live for.

800
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,795
The moment you give up on that,

801
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:40,258
the romance in life ends.

802
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,093
Understood?

803
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,930
That's what he said.

804
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,980
AND...

805
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:15,543
Mr. Jung Jin-yeong?

806
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:18,171
Who are you?

807
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:22,342
This is sent from a sponsor
who wants to pay for your talent.

808
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:26,888
Pardon? Pay for my talent?

809
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,808
Your sponsor is willing to pay

810
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,394
for all of your LVAD operation fees

811
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:34,562
in return for your drawing.

812
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:36,398
Does that...

813
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,025
Does that mean

814
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,486
I can live?

815
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,822
If the surgery goes well.

816
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:20,025
IMF BAILOUT

817
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:36,791
There once lived
a very rich man in Namdaemun

818
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,252
who had the most cash in the country.

819
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,881
He was cold-hearted,

820
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:45,216
and he never knew to share.

821
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:49,220
He was also known as Scrooge of Namdaemun.

822
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:53,516
People who wanted to borrow from him,

823
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,310
and people who borrowed from him,

824
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:58,104
all hated that man.

825
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:03,109
He was only concerned
about money, money, and money.

826
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:06,488
He was a miser who only cared about money.

827
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,240
One day,

828
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:12,827
he was haggling a guy
to pay him back what he owes.

829
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:17,207
Suddenly, his heart failed
and he collapsed on the street.

830
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:23,755
None of the people around
stepped up to help him.

831
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:28,551
Except for

832
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,930
one righteous passerby.

833
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:33,515
No one else stepped up.

834
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:40,396
Teacher Kim.

835
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:45,485
Do you remember who the righteous man is?

836
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,343
THE FOUNDATION PLAN OF
TRAUMA CENTER AT DOLDAM HOSPITAL

837
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:20,145
The sunlight is

838
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:23,148
very nice.

839
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:12,363
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

840
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:28,671
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

841
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:18,263
Hey.

842
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:24,519
It's been a while.

843
