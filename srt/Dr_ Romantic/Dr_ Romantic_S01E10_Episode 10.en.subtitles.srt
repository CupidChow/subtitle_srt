1
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:24,941
Never do that again, Seo-jeong.

2
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,570
Never disappear again
without telling me anything.

3
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:30,822
You're acting up again.

4
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,869
No!

5
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,464
That's enough. Seriously!

6
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,816
What's wrong? What happened?

7
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,753
Hey. Wake up.

8
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,297
-Can you walk?
-Yes.

9
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,466
-Be careful.
-Is this 911?

10
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:34,552
There's been a traffic accident
on Route 38.

11
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,430
It's a rear-end collision of six vehicles.

12
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:45,939
Hang on a second.

13
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,775
-Are you okay?
-It wasn't me.

14
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,778
I wasn't speeding at all.

15
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,947
-It's not my fault!
-Calm down.

16
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,365
I get it. Just calm down.

17
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,616
Oh, my gosh.

18
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,535
Gosh.

19
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,703
Hang on a second.

20
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,984
Hey.

21
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,486
Are you hurt?

22
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,780
Are you experiencing any pain
in your back or your neck?

23
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,283
I'm just a chauffeur. It's not my fault.

24
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,450
Can you stand or walk?

25
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:42,537
I really didn't do anything wrong.

26
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,331
Hey. Can you help this person?

27
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,375
Being on the road can be dangerous.

28
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,751
Please move to the shoulder.

29
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,253
Let's get you on your feet.

30
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:51,838
Get up.

31
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,345
We should check other vehicles as well.

32
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,222
I'll check that side.

33
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,682
I'll check the other side.

34
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,608
Look at you.

35
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,401
Did you hit me?

36
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,570
Did you just hit me?

37
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:19,949
Call the police.

38
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,951
Call the police!

39
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,622
How dare you lay your hands on me?

40
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,168
Do you know who I am?

41
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,837
Can't you see this is an urgent situation?

42
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,216
You'd like to blame the patients,
wouldn't you?

43
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,677
I've been investigating hospitals
for 12 years now.

44
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,346
I know everything that's going on

45
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,973
in your little minds.

46
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,683
How dare you?

47
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,061
I said, call the police!

48
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,187
Yes, sir.

49
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,649
Is this the police? This is
the emergency room of Doldam Hospital.

50
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,983
You need to come here right now.

51
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,277
There's been an assault.

52
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,780
You picked the wrong day to mess with me.

53
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,825
I will never settle this out of court.

54
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,329
Teacher Kim, we have a problem.

55
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,374
I got a call from Dr. Kang.
There was a six-car rear-end collision.

56
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,087
Oh, my gosh.

57
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,547
Tell me what's happening.

58
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,300
A patient with carotid artery
injuries is expired.

59
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,804
Four patients with minor injuries
are evacuated out of the cars.

60
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,598
There are at least more than

61
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,142
10 patients including unconscious ones
remaining in the cars.

62
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,814
What about Seo-jeong? Is she with you?

63
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:36,067
Yes. She's looking for more patients
just to be sure.

64
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,112
Ms. Oh, what's the temperature outside?

65
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,698
Minus one degree.

66
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,783
And it will drop
two or three degrees more in an hour.

67
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,603
Dong-ju.

68
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,480
Bring kids, pregnant women,

69
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,774
and those with excessive bleeding first.

70
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,819
Send them to the hospital in that order.

71
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,362
Okay.

72
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,531
Make sure to keep up
the patients' body temperature.

73
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,616
You have to maintain

74
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:29,829
the unconscious patients' body temperature
no matter what. Okay?

75
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,122
Okay.

76
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,500
Do you have a blanket
or anything in your car?

77
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,044
Hold on.

78
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,381
Sir, let me see your wound, please.

79
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,219
Do you feel any pain anywhere?
Are you all right?

80
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,055
What about you?

81
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,482
Excuse me.

82
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,696
I'm cold. It's too cold.

83
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,740
Did he drink and drive?

84
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,367
Hey, lady. Why is it so cold?

85
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,537
I don't see any bleeding.

86
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:15,374
Hey, don't move and stay in the car.

87
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,460
Please close the door. I'm cold.

88
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,055
It's blood.

89
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,409
Eun-seol.

90
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:52,620
Eun-seol.

91
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,622
Eun-seol!

92
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,541
Eun-seol. Open your eyes.

93
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:57,625
Eun-seol.

94
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,043
Gosh.

95
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,004
Help.

96
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,423
Please help!

97
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,759
Please save my daughter.

98
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,803
Help!

99
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,555
Take these!

100
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,890
Cover yourselves with them.

101
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,393
Put this on, ma'am.

102
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,815
Please wait here for a moment.

103
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,527
Help!

104
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,030
We can't handle this ourselves.
Call the control room for support.

105
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,490
-Get the equipment.
-Okay.

106
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,783
Help.

107
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,493
Help my daughter!

108
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,078
Are you all right?

109
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,413
Please save Eun-seol.

110
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,498
-Eun-seol?
-Please save her.

111
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,000
Gosh.

112
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:41,878
Help!

113
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,300
Eun-seol.

114
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,636
My poor baby.

115
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,059
Eun-seol.

116
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,561
How old is your daughter?

117
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,105
How old is she?

118
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,025
She is 38 months old.

119
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,278
Where is the car seat?

120
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,241
How could you put your kid in a car
without a car seat?

121
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,371
-Eun-seol.
-What should I do?

122
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:36,807
Gosh.

123
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,524
Excuse me. Do you hear me?

124
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,442
Sir!

125
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,322
You have seriously injured your legs.

126
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,324
I will bring something to splint your legs

127
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,202
and someone to help you.
Please wait a second.

128
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:00,998
I will be right back.

129
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,959
Just a moment.

130
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:08,256
There is one more patient.

131
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,661
Honey, are you all right?

132
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,413
Honey.

133
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,583
Can you please bring a doctor?

134
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:47,378
My husband has
chronic obstructive lung disease.

135
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,006
Please tell the doctors about that.

136
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,425
-Chronic what?
-Honey.

137
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,094
Oh, no.

138
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,161
She seems to have hemoperitoneum.
Move her to Doldam Hospital now.

139
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,996
Okay. Ma'am, come with us.

140
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,956
Eun-seol, are you all right?

141
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,635
Are you okay?

142
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,219
Yes.

143
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,805
Can you move your neck?

144
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,432
Yes.

145
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:45,936
Do you feel pain in your back,
legs, or anywhere?

146
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,980
No, I don't.

147
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,359
But...

148
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,195
Look over there.

149
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,950
Help!

150
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,662
There is a patient in the thicket.

151
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,789
He has an open fracture on his right leg.

152
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,458
Please go check him
with a splint and a stretcher.

153
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,086
Bring a splint and a stretcher to him now.

154
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,462
-Yes, sir.
-Move.

155
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,546
Seo-jeong.

156
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,674
What do you think that is?

157
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,306
Is it a person?

158
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,273
Inhale on the count of three.

159
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,984
One, two, three.

160
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:36,695
Okay.

161
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,907
I will give you oxygen.

162
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,201
Breathe slowly through your nose.

163
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,203
Okay.

164
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,714
Excuse me. Lean backwards.

165
00:11:58,801 --> 00:11:59,802
It's done.

166
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,680
One, two, three.

167
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,724
One more time. One, two, three.

168
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,227
Push.

169
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,274
Okay.

170
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,826
He has crushing injuries
in both lower legs.

171
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,286
He's bleeding a lot.

172
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,745
We need to apply a tourniquet.

173
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:27,997
Tourniquet?

174
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,753
-Would this work?
-Yes. I need one more.

175
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:35,880
One more?

176
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,549
I have one.

177
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,468
Here you are.

178
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,515
Give him hydration.

179
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,767
And I need splints and fluid.

180
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,852
Okay.

181
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,526
I need a lot of warm saline.
I need the C-line, Foley catheters,

182
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,944
and intubation tubes, five each.

183
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,071
Empty the hybrid room entirely.

184
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,948
-Where should I go?
-Empty all these beds here.

185
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,951
Move the existing patients inside.

186
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,369
-Teacher Kim.
-Yes.

187
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,289
The first patient is coming
in three minutes. A four-year-old girl.

188
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,417
Dr. Kang says she has muscle guarding,

189
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,211
so it might be a seat belt injury.

190
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,214
Have Seo-jeong take care of
the patients at the scene

191
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,798
and call Dong-ju now.

192
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:20,758
Okay.

193
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,510
-Mr. Park.
-Yes.

194
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,178
What about the
Boerhaave's syndrome patient?

195
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,096
Dr. Nam is getting ready for that.

196
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,098
Call Dr. Yang at Jeongil Hospital

197
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,392
and send the patient to him.

198
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,894
And have Dr. Nam

199
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,647
treat the four-year-old girl.

200
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,731
Okay.

201
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,904
Do you really want to take it this far?

202
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:43,989
Dr. Bu Yong-ju.

203
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,075
-I can't stand it anymore.
-Stop it.

204
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,537
There was a six-car rear-end collision.
Didn't you hear that?

205
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,498
Do you really want to do this
while people are dying?

206
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,583
We are just following the instructions.

207
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,044
That's what I'm getting paid for.

208
00:13:57,127 --> 00:14:00,089
An instruction disregarding reality
is no different from a tyranny.

209
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,175
What if people die?
Will you take the responsibility?

210
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,260
Exactly.

211
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,972
This wouldn't have happened
if you followed the rules.

212
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,183
You're the one who did you wrong.

213
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,268
You can't blame us.

214
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:16,647
What an ignorant little brat.

215
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,856
We have a patient.

216
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,817
She's a four-year-old,
currently unconscious,

217
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,485
and her capillary refill time is dropping.

218
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,153
-Move her to the hybrid room.
-Okay.

219
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,405
Eun-seol!

220
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,367
Doctor, please save Eun-seol.

221
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,912
Honey.

222
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,397
They need an orthopedic surgeon.

223
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,774
-Please take them to a big hospital.
-Yes.

224
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,702
Surgeons, you can return to the hospital.

225
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,121
I'll take care of the rest of the wounded.

226
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,415
Wait.

227
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,175
See you at the hospital.

228
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,636
Okay. See you.

229
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,405
What's wrong? Is it bad?

230
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:51,742
He is so drunk
that he's throwing up right now.

231
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,370
I need water.

232
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,205
Water, please.

233
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:57,790
Water.

234
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,376
Miss, do you have water?

235
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,505
What's his blood alcohol content?

236
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,006
He refuses to be tested.

237
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,384
He wants a blood test
at the police station.

238
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,468
I'll go.

239
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,178
Let's go, man.

240
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:15,432
I will let you take my blood
at the police station.

241
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,518
Really?

242
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,229
If that's what you want.

243
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:26,694
What's she doing?

244
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,114
You're pretty.

245
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:43,210
-Wow, that was fast.
-It's done.

246
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,380
You just need to get
an ex post facto warrant.

247
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,297
Yes.

248
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,509
You.

249
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,930
Don't put your drunk ass behind the wheel.

250
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,766
That's an attempted murder. You asshole.

251
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:01,645
Hey, lady.

252
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,647
Who are you?

253
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,315
Who are you

254
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,402
to talk to me like that?

255
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,029
Me?

256
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,323
I'm Crazy Whale of Doldam Hospital,

257
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,035
Dr. Yun Seo-jeong.

258
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,234
He wants to see you.

259
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,367
Her spleen seems damaged.

260
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,411
It looks like her capsule is broken.

261
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,455
CAPSULE: MEMBRANE ENCLOSING ORGANS

262
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,040
-Teacher Kim.
-Yes?

263
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,174
Her CT scans are in. Come here.

264
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,220
This is her spleen.

265
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,097
Do you see how it's spotted?

266
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,140
That means internal bleeding.

267
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,728
Is this fatal?

268
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,271
She's a little girl.

269
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:30,442
So general anesthesia itself
may be dangerous to her.

270
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,278
However, if she doesn't get an operation,

271
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,740
the worst may happen
due to excessive bleeding.

272
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:38,659
Oh, no.

273
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,410
No.

274
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,330
Pediatric surgeries are

275
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,457
different from that of adults.

276
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,502
I'm the only one who can operate on her.

277
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,505
Will you stop me now?

278
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,425
Rules are...

279
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,137
rules.

280
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,018
I know she's my daughter,

281
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,357
but I can't bend the rules.

282
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:11,984
Honey.

283
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,281
You idiot.

284
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,375
Okay.

285
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,171
I'll do my thing,
and you can do your thing.

286
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,965
I don't care what you do.

287
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,384
I have to operate on her.

288
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,722
You still don't have any idea.

289
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,516
There's only one rule for me.

290
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,394
I will make them live. No matter what.

291
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,607
Okay.

292
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,942
-Get her to the operating room.
-Yes, sir.

293
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,323
-Will you come and sign a consent form?
-Yes.

294
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,057
We have a patient.

295
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,392
This way, please.

296
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,145
This way.

297
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:31,813
Use that bed.

298
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,732
This way.

299
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:37,027
She was hanging upside down
from a small car.

300
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,363
-Please take a C-spine X-ray first.
-Okay.

301
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,240
-Dong-ju
-Yes.

302
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,200
I heard we have an open fracture case.

303
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,868
Two patients with lower leg open fracture.

304
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,954
One injured both legs,
the other injured the right.

305
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,747
We sent them
to a different hospital for OS.

306
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,750
Seo-jeong will be back as soon as
she takes care of the wounded.

307
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,752
We have two operations.

308
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,212
One is Boerhaave's syndrome,

309
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,047
and the other is a pediatric splenectomy.

310
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,633
I'm taking the kid.

311
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,261
Did any of you ever deal with a case of
Boerhaave's syndrome?

312
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,639
I have. Once.

313
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,141
-With a laparoscope?
-Yes.

314
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,060
Okay.

315
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:13,355
In-beom, you're the main surgeon,
and Dong-ju will assist.

316
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,440
Okay.

317
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,486
We'll get ready.

318
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,301
What?

319
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,761
What do you mean
you haven't found a hospital?

320
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,723
We've searched everywhere
through Gangneung and Sokcho.

321
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,433
I called every single hospital,

322
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,351
and they are all fully booked.

323
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:54,104
There are no beds
at their emergency rooms. What do we do?

324
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,857
His blood pressure is dropping,
and his bleeding continues.

325
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,692
My goodness.

326
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,501
You said you've done it before.

327
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,253
I'm just practicing one last time.

328
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,298
-Is that bad?
-No.

329
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:26,261
I'll get ready then, Dr. Do.

330
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,742
Dr. Nam, are we ready?

331
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,164
Dr. Nam.

332
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,834
Yes, begin.

333
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,301
Scalpel.

334
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:19,689
Trocar.

335
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,163
Scope.

336
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,502
Scalpel.

337
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,634
We're opening her peritoneum.

338
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,302
Keep your eyes on her vital signs.

339
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:51,221
Okay.

340
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,768
Eun-seol wanted to see you.

341
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,813
You said it was a day trip.

342
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,316
When we heard you are
staying for a few more days,

343
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,902
we packed her clothes

344
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,280
and went to see you.

345
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,284
Why did you remove the car seat?

346
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,204
She hated sitting there.

347
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,749
I didn't know this would happen.

348
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,131
Please move aside.

349
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,384
Patient coming in.

350
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,311
Hey.

351
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,438
You can't bring OS patients in here.

352
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:44,566
Was I supposed to leave him
on the streets and let him die?

353
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,026
Watch your words, Seo-jeong.

354
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:48,820
The ambulance wasn't well-equipped,
and the bleeding was too excessive.

355
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:51,198
I'll see if I can transfer him
while doing transfusion.

356
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,533
Can't you see this place is
already packed?

357
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,285
Which one do you want?

358
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,829
-The one with right leg injury.
-Okay.

359
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,915
Can you hear me, sir?

360
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,416
The BP is 90 over 60, pulse 120.

361
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:04,085
Please give him warm fluid.

362
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,379
Set one more IV line
and give him 2L of hydration.

363
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,006
-Yes, Doctor.
-Scissors.

364
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:12,928
Hang in there.
I'm going to cut the bandages now.

365
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,560
Bring me elastic bandages
and pad splints, please.

366
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,519
Yes, Doctor.

367
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:31,696
This looks like the spot.

368
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,324
There isn't a clear vision.

369
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,159
Can you pull the scope back?

370
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,789
Pull the scope back!

371
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,940
Should we call Teacher Kim?

372
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,861
Hey, Dr. Do.

373
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:18,785
No.

374
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,370
I got this.

375
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,092
I found it.

376
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,094
Here is the tear site.

377
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,096
Give me 3-0 Vicryl.

378
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:54,487
I got it.

379
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,574
Commencing fundoplication.

380
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,035
One more 3-0 Vicryl, please.

381
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,083
How's the other patient?

382
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,419
I think he needs amputation
below both of his knees.

383
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,881
Lacerated wounds on his scalp
and severe abrasion on his back.

384
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,549
-How big is it?
-About 10 palms.

385
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:17,135
So is the other patient.
There's no pulse on his foot.

386
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,595
Did you find a hospital available?

387
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,638
I'm looking into it,
but it's hard to find.

388
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:24,100
Please ask Manager Jang as well.
He has friends in other hospitals.

389
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,268
I will.

390
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:29,272
Let's return to the customers
who are waiting for us.

391
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,024
To the left?

392
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:34,986
Or to the right?

393
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,783
-I'll go to the left.
-I'll take the right side.

394
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,370
What are you talking about?

395
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,205
Why would she bring OS patients
to our hospital?

396
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:49,042
We couldn't transfer them elsewhere.
They're in critical conditions.

397
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,293
My goodness.

398
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,214
Dr. Yun has done it again.

399
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:34,504
Are you still having difficulty breathing?

400
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,840
It's gotten a lot better now.

401
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,384
Actually

402
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:43,638
tomorrow is our 54th anniversary.

403
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,559
Really? You have been married
for 54 years?

404
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,354
My wife married me when she was 19.

405
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,148
-Stop it.
-She's done--

406
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,900
The doctor is trying to examine you.

407
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,903
Take a deep breath for me.

408
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,535
Let's get you some more oxygen
through respiratory treatment.

409
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:08,455
How about you?
Are you experiencing any pain, ma'am?

410
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:11,708
-Did you hit hard into anywhere?
-Not that,

411
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:16,838
but my heart is beating really fast.
I think it's because I'm in shock.

412
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:21,009
My wife always had a weak heart.

413
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,385
May I see your hand?

414
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:28,141
You do have a rapid pulse.

415
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:32,437
Do you feel heavy in the chest or pain
in any other body parts?

416
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,314
It's probably because I'm in shock.

417
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:40,195
I'm really fine.
Please look after my husband first.

418
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,906
You have to tell me right away
if you start feeling any pain.

419
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,949
By the way, Doctor.

420
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,952
How old are you?

421
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,662
There you go again.

422
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:50,789
What?

423
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:54,584
She looks about the same age
as our youngest child.

424
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,754
Please get some rest.

425
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,760
Did you call the kids?

426
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:07,680
I told them to drive slowly
because the road is slippery.

427
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,309
Get some sleep until they get here.

428
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:12,685
I will.

429
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:34,457
Gosh.

430
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,634
It hurts.

431
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,682
RESTRICTED AREA
OPERATING ROOM

432
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:57,856
Come out with it.

433
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,066
You've never done it, have you?

434
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:04,112
You were lying when you said
you've done it once, right?

435
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,865
It wasn't that difficult of an operation.

436
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,783
The operation was a success anyway.

437
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,410
Isn't that what matters?

438
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:12,745
Do you think it's kind of a joke?

439
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,497
Of course it's not.

440
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,417
But it's not something
I'll risk my life for, either.

441
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,964
He got you there.

442
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,632
I think so.

443
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,362
That's how you have it, right?

444
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:50,700
Coffee, cream, and sugar.

445
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:51,993
It is.

446
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,039
Here you go.

447
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,625
Thank you.

448
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:00,960
Excuse me, Doctor.

449
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,881
Have you, by any chance,

450
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:08,551
ever thought of

451
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,386
quitting your job?

452
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,890
Why do you ask me that all of a sudden?

453
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,851
I was wondering

454
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:21,022
how you kept yourself going
whenever you wanted to quit.

455
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,649
I was just curious.

456
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,526
Let me think.

457
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,529
Sometimes I felt like

458
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,532
I didn't want all my hard work
to go to waste.

459
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,869
I also didn't have the courage

460
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,705
to be good at something else
other than this.

461
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,583
Is that all?

462
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:45,213
What about your beliefs as a doctor

463
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,632
or the sense of duty?

464
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,803
I think

465
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,889
I need at least 10 years
of experience to know those things.

466
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,143
Speaking about it and knowing it
in your head are different things.

467
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,398
The emergency room is paging me.

468
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,400
I have to go. Thanks for the coffee.

469
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:21,749
What happened?

470
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,543
The bleeding got severe
from the increased BP.

471
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,753
Reduce the amount of fluid.
Bring me the C-line and Foley.

472
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:26,879
Yes, Doctor.

473
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,006
I'll set up the C-line.

474
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,258
I need a Foley catheter.

475
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,430
Doctor. The patient on bed number five
went into arrest.

476
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,432
-Set up the C-line for me.
-Okay.

477
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,315
Doctor? My wife isn't breathing!

478
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,776
Can you hear me, ma'am?

479
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,112
-I need the monitor.
-Yes, Doctor.

480
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,076
No breathing and unresponsive.
I need her on a bed.

481
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,454
-Honey! Honey!
-Excuse me.

482
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,747
One, two, three.

483
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,085
Connect her to a monitor
and prepare for an intubation.

484
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,141
His central venous pressure is very low.

485
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,267
No urine, either.

486
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,020
He needs more blood,
but he's losing it when the BP goes up.

487
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,438
Let's put more elastic bandages.

488
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,065
Target blood pressure
on the systole is 100.

489
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,150
-Tell me if it goes over.
-Okay.

490
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:49,378
Bring the defibrillator immediately!

491
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,301
You can stop.

492
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,263
Stop doing that!

493
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:03,935
We have

494
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:07,688
decided not to do this, Doctor.

495
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,025
We already signed the papers

496
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,278
that we don't want CPR performed on us.

497
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,614
I think he means
the Do Not Resuscitate Order.

498
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,449
Sir.

499
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:24,872
It's fine.

500
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,794
You may stop, Doctor.

501
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:10,835
You have been

502
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:14,297
through so much.

503
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,217
You've done so much

504
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,222
as my partner in life.

505

WOO YEON-HWA

507
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,717
-Monitor her input and output.
-Yes.

508
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,720
And let me know if her Hemovac darkens.

509
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:26,846
-Yes, Teacher Kim.
-Okay.

510

HEMOVAC: DRAINAGE TUBE

511
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,351
Yes.

512
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:37,189
Her spleen was damaged,
so I removed some parts.

513
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,067
But thankfully,
her prognosis isn't so bad.

514
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,530
We'll monitor her for a day

515
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,907
and move her to the general ward tomorrow.

516
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,535
Thank you.

517
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:51,245
Thank you so much.

518
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:54,665
-You can go see her for a second.
-Okay.

What...

521
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,809
should I do?

522
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:19,440
I'm not sure what you wanted
in return for my kid's operation.

523
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,277
Tell me.

524
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,823
What do you want from me?

525
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,658
You should go see your kid.

526
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,585
I know that you are
trying hard to do your job.

527
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,630
But let's not live like a fool.

528
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,840
At the very least,

529
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:49,387
we shouldn't forget what we live for.

530
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,367
What are you talking about?

531
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,577
Why do they want our orthopedic surgeon
at Doldam Hospital?

532
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:16,205
-Why?
-I am not sure why.

533
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,791
I heard it was the decision
of Internal Affairs.

534
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,628
-Get him on the phone.
-Yes.

535
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:26,966
There are two patients severely injured
from a car accident.

536
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,051
Things are really bad,

537
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,095
so I asked for the orthopedic surgeons.

538
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:32,763
Mr. Choi.

539
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,348
What do you think you're doing?

540
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:37,726
I'll report on the details once I'm back.

541
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,145
Bye.

542
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:04,462
Yes, President Do.

543
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,255
What on earth are you doing?

544
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,215
Do you even know

545
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,551
what's happening at Doldam Hospital?

546
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,137
What's going on?

547
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,722
You are absurd.

548
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,557
Should you be asking me?

549
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:18,642
Where are you?

550
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,436
Are you out getting drunk?

551
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:24,231
No, drinking? No way.

552
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,733
Never, President Do.

553
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,080
President Do.

554
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,000
President Do.

555
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,671
Bu Yong-ju.

556
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,351
Is Seo-jeong back?

557
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:01,602
Yes.

558
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:06,315
But a patient died just now
due to a cardiac arrest.

559
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,387
Are you feeling better?

560
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:38,722
I should be.

561
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,643
It's not like this is my first time.

562
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,397
But I never get used to it.

563
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,774
You did your best.

564
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,694
That's what counts.

565
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:55,281
Did I do my best?

566
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,367
I'm not so sure.

567
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:03,038
Am I doing this right?

568
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,168
Is the best I'm doing

569
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:12,464
the best for my patient?

570
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,801
A doctor is only human.

571
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,470
You're only human.

572
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,684
Would that work

573
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:27,730
as a viable excuse for my dead patient?

574
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,610
Teacher Kim.

575
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,155
Follow me.

576
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,621
Should I come with you?

577
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,497
No, it's fine.

578
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:11,482
I'm sorry about what I did earlier.

579
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,192
Go in.

580
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,781
In there?

581
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:19,782
Hey.

582
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:24,370
Do you want everyone
to see you get kicked in the shins?

583
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,877
No. I'll go in.

584
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:41,887
Doctor.

585
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,976
Honey, look.

586
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,062
She's the doctor who saved you.

587
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:00,572
There is

588
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,952
only one way to see

589
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,787
if a doctor is doing the job right.

590
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,749
You can see that through the patient.

591
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:14,753
That's the only way.

592
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:23,345
Don't try to take responsibility
for the patient's unfortunate death.

593
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:28,934
All you have to do is
doing your best as you learned.

594
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,438
Just focus on that.

595
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,987
As of today, you're no longer an orderly.

596
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:45,742
I'll train you hard from now on,
so brace yourself.

597
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,204
Yes, I'll brace myself.

598
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:51,331
Don't cry. It makes me emotional.

599
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,919
Why are you still standing here?
Go in there.

600
00:45:58,464 --> 00:45:59,465
Yes, Teacher Kim.

601
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,384
Doctor, thank you so much.

602
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,761
Doctor, thank you very much.

603
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,097
Thank you, Doctor.

604
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,691
Thank you.

605
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,235
Thank you.

606

00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,173
You've been up to something interesting.

612
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,845
How long have you been there?

613
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,681
I got here quite long ago.

614
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:34,268
I found something interesting,
so I've been reading it.

615
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,562
Is this

616
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:40,065
the plan you said you had in mind?

PERSONNEL RECORD, KANG DONG-JU

620
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,544
You came into my office
without my permission,

621
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,754
and you touched my belongings.

622
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:05,382
This is a very bad habit of yours.

623
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,968
Chairman Shin wants to know.

624
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,554
You seem to have a specific plan.

625
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,390
Isn't that good enough to reveal now?

626
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,934
This is just a rough sketch.

627
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:20,314
Have you found the people
to be in your rough sketch?

628
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:24,151
May I ask who they are?

629
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:28,405
Teacher Kim.

630
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,367
I'm sorry to interrupt.

631
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:35,037
It's okay. What is it?

632
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:39,333
An orthopedic surgeon
from the main hospital is coming.

633
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:42,002
I think Mr. Choi pulled some strings.
What should we do?

634
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:50,802
Please call Dr. Nam from Anesthesiology.

635
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:59,686
Dong-ju and In-beom.

636
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,648
Let them assist the surgery.

637
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,652
Please prepare for the surgery
with Mr. Park.

638
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,742
Please call Seo-jeong as well.

639
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:15,285
Although she's from another department,

640
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:18,955
she'll learn a lot
from assisting surgeries.

641
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,041
Yes, Doctor. I'll let everyone know.

642
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:23,502
I'll leave you two alone.

643
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:39,017
-Are you going in, too?
-Yes, I received a call.

644
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,936
The patient's vital signs are unstable.

645
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:43,730
We need to give him enough
blood transfusion during the surgery.

646
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,191
Please prepare 10 packed RBCs and 10 FFPs.

647
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:47,150
Yes, Doctor.

648
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:50,028
Let's move the patient
with both leg injuries to the OR first.

649
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,446
-Yes, Doctor.
-Yes, Doctor.

650
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:55,534
PRESIDENT DO

651
00:49:58,829 --> 00:49:59,830
What is it?

652
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:04,167
Nothing. You go ahead.

653
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:07,546
PRESIDENT DO

654
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,992
We'll begin the surgery.

655
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:39,119
The BP is 100 over 60. It remains stable.

656
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:42,122
Tourniquet on.
Set it up at 280 for 90 minutes.

657
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:54,217
Are all of them going to be
on the same boat?

658
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,386
I'm not sure.

659
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:01,683
I will have to look into that.

660
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,622
EMERGENCY CENTER

661
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,181
-Hello.
-Hello.

662
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:49,648
-Shall I wake her up?
-No, that's okay.

663
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:51,983
I guess she worked all night again.

664
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:54,903
Yes, she finished a surgery
less than an hour ago.

665
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:56,988
Oh, I see.

666
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,366
Everyone worked so hard.

667
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:02,452
Goodness.

668
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:06,164
It was

669
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,292
the best night ever.

670
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:15,048
I finally came up with the main characters
for my new webtoon.

671
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:19,344
I'll give you this to celebrate it.

672
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,863
It looks great.

673
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,017
It's nice.

674
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:39,090
What brings you here this early?

675
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:41,176
I'm surprised you came to see me.

676
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:46,640
I'm here to apologize
for what happened the other day,

677
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,392
and to report to you
that Dr. Yun's incident

678
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,186
has been resolved well.

679
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:52,854
Has it been resolved well?

680
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,942
-How?
-Her test result says she's normal.

681
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:59,653
Also, the patient she was accused
of overtreating

682
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,279
recovered his consciousness.

683
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:03,365
You didn't come here to apologize.

684
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:06,409
You are here to just show off.

685
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,411
You were right,

686
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,664
and I was wrong.

687
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,123
Is that what you want to say?

688
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:20,632
You might have gotten away
with it this time,

689
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:24,594
but President Do won't give up.

690
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:30,308
He is a man of tenacity.

691
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:32,686
I think you know that.

692
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,776
PRESIDENT DO

693
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,153
He will

694
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:46,032
take away things

695
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,618
that matter to you

696
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,203
one by one.

697
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:53,915
Pick up your phone, gosh.

698
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,001
Answer it.

699
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:58,837
Damn it.

700
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,924
He will try to mess with you

701
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:06,052
by using your weaknesses against you.

702
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,305
Are you sure you can handle it?

703
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:19,232
Drink it.

704
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:23,069
Why did you want to see me

705
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,530
so early in the morning?

706
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:26,948
How do you like the car?

707
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:28,950
Do you like it?

708
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:34,080
I heard your car was scrapped.

709
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,206
So I

710
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,584
bought you a new one.

711
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:39,753
Didn't you hear that?

712
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:00,315
It's cold.

713
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,694
What time is it?

714
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:19,918
MEDICAL OFFICE

715
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:33,306
Manager Jang, what are you doing here?

716
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:38,895
I was emptying the trash can.

717
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:40,146
Were you?

718
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,024
-Where is Yeon-hwa?
-She quit.

719
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,193
It must have been hard for her.

720
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,445
She just left without saying goodbye.

721
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,950
I'm sorry that you have to
take over her job.

722
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:53,493
There is nothing I wouldn't do

723
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:55,453
if it's for Doldam Hospital.

724
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:57,997
I'm done

725
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,125
cleaning the office.

726
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:02,335
I should go, then.

727
