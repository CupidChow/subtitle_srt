1
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:47,881
Do you…

2
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,132
ALPRAZOLAM

3
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,092
have to go into that OR?

4
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,137
Yes. I do.

5
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,348
-Who did you say is coming in?
-Dr. Seo.

6
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,602
He was the first assistant
during the first surgery,

7
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:02,729
so it'll be helpful to have him around.

8
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:05,899
-He told me to tell you that.
-Dr. Bu Yong-ju said that?

9
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,233
Doctor Kim did.

10
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:11,905
That's how we address him
here at Doldam Hospital.

11
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,494
So go get ready, will you?

12
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,789
How much do I tell them?

13
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,999
-What?
-You didn't…

14
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,252
You didn't take a CT before going
into the OR,

15
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,713
and the intercostal vessel process
was odd too.

16
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,049
They'll nitpick over everything
if I tell them.

17
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,885
-And?
-Then won't you get in trouble?

18
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,971
Why are you worried if I get into trouble?

19
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,893
I don't want to be involved in a hassle.

20
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,523
I want to make sure I don't have to take
any responsibility for this.

21
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,110
Goodness.

22
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:53,029
You're one consistent kid.

23
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,117
I was the surgeon in charge,
so I'll take full responsibility.

24
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,202
Just focus on the surgery, okay?

25
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,788
Make sure you answer
everything the surgeon asks.

26
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,832
I mean, as is?

27
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:09,170
Yes, as is. According to all the facts.
Whatever you have seen.

28
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,923
You can be consistent
and tell him everything as is.

29
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,259
TREATMENT ROOM 3, TREATMENT ROOM 2

30
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:42,954
Okay.

31
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:45,540
I can do it.

32
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,587
It's okay.

33
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,672
Someone else is joining us to help us out.

34
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,301
There he is.

35
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:58,887
Seo Woo-jin?

36
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,347
What's going on?

37
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,892
What do you think?

38
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,228
He betrayed you
so that he could snatch the opportunity.

39
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:11,649
This punk is a pro at stabbing others
in the back, you know.

40
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,953
All right. Let's begin the surgery.

41
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:25,747
Let's begin.

42
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,332
Scalpel.

43
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:29,792
Scalpel.

44
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,385
OPERATING ROOM 1

45
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,637
OPERATING ROOM 2

46
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,639
RESTRICTED AREA: OPERATING ROOM

47
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,937
That scumbag.

48
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:04,160
UTILIZING CONFLICT

49
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,245
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

50
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,509
Good day, sir.

51
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,302
Thank you. Goodbye.

52
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,069
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

53
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,363
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

54
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,287
Excuse me.

55
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,038
He's in surgery again.

56
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,348
President Yeo. How may I help you?

57
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,768
Oh, did you watch the news?

58
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,187
I didn't call because you were on leave.

59
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,272
Oh, I see.

60
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,942
I am currently by the operating rooms.

61
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,862
In OR one, doctors from Geosan

62
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,614
are performing the second surgery
on Minister Ryu.

63
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,452
Doctor Kim is in OR two,

64
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,495
operating on the minister's secretary.

65
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,749
Both rooms are filled with tension.

66
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:36,127
It feels as if we will see
two master swordsmen

67
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,671
having a showdown.

68
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,632
We'll check for bleeding in the abdomen

69
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,760
and remove the gauze packed in there.

70
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,724
Ms. Oh, hand me more. Large tape.

71
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,560
Keep the tape coming.

72
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,187
He's bleeding more than I expected.

73
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,229
BLEEDING: HEMORRHAGE

74
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,522
Retractors.

75
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,152
Right angle forceps.

76
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,870
Gosh, that looks really neat.

77
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,918
How much did he bleed
during the first surgery?

78
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,921
We used 30 packs of RBC
and 20 packs of FFP.

79
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:20,963
That much?

80
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,757
He had been taking aspirin.

81
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,177
-It wasn't easy to control the bleeding.
-He really is an expert, isn't he?

82
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,887
I can't believe he managed to do this.

83
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,265
It looks like you won't have
a lot to do, Professor Park.

84
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,687
I saw on the record that there was
bleeding from an intercostal vessel.

85
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,439
We controlled the hemoperitoneum,

86
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,150
but his chest cavity still gave out
800 ml of blood.

87
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,862
After we changed his position,
we found bleeding from the intercostal.

88
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,114
What about the CT scan?

89
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,074
He didn't check before?

90
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,917
He's asking you a question.
Didn't he check the CT scan?

91
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,593
Forget the CT scan.

92
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,178
Send him to the OR immediately.

93
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,180
You'll open him up without a CT scan?

94
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,516
With trauma patients,
it's all about saving time.

95
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,394
If you stick to the procedure,
you won't be able to save him.

96
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,272
He was in critical condition,

97
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,732
-and his blood pressure didn't look good.
-Wait.

98
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,026
You didn't even take it?

99
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,577
No.

100
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,204
Are you insane?

101
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,914
You opened him up without a CT scan?

102
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,709
As I told you,
the patient's condition was failing.

103
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:40,877
And in times like these,

104
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,421
he said we must do damage control
for trauma patients.

105
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,505
Yes, so…

106
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:50,011
how did he control the bleeding on
an intercostal vessel without a CT scan?

107
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,057
It was all based on
your gut instinct and luck.

108
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,268
If that was all you could see,

109
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,563
it means you're not any better after all.

110
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,026
What's wrong?

111
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,279
Can you not answer that?

112
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,741
No.

113
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,161
-It's not that.
-Then what?

114
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,747
Did he bribe you?

115
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,586
How much are you getting
for keeping your mouth shut?

116
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,633
All right, Mr. Jang.

117
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,510
Call me as soon as it's over.

118
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:31,969
Yes.

119
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,722
-Goodness.
-Gosh. I'm sorry.

120
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,308
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

121
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:41,479
-Are you a new doctor here?
-How did you know?

122
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,980
Are you a regular at this hospital?

123
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:47,109
-Which department are you looking for?
-Oh, I'm the president of this--

124
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,070
Oh, are you the president's patient?

125
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,238
What?

126
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,781
Gosh, I'm sorry.

127
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:55,117
-The president is apparently on leave.
-No, I'm--

128
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,285
One second, sir.

129
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,453
What?

130
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,579
Let's see…

131
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,960
It's busy here with this crowd,
so do you want to come to the ER?

132
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,420
I'm actually an ER resident.

133
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,338
I see.

134
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,883
And on top of that,
I'm a bit free right now.

135
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,385
Let me take a look at you.

136
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,053
-Come this way.
-Let's do that.

137
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,597
Excuse me, coming through.

138
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,182
-I'm so worried.
-Sorry. Excuse me.

139
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,225
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

140
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,309
What's going on?

141
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:31,737
Dr. Cha?

142
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,955
Dr. Cha? Dr. Cha? Are you ill?

143
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,003
I wasn't sleeping.

144
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,338
What?

145
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,008
No, I wasn't asleep.

146
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,343
Oh, I'm completely all right.

147
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,895
Yes, this is Bae Moon-jung.

148
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,482
I see. All right.

149
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,027
I'll head over right now. All right.

150
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,616
-Hey, where are you going?
-There's a rib fracture patient.

151
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,618
A rib fracture patient?

152
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,828
Then I… I'll go.

153
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:21,996
I'll go.

154
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,372
I'll do it. I'll go.

155
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:37,219
Nurse Um, the president's patient came,
and I said I'd take a look at him.

156
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,097
Can you check his temperature and BP?
Bed number two, please.

157
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,559
The president's patient?

158
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,478
Who could it be?

159
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,104
Goodness.

160
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,857
Goodness. Oh, my gosh.

161
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,693
He bumped into a cultivator
and has pain in his right chest.

162
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:53,653
Goodness.

163
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,073
Dr. Cha.

164
00:10:58,532 --> 00:10:59,492
Oh, yes?

165
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,080
But… But why did you call an OS doctor?

166
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,998
You should call a CS for a rib fracture.

167
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,667
What?

168
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,085
I looked at the FAST,

169
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,086
but he wasn't bleeding,

170
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,089
the oxygen level looked fine,
and he had no other organ damage.

171
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:17,093
I've been taking care
of simple rib fracture cases, Dr. Cha.

172
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,803
My gosh, man.

173
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,932
Please stop using honorifics on me,
Moon-jung.

174
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,850
You can speak casually to me.

175
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,727
Okay, I'll do that over time.

176
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,105
It takes me a while
to get close to someone.

177
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,691
You can't do that to me though.

178
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:36,070
I even joined the Bone Club
because of you.

179
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:39,031
Don't you remember?
Look at my delicate phalanx.

180
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:39,990
PHALANX: FINGER BONES

181
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:43,494
"Your mid phalanx and distal phalanx
are especially beautiful.

182
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,329
It's a perfect hand for a surgeon."

183
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,498
You told me that.

184
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,916
Don't you remember?

185
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,377
So, what now?

186
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,170
What about the patient, Dr. Cha?

187
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,048
We need to take a CT scan first.

188
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,802
If he has any internal bleeding,
he might need surgery.

189
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,388
What? Do I need surgery?

190
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,639
No, sir.

191
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,516
It's not that you need one, sir.

192
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:09,603
You may look fine right now,
but you might suddenly bleed, sir.

193
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,355
Bleed? What?

194
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,150
Is my condition that serious?

195
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,276
No, sir.

196
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,610
That may be the case,

197
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,988
so we need to take a CT scan to check.

198
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,947
Take her away.

199
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,824
-Oh, yes. Hey.
-Dr. Jung!

200
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,410
Why do you keep cutting me off?

201
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,496
We have the responsibility and duty

202
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,499
to explain all possible scenarios
to patients.

203
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,169
That way, we have something to say
even if they sue us.

204
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,379
We get betrayed by patients all the time.

205
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,338
Dr. Bae?

206
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,840
Dr. Cha, we need to talk.

207
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,009
Am I wrong, Moon-jung?

208
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,012
Of course, you're right.
Right. Let's turn this way.

209
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,847
Okay. This way.

210
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,640
Call me when you have the CT scan.

211
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,934
Let's grab a cup of coffee then.

212
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,061
Goodness, Mother.

213
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:55,399
I saw my late mother in my dream
last night.

214
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,567
Goodness, no.

215
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,651
Darn it.

216
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,569
Oh, no. Mother.

217
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,071
-Let's take him for a CT scan.
-Goodness, Mother.

218
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,406
Who am I talking to?

219
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,033
Dr. Yoon! Nurse Um!

220
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:06,952
What?

221
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,330
What's wrong?

222
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,124
Do you know him too?

223
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,459
Yes, of course.

224
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:14,794
I know him very well.

225
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,003
I see.

226
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,964
Wow, you must be a regular.

227
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,424
You even know Nurse Um.

228
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,261
I've been coming here for ages.

229
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,348
-I see.
-Quiet.

230
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,974
Let me take a listen.

231
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,768
It might be a bit cold.

232
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,103
Please take a deep breath in.

233
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,606
And breathe out.

234
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,986
Please take another deep breath in.

235
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,617
And breathe out.

236
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:49,662
What?

237
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,831
Look.

238
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:52,915
What's this?

239
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,004
Doctor Kim. It's a message from Mr. Jang.

240
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,757
They found green-colored gauze
in the minister's abdomen.

241
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,428
His bile must be leaking.

242
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,638
Right angle forceps.

243
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,312
Okay. His splenic artery is under control.

244
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,522
Scissors.

245
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,694
Tie it up.

246
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,496
Clip.

247
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,290
It's bile peritonitis.

248
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,709
His bile duct must be damaged.

249
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,420
-Irrigation.
-Suction.

250
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,049
There's no leakage.

251
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,093
It's still tied up well.

252
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,763
Open up the cystic duct again
with a trans cystic biliary drain.

253
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,474
We'll use that to find out
where the bile leakage is.

254
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:53,767
Scalpel.

255
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,983
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry.

256
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,110
-I must have touched the clip.
-Tape.

257
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:04,987
Keep pressing down.

258
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,449
-Keep going.
-Tape.

259
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,160
His blood pressure is dropping.

260
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,204
There must be more bleeding.

261
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:21,795
Bring more blood.

262
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,427
Is something wrong?

263
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,428
I'm not sure.

264
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,847
I'm a little worried too.

265
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,893
After all, he's not Doctor Kim.

266
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,565
Bovie.

267
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,400
Can you hold this a little?

268
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,419
Forceps.

269
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,468
Found it.

270
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,930
It started bleeding in the hepatic artery
as the clip was detached. Forceps.

271
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,306
Clip.

272
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,392
Stick.

273
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,441
One more.

274
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,075
Okay.

275
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,620
He's at 90 over 50.

276
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,164
Dr. Yang, are you out of your mind?

277
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:40,708
I'm sorry.

278
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,043
His intestines are quite swollen.

279
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,463
We probably can't suture him like this.

280
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,008
What will you do?

281
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:16,577
I heard Lee Joo-young is your brother.

282
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,246
Yes.

283
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,291
The surgery went very well.

284
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:28,130
We will move him to the ICU
and watch him for a couple of days.

285
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,092
-Thank you.
-Sure.

286
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,281
For your information,
the minister wasn't sutured up.

287
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:55,699
I'm not sure,

288
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:59,620
but I think one of his staff members
made a mistake and caused bleeding.

289
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,252
Dr. Yoon.

290
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,295
Nurse Um.

291
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,630
There's a patient who's--

292
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,382
-President Yeo.
-What?

293
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:17,054
What brings you here?
You're on leave until this week.

294
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:19,890
You're the president?

295
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,479
I saw the news
and got here a little early.

296
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,773
How do I look, Nurse Um?

297
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,110
Your temperature is normal,
and your blood pressure is a bit high,

298
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,403
-but it's within the normal range.
-I see.

299
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,697
Your name is Yoon A-reum, right?

300
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,535
You're meticulous when you examine.

301
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,666
Take this. I got some steamed buns.

302
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,668
You can all share.

303
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,294
All right.

304
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,338
Then I'll go upstairs.

305
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,761
Gosh, why didn't you tell me?

306
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,181
-Where's the patient for the CT scan?
-On bed six.

307
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,641
All right.

308
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,644
-What am I going to do, Dr. Jung?
-Don't worry.

309
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,980
He's not a guy who holds grudges.

310
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,025
I guess he wanted to see what you can do.

311
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,669
PRESIDENT YEO UN-YEONG

312
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,715
Have you all been well?

313
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,227
And?

314
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,314
They finished up the second surgery
without suturing him up.

315
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,940
Minister Ryu is in the ICU again.

316
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,737
Maybe there were some problems
during the initial surgery.

317
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,784
Professor Park Min-gook is the ace of aces
at Geosan Hospital,

318
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,413
but Dr. Bu Yong-ju is a washed-up doctor

319
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,790
who is living under a different name
at a branch hospital.

320
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:13,879
Anyone would think there was an error
with Doctor Kim's initial surgery, right?

321
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:18,425
It'd be rather complicated
to check the facts on that, Reporter Choi.

322
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,928
Well, it's all right.

323
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,347
It's enough to raise a concern.

324
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,391
That's what the media is for, isn't it?

325
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,853
To keep questioning things
and raising concerns.

326
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,566
Then let's do this for now.

327
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,111
Have you heard?

328
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,113
Well, this is looking bad.

329
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,379
This is Minister Ryu's son and his wife.

330
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,547
Hello.

331
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,716
I'm Park Min-gook, the surgeon
for his second surgery.

332
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,928
The flight was delayed
due to weather conditions in Jeju.

333
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,722
How's my father?

334
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:10,811
We found a few problems
during the second surgery,

335
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,521
but everything was dealt with quickly.

336
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,816
And currently,
Minister Ryu is in good condition.

337
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,736
I heard this surgery would fix everything.
What are the problems now?

338
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,156
His organs looked more swollen
than we expected.

339
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,992
As soon as the swelling disappears,

340
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:28,203
we will set up a date for another surgery
and wrap up his case.

341
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,833
Where's the doctor
that I talked to for the first surgery?

342
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:37,629
This way, please.

343
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,175
NURSING DEPARTMENT

344
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,262
I'm sorry.

345
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,514
-If I hadn't made that mistake--
-Be quiet.

346
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,393
Shut your mouth and stay still.

347
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,277
Darn it. This is driving me insane.

348
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,573
NO VISITORS ALLOWED

349
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,465
So? Did you find the leakage point?

350
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,175
Yes, it was in the gallbladder.

351
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:24,968
That's good then.

352
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,971
You controlled the bile duct
and the bleeding.

353
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,265
Any other problems?

354
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:33,810
Well, it's…

355
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:46,990
-Doctor Kim.
-Yes?

356
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:50,369
Minister Ryu's son and wife are here.
They would like to see you.

357
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,330
-Okay, one second.
-Sure.

358
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,468
No other problems.

359
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,722
Keep up the good work.

360
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,851
-Hello.
-He's the doctor.

361
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,228
Hello.

362
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,398
Would you like to come to my office?

363
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,732
-Sure.
-Let's go.

364
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,452
Who do you think you are?

365
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,955
You're just mooching off of people
here and there.

366
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,998
How dare you show off in front of me?

367
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,338
If you're siding with Doctor Kim
or whatever he is, keep it that way.

368
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,882
Don't try to take my spot in the OR.

369
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,510
You think Professor Park will care
even if you step up like that?

370
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,263
-I didn't do that to get his attention.
-Then did you get ahead of me

371
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,556
to make me look bad?

372
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,351
You were the one who touched the clip,
not me.

373
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,105
-What?
-And it's not my fault you got flustered

374
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:01,815
and couldn't control the bleeding.

375
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,025
You little jerk!

376
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,824
If you want to talk, just talk.

377
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,953
You might break your wrist next time,
Ho-jun.

378
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,371
You're unbelievable.

379
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,958
Don't you see or care
that I'm your senior or whatever?

380
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,172
Senior or whatever,

381
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,092
I see too many of them.

382
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,053
That's always the problem.

383
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,482
Darn it!

384
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,151
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

385
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,411
Dr. Cha?

386
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:58,622
Dr. Cha?

387
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,373
What about the CT scan?

388
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,584
The patient is in the CT room.

389
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:07,088
It'll take about 10 to 20 minutes
until we get…

390
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,261
Oh, I see. Okay.

391
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,692
Goodness.

392
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,529
Oh, Dr. Seo.

393
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,322
What's with Dr. Cha?

394
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,157
WE HOPE TO SEE YOU HEALTHY

395
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:35,742
Dr. Cha.

396
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:36,868
I'm not sure.

397
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,870
I guess she didn't get enough sleep.

398
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,288
She's been like that all day long.

399
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,666
-Goodness.
-Eun-jae!

400
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,173
Hey, it's the traitor.

401
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,469
What are you looking at?

402
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,806
I'm talking about you. Seo Woo-jin!

403
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,432
You.

404
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:06,439
Hey, man.

405
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,608
Stand still, okay?

406
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,278
Stop moving around, okay?

407
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,658
I got you. You traitor.

408
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,994
You jerk.

409
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,163
I'm going to kill you, okay?

410
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,624
I'm really going to…

411
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,752
I'm going to kill you, okay?

412
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:34,384
I'll kill you…

413
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,523
Excuse me, Dr. Cha?

414
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,038
Where are we…

415
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:11,546
She just fell asleep like that,
didn't she?

416
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,089
Right, Nurse Um?

417
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,717
Yes, I think so.

418
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:20,972
Wash your face and wake up.

419
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:22,682
I'm too tired.

420
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,309
You're a mess right now.

421
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,936
-Wash your face and wake up!
-Forget it!

422
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,480
It's annoying.

423
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:31,107
I don't need anything. Go away!

424
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,276
Why are you throwing a tantrum?

425
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,362
You're insane.

426
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,532
-Does this look like a tantrum to you?
-If you throw a fit and get angry

427
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:43,536
-when things don't go your way, it is.
-You took away my surgery!

428
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,791
That was my chance to return to Geosan.

429
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:52,170
But you betrayed me
and went into the OR, you traitor!

430
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,963
It's not like I wanted to do that!

431
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,299
No way, Woo-jin.

432
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,510
I know you.

433
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:03,014
You don't care about your friends
as long as you can make some money.

434
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,142
You disgusting opportunist.

435
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,940
Why did you call me to your OR then?

436
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,569
Why didn't you wrap up the tear
in the diaphragm?

437
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:20,365
Then I wouldn't have gotten kicked out
and sent here!

438
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,243
This is all because of you!

439
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:33,211
If you blame others for everything,
is it comforting for you?

440
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:34,713
What?

441
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:38,717
Okay then.

442
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:40,802
Keep living like that.

443
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,057
WOMEN'S BATHROOM

444
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,901
WOMEN'S BATHROOM

445
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,338
ALPRAZOLAM

446
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,068
I heard there was a problem
during the first surgery.

447
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,780
Problem?

448
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,407
What do you mean?

449
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,243
A reporter called me on my way here.

450
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,206
He said the second surgery failed
because of you, Dr. Bu.

451
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,625
What?

452
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,126
What do you mean?

453
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,879
I heard you didn't take a CT scan
before you started the surgery.

454
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,005
Is that correct?

455
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,050
That happens from time to time

456
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,552
for trauma patients
who are in critical condition.

457
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:09,641
You just admitted to your malpractice
very confidently, didn't you?

458
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:13,728
I wouldn't call that malpractice--

459
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,481
You didn't follow the procedure
before you performed the surgery.

460
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:17,982
How is that not malpractice?

461
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:21,611
It's because the situation
for the patient was--

462
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,154
Can you just be quiet?

463
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,907
I'm asking the surgeon right now.

464
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:27,867
One second.

465
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,246
So, what are you trying to say?

466
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,873
If you weren't confident,
you should've sent him to a big hospital.

467
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,625
Why did you lay your hands on my father?

468
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,629
He wouldn't have survived the transfer.

469
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,089
And he still can't.

470
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:45,343
Did you operate on him rashly,
disregarding the basics and procedures

471
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,136
to rise to fame by using his title?

472
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,683
You can't seem to answer me.

473
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,560
Do you admit it?

474
00:30:56,479 --> 00:31:00,316
If I had been more worried
about my reputation than the patient,

475
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,778
I would have pronounced his death
instead of operating on him.

476
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:08,199
In your father's condition,
that might have been much easier.

477
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:14,163
There's nothing more
I can discuss with you.

478
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:20,378
I'll sue all the doctors and the hospital
for medical malpractice.

479
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:22,922
What? You'll sue us?

480
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,355
What did you say? He'll sue us?

481
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,607
That's right.

482
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,610
He said he'll sue Doctor Kim
as well as the hospital.

483
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,779
You've got to be kidding me.

484
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,532
How can he sue a doctor
for not doing a CT scan?

485
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,618
Is that worthy of a lawsuit?

486
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,994
He won't get his way.

487
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,663
The patient is no longer
in critical condition.

488
00:31:56,414 --> 00:32:00,752
It's hard to prove malpractice
without firm evidence.

489
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:06,257
Apparently, they have
a video recording of the second surgery.

490
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,557
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

491
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,060
I was with the minister the whole time,

492
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,646
but I didn't notice anything
that would constitute malpractice.

493
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,273
The reporter said there's a recording

494
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:26,110
and that it'll show us
how lousy the first surgery was.

495
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:27,987
That's what he told me.

496
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,288
That's odd.

497
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,458
Dr. Seo didn't say anything
about a recording.

498
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:44,087
Maybe he's been
intentionally hiding it from us.

499
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:45,672
From us?

500
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,383
But why would he? What's there to hide?

501
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:53,763
What if he said something
that can help them prove their case?

502
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,640
What's there to say?

503
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,017
There was no issue with the first surgery.

504
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,727
It's not what you say, but how you say it.

505
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:03,189
Just a subtle change in nuance
can cause many misunderstandings.

506
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,817
-Don't you know that?
-Right, so why?

507
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,653
Why would Dr. Seo help them?

508
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:10,947
What if…

509
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:42,228
Do the three of you
have something to say to me?

510
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,572
That jerk.

511
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,202
About the recording from the OR…

512
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,788
Did you download the file?

513
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:04,125
Yes, I did it right after the surgery.

514
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,501
But the thing is…

515
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,606
Yes, Cha Eun-jae speaking.

516
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,608
Oh… I beg your pardon?

517
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:32,320
I see. I'll be right there. Okay.

518
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,868
Can we talk, Dr. Cha?

519
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:49,003
What did you say to Professor Park
in the OR during the surgery?

520
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,090
He asked me about the first surgery.

521
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,216
SOFT DRINK

522
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:54,634
And I answered his questions.

523
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:58,012
Did you answer any questions
that may hurt the hospital?

524
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,680
Why do you ask?

525
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,265
Well…

526
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:06,604
Minister Ryu's son wants
to sue Doctor Kim for malpractice.

527
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:11,651
It looks like the recording will be used
as their key piece of evidence.

528
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:19,283
Why didn't you tell us
that the surgery was recorded?

529
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:22,703
Because you didn't ask.

530
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:27,500
Don't talk like
you have nothing to do with this.

531
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:31,462
Doctor Kim and the hospital's reputations
are on the line.

532
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,298
Did you,

533
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,092
by any chance…

534
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:41,472
Did they try to coax you or something?

535
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,099
Mr. Jang.

536
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,520
What do you mean by that?

537
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,522
What I'm saying is…

538
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:53,568
On the condition
that you'll testify against Doctor Kim--

539
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,486
You mean, did I get money from them?

540
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,698
Don't take this the wrong way.

541
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:01,159
-That's not what Mr. Jang meant.
-So you got money from them?

542
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,327
-Gosh. Enough, please!
-Geez.

543
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,581
-You're making me so uncomfortable.
-Ms. Oh, wait.

544
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:14,088
No matter where I go…

545
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,092
people are all the same.

546
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:25,975
Wait.

547
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:29,645
Gosh, seriously!

548
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,273
-Dr. Seo!
-Wait.

549
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,357
Dr. Seo!

550
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:37,612
What's with that look?

551
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,822
It was a reasonable thing to ask.

552
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,366
On his first day here,

553
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,453
he talked about money with Doctor Kim.

554
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:49,373
-He said he needed money.
-But this is just wrong, Mr. Jang.

555
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:51,417
What? I can't even ask?

556
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,669
My goodness.

557
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:57,340
Dr. Seo! Dr. Seo Woo-jin!

558
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,479
Why didn't you ask me directly
if you were that curious?

559
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,398
"Did you take any kickbacks from them?"

560
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:17,985
What are you talking about?

561
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,446
You told me to tell them what I saw

562
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,573
as truthfully as possible.

563
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,161
Were you trying to test me?

564
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:31,582
Did you deliberately send me there
to test me and see

565
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,918
what I'd do around Professor Park?

566
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,336
Dr. Seo!

567
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,796
You told me to find an answer!

568
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,308
Darn it.

569
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,737
Ms. Oh. What was that about?

570
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:38,649
You'll keep it to yourself, right?
Dr. Cha.

571
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:41,444
I know you want to go back.

572
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:44,697
I'll persuade Professor Park,

573
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,449
so promise that you'll keep quiet.

574
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:48,284
Okay?

575
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,372
Hey, earlier…

576
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,838
Hey. I don't want to talk to you either.

577
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,895
Send the money,

578
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,022
or we'll really kill you this time.

579
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,368
What's going on?

580
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,954
Oh, Dr. Cha is here.

581
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,999
Didn't I tell you to call Dr. Bae?

582
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:40,127
Well, I did call him.

583
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,545
Please call CS.

584
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,714
CS will handle rib fractures from now on.

585
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,846
Oh, really?

586
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,473
I see.

587
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:53,808
Who's the patient?

588
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:54,892
Well…

589
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,603
It's the rib fracture patient
from earlier.

590
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,397
He says he keeps having chest pain.

591
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,483
-What about the CT scan?
-His lungs look fine.

592
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,193
I don't see any bleeding either.

593
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:07,363
Both the EKG and cardiac enzyme test
look fine too.

594
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:10,157
Nurse Um, did you look up
his prescription history?

595
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,700
He's only on BP medication.

596
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,911
Oh, I see a segmental fracture.

597
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,746
FRACTURE WITH 2 OR MORE FRACTURE LINES

598
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,165
Dr. Jung, his oxygen level is dropping!

599
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,128
Call Doctor Kim. Quick.

600
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,172
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

601
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:33,514
Sir, does your chest still hurt?

602
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,724
His oxygen level is at 78 and falling.

603
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,727
This won't do. We should intubate him.

604
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:39,979
Hold on a second.

605
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,861
What? What is it?

606
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,449
Flail chest?

607
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,325
Flail chest?

608
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,536
Do we have face masks or venturi masks?

609
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,955
-No, we don't.
-Then let's intubate him, Dr. Jung.

610
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,373
-Nurse Joo.
-Yes.

611
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,792
Put one ampoule of tramadol into his IV.

612
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,128
-And get me a 10 ml syringe and lidocaine.
-Sure.

613
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:10,134
We'll do an intercostal nerve block
to tame the pain first.

614
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,510
Pass me the tube.

615
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,685
Here it is, Dr. Cha.

616
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,902
-Pull it out.
-Okay.

617
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,212
-Is the ventilator ready?
-Yes, it's all set.

618
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,216
INSPIRATORY PRESSURE: 15

619
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:52,218
40

620
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,386
What are you doing? That much pressure?

621
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,971
He needs positive pressure ventilation.

622
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,807
The fractured ribs are moving against it,
so he needs a lot of pressure

623
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,851
-every time he inhales.
-Really?

624
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,573
The oxygen level is going back up.

625
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,283
Seriously?

626
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,286
Thank goodness.

627
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,859
How did you know he had flail chest?

628
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:54,113
I saw it once at the main hospital.

629
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,948
On a victim of a traffic accident.

630
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,285
For someone who saw it just once,
you took care of it pretty quickly.

631
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,247
I'm a quick learner.

632
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,086
I didn't mean to brag.

633
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,256
Why were you in the ER at that hour?

634
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,133
Do you hang out in the ER often?

635
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:16,635
Oh, how did you know?

636
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:20,014
I'm usually there when I'm on night duty.

637
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,391
Cardiac arrest victims
tend to come in at night.

638
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:25,227
To them, time is of the essence.

639
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:29,523
I'm really good at CPR as well.
I also have an ACLS certification.

640
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,483
Have you ever run out of the ER?

641
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,152
Well…

642
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:34,862
No, never.

643
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:40,951
When you see blood
or have to make simple scalpel incisions--

644
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,245
Right, I can do all of that in the ER.

645
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:46,498
As long as it's not in the OR,
I can handle everything.

646
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,838
All right. You may leave.

647
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:56,508
Okay. I'll be off then.

648
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:05,184
We might have to wait over a week
to take him off the ventilator.

649
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:08,729
-Pardon me?
-Monitor him carefully.

650
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,439
He's your first patient, you know.

651
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:17,821
But didn't you tell me
to quit being a doctor?

652
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:22,076
Hey.

653
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,080
Will you really quit if I tell you to?

654
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:28,165
No, I won't.

655
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:29,583
Goodness.

656
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:32,503
Get back to work.

657
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:35,422
Okay.

658
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:39,760
I'll call you when we move him
to the ward.

659
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,054
Okay, thank you.

660
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:58,612
Why didn't you compliment her?
She did a great job.

661
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:04,410
She knows that better than anybody else,
so why bother?

662
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:22,386
What was that about?

663
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,763
He said he didn't need a doctor like me.

664
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,557
RESTRICTED AREA: OPERATING ROOM

665
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:34,398
Shouldn't we come up with a plan too?

666
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:37,985
He's saying he'll sue us for malpractice.

667
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,779
We can't just sit back
and let him attack us like that.

668
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:48,370
Besides, if Dr. Seo is actually playing
both sides, what's going to happen?

669
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:52,624
You know that Doctor Kim was the one
who sent him to that OR.

670
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:57,629
It means he trusts Dr. Seo to some extent.
Am I wrong?

671
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,300
Do it if you want to. I'm not interested.

672
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,010
It's the traitor.

673
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,678
It's not like I wanted to scrub in.

674
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,972
You disgusting opportunist.

675
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:18,066
Dr. Cha?

676
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,156
TEXTBOOK OF SURGERY

677
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,246
You left it in the staff lounge,
so I brought it for you.

678
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:40,214
I'm sorry about what happened earlier.

679
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:44,301
It was wrong to accuse you like that
without any evidence whatsoever.

680
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,929
We obviously owe you an apology.

681
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,183
As one of the older staff members,
I apologize.

682
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,147
There's no need to apologize.

683
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,441
Mr. Jang could be right, you know.

684
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,653
After all, I'd do anything for money.

685
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:06,323
If you were actually like that,
you'd just be after money.

686
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,243
You wouldn't be looking for an answer.

687
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:18,961
Didn't you say earlier
that you're looking for an answer?

688
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:30,055
-Nurse Um.
-Yes?

689
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,267
Is something up with Dr. Yoon?

690
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:38,981
Well, it's because of President Yeo.

691
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,817
-President Yeo?
-She thought he was a regular patient

692
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,402
and even examined him.

693
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:46,697
-She examined President Yeo?
-Yes.

694
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,992
She took his temperature,
checked his pulse, auscultated him,

695
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:51,535
and did all sorts of things.

696
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:11,263
-What are you going to do?
-What? Oh…

697
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,141
I have to speak with President Yeo.

698
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:15,642
About what?

699
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,353
Well, the thing is,

700
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:21,648
I heard some strange sounds
from his lungs when I was examining him.

701
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,692
Then you can talk to me first.

702
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:25,569
Sorry?

703
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,824
You didn't have to return so soon.

704
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,492
You should've gotten more rest.

705
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:41,001
I saw the news,
and things seemed so hectic.

706
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:44,755
So I couldn't just take it easy and rest.

707
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,676
I heard Minister Ryu's son
is saying he'll sue us.

708
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:54,556
We're always dealing with
either inspections or lawsuits, you know.

709
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:59,811
There was no issue with the surgery,
so we'll just have to handle it well.

710
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,486
I heard Do Yun-wan is back.

711
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:11,740
I don't think it'll be easy this time.

712
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:18,914
People with low self-esteem
tend to have big egos, you know.

713
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:22,209
His ego has been bruised,

714
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,045
so I bet he's very determined.

715
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:28,715
How's the pain?

716
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:31,885
Any better?

717
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,889
How about a game of Go? It's been a while.

718
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:41,436
Gosh, sir.

719
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,525
-You want me to play dumb?
-That's right.

720
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:50,445
Please just act like you know nothing
in front of President Yeo and the staff.

721
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:51,989
I can't do that.

722
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,325
I clearly heard the sound from his lungs.
How could I…

723
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:58,495
Hold on.

724
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,914
Does he know about it?

725
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,667
Yes. He does.

726
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:06,545
Gosh.

727
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,089
Then what about the staff?

728
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,008
Only Doctor Kim and I know about it.

729
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,718
So even Ms. Oh has no idea?

730
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,136
That's right. Not yet.

731
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,056
-So please--
-I get it.

732
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:21,143
You want me to keep my lips sealed.

733
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,311
I'd really appreciate that.

734
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,440
Okay. I will.

735
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:27,941
I should.

736
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:29,735
I'll trust you then.

737
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:57,054
BEWARE OF OPENING DOOR

738
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,141
Let me check your eyes.

739
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,276
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

740
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,862
DOLDAM'S FOUR PROMISES

741
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:32,047
RECEPTION, INFORMATION, PRESCRIPTION

742
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,229
You plan to file a lawsuit?

743
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:48,563
That's right.

744
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:52,025
And that's why I need
the video recording of the second surgery.

745
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:53,610
Video recording?

746
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:55,737
I'm not quite following.

747
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,323
I heard the surgery was recorded.

748
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:02,494
I was told that it contains a statement
by a doctor who was in the first surgery.

749
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,331
Who told you that?

750
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:08,125
An anonymous reporter.

751
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:11,837
He said he deeply admires you.

752
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:21,471
About the recording from the OR…
Did you download the file?

753
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,223
But…

754
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:26,935
wouldn't this hurt us more if it got out?

755
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:28,353
That is why

756
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:30,981
we must make sure it doesn't leak.

757
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:34,484
-You deleted it from your phone, right?
-Yes, I did.

758
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,657
Do you have a black flash drive?

759
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,700
Well…

760
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:46,246
-Something like this?
-No, it's smaller.

761
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,998
-I need to find it.
-I checked the file.

762
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:49,666
Yes, I'll send it over.

763
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,168
All right.

764
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,721
May I borrow this for just five minutes?

765
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,515
GEOSAN UNIVERSITY

766
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:10,061
I think you've been misinformed.

767
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,480
We didn't record the surgery.

768
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:15,901
Are you trying to protect
your fellow doctor?

769
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:16,860
Gosh. No, sir.

770
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,070
Of course not.

771
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:23,617
I put everything aside and came
all the way here to save Minister Ryu.

772
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,160
Trust me.

773
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:28,371
There is no recording.

774
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,915
Doctor Yang.

775
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:31,416
This flash drive.

776
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,335
It's yours, right?

777
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:36,213
-I found it in the changing room.
-What?

778
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:44,387
Oh, you have yours.

779
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:48,099
This looked exactly like yours,
so I thought you dropped it.

780
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:49,100
No worries.

781
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:54,564
That must be the flash drive
with the recording of the second surgery.

782
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:00,987
Hey.

783
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:03,240
What are you talking about?

784
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,075
What recording?

785
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:06,243
It is, right?

786
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:11,623
You told me earlier that it's a recording
of the entire second surgery.

787
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:23,677
What?

788
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,971
He got his hands on the video recording?

789
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,682
Yes, apparently.

790
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:31,851
Then what will happen to us now?

791
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,228
Will he actually sue us?

792
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,355
Not a chance.

793
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:38,066
Quite the contrary, actually.

794
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:44,698
Really?

795
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:47,158
My gosh, that's great.

796
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:50,120
See? I told you everything would work out.

797
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,915
So? What's Mr. Jang going to do now?

798
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:00,297
This is from the bottom of my heart,
Dr. Seo.

799
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:02,424
Please accept this.

800
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:12,517
I'm sorry, Doctor Kim.

801
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:14,811
It was a misunderstanding on my part.

802
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,647
I should've looked into it more.

803
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:22,485
It's so hard for me to see
my father bedridden like that.

804
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:27,657
On top of that, I heard he's not showing
much improvement after the second surgery,

805
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:31,286
so I guess I lost my mind for a moment.

806
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:33,580
I sincerely apologize.

807
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:38,209
Minister Ryu is putting up a good fight.

808
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:41,713
I promise you,
I'll continue to do my best.

809
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:45,550
I'll speak to you soon.

810
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,682
-Doctor Kim.
-Yes.

811
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:57,937
Here's the recording of the surgery.

812
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,023
I thought you might need it.

813
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:04,778
Thank you.

814
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:15,497
Joo-young.

815
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:32,430
I have to say,
happy endings suit our hospital the best.

816
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:35,225
You think so?

817
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:38,103
And that's precisely why
we turned down all other opportunities

818
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:40,063
and chose to stay here.

819
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:46,403
I hope both Dr. Seo and Dr. Cha
will eventually feel the same way we do.

820
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,904
-Right?
-Totally.

821
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,366
Oh, that reminds me.

822
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,159
Is Dr. Cha all right?

823
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:55,829
Gosh, it's so crazy.

824
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,831
I must be going insane.

825
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,125
I mean, how…

826
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,001
Why the heck did I do such a thing?

827
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:05,130
Gosh, what is wrong with me?

828
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:14,222
Dr. Cha.

829
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,355
Yes, Dr. Yang.

830
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:29,904
You probably did that because
you don't know what kind of person I am.

831
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:32,365
I'm not really following.

832
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:12,155
Sorry.

833
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:17,911
I'm sorry about earlier.

834
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,163
That was a little…

835
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:22,999
I mean, it was so mean.

836
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:27,462
Especially calling you a traitor
and an opportunist.

837
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:31,508
I hope you can erase it from your head.
Can you?

838
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:39,224
Sure. I can do that.

839
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,312
All right then.

840
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:49,484
I'll see you tomorrow.

841
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:49,961
ALPRAZOLAM

842
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:56,551
Well done, Jessie.

843
00:59:57,343 --> 00:59:58,261
High five.

844
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,518
What about the CT scan?
You didn't check before coming in?

845
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:07,395
Professor Park asked you a question.

846
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,106
His condition was critical,
and his BP was low.

847
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:12,942
-Yes, come in.
-So you didn't even do a CT scan?

848
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:26,372
What is this?

849
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,498
Your ten million won.

850
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:28,458
Pardon me?

851
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:32,295
But it hasn't been a week yet.

852
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,131
So what? You're declining it?

853
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:38,593
All right. I'll wait until then.

854
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,429
How many months does this cover?

855
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:43,598
I'm lending you money out of my pocket.

856
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:46,142
Pay me back a million won every month.

857
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,645
Hold on.

858
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,522
A million a month to pay back ten million?

859
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:55,860
It means you'll be stuck here
for the next ten months.

860
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,487
Will you be okay with that?

861
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:02,825
What? Did you just scoff at me?

862
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:07,580
Well, it was just a little cringy.

863
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:12,335
Was I just acting too cool
for you to take?

864
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:13,836
You could also…

865
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:17,173
call it romantic.

866
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:32,313
You should get going.

867
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:34,524
Yes, sir.

868
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:46,828
He is…

869
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:48,329
weird.

870
01:01:58,673 --> 01:01:59,757
And this hospital…

871
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,676
is a weird place.

872
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:09,851
As one of the older staff members,
I apologize.

873
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:14,313
I'm sorry, Dr. Seo.

874
01:02:17,608 --> 01:02:18,693
And…

875
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:22,613
weird elders.

876
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:27,994
Gosh, Woo-jin.

877
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:30,621
There you are.

878
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:34,542
Hey, we've been looking everywhere
for you.

879
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:36,961
-How have you been?
-And…

880
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:40,131
my messed-up situation.

881
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:43,551
Will I manage…

882
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:46,471
to find the answer?

883
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,867
What are you talking about?
Notice of termination?

884
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:09,702
Will you join hands with me?

885
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,579
I heard some interesting rumors.

886
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:13,623
Is it true that you're coming to Doldam?

887
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:17,084
Will you be able to handle it?
Are you trying to scare me away?

888
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:18,628
A whole family attempted suicide?

889
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:21,005
Patients can choose their doctors,

890
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:23,341
but doctors can't choose their patients.

891
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,092
What is the matter with you, Dr. Seo?

892
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:28,054
I'm sorry, but I can't treat this patient.

893
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:29,555
What did you just say?

894
01:03:30,097 --> 01:03:31,474
The patient isn't responding!

895
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:33,768
Promise me that you'll help him.

896
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:37,063
You will help him, right?
