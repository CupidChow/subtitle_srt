1
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,482
Can you tell me?

2
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,276
Why did you

3
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:30,697
push my father's operation back?

4
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,745
I'm asking you. Why did you push
my father's operation back?

5
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:45,879
I just heard

6
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:49,132
that the hospital would
take care of it. That's all I know.

7
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,634
Why?

8
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,303
Was there anything else?

9
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:56,806
I heard the amount of the damage was

10
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,558
around 200 million won.

11
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,686
Right. It was about that.

12
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,813
It was 14 years ago

13
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,815
and it was an obscene amount
of money back then.

14
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,152
Did they let it slide
without charging you any of it?

15
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,821
We were investigated
by the police, though.

16
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,825
In the meantime,
we were informed of their decision.

17
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,454
They said they'd drop the charges
and wouldn't seek compensation.

18
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,997
All of a sudden?

19
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,124
Did they say that
with no apparent reason or trigger?

20
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,209
Well,

21
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,213
maybe that was because my husband
died in the hospital

22
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,964
or my son was too young.

23
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:33,343
Things just worked out like that.

24
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,221
That's all I know and nothing more.

25
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,972
I see.

26
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,642
Okay.

27
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,103
Thank you anyway.

28
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,981
Right.

29
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,901
-What is your son's name?
-Pardon?

30
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,778
He's Kang Dong-ju, right?

31
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,114
He used to work at Geosan Medical Center,

32
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,908
and he is now working as a surgeon
at Doldam Hospital.

33
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,873
Do you know what the easiest thing
in this world is?

34
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,001
It's breaking a relationship.

35
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,254
It doesn't require

36
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,464
any money nor effort.

37
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,092
You can do it with a single word.

38
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,473
"You are being

39
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,226
fooled right now."

40
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,104
Did you know

41
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,023
the patient whose operation
was pushed back

42
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,820
was my father?

43
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,034
Did you know that?

44
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,053
Yes, I remember that operation.

45
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,348
I was on duty that night.

46
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,560
Two patients with dissection
and cardiac infarction

47
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,855
came in five minutes apart.

48
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:10,982
Then...

49
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,236
was that you

50
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,741
who pushed my father's operation back
for a VIP patient?

51
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,620
Was it you,

52
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,248
not President Do?

53
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,252
Yes.

54
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,757
It was my decision.

55
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,889
The risk of death for a patient

56
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,768
with acute aortic dissection
rises by one percent every hour.

57
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,021
There was a patient
with cardiac infarction

58
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,441
whose probability of dying
within one hour was 99 percent

59
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:58,947
and a patient with dissection
whose probability rises gradually.

60
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,283
They both came to the hospital
five minutes apart.

61
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,910
If you were there,

62
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,580
which patient would you
operate on first, Dong-ju?

63
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,336
It was not because he was a VIP patient.

64
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,630
I made that decision

65
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,091
in the order of emergency.

66
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,051
That's the truth.

67
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,770
Did you call Dr. Yang at Jeongil Hospital?

68
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:32,689
Yes.

69
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,817
He said he'd be here in ten minutes.

70
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,277
Ask Dr. Nam

71
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,696
to take care of the patient with colitis.

72
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,615
Dr. Yang will treat the patient
with aortic dissection.

73
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,702
Yes, Teacher Kim. I will go tell them.

74
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,378
Do you think

75
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,755
you can operate
with the state you're in right now?

76
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,051
If you can't,

77
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,637
ask Dr. Do to perform it.

78
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,348
I will do it.

79
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,728
I will perform the operation.

80
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,230
Are you sure? Can you do that?

81
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,318
Don't worry about me.

82
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,864
You should focus on treating

83
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,742
the patient with dissection.

84
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,744
Dr. Kang.

85
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,256
Okay.

86
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,634
I will do so.

87
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,481
Ms. Oh.

88
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,608
Can you go with him?

89
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,444
Please do me a favor.

90
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,363
Okay.

91
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,840
Are you all right, Dong-ju?

92
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,390
Dad.

93
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,726
Dad!

94
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,019
Why?

95
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,022
Why?

96
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,235
-Cut.
-Cut.

97
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,113
I'm nothing
without my romantic view of life.

98
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,741
-Great job.
-What?

99
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,285
Why?

100
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,083
Dong-ju,

101
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,043
are you really okay?

102
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,214
Let me finish the operation first.

103
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,219
I'll see if I'm okay or not

104
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,056
after I'm done with the operation.

105
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,445
I will decide
if we should a use stomy or not

106
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,906
after excising the intestine

107
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,117
with necrosis. Scalpel.

108
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,066
What are you doing not treating
an injured person?

109
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,611
We have other urgent patients.

110
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:09,113
There's glass stuck in my husband's tummy.

111
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,699
What's more urgent than this?

112
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,577
Your husband is urgent, too.

113
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,706
But as emergency room staff,
we have no say in the order of operations.

114
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,334
Transfer him to another hospital
if you're not going to operate on him.

115
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,794
Within an hour radius from here,
there aren't other hospitals

116
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,171
that can perform surgeries.

117
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,466
We've been here for over an hour!

118
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,514
Dr. Kang, Dr. Jeong is calling.

119
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,015
What is it, In-su?

120
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:37,975
Dr. Kang.

121
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,311
How much longer do you think
your operation will take?

122
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:43,064
-Why?
-The patient with a penetrated abdomen.

123
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,942
His guardian is very upset.

124
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,444
She's saying we're neglecting him
when we said we'll operate on him.

125
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,030
Could you hurry up?

126
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,742
I told you to explain to her
that there's a more urgent situation.

127
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,911
I did, but she's still upset.

128
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:00,331
Even if I finish as quickly as I can,
it'll take another hour.

129
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,291
I suppose so. You just opened him up.

130
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,293
All right, then.

131
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,550
This is ridiculous.

132
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:13,636
Dr. Kang. Don't rush and take your time.

133
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,472
If Teacher Kim finishes early,
he will perform the operation.

134
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,057
No, I'll do it.

135
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:23,145
We'll have to dissect this much.

136
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,231
I have to hurry. Bovie.

137
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,782
Hey.

138
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,534
Pad.

139
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,620
Where is it coming from?

140
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,914
I think I touched
one of the mesenteric arteries.

141
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,207
Hemostatic forceps.

142
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,211
I'll hold it with the forceps.
Get ready to tie it.

143
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,592
Teacher Kim, Dr. Jeong from ER

144
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,219
is asking about the progress
of the aortic dissection operation.

145
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,807
The guardian of
the abdomen penetration injury patient

146
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,435
is making complaints asking
why we're not operating on him.

147
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,228
Pump on.

148
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:13,779
Tie.

149
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,118
Teacher Kim?

150
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,122
-Cut.
-Cut.

151
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,961
-Cut.
-Cut.

152
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,130
Okay.

153
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,174
What should I do next?

154
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,717
Wait for the body temperature to fall

155
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,969
and commence circulatory arrest.

156
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:41,390
We wait until the temperature falls
to 24 degrees.

157
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,600
Yes, Teacher Kim.

158
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,397
Teacher Kim's operation
doesn't look like finishing soon.

159
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,776
He hates it when he gets interrupted
in the middle of an operation.

160
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:52,860
Does he?

161
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,696
Are you not listening?

162
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,784
How long are you going
to keep him like that? I'm going crazy.

163
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,911
-I'm about to go crazy.
-A doctor just went to ask.

164
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,746
Gosh.

165
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,044
What's taking you so long?

166
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,797
I found it.

167
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:15,633
Tie.

168
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,186
-Cut.
-Cut.

169
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,563
Releasing the forceps.

170
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,318
There's no bleeding.

171
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,403
How are his vital sings?

172
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,154
His heart rate got faster,

173
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,531
but it's fine. We should continue.

174
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,283
Resuming to functional end to end. GIA.

175
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,411
FUNCTION END TO END:
TYPE OF GASTROINTESTINAL ANASTOMOSIS

176
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,664
Commencing arrest.

177
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,791
We won't be applying
selective perfusion today.

178
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,918
We have to finish in 30 minutes.

179
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:52,795
Pump on.

180
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,716
Give me GIA again.

181
00:11:58,884 --> 00:11:59,927
Cut.

182
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,350
Suction.

183
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,352
Metzembaum.

184
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,527
Specimen.

185
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,117
Specimen.

186
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,328
-Babcock forceps.
-One more, please.

187
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,167
Graft.

188
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,852
Cut.

189
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,354
-Cut.
-Cut.

190
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:53,898
Cut.

191
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,691
Get the Hemovac ready, please.

192
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,109
Irrigation.

193
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,113
-Cut.
-Cut.

194
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,617
All right. Clamps.

195
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,079
Pump slowly.

196
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,040
I'll insert Hemovac and finish up.

197
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,502
Full flow.

198
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:16,962
Raise the body temperature please.

199
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,384
-It took 28 minutes, Doctor.
-Okay.

200
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,764
You failed to disappoint me
yet again, Dr. Kang.

201
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,307
I'll finish up in 10 minutes

202
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,435
and proceed with the abdomen
penetrating injury patient.

203
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,812
Please tell them to prepare
the next patient.

204
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,022
Okay.

205
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,193
-Cut.
-Cut.

206
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,113
Dr. Yun.

207
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,700
The proximal is ready to be tied up.
Come here and do it.

208
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,328
You want me to do it?

209
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,747
We have a lot of time
until the body temperature rises.

210
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,582
Take your time and do it with precision.

211
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,627
I'll assist you. Come over here.

212
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,482
Prolene number four.

213
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,293
-Cut.
-Cut.

214
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,898
-Cut.
-Cut.

215
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,443
Okay.

216
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:06,447
Now, release the air
and release the clamps.

217
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,492
Clamps off.

218
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,882
Good job.

219
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,106
-The operation went well.
-I see.

220
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,901
Blocked blood vessels resulted
in intestine necrosis.

221
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,986
We had to cut 30cm of it out.

222
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,072
That much?

223
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:52,034
We should wait and see how things go
while putting him under medication.

224
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,827
-Thank you.
-Well then.

225
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,246
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

226
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,501
The operation went well, right?

227
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,086
Yes.

228
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,923
When I was signing the surgery consent,

229
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,884
they said it could take up
to two hours or more,

230
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,346
but you finished in less than
an hour and a half.

231
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,347
I was wondering--

232
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,599
The duration of the operation
doesn't matter that much.

233
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,643
We tried our best

234
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,771
and the operation was a success.

235
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,482
-Thank you.
-Excuse me.

236
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,072
He'll be all right.

237
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,706
You get

238
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:44,086
more patients than I thought.

239
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,173
You didn't know?

240
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,927
This hospital

241
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,680
is pretty famous

242
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,307
around here.

243
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,893
The doctors are skilled.

244
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,730
And sometimes

245
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,900
they let you put it on your tab.

246
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,071
You must have

247
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,158
had heart surgery.

248
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:15,409
What?

249
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,496
How did you know that?

250
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:24,168
I have a bad heart, too.

251
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,754
I can tell.

252
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,681
RESTRICTED AREA

253
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,562
CT scan shows
his bowel injury isn't severe.

254
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,356
-We'll suture him up and finish.
-Okay.

255
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,817
Let us begin. Scalpel.

256
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,466
It's all cold now.

257
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,603
MOM

258
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:29,858
Hello?

259
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:31,944
Hello?

260
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,404
Isn't this Kang Dong-ju's phone?

261
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,532
Yes, it's Dong-ju's phone.

262
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,575
Hello, it's me. Seo-jeong.

263
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,743
I see.

264
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,329
It's you, Seo-jeong.

265
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,416
Dong-ju is in an operation.

266
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,085
Is this urgent?

267
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,379
No, it's not like that. I just...

268
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,093
Is Dong-ju doing okay?

269
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,972
Of course. He's fine.

270
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,765
That's all, then.

271
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:05,477
-It's been a while, so I called.
-I see.

272
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:06,895
Right.

273
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,648
What happened to the side dishes

274
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,191
I brought the last time?

275
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,818
The side dishes and kimchi, right?

276
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,820
We finished them a while ago.

277
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,534
Actually, I ate most of them
because they were so good.

278
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,952
I'm sorry, Mother.

279
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,748
I mean, ma'am.

280
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,711
No, Mother?

281
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,299
I'm sorry.

282
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:38,010
I'm not sure how I should address you.

283
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,679
You should call me Mother.

284
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,431
"Ma'am" sounds

285
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,392
-a bit too cold.
-Right?

286
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,187
It's a bit cold, Mother. Right?

287
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:53,692
Should I send some more side dishes?

288
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:54,818
Really?

289
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,613
The burdock dish was delicious.

290
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,823
Really? What else?

291
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:04,786
I liked stir-fried anchovies
and stir-fried fish cakes.

292
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,915
Do you like beans cooked in soy sauce?

293
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,334
Really? I love them.

294
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:15,047
Oh, corns are very famous here
in Gangwon Province.

295
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,298
Should I send some over?

296
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,468
I feel bad
that I'm only taking food from you.

297
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,802
DONG-JU DUMPLINGS

298
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,305
Really? Okay.

299
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:32,481
DONG-JU DUMPLINGS

300
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,274
Okay, that sounds good.

301
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,000
Is that why you helped me that day?

302
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,295
When I turned the ER upside down.

303
00:20:57,297 --> 00:21:01,093
Did you know I was the patient's son
who died because of your priorities?

304
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,512
Is that why you were kind enough

305
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,640
to treat me, too?

306
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,106
What do you want to hear from me?

307
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,983
Have you ever

308
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,611
regretted the decision

309
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,864
you made at that time?

310
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,619
In the end, someone died
because of your decision.

311
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:29,997
Have you ever

312
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,668
regretted the decision?

313
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,671
There's a patient dying
right in front of you.

314
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,299
Then there is a patient
you are not sure about.

315
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,967
Which one am I to choose?

316
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,805
Even when I think about it now,
when much time has passed,

317
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:52,185
I believe the choice I made was
an inevitable one.

318
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,023
I see.

319
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,739
But why do I feel so awful?

320
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,410
I understand

321
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,914
what you are saying with my head.

322
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,710
But why do I feel like I've been fooled?

323
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,256
The doctor side of me

324
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,178
can understand why
you had to make that choice.

325
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,809
But as a son,

326
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,065
I can't help but feel more upset.

327
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,822
That's not for you to ask me.

328
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:50,368
I think you should be asking
that question to yourself.

329
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:52,996
You are no longer

330
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,666
a helpless kid who lost his father.

331
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:00,629
You're a doctor.

332
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:46,216
Why did you say that to Dong-ju?

333
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,927
-What?
-You did not know

334
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:51,680
that the dissection patient

335
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,682
had come in before.

336
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,977
You went into the VIP's surgery
without knowing that.

337
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,478
Even if I knew,

338
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,440
my choice would have been the same.

339
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:09,114
Telling him that I didn't know

340
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,075
won't comfort him a bit.

341
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,162
It would only sound like an excuse.

342
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,081
What if

343
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,792
he turns his back on you for good?

344
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,045
He finally became a doctor worth keeping.

345
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,384
Sometimes it's better to face
what you have to face

346
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:34,973
instead of finding out the truth
which sounds more like an excuse.

347
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,477
GEOSAN MEDICAL CENTER

349
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,945
Okay, release them.

350
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,197
Yes, sir.

President Do is really something.

354
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,799
He betrayed them just like this.

355
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,596
President Yeo.

356
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,350
Look at this article.
President Do is playing dirty.

357
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,644
Does this make any sense?

It's been a while, Ms. Noh.

362

Do you remember me?

363
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:38,995
Who are you?

364
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:43,375
I'm reporter Oh Seong-jae,
who covered the case

365
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,584
of Jang Hyeon-ju 14 years ago.

366
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:48,380
You were reading that article.

367
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,131
That surgery was

368
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,926
actually done by Dr. Bu Yong-ju.

369
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,845
But it's odd, isn't it?

370
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,890
Dr. Bu Yong-ju did the surgery,

371
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:01,434
but his name is nowhere
to be found in that article.

372
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,436
14 years ago,

373
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,690
he covered up everything
as Dr. Bu's fault,

374
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:10,235
and now his name is nowhere to be found.

375
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,154
What do you think?

376
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:18,535
I have nothing to say.

377
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,495
I won't write any articles.

378
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:22,747
I have no voice recorders.

379
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,667
I won't write it in my note, either.

380
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:27,961
Can you

381
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,257
tell me what exactly happened on that day?

382
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,635
Tell me the truth.

383
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,640
Why is that so important?

384
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,935
The important thing is to stop the rumors.

385
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:47,188
Think about those ill-rumors
about Chairman Shin.

386
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:49,524
I can't overlook those.

387
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,777
I also can't bring out Doldam Hospital

388
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,446
for the sake of media exposure.

389
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:58,199
But still, how can you steal
Teacher Kim's work like this?

390
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,162
Don't be disappointed, President Yeo.

391
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,206
We have included the names
of other surgery staff members

392
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,542
in that article.

393
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,836
I am thinking about rewarding

394
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,964
those staff members
in a separate occasion.

395
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,342
If we can,

396
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,761
I am considering

397
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,096
bringing them to Geosan Medical Center.

398
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,474
Goodbye, then.

399
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,309
I'm a bit busy.

400
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:26,978
What does he mean?

401
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,438
How can he take them all?

402
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,565
What about Doldam Hospital?

403
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,735
Basically, we are doomed.

404
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,278
That's what I'm saying.

405
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,072
It's like Teacher Kim beats the bush

406
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,491
and Geosan Medical Center
catches the birds.

407
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,785
They are stealing
the young competent doctors

408
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,536
whom Teacher Kim has taught.

409
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:47,082
Something must be done here.
Don't you think so?

410
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,124
Like what?

411
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,710
We should tell Teacher Kim
all about it first.

412
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,045
He already knows.

413
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,130
Does he?

414
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:55,632
What did he say?

415
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:58,093
Just forget about it.

416
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,178
How can I forget about it?

417
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,304
It's like

418
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,807
one man sows and another man reaps.

419
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,393
Why should that worry you?

420
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:10,355
Our hospital is already full of patients.

421
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,023
We don't have

422
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:15,151
enough beds in the ICU anyway.

423
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,653
Teacher Kim!

424
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:21,950
Do you know

425
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:24,619
what the best thing
I've done in my life is?

426
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:29,124
The fact that I gave up
my real name, Bu Yong-ju.

427
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,710
It took a load off my shoulders.

428
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,130
I was set free after emptying my mind

429
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,923
and dream of success.

430
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:41,553
I'm much happier with the way
I'm living my life now.

431
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,014
Teacher Kim, still!

432
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,517
All of us?

433
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,145
Yes. President Do invited

434
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,604
all of you.

435
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:56,151
He'd like to praise all of you
for your hard work.

436
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,903
So I hope every single one
of you will come. Okay?

437
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,824
Is Teacher Kim coming, too?

438
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,160
Do you think Teacher Kim would
accept President Do's invitation?

439
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,369
Of course not.

440
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,163
Then I won't attend.

441
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,540
There's no reason to go there.

442
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,796
I didn't even participate
in the operation. I'm sorry.

443
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:25,346
The three of you are
the key figures anyway.

444
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,098
You are coming, right?

445
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,017
Dr. Song, what about me?

446
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,686
Right. I want you to be on duty
in the emergency room

447
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,938
while they are out of the hospital. Okay?

448
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,065
Okay.

449
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,154
I'm afraid I can't be there.

450
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,072
I have patients to take care of.

451
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,241
Dong-ju.

452
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,076
We can't do this without you.

453
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,204
I should go treat Chairman Shin.

454
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,372
I can't leave the hospital.

455
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,334
Dr. Yun.

456
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,377
You can't do this.

457
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,756
What? Dr. Do, are you leaving, too?

458
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,591
I can't go there alone.

459
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:04,552
I don't think that is
what my dad really wants.

460
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:10,850
Gosh.

461
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,644
This is not the way it's supposed to be.

462
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,646
-Hey!
-Dr. Song.

463
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,526
He's treating me like I'm not around.

464
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:20,902
Am I invisible or what?

465
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,279
When do I get to go home?

466
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,281
Why aren't you answering me?

467
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:28,827
Until when are you going to neglect
my husband just like that?

468
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,121
Ma'am, we are not neglecting your husband.

469
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,373
He's supposed to be

470
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,458
in the Intensive Care Unit
after the operation.

471
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,418
Why do you let him stay in there instead?

472
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,922
Like I said, we don't have
a bed available in the ICU yet.

473
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,131
That's enough.

474
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,592
Where's my husband's doctor?

475
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,719
I need to talk to the doctor.

476
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,687
Did you make up with Teacher Kim yet?

477
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,359
You don't want to talk about that, right?

478
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,864
I get it.

479
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,618
By the way, your mother just called.

480
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,078
She asked if you were doing okay.

481
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,873
Did you talk to my mother on the phone?

482
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:15,957
Yes.

483
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,251
I heard your phone ringing.

484
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,129
I was going to tell her
you were in the operating room.

485
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,464
Was there anything else apart from that?

486
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,925
She talked about some side dishes

487
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,927
and corns?

488
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:32,015
Can you have a conversation
about those things?

489
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,141
Of course.

490
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:34,517
Why?

491
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,938
Dr. Kang. We have a problem.
A patient is having a fit.

492
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:45,820
What happened?

493
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,907
He started writhing all of a sudden.
It seems he's having a fit.

494
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,997
Administer 4mg of lorazepam
through IV line.

495
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,165
Okay.

496
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,052
Administered.

497
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,596
-He suffers from alcoholism, right?
-Yes.

498
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,181
I think it is delirium tremens.

499
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,933
DELIRIUM TREMENS:
DELIRIUM DUE TO WITHDRAWAL

500
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,226
Dr. Kang, his heart rate is 180.

501
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,770
Administer another ampule of lorazepam.

502
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:19,854
Okay.

503
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:27,028
His heart rate is not dropping.

504
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,529
Administer another ampule of lorazepam

505
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,157
-and inject 200mg of phenobarbital.
-Okay.

506
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,076
Inject 100mg of scyamine, too.

507
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,160
Okay.

508
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,622
Sir. Sir!

509
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,415
No...

510
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,421
-Ma'am, may I speak--
-What's wrong with my husband?

511
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,716
Did something happen
to where you operated on yesterday?

512
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,511
No, ma'am.
There's nothing wrong with that.

513
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:52,637
But

514
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,432
he's showing
serious alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

515
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:59,769
It's called delirium tremens.

516
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,312
Delirium tremens?

517
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,732
We are trying to control it
with medication.

518
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,985
But it's not working well.

519
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,279
If the condition continues,

520
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:14,242
-he may have a cardiac arrest.
-Goodness.

521
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,037
Please save my husband.

522
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:21,958
He's not a good husband,
but I can't live without him.

523
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,669
-Ma'am--
-There you are.

524
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:28,673
Look, until when are you going
to neglect my husband in the ER?

525
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,049
-Pardon?
-I mean,

526
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,510
I'm already upset with the fact
that his operation was pushed back.

527
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,470
and now he can't be treated in the ICU?

528
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,555
Ma'am,

529
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,558
didn't the head nurse explain about that?

530
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,602
We don't have any bed
available in the ICU now.

531
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,771
We have patients who had
an operation before your husband.

532
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,356
And they both are in a critical condition.

533
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,151
Then you shouldn't have accepted
a patient in the first place.

534
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,614
We had no choice as two emergency patients
came in at the same time.

535
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,533
We asked for your understanding already.

536
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,827
And your husband is making
good progress after the operation.

537
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,163
So we were going to move him
to a patient's room anyway.

538
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,456
Forget it.

539
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,459
Send my husband
to the Intensive Care Unit now.

540
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,544
-Right now.
-Excuse me.

541
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,589
-This is just too much.
-What did you say?

542
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,174
My husband didn't even get

543
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,302
a proper operation
because of your husband.

544
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:18,056
And now you want to take
his bed in the ICU?

545
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,725
What do you mean by that?

546
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,770
I heard what the doctors said yesterday.

547
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,730
I heard that

548
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:29,567
you'd give my husband's operation
a lick and a promise because of him.

549
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:33,071
Gosh, what are you talking about?

550
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:37,533
My husband's operation was pushed back
because of your husband.

551
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,702
You are the one who cut in line.

552
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:42,288
-What did you way?
-Don't be ridiculous.

553
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,664
-Excuse me.
-What's that?

554
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,708
Calm down.

555
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,711
Ma'am, there seems to be
some misunderstanding.

556
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,422
I never give an operation
a lick and a promise.

557
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,925
I told you that we did our best.

558
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,134
Ma'am.

559
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:58,096
It's a doctor who determines
the order of emergency.

560
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,722
That's it. That's enough.

561
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,226
Just send my husband
to the Intensive Care Unit right now.

562
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,103
Otherwise, I will sue this hospital.

563
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,188
Move him immediately.

564
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,023
Dr. Kang. He's having a cardiac arrest.

565
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,320
My goodness.

566
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,906
It's VPB. Hurry and bring a defibrillator.

567
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:17,990
Okay.

568
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,333
Oh, my goodness.

569
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,177
Let me.

570
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,180
Charge 200J.

571
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,144
Step away. Clear.

572
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,190
Gosh.

573
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,734
Give him 1mg of epinephrine
every 3 minutes.

574
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:54,861
Yes, Doctor.

575
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:57,780
I'll check his heart rhythm.

576
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,535
-Ventricular fibrillation.
-Charge 200J.

577
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,413
Clear.

578
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:10,251
What's going on with him?

579
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,839
-I will switch with him.
-Okay.

580
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,766
Honey.

581
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,113
It's been almost an hour.

582
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,116
We've been giving him epinephrine, right?

583
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:44,994
Dr. Kang.

584
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:28,037
Honey.

585
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,423
Patient Lee Dong-su

586
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,511
has passed away.

587
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,472
No.

588
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,184
No.

589
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,862
Why did you say he needs operation

590
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:06,409
if you weren't even going to save him?

591
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,788
If you performed the operation well,

592
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,167
my husband wouldn't have died.

593
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,878
Bring him back.

594
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,841
Bring my husband back now.

595
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,176
Now.

596
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,512
Doctor.

597
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,807
It wasn't because of the operation.
It was because of alcohol.

598
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:34,437
He died of delirium tremens.

599
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,355
He walked in here just yesterday.

600
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,649
This can't just happen overnight.

601
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,526
Please.

602
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:42,486
Bring him back.

603
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:46,115
Bring my husband back.

604
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,868
Please.

605
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:51,871
Please bring him back, Doctor.

606
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,998
Please calm down.

607
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,834
We will give you time
to say goodbye to him.

608
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,338
You should say your last farewell.

609
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,133
Honey.

610
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,317
I guess, now,

611
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:26,072
your husband can be moved to the ICU.

612
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,925
What was with your attitude back there?

613
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,719
Why would you get angry
with the guardians?

614
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,805
She kept doubting
the operation I performed.

615
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,184
I tried my absolute best.

616
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,812
I tried my absolute best
to find the bowel infarction

617
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:00,022
and I tried my absolute best
to remove that piece of glass.

618
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,318
It's not my fault that the ICU is full.

619
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,362
It's not my fault that he drank a lot.

620
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,864
Why would she put the blame
on my operation? Why?

621
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,451
I know.

622
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,704
You want to yell at me like I did.

623
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,957
You want to say

624
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:21,585
you had no other option to make
that decision about my dad.

625
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:25,423
That you tried your absolute best
as a doctor.

626
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,137
And that I shouldn't blame you.

627
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,142
That's probably what you're
thinking right now.

628
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,479
I know that very well.

629
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,984
I know very well and the anger
is driving me insane.

630
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,948
I want to blame you so much,

631
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,787
but I can't anymore.

632
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:03,752
Because I'm a doctor.

633
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,720
Do you know

634
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:17,349
what surgeons hear the most often?

635
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:22,188
They ask us why we operated on them
if we weren't even going to save them.

636
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:27,651
Do you know what the second most one is?

637
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,029
That the patient was fine
before the operation,

638
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,656
but the operation worsened the condition.

639
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,619
What we do here

640
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,580
is to save lives.

641
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:41,790
But inevitably,

642
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,710
we have to take criticism and blame

643
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,463
at the same time.

644
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:48,923
After all,

645
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,842
we're cutting people with knives.

646
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,347
As soon as you get yourself together,

647
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,682
go back there and apologize to them.

648
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,895
Doing that concludes the treatment.

649
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:04,730
Do you understand?

650
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:09,735
I'm sorry.

651
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,198
I can't

652
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,701
accept that right now.

653
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,394
Dr. Kang.

654
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:50,025
May I have a word with you?

655
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:55,990
Dr. Bu Yong-ju didn't do anything wrong.

656
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,075
If he didn't do anything wrong,

657
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,704
why did he get kicked out of the hospital
in such fashion?

658
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,166
It was probably
because he felt responsible.

659
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:10,963
What do you mean,
you'll fight against the hospital?

660
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:14,216
If I back down like this
without saying anything,

661
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,761
you will never realize it.

662
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,389
What you did wrong

663
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,392
and why you should never
do something like that again.

664
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:24,560
So

665
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:26,520
if we fight,

666
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:28,439
do you think you'll win?

667
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:29,732
Do you think

668
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,484
I can't?

669
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,653
You'll get hurt.

670
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,073
I'm not scared.

671
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,241
Not you.

672
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,244
The seven staff members
who operated for you.

673
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,748
GEOSAN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

674
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:48,083
No matter how much noise you make,

675
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,793
you won't be able to touch me.

676
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,504
The person who will get hurt
and kicked out

677
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,381
will be those seven staff members.

678
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,970
Which hospital do you think will hire

679
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,348
medical staff with such scarlet letter?

680
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:05,601
Are you sure

681
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:09,938
you can be responsible
for all of their lives?

682
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:15,611
Among them, three are heads of their
households with family to feed.

683
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:20,032
So keep your mouth shut and leave.

684
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,701
If you just disappear,

685
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,288
those seven people can live in peace.

686
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:28,540
What do you say?

687
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,087
So because of

688
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,714
those seven people,

689
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:39,551
Dr. Bu Yong-ju took all the blame

690
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,512
and left the hospital?

691
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,305
Yes.

692
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,266
As far as I know.

693
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,563
Why are you telling me

694
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:54,066
something like that?

695
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,110
What does Teacher Kim's past

696
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:58,612
have to do with me?

697
00:44:58,695 --> 00:45:01,115
Other than those seven people,

698
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:04,535
Yong-ju covered for

699
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,412
one another person.

700
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:10,666
On the day of Jang Hyeon-ju's funeral,

701
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:14,294
some middle-schooler barged into the ER

702
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,297
and created a scene.

703
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,135
The hospital charged that kid's mother

704
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,011
with all kinds of claims
including property damage.

705
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:26,765
The kid's mother was charged
with 200 million won.

706
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,517
They even tried to

707
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:31,103
push criminal charges against that kid.

708
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,397
Because he was over 14 years of age,

709
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,816
it was definitely possible.

710
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:40,529
What are you

711
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:43,991
talking about right now?

712
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:46,535
Have you never found it curious?

713
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:49,204
How could nothing have happened

714
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,290
after causing such a scene?

715
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,007
Back then,

716
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,718
we weren't courageous.

717
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:04,887
No.

718
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,806
Cowardly fits better.

719
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,517
We were relieved

720
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,812
that Dr. Bu Yong-ju took all the blame

721
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:17,357
and left the hospital.

722
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:21,862
Let me ask you one more thing.

723
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,990
If Bu Yong-ju wasn't the person

724
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:29,411
who made someone else to operate,
then who was it?

725
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:39,755
The person who was
vice president at that time.

726
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:41,840
Him.

727
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,680
If you find out the truth,

728
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,893
do you have the courage
to tell it to the world?

729
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,437
Why don't you take the opportunity

730
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,524
to realize justice?

731
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:23,340
THE LIST OF PEOPLE WHO PERFORMED
GHOST SURGERY

732
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,180
OPERATION RECORD
NAME: JANG HYEON-JU

733
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:46,029
What is this?

734
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:49,074
They're the patients who were operated
by ghost surgeons.

735
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:53,120
Some of them know
that their surgeries were performed

736
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,997
by a ghost surgery.

737
00:47:56,498 --> 00:48:00,669
You can also see the amount of hush money
Geosan Medical Center gave them

738
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:02,254
right before the lawsuit.

739
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,799
Why did you give this to me?

740
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:08,468
The statute of limitations
on this case has expired,

741
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,262
so there's nothing you can do.

742
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,347
Still, it can be

743
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:15,142
a useful weapon against President Do.

744
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:19,938
Congratulations on your return.

745
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:21,690
Bye, then.

746
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:28,614
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

747
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,917
Even though I couldn't tell
the truth to the world,

748
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:44,880
I wanted to give this to the person
who should know the truth.

749
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:20,666
Honey, you'll be all right.
Don't worry, okay?

750
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,793
I'll be waiting here.

751
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,463
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

752
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:39,810
I am sorry.

753
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:43,146
I apologize

754
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:45,190
for what I said before.

755
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:51,780
However,

756
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,450
I hope you know this one thing.

757
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,037
Every patient in Doldam Hospital

758
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,790
is treated equally.

759
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,961
The doctors here are more sincere
than anyone else

760
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,047
about saving our patients.

761
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,341
I never said that you weren't sincere.

762
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:14,720
I don't know why you're talking
about something I didn't say.

763
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,722
Gosh.

764
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:27,566
You did well.

765
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,874
Hi, Dr. Yun. Can I see you for a second?

766
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,211
I don't think this is the right way
to handle the situation.

767
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:51,298
President Do arranged
the celebratory event for you guys.

768
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,925
I don't know about the others,

769
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:56,470
but you shouldn't do that to President Do.

770
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:59,765
Even so, Teacher Kim is not going
to attend the event.

771
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:01,099
We can't go there by ourselves.

772
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:02,309
Goodness.

773
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:05,187
He wouldn't attend it
even if he was invited.

774
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,105
-Invited to what?
-Oh, gosh.

775
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,735
What would I not attend
even if I was invited?

776
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,278
President Do invited

777
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:16,156
all the staff members of
Chairman Shin's surgery

778
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:18,533
to Seoul today.

779
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,870
-Why did he do that?
-Why do you think?

780
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:24,372
It's out of his appreciation
for the hard work they've done.

781
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:27,292
Wasn't the media manipulation
enough for him?

782
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,462
Why would he make them go to Seoul?
They're busy!

783
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:32,839
Please don't be like that.

784
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,008
They can't say they will go
even though they want to

785
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:37,594
because they don't want to upset you.

786
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,221
Seo-jeong.

787
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,765
-Are you not going because of me?
-No.

788
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,099
It's not like that.

789
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:46,311
See? She is obviously trying
not to upset you.

790
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:47,854
That's not true, Dr. Song.

791
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:52,901
Don't be like that and tell everyone
that you don't mind.

792
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:54,694
Let them go if they want.

793
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:59,032
In fact, Ms. Oh and Mr. Park
are invited as well.

794
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:02,828
But since they're on your side,
they wouldn't accept the invitation.

795
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:04,371
Then, why have I not been invited?

796
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:05,497
What?

797
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:08,667
You said it's a celebration
for Chairman Shin's surgery.

798
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:12,045
I was the lead surgeon of that surgery.

799
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:13,880
Why did he leave me out?

800
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:18,134
Stop it. You wouldn't attend it
even if you were invited.

801
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,262
Invite me to see if I go or not.

802
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:21,346
Pardon?

803
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:24,015
I said, try inviting me.

804
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,478
Would you like to come?

805
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:30,480
-Sure.
-Sorry?

806
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,733
Dr. Yun, you're going with me.

807
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:37,696
It would be good to go to Seoul
for a change.

808
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:38,822
You don't mind, do you?

809
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:40,824
No, I don't.

810
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:42,576
Hold on a second.

811
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:45,829
I wonder if Ms. Oh has free time.

812
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,038
Move aside.

813
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:50,750
What has gotten into him?

814
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:52,627
-Pardon?
-Pardon?

815
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:54,796
Why are you so surprised?

816
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:58,258
Geosan Medical Center invited us
to congratulate us.

817
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:02,053
We should all go to Seoul
and receive congratulations.

818
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,723
Ms. Oh, please go with me.

819
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:05,807
-Dr. Nam.
-Yes?

820
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:06,808
You, too.

821
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:09,519
Manager Jang, would you like to join us?

822
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:11,730
-Can I come, too?
-Dr. Do.

823
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:13,648
You're going, too.

824
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:17,444
What about the emergency room?

825
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:20,739
We have Dr. Jeong and Dr. Woo.

826
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:22,490
The GS on call

827
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,327
will be Dr. Song.

828
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:28,705
Me? I have to go to Seoul with you.
What are you talking about?

829
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:30,665
Did you perform Chairman Shin's surgery?

830
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:32,167
No, I didn't, but--

831
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,294
So you should stay at the hospital.

832
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,171
Only then, we can go.

833
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,093
Dr. Kang.

834
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,472
You will go with us, right?

835
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:52,979
Yes, I will.

836
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:54,689
I'm going with you.

837
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,192
If you go,

838
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:59,152
I will go, too.

839
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:03,448
This is good. We could use
a trip to Seoul for a change.

840
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,868
-Let's go, Ms. Oh.
-Okay.

841
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,099
What should I do?

842
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:31,851
What should I do?
What am I supposed to do?

843
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:37,857
Should I tell him or not? Wait.

844
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:41,403
I can't tell him.

845
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,823
He would tell me to stop Teacher Kim.

846
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:48,284
How can I stop Teacher Kim?

847
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,620
I can't do that. I can't.

848
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:10,432
What are you going to do?

849
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:11,641
It's obvious.

850
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,437
I couldn't do it 14 years ago.

851
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,398
I will do it this time.

852
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,580
GEOSAN MEDICAL CENTER SUCCESSFULLY
REPLACES AN ARTIFICIAL HEART

853
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:58,396
THE DAY OF THE FIRST ARTIFICIAL HEART
REPLACEMENT SURGERY

854
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:04,194
Here you are.

855
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:05,570
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

856
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:09,282
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

857
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:13,495
It's me. Where are you now?

858
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,662
Hello?

859
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:18,875
They must be almost there.

860
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,960
They? Aren't you coming?

861
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,003
Pardon?

862
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:23,963
Oh, I'm...

863
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:27,342
Actually, I have enteritis.

864
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:28,468
Oh, no.

865
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,136
My stomach hurts.

866
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:34,474
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry, President Do.

867
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,227
I need to go to the bathroom.

868
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,691
President Do, please smile.

869
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:45,193
Oh, right.

870
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:47,237
-Let's take a picture together.
-Yes, President Do.

871
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:51,825
When will they be here?

872
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,618
I was just told they're almost here.

873
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:54,869
They will arrive any minute.

874
00:56:58,581 --> 00:56:59,707
Wait. Who is that?

875
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:03,128
-Isn't that Bu Yong-ju?
-That's Bu Yong-ju.

876
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:05,088
-Look.
-I think he's Bu Yong-ju.

877
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,438
Bu Yong-ju?

878
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:25,191
THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL ARTIFICIAL HEART
REPLACEMENT SURGERY IN KOREA

879
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,985
"The first

880
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:32,031
successful artificial heart
replacement surgery in Korea."

881
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,493
THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL ARTIFICIAL HEART
REPLACEMENT SURGERY IN KOREA

882
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,623
Why are you here?

883
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:44,335
I thought it was a party
for the artificial heart implant.

884
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:46,588
Then I should be here.

885
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:52,427
We are the heroes
and heroines of this surgery.

886
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:06,441
Do you know what
the hardest thing in this world is?

887
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,777
It's to overcome yourself.

888
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:12,697
14 years ago, Bu Yong-ju...

889
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:16,618
was a coward.

890
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:17,952
He just

891
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:21,206
didn't know how to win.

892
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:22,582
He stayed silent.

893
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:25,043
He didn't want to make excuses.

894
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:26,544
Then he ran away.

895
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:27,879
He thought

896
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:30,965
that was the way of becoming responsible.

897
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:33,968
What are you trying to say?

898
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:37,388
I think

899
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:40,433
it'll be hard for you this time,
President Do.

900
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,396
