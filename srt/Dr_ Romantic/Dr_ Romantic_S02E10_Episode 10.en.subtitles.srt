1
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,097
As

2
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,058
a person...

3
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,352
and a doctor...

4
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:05,106
Surgeon Park Min-gook of Geosan Hospital.

5
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,816
BEAUTIFUL DOCTOR AWARD

6
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,615
I have never been embarrassed

7
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,367
or disappointed in myself.

8
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:17,744
The duodenum and...

9
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:18,953
And my principle

10
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,248
that I should save more people
than gain money and fame

11
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,584
has never been shaken either.

12
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,087
But...

13
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,800
the accident that day...

14
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,428
shook everything apart.

15
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,139
In shock and fear,

16
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,016
my weakness persevered

17
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,935
harder than any form of life.

18
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,438
My cowardly desire to live was

19
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,191
stronger than any principles I held on to.

20
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,109
The oil is leaking!

21
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,568
-You need to hurry!
-Come out!

22
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,572
So I ran away to live.

23
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,366
And he...

24
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,119
remained there to save.

25
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,123
She's in arrest!

26
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,022
I'm here, Doctor Kim.

27
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,098
Doctor Kim!

28
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,601
Can you take this?

29
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,981
Doctor Kim, are you all right?

30
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,821
Let's switch hands.

31
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,582
How's his condition?

32
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,876
His breathing is weak,

33
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,085
and his heart rate is slow.

34
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:37,050
Doctor Kim! His vein is quite swollen.

35
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,178
The umbrella in his chest is
stopping the blood flow

36
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,596
and putting pressure on his heart.

37
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,099
Did you bring the emergency kit?

38
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,392
I did.

39
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:48,978
Then open it!

40
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,232
There must be something
you can put into his chest.

41
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,695
The right side of his chest is stuck
under the bar.

42
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:01,324
It's impossible to insert the tube.
The bus needs to be lifted up first.

43
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,244
Mr. Heo, is the crane here?

44
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,704
It's already arrived.
They should be working on this now.

45
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:07,664
Okay.

46
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,457
Help me.

47
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,337
My legs are...

48
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,138
When did the accident occur?

49
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,474
About 30 to 40 minutes ago.

50
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,648
If his legs were stuck for 30, 40 minutes,

51
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,566
he might have crush syndrome.

52
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,902
He'll go into arrest
if you lift the bus too fast.

53
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:41,197
You need to lift it up slowly
after we put him on fluid.

54
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,532
It's minus ten degrees.

55
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,909
It may be dangerous to delay the process.

56
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,578
If you lift it up now,
he'll go into cardiac arrest!

57
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,456
If we do not lift it up now,
this patient will expire!

58
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,083
TO DIE

59
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:18,609
THE EFFECTS
OF AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF ANXIETY

60
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,695
Let's prepare more lines for later.

61
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,071
Ms. Oh.

62
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,157
Any news from the scene?

63
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,159
No, the rescue is taking a while.

64
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,244
There are three doctors out there.

65
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,370
Why are you worried?

66
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,664
Aren't you getting ready for surgery?

67
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,876
I'll manage my own business.
You don't have to mind me.

68
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:41,966
Doctor Yoon!

69
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,718
-Yes?
-Come here.

70
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:44,844
Yes, sir.

71
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,686
I brought blankets!

72
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,021
Give me a neck protector!

73
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,398
I'll put the neck protector.

74
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,570
The patient is in arrest.

75
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:03,946
Take her to the ER

76
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,907
and perform CPR first. Okay?

77
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,866
Yes, sir.

78
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,493
Let's move her!

79
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,245
One, two, three.

80
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,206
Be careful.

81
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,464
She's secured. We're moving the patient.

82
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,675
Patient coming through!

83
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,635
Be careful.

84
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,553
Take your time!

85
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,638
Doc... Doctor.

86
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,974
I can't feel my legs.

87
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,477
Do you see bicarbonate there?

88
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:37,939
I don't see any.

89
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,193
Then let's put him on IV fluid.

90
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,446
Are you giving up on this patient?

91
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,242
We can't save both of them.

92
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,036
We need to make a choice.

93
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,538
And this patient is still conscious.

94
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,624
Mr. Heo.

95
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,168
How long will it take to lift up this bus?

96
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,254
How long will it take to lift it up?

97
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,132
We're all ready!

98
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,383
Just give us a go sign.

99
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,885
Let's wrap his leg with EB,

100
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,971
then lift up the bus.

101
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,389
Give me some EB.

102
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,766
Are you insane?

103
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,393
Then he'll get crush syndrome.

104
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,271
He may,

105
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,106
and he may not.

106
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,025
You're willing to take a risk
over something you aren't sure of?

107
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,194
Should we give up on someone who's alive

108
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,489
over something you aren't sure of?

109
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,616
They both may end up dead!

110
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,994
They're both still alive.

111
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,370
And I will save...

112
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,665
both of them. Happy now?

113
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,463
Doctor Kim!

114
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,381
His blood pressure is dropping!

115
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,343
Please help me.

116
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,933
I thought he was one or the other.

117
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,269
That he was either insane

118
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,688
or an awful liar.

119
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,191
But he's...

120
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,609
Mr. Heo.

121
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,277
Get the crane ready.

122
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,529
And as soon as I give the signal,

123
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,366
let's lift it up by just 50 cm.

124
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,952
Is the crane ready?

125
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,913
There are people inside. Is it all right?

126
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,456
Yes, when I give the signal,

127
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,916
lift it by just 50 cm.

128
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:21,417
All right!

129
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,170
-Eun-jae!
-Yes.

130
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,880
You're in charge of his chest tube.

131
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,340
Can you do it?

132
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,009
Yes, I can do it.

133
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,052
Okay.

134
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,348
If anything goes wrong with him,

135
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,850
the blood is on your hands.

136
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,362
Please...

137
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,450
I'm all ready, sir.

138
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:57,995
Lift up the bus!

139
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,082
Lift up the bus!

140
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,244
Okay, good.

141
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,633
Mr. Heo.

142
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,427
Give me an IV set for him.

143
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,469
Yes, Doctor.

144
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,358
We have a patient!

145
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,237
Doctor Yoon, look after the patients.

146
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,281
-Let me know if something happens!
-Yes, sir!

147
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,241
Can you bring him over here?

148
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,744
Nurse Park and Nurse Um,
assist Doctor Yoon.

149
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:20,745
Yes, Ms. Oh.

150
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,583
Let's move the patient. One, two, three.

151
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,586
One, two, three.

152
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,884
How long has she been in arrest?

153
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,137
The rescue and transfer took
about 15 minutes in total.

154
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,221
Keep compressing.

155
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,182
We'll check her pulse on the monitor.

156
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,309
Give one ml. of epinephrine
every three minutes.

157
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,226
Got it.

158
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,811
-Bring an intubation set too!
-Got it.

159
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,607
-She's on the monitor.
-Let's check her rhythm.

160
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:52,735
Asystole.

161
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,904
Ms. Oh, pull her uterus to the left.

162
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:55,863
Yes, sir.

163
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,080
She's well over 36 weeks, isn't she?

164
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,332
Her fundal height is about 36 cm.

165
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:09,710
Her baby passed the limit of viability.
Let's check if the baby is still alive.

166
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,803
Fix the tube at 20 cm.

167
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:19,804
The sonograph.

168
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,014
Cut her shirt.

169
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,358
The baby is alive.

170
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,276
But the heart rate is too slow.

171
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:35,903
We need to do a C-section.

172
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,322
-A C-section?
-We need to conduct a PMCD.

173
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,199
-Got it.
-Are we doing it here?

174
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,575
The baby is in fetal distress.

175
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,910
Even if you keep compressing,

176
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,745
the placenta won't get enough blood flow.

177
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,832
If we don't deliver the baby now,
they'll both be in danger.

178
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,750
Ms. Oh, what about
the infant emergency kit

179
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:50,751
and the NICU?

180
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:54,130
The infant emergency kit is ready,
and there's a bed in Jungil's NICU.

181
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,173
Nurse Joo will transfer the baby.

182
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,675
Get ready to revive the baby.

183
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:01,387
Once the baby's out,
keep doing CPR, and run to the ambulance.

184
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,472
-Yes, sir.
-Who's going to operate?

185
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,850
-I will.
-Then I'll assist.

186
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,436
Nurse Joo, please get the surgery kit.

187
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,437
Yes, Ms. Oh.

188
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,648
You can stay here. Or just go home.

189
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,903
-Let's switch hands!
-Okay, got it.

190
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,034
I'm all finished!

191
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,329
Get the patient to the hospital!

192
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,790
We need to move this patient!

193
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,462
His heart rate dropped to 60 bpm.

194
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,046
The weather is too cold,

195
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,798
so his blood vessels are constricted.

196
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,800
Give me a 20 gauge angio needle.

197
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:40,760
Yes, sir.

198
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,680
You're going into his external jugular?

199
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,644
His heart rate dropped even more.

200
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,314
ALCOHOL SWAB

201
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,567
He has hyperkalemia.

202
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,569
What will you do now?

203
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,112
ELEVATED POTASSIUM IN THE BLOOD

204
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,287
Doctor Kim.

205
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:16,587
Got it.

206
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,672
-Hey, let's work on him.
-Yes, sir.

207
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,220
-Drop the IV at full speed!
-Yes, sir.

208
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:29,600
Okay. And this isn't warm saline,
so maintain his body temperature,

209
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,185
and get him to the hospital.

210
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,311
Yes, sir.

211
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,396
We have another patient here!

212
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:36,732
Over here.

213
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:48,994
Oops.

214
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,871
He made it.

215
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,751
Let's move him.

216
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,962
One, two, three.

217
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,524
Don't stop chest compressions.

218
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,442
Scalpel.

219
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,444
She has been on CPR for 19 minutes.

220
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,738
We'll cut vertically,
then do a transverse on her uterus.

221
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:25,656
HORIZONTAL

222
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,533
-Cutting.
-Gauze, please.

223
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,292
I'm in her abdomen. Hold this.

224
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,751
-Okay.
-One, two, three.

225
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:39,712
I see the uterus.

226
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,130
Richardson retractors.

227
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,094
I'll cut her uterus.

228
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,559
Remove the retractors.

229
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,106
-Push, please.
-Okay.

230
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:02,985
I can see the baby's head.

231
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,487
The baby is coming out.

232
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,917
Baby out at 19:25.

233
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:19,877
Kelly clamps.

234
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,465
Scissors.

235
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,059
You can keep going.

236
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,733
Keep compressing her chest.

237
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,237
The placenta is coming out.

238
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,995
I'll wrap up. Suture, please.

239
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,834
Please!

240
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,588
Please!

241
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,423
Please!

242
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,300
Please!

243
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,177
Please...

244
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,887
Please.

245
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,764
Please...

246
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:22,690
Cut.

247
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:28,988
Ms. Oh?

248
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,656
Right, yes.

249
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,618
This isn't good. Intubation.

250
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,366
SEO SE-YOUNG

251
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:31,592
I'm so relieved.

252
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,725
The ambulance is outside.

253
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,936
It's a 20-minute drive to Jungil Hospital.
Nurse Joo.

254
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,148
Don't worry.
I'll get the baby there safely.

255
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,401
Wait.

256
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,872
ROSC. She's back.

257
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,499
The mother came back.

258
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,931
Give me the central line.
I'll put her on norepinephrine.

259
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,601
We'll transfer them together.

260
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,269
Okay.

261
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,522
The mother...

262
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,526
must have heard her baby cry.

263
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,161
Patient coming through!

264
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,371
Please make room!

265
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,004
Great work, Ms. Oh.

266
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,051
Doctor Yoon.

267
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,637
Can you and Ms. Oh come with me?

268
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,358
The paramedics said

269
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,819
she was found near the bus accident site.

270
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,654
But she doesn't seem like a TA patient.

271
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,589
We should call the police first.

272
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,341
-It's what I'm thinking, isn't it?
-Yes.

273
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,011
I think she's a rape victim, Ms. Oh.

274
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:39,970
RAPE VICTIM

275
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,145
JUNGIL HOSPITAL

276
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,571
Be careful.

277
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,115
Can you manage alone?

278
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,408
Yes, don't worry.

279
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,368
I'll go with you.

280
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,790
I have a sister who's a lot younger,
and was born a month early.

281
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,293
My experience from that time may help.

282
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,212
May I go with you?

283
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,132
Thank you.

284
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,763
Please close the door.

285
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,770
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

286
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,317
119 RESCUE SERVICES

287
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,294
-Eun-jae.
-Yes?

288
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,004
Run his OP lab on the way

289
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,589
and put him in the OR fast.

290
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,548
OP LAB

291
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,717
And get the chest portable on the way.

292
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,512
His right arm was crushed
and needs to be amputated.

293
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,974
So take an X-ray, call Doctor Bae,

294
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,768
and ask him if he can
operate on him immediately. Okay?

295
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,311
-Yes, sir.
-Hurry up and go.

296
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,191
What's his condition?

297
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,818
His legs were stuck under a bar.

298
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,903
He has crush syndrome due to decompression

299
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,446
caused when the bus was lifted.

300
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:24,408
His heart rate has been dropping.

301
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,993
It looks like hyperkalemia.

302
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,454
We put in almost a liter of the IV,

303
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,164
so get his BGA first.

304
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,874
Yes, sir. What are his vitals?

305
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,376
100 over 70, 60 bpm.

306
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,343
Doctor Kim, are you okay?

307
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:44,928
I'm fine.

308
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,931
Can you tell Doctor Bae

309
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,434
to stop by my office for a second?

310
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:53,395
-Yes, let's go inside. It's cold.
-Okay.

311
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,106
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

312
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,142
You can't put this off any longer.

313
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,562
Let's talk later.

314
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,230
Doctor Seo knows too.

315
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:44,863
Goodness. Why did you tell him that?

316
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,365
I noticed it myself first.

317
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,494
It's nothing.

318
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,245
Don't go around

319
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,289
telling everyone.

320
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,084
You tell patients
not to hide their symptoms.

321
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:58,960
So why do you hide them?

322
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,089
I'm not a patient.

323
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:04,216
If you're ill, you can be a patient.

324
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,300
Listen to this guy.

325
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,929
Are you trying to educate me now?

326
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,514
I'm worried about you.

327
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,437
I mean,

328
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,023
I need to stick around here
for ten months.

329
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,608
If you fall ill,

330
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,777
it'll put me in a tight spot.

331
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,154
Nine months.

332
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:28,281
What?

333
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,868
You paid me back for a month,
so you have nine months left.

334
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,958
Hey, wait.

335
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,251
What?

336
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:44,631
Oh, no.

337
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,425
Why? Did I get hurt?

338
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:49,302
-Yes, a little.
-It's not too deep, but you're bleeding.

339
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,346
Let's clean it and suture the wound.

340
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,764
It's okay.

341
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,808
I can just put a plaster on it.

342
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:55,892
It'll mend itself.

343
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,436
You'll get infected with tetanus.

344
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,564
My gosh. I'll just get a shot later.

345
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,775
You can both get back to work.

346
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,902
I'll get the suture and a TD vaccine.

347
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,362
You need to be treated now.

348
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,197
Hey, you. Woo-jin.

349
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:16,913
Doctor Kim.

350
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,166
Hey, Ms. Oh.

351
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,421
Am I interrupting something?

352
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,256
No.

353
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:27,632
No.

354
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,342
We were talking about

355
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:32,304
the surgeries for the emergency patients.

356
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,265
Ms. Oh, what is it?

357
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,393
We have a rape victim in the ER.

358
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:39,769
What?

359
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:41,771
I called the police,

360
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,357
but she's not in good condition.

361
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,859
She has hemoperitoneum too.

362
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:46,860
Is that so?

363
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:48,862
Woo-jin.

364
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,115
You need to go and check her condition

365
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,450
then report back to me.

366
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:55,368
But--

367
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,621
She has hemoperitoneum.

368
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,623
It'll be bad if she goes into shock.

369
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,041
Hurry up.

370
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,088
Go on, now.

371
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:09,966
Yes, sir.

372
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:18,099
Doctor Bae.

373
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,019
You need to go look after

374
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,604
the crush syndrome patient.

375
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,356
But...

376
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,691
You should hurry up and go.

377
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,861
Oh, okay. I'll get going.

378
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,866
-Keep up the good work.
-Yes.

379
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,623
Ms. Oh, can you head over

380
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,501
to the OR and help Eun-jae?

381
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,837
There's a patient who was impaled
with an umbrella.

382
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,800
I'll get changed quickly and go there too.

383
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:53,552
Yes, sir.

384
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:54,844
Okay.

385
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,225
Doctor Kim.

386
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:01,643
Yes?

387
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,646
Are you all right?

388
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,190
Of course I am.

389
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:08,942
I'm fine.

390
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,289
TREATMENT ROOM 3, TREATMENT ROOM 2

391
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,981
TRIAMCINOLONE

392
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:55,572
Then I'll take her to the hospital
with the Rape Crisis Center.

393
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,533
Her condition is too dire for a transfer.

394
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,160
How bad is it?

395
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,330
I took a sonogram of her abdomen
because there were too many bruises,

396
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,874
and I found some blood around her spleen.

397
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,834
We need a CT scan to check the bleeding.

398
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,503
-Her vitals?
-Her blood pressure is okay.

399
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,714
Get her to the hospital
with the Rape Crisis Center.

400
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,257
We don't have an OB-GYN department.

401
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,968
We have an emergency rape kit

402
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,178
at our hospital too.

403
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,056
I'll take a CT scan first,

404
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,266
ask her about her condition, examine her,

405
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,310
then hand over whatever the police need.

406
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:28,647
Gosh, the admissibility of evidence
drops by the hour.

407
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,649
We might lose the rapist.

408
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,734
Are you looking for a murderer
instead of a rapist?

409
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,694
Hey, Doctor Yoon.

410
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,155
That was kind of harsh, Doctor.

411
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,657
In that case, I'm sorry.

412
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,993
Doctor Yoon, she woke up.

413
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,542
Ma'am, are you all right?
You're at a hospital.

414
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,130
You can relax. You're safe here.

415
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,383
I'm going to ask you a few questions.

416
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,219
The police. Please get the police.

417
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,554
Yes, there's a police officer out there.
Don't worry.

418
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:06,893
But there's bleeding in your stomach,
so we need to take a CT scan first--

419
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,978
Please.

420
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,647
Please call the police.

421
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,152
Ma'am... Ma'am?

422
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,321
Her vitals are dropping.

423
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:22,242
-What's with her?
-She went unconscious while talking.

424
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,493
Her vitals?

425
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:24,869
80 over 40, 110 bpm.

426
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,080
Darn it. Let me check her FAST.

427
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,126
What's going on?

428
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,044
She's a rape victim with hemoperitoneum.

429
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,754
ABDOMINAL BLEEDING

430
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:36,715
I can't catch the origin.

431
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,885
It looks like a spleen injury.

432
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,679
Darn it. Of course I know that.

433
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,640
Doctor, her vitals are dropping.

434
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:46,975
70 over 40, 130 bpm.

435
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,852
She needs surgery now. Please get ready.

436
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:51,271
Hey. I'm her doctor.

437
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,314
You're going to operate on her?

438
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,024
What do you mean?

439
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:58,069
You used to make me perform
surgeries like this in the main hospital.

440
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,780
And you stayed away from surgeries
that could cause trouble later on.

441
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,077
Put her on some blood and run the OP lab.

442
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,580
Call Professor Sim and ask her
to open up an OR.

443
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:09,998
Then I'll assist.

444
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,624
I'm the only one around anyway.

445
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,175
-Please get ready.
-Yes, sir.

446
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:21,342
Doctor Seo.

447
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,854
OR 1: WOO JUNG-TAE, OR 2: JUNG GA-YOUNG

448
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,814
SURGEON: DOCTOR KIM, YANG HO-JUN

449
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,946
DOCTOR KIM

450
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,783
You're going to operate in that state?

451
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,444
Okay. May I begin?

452
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,279
Yes, go ahead.

453
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:25,865
Okay. Scalpel.

454
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:28,618
Gauze.

455
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:37,627
Okay, Bovie.

456
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,051
Richardson retractors.

457
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,514
Can you pull?

458
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,601
Okay, Bovie and gauze.

459
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,522
Retractors.

460
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:00,775
Hold the umbrella tightly.

461
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:06,781
Let's see...

462
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,117
His right middle lobe's been penetrated.

463
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,034
A LOBE IN THE LUNG

464
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:13,663
After we remove the foreign body,
we'll do a right middle lobectomy surgery.

465
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,331
Yes, sir.

466
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:16,916
Okay, Bovie.

467
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:33,892
What are you doing here?

468
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,311
I told you to get ready for surgery.

469
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,981
She had to collect something
from the patient's body.

470
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,069
All finished.

471
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,572
RAPE KIT FOR POLICE RECORDS

472
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,334
Here.

473
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:02,003
I collected those from Ms. Jung.

474
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:05,089
I hope you catch the culprit with that.

475
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,966
Yes, great job.

476
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:08,801
Yes, goodbye.

477
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,846
Excuse me, what's your name?

478
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,181
I'm Yoon A-reum.

479
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,849
Doctor Yoon A-reum.

480
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,435
I have a few more questions

481
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:18,811
about the victim.

482
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,063
Do you have some time?

483
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,453
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

484
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:42,835
Detective Ko.

485
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:46,673
Goodness, it must be hectic
because of the bus accident.

486
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:50,259
We already had a round.
We're finally catching our breath.

487
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,596
We received a report of a rape victim,

488
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,933
but we ran a little late with the traffic
because of the accident.

489
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:57,892
Where's the victim?

490
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,229
She's already in the OR.

491
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,481
Wait,

492
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,359
a police officer already came by.

493
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,277
What?

494
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:09,988
One of our officers came by already?

495
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,990
Did you get any updates?

496
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,283
No, not at all.

497
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:17,370
Which station was he from?

498
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,371
I don't know.

499
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:20,164
We wouldn't know that much.

500
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,977
We've tied off the blood vessels.

501
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,439
-Shall we remove the umbrella now?
-Nurse Choi.

502
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,111
What? Oh.

503
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,824
Great. Thank you.

504
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,951
Doctor Nam, how are his vitals?

505
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,578
They're stable.

506
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:03,791
We'll now remove the foreign body.

507
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,960
Okay, we're ready too.

508
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,838
-Eun-jae.
-Yes, sir.

509
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:10,923
Pull it.

510
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,009
Okay, I'll pull it out.

511
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,180
Slowly.

512
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,141
Slow down. Keep it slow.

513
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:21,851
Be gentle.

514
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:23,478
Pull it slowly.

515
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,111
I'm sorry, sir.

516
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,489
It's okay.

517
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,576
Change of gloves.

518
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,040
Gauze, please.

519
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,549
Keep the gauze coming.

520
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,095
Hurry up.

521
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,930
I need to see the spleen.

522
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,227
Okay, I see it now.

523
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,187
Bovie.

524
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,149
Suction.

525
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:11,651
Right angle forceps.

526
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,112
Shouldn't we dissect the area a bit more?

527
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,279
SEPARATION OF TISSUE LAYERS

528
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,614
Are you the lead surgeon?

529
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,784
The patient's pancreatic tail is long.

530
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,702
I'm just giving you my opinion

531
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:22,829
on the matter.

532
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,457
How dare you interrupt a senior surgeon
during surgery?

533
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:31,754
Doctor Seo.

534
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:37,343
I apologize.

535
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,513
Right angle forceps.

536
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:45,768
Instrument tie.

537
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,366
-Cut.
-Metzenbaum scissors.

538
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,202
Cut.

539
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,039
Bovie.

540
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,629
What is this?

541
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,465
-Did you not tie it off properly?
-Suction.

542
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,927
I think the accessory vessel is torn.

543
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,554
Accessory vessel, my foot.

544
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,055
You can't even tie a knot.

545
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,098
Vascular clamp.

546
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,142
What are you doing?

547
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,357
The bleeding's stopped.

548
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,360
It wasn't the vessel I tied.

549
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,281
What are you waiting for?
Keep tying them off.

550
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,158
Instrument tie.

551
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,417
-Cut.
-Cut.

552
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:54,921
What is this?

553
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,506
What's with the pancreatic tail?

554
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,092
What did you do with the clamps?

555
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,136
Vascular clamps can't cause this injury.

556
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,097
-Are you saying it's my fault?
-I said we should dissect the area more.

557
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,390
How dare you.

558
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,267
Enough, both of you.

559
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,561
What are you doing in front of a patient?

560
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:12,396
I'll call Doctor Kim.

561
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,565
There's no need. I'll finish this.

562
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:19,028
The pancreatic juice is leaking.
All the organs will melt at this rate.

563
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,321
I told you I'll finish this!

564
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,697
Enough!

565
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,662
Doctor Kim's in another OR. Call him now.

566
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:29,121
Professor Sim.

567
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:32,041
Will you wait until she dies on the table?

568
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:38,297
Call Doctor Kim immediately
before things get worse.

569
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:39,632
Yes, ma'am.

570
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,639
-Doctor Kim.
-Yes?

571
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,808
The other OR is asking for you.

572
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,268
The pancreas was torn

573
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,769
during a splenectomy.

574
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:55,439
Isn't Doctor Seo in that OR?

575
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,402
But Doctor Yang is leading the surgery.

576
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,488
Okay.

577
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,157
-Eun-jae.
-Yes, sir.

578
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:08,244
You can finish up this lobectomy, right?

579
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,121
Yes, of course. I can do it.

580
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,081
Leave this to me,

581
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,624
and go save those poor souls

582
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:14,750
in the other OR.

583
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,461
My, you've come a long way.

584
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,504
I can't believe

585
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,298
you're cracking a joke in the OR.

586
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,135
I owe it all to Doctor Kim's prescription.

587
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,475
Sorry about that.

588
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,978
For some reason, I always get so hungry

589
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,730
when I'm in the OR.

590
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,858
Well, I guess that's better than fainting,

591
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:40,526
vomiting, or running away.

592
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:50,453
Ms. Oh.

593
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,748
Are you not feeling well?

594
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,875
You're very quiet today.

595
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:58,294
Am I?

596
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:00,629
Bovie, please.

597
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,412
Would you like some coffee?

598
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:39,126
My stomach has been acting up lately.

599
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,921
Oh, then...

600
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,549
But I'll have some since you're offering.

601
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,220
What do you prefer?

602
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:51,013
Instant coffee or brewed coffee?

603
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,224
We also have a vending machine outside.

604
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:54,558
Take a guess.

605
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,519
What do you think I'd prefer?

606
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,606
Well, I'm not sure.

607
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:03,526
My gosh.

608
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:07,780
This.

609
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,452
Please call the police.

610
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,005
Okay.

611
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:45,943
You figured it out?

612
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,329
What are you saying?

613
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,332
A police officer responded to a rape case,

614
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,751
but he's actually not a police officer?

615
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,587
Then who is this man?

616
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,255
That's what we're trying to find out now.

617
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:10,009
But none of the substations in the area
sent any officers here.

618
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,845
The station didn't send anyone either.

619
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,972
What? Goodness.

620
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,308
I thought it was odd.

621
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,310
He got here so quickly.

622
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:21,896
Excuse me.

623
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:24,064
Is a patient named Jung Ga-young here?

624
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,526
Wow, we called just five minutes ago.
You got here so fast.

625
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,944
I was patrolling the area

626
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,030
when I received the call. Where is she?

627
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,615
Oh, okay.

628
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,700
Who's the doctor that talked to him?

629
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:36,285
Doctor Yoon.

630
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,245
Where is Doctor Yoon?

631
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,039
Nurse Park is looking for her.

632
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:42,583
She's not picking up,
and we can't find her anywhere.

633
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:43,751
What?

634
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:52,635
Doctor Yoon.

635
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:53,636
Are you in there?

636
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,223
Is there anyone in there?

637
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,690
The phone is turned off.

638
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,859
Please leave a message after the tone.

639
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,447
Women are so easy to trick.

640
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,324
When they see this police uniform,

641
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:16,659
they totally trust you

642
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,410
and let their guard down.

643
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,082
So you're not a cop?

644
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:24,875
What? This uniform?

645
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,670
No, I stole this, you fool.

646
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:38,514
By the way,
will Jung Ga-young live

647
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,307
once she gets the surgery?

648
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,435
Of course she'll live.

649
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,939
Our best surgeons are operating on her.

650
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,234
I see.

651
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,861
That's not good.

652
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:58,534
Anyway, thanks for the gift.

653
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:01,579
Thanks to you, the evidence will be gone.
Right?

654
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:04,290
I know, right?

655
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,084
-Be careful.
-What?

656
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,048
Give it back!

657
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,259
A-reum!

658
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:16,385
-Nurse Park!
-Hey!

659
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,721
Darn it.

660
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:21,432
Hey, come over here. Come here!

661
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:31,650
Darn it.

662
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,381
You little...

663
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:57,885
Hey!

664
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,016
Darn it.

665
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,603
Sir!

666
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:08,937
Are you all right?

667
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,789
I'll take over the surgery.

668
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,883
What happened to the pancreatic tail?

669
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:41,053
The patient has a spleen injury,
but her pancreatic tail is unusually long.

670
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,055
It got torn while tying the vessels.

671
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,724
And her pancreatic juice keeps leaking.

672
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:46,809
Okay.

673
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,437
We'll have to do a distal pancreatectomy.

674
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,189
Sponge stick.

675
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:00,656
I'm sorry.

676
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:15,879
Carpal tunnel syndrome.

677
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,298
Wrist pain,

678
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,050
tingling and numbness in your hands,

679
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,136
and weakness of the thumb muscles.

680
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:24,638
What's wrong?

681
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,223
Is there a problem?

682
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,349
No.

683
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,810
I got a cramp in my hand.

684
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,024
But what I saw that day was...

685
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:42,573
Was I...

686
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,117
really mistaken about his elbow?

687
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:51,957
Will you not perform the surgery?

688
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:58,797
Doctor Kim.

689
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,138
Okay.

690
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,306
I'm ready.

691
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:08,932
I'm okay now.

692
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:10,851
Let's begin.

693
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,189
Bovie.

694
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:28,243
It looked more serious than we thought.

695
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:31,246
He couldn't move his hand for a while.

696
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:35,042
I don't think he can
put off the wrist surgery any longer.

697
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,836
So? What happened to the surgery?

698
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:39,296
Pardon?

699
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,048
Right.

700
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,509
I think it's going well.

701
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,929
The one with the penetrating wound
and the crush syndrome patient?

702
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,138
Yes.

703
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:50,974
They all seem to be doing okay.

704
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:56,939
Why do you ask?

705
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:03,529
So he ended up saving both of them?

706
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,405
Pardon me?

707
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,086
What was I waiting for?

708
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,421
Was I hoping he'd be wrong?

709
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:24,675
Was I hoping one of them would die?

710
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:37,271
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

711
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:42,317
Gosh.

712
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,905
Thank you for all your help.

713
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:49,616
Gosh, no problem.

714
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,368
We didn't even do much.

715
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:55,163
Doctor Yoon and Nurse Park
did most of the work anyway.

716
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:58,876
And Mr. Gu helped us wrap things up.

717
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,669
I just happened to be walking by.

718
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:01,628
That's all.

719
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:04,381
-Here.
-Oh, thank you.

720
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:05,924
It's the victim's rape kit.

721
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:08,010
Please use this

722
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:10,178
to make sure that man rots in jail.

723
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:12,431
He deserves a heavy sentence.

724
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,893
We'd love to do that,
but the judge is the one

725
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,185
who decides that.

726
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,354
Anyway, thank you all.

727
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:21,773
Thank you, sir.

728
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:22,733
Bye.

729
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,818
Hey, move. Move over.

730
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:27,696
-You little...
-Stop.

731
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,913
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

732
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,289
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

733
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,125
I must say,

734
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,169
it was another long night.

735
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:43,378
Wasn't it?

736
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:47,049
It's cold. Let's go back inside.

737
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:49,968
Shall we?

738
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,597
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

739
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,183
We should go back inside too.

740
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,022
I like that you're brave,

741
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:03,690
but don't be reckless.

742
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:06,860
Wouldn't you say you were
more reckless than I was?

743
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,989
I thought you had wings or something.

744
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:13,033
How could you fly so high?

745
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,078
Well, you know.

746
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:18,372
I learned taekwondo when I was little.

747
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,000
You know what?

748
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:25,963
I'm really glad I came to this hospital.

749
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:31,677
Someone told me that if I come here,

750
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,304
I'll feel so viscerally alive

751
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:35,639
every single day.

752
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,308
And I have to say,

753
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:41,520
you do experience such a wide range
of cases and patients here.

754
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:45,565
And there are so many good people here.

755
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,777
Who told you that?

756
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,322
Just someone who's very cranky.

757
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:55,575
It's cold.

758
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:56,743
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

759
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,205
Someone who's cranky?

760
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:02,749
Who could it be?

761
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,933
YOON A-REUM

762
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,531
My gosh.

763
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:37,409
The chairman's office is on another level.

764
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,704
Every single part of this room

765
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:42,289
is exquisitely decorated, sir.

766
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,753
Gosh, me and my mouth.

767
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,964
My apologies, sir. I'm a little drunk.

768
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:57,387
This must be Mirae Hospital,

769
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,014
the project you mentioned earlier.

770
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:04,770
My gosh, this is...

771
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,647
It's bigger than I thought.

772
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:09,775
Since I'm the chairman now,

773
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,401
I should do big things.

774
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,278
So...

775
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,448
do you plan to appoint Professor Park

776
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:19,534
as the president of this hospital?

777
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:22,329
I'm still undecided

778
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:25,040
because I can't figure him out.

779
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,710
I told you he's like that.

780
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,172
This is a huge project.

781
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,508
I'm not sure

782
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,218
if he'll be able to handle it.

783
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:38,428
Don't get the wrong idea.

784
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:41,306
Just keep your position safe
at the main hospital.

785
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,683
Of course, that's a given.

786
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,228
When did I get such "ideas"?

787
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:52,526
But I must say...

788
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:55,695
my feelings are a little hurt.

789
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,073
That's such a prominent position.

790
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:01,034
I can't believe you're considering him,
and not me.

791
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,203
As you know, Professor Park

792
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,497
is a highly sought-after surgeon.

793
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:07,707
He has great skills.

794
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,585
Admit it already.

795
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,003
Right, I do.

796
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:15,465
I do admit that, of course.

797
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,028
Is this fun for you?

798
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:46,163
Belittling others while showing off.

799
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:51,501
-Do you enjoy it?
-Do you work as a doctor for fun?

800
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:55,046
Do you walk around in your white coat

801
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,173
to show off?

802
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:58,216
I wanted to be a better person.

803
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,553
That's why I became a doctor,
and when I have the white coat on...

804
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:06,600
Right.

805
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:10,395
I thought I deserved to show off a little.

806
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:12,856
Then just keep living like that.

807
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:15,025
Why do you keep provoking me?

808
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:18,069
That accident 11 years ago.

809
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,364
Ever since that accident...

810
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:24,492
I had been caught in a vicious cycle

811
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:27,078
of trying to run away from that bus
every night.

812
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,833
But the moment we met again...

813
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,502
I realized that the accident

814
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:36,880
wasn't what I was trying to run away from.

815
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,466
It was you.

816
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:44,012
What the heck are you talking about?

817
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:47,349
Don't act like you don't know.
In that bus, that day!

818
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,686
You stayed behind...

819
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:56,816
while I ran away.

820
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,821
And that's why you kept mocking me.

821
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,324
When?

822
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:06,034
The tension pneumothorax!

823
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:08,870
AIR TRAPPED IN THE PLEURAL CAVITY

824
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:11,498
From the moment you sent me that note
until now.

825
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:18,463
Right.
Even now, I bet you're mocking me inside.

826
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:22,926
That's why you boast even more
in front of me.

827
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,886
"Can you save him?"

828
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,596
That's what you should be asking first.

829
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,515
And that's why you criticize me!

830
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,892
You don't want to risk
ruining your reputation,

831
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,519
so you're just trying to avoid problems.

832
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:33,812
And you belittle me!

833
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,355
Oops.

834
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,440
He made it.

835
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:40,944
You keep pushing me
to make me feel ashamed and humiliated.

836
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:43,780
"You're a fake doctor."

837
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:48,868
You think I'm a coward
who ran off to save himself

838
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,161
despite being a doctor.

839
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:53,623
Am I wrong?

840
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:58,670
I'm finally beginning to understand

841
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,256
why such a haughty man like you

842
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:03,925
always seemed so insecure and defeated.

843
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:05,468
But you know what?

844
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:09,806
I don't remember you.

845
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:16,646
I only found out

846
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,690
that you were also on that bus

847
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:20,900
through a newspaper article later on.

848
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,986
But that's it.

849
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,573
Whether you were...

850
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,784
hurt that day,

851
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,661
or whether you ran away or not...

852
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:34,372
I have no recollection whatsoever.

853
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:37,375
Are you really this determined
to make me look pathetic?

854
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,711
If you want to do that to yourself...

855
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,589
I won't stop you.

856
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:43,548
But you see...

857
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,468
let me just tell you one thing.

858
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:49,346
That accident was neither your fault

859
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:50,805
nor your responsibility.

860
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,391
It was horrible and terrifying.

861
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:57,812
It was very dangerous because the bus
could've caught fire at any time.

862
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:00,815
You escaped that madness

863
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,400
to save yourself.

864
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:05,487
Who could criticize you for it?

865
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:07,655
No one can.

866
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,325
And no one should.

867
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:15,914
So...

868
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,168
it's time you got off that bus.

869
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:27,759
Just get off.

870
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:49,489
SURGERY, FAMILY MEDICINE

871
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,067
I'll follow up on the ABGA in ten minutes.

872
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:27,277
Okay, sure.

873
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:39,289
Please check the Hemovac drain often.

874
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:40,331
Sure.

875
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,049
How's your OR-phobia?

876
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,051
Is it completely gone?

877
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:59,184
Thanks to Doctor Kim,
I rule the OR now.

878
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:00,435
I showed them all.

879
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:07,609
When I was forced to transfer here,

880
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:09,486
I thought my life was over.

881
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,281
Same here.

882
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:16,075
I came here when I felt as if...

883
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:18,328
I reached a dead end.

884
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:21,789
But now...

885
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:24,167
I'm having fun here.

886
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:28,338
I want to be a doctor here
for a long time.

887
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,592
Here, we don't have to worry

888
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:35,303
about sucking up to others

889
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:37,222
or calculating who to side with

890
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:38,598
to advance our career.

891
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:41,809
Even when Ho-jun glares at me
and tells me to leave,

892
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:42,894
I can fight back.

893
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:44,437
Right.

894
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:47,232
Such things were unimaginable
at the main hospital.

895
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:50,318
That place was all about cliques,

896
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,362
and we had to know who to side with.

897
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:54,447
But here,

898
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,491
we have no time to think about that

899
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:58,701
because patients keep coming in nonstop.

900
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,955
That's why it's easier to focus on them.

901
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:04,999
That's how it should be.

902
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,585
But these days, it's not easy

903
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:09,837
to keep things the way they should be.

904
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:12,715
We owe it all to Doctor Kim.

905
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:14,634
Right?

906
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:21,015
To be honest, I initially thought
he was a close-minded old man.

907
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,476
But he's actually open-minded.

908
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,395
Very open-minded for an old man.

909
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:26,729
He's totally my type.

910
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:31,276
He even took my side
in front of President Park earlier today.

911
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,404
He took the patient's side, not yours.

912
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:35,905
Either way.

913
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,865
It felt so great, very gratifying.

914
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:40,952
Thanks to him, I survived,

915
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,496
and so did the patient.

916
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,712
After my first surgery here...

917
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:53,631
he said this to me.

918
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:55,133
What?

919
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:58,970
"Save them.

920
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,639
We must save them no matter what."

921
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:04,475
That's so inspiring.

922
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:06,436
My gosh.

923
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:09,355
What if I fall head over heels
and end up staying here forever?

924
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:11,691
I may stay here for the rest of my life

925
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:14,235
and work with Doctor Kim forever.

926
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:15,236
Shall we...

927
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:18,948
really do that?

928
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:22,410
Do you want to stay here too?

929
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:25,246
Why do you ask? You don't want me to?

930
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:28,833
Well, that's totally up to you.

931
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,752
How I feel about it doesn't matter.

932
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:33,504
Stay here forever if you want to.
Don't mind me.

933
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:35,048
Don't you worry.

934
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:36,424
I won't cross the line.

935
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:39,677
What? I didn't say anything.

936
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:43,181
Gosh, I'm hungry.

937
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:46,976
Shall we have cup noodles?

938
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:50,146
No.

939
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:53,691
I don't eat carbs after 6 p.m.

940
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:04,702
It's so odd.

941
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:06,704
I never get this hungry.

942
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:35,650
MILK

943
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:10,476
Gosh.

944
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:19,861
Doctor Kim, are you in here?

945
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:20,820
Sir.

946
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:32,790
What...

947
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:35,209
Doctor Kim.

948
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:37,295
Sir!

949
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:38,671
Sir!

950
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:41,549
Sir!

951
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:43,634
Sir!

952
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:47,054
Sir!

953
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:49,265
Sir...

954
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:54,854
I need sutures, antibiotics,
and some elastic bandages.

955
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:55,938
Sure, no problem.

956
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:58,733
Do we have another new patient?

957
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:01,402
No.

958
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:02,612
Not really.

959
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:04,614
The supplies you just requested

960
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:05,990
must be for a laceration.

961
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,034
Who's the patient?

962
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:09,952
Oh, it's...

963
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:12,038
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

964
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:15,458
I'll come with you.

965
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:17,418
You'll need assistance anyway.

966
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:20,505
I think I can manage on my own, Ms. Oh.

967
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:23,049
Where is

968
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:25,134
the patient now?

969
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,094
Ms. Oh.

970
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:28,346
I asked you...

971
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:30,640
where the patient is.

972
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:36,145
The phone is ringing, Ms. Oh.

973
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:40,274
This is the ER.

974
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:53,996
Here's the key.

975
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:08,302
Doctor Kim. Sir!

976
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:15,810
Doctor Seo.

977
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:20,106
Be careful. One, two, three!

978
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:24,235
Doctor Kim. Sir.

979
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:25,945
Sir!

980
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:27,655
Please wake up.

981
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:29,323
Doctor Kim?

982
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:36,330
Doctor Kim, please. Please wake up.

983
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,124
Gosh, sir.

984
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:39,417
Sir!

985
01:05:16,203 --> 01:05:17,455
You've been hiding here?

986
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,417
Hey, Woo-jin.

987
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,668
You punk.

988
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:24,837
You haven't changed one bit.

989
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,422
What? Who collapsed?

990
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:27,882
Are you okay, Doctor Kim?

991
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:29,383
Doctor Kim?

992
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:31,510
What if we're the reason he collapsed?

993
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:35,348
I'm no longer needed at Doldam Hospital?

994
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:37,475
How's Bu Yong-ju doing?

995
01:05:38,142 --> 01:05:40,311
What? Is something wrong, Doctor Seo?

996
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:42,438
You must never repeat the same mistake.

997
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:44,273
Without Doctor Kim,

998
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,609
Doldam Hospital will collapse.
