1
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:46,880
Yes, the surgery went on
until late at night today too.

2
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,300
I'm not sure.

3
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,969
I don't know how it'll be this weekend.

4
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:56,806
What about you?

5
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,227
Really?

6
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,562
Great job.

7
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,106
Doctor Kim.

8
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,232
Doctor Kim!

9
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,734
Yes, okay.

10
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,653
I'll call you once I'm in my room. Okay.

11
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,698
Doctor Kim! Goodness, Doctor Kim.

12
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,158
I can't believe this.

13
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,534
What's going on?

14
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,119
Are you all right, Doctor Kim?

15
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,872
-Doctor Kim.
-Doctor Kim!

16
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,294
PROFESSOR SIM HYE-JIN

17
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,173
Yes? What is it?

18
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,011
What? Who just collapsed?

19
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,277
Did I keep you waiting?

20
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,072
Oh, no. I just came out too.

21
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,658
But it looks like we have
another ER patient.

22
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,622
I've got him.

23
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,547
Establish both lines

24
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,382
-and put him on fluid first.
-Got it.

25
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,551
-His vitals?
-110 over 70, 110 bpm.

26
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,718
Temperature is 39.1 degrees.

27
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,303
Give propacetamol through IV.

28
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,055
-Let me look at his FAST.
-Yes, Doctor.

29
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,349
-And give me the suture kit.
-Here's the kit.

30
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,190
What's going on, Mr. Jang?

31
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,316
Another patient?

32
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,442
Nurse Park.

33
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:32,986
This is bad.

34
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,529
It's Doctor Kim...

35
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,367
What's going on?

36
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,327
Why is he like this?

37
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,122
He must have been hurt
during the accident.

38
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,376
I can't believe he operated
in this condition.

39
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,505
There's no internal bleeding,
so don't worry.

40
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:54,883
But we never know,

41
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,468
so we'll take an X-ray
after you're done suturing.

42
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:58,803
All right.

43
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,096
Cut.

44
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,640
Tape, please.

45
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,647
We'll move him. Please get ready.

46
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,565
Yes, Doctor.

47
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,193
It's fine.

48
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,243
-Doctor Kim.
-Doctor Kim.

49
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,244
Doctor Kim.

50
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:25,705
Doctor Kim.

51
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,084
Hey, there's no need to make a fuss.

52
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,087
You don't have to...

53
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,840
take my X-ray either.

54
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:39,469
But there could be a rib fracture.
You should take one just in case.

55
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,429
If it were that serious,

56
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,517
I would've felt it already.

57
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,853
You can't move around yet.
Stay on the bed.

58
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,148
I'll lie down in my office.

59
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,274
No, don't do that.

60
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,360
I'll take you to the hospital room.

61
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,111
I'll keep my eye on you until tomorrow.

62
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,030
Yes, please do that.

63
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:01,532
I'm fine. I won't die.

64
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:06,496
Will you please just listen!

65
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,420
Don't be alarmed.
She's sorting things out right now.

66
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,673
It's not because we think you'll die.

67
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,217
He just wants to check your condition!

68
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:22,178
You'll be hospitalized for just one day!

69
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,931
Why are you so stubborn?
You're causing a nuisance!

70
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,768
I can manage my own body, Ms. Oh.

71
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:32,313
You say you can manage yourself,
but why did we find you lying on the floor

72
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,023
of the treatment room like that?

73
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,110
That's because I haven't--

74
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,111
If you were hurt,

75
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,487
you should've told people

76
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,698
that you were hurt,

77
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,783
and then you should've gotten treated!

78
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,619
Do you think you're
the only doctor around here?

79
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:50,623
Why didn't you do anything like a fool
until you were found in such a condition?

80
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,251
Do you see them?

81
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,088
They're all standing out there
worried about you,

82
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,589
and they can't even go home!

83
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,718
Goodness, I'm fine. What's with you all?

84
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,680
Your doctor will decide
if you are all right or not.

85
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:10,310
You just have to listen to your doctor
as a patient.

86
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,520
You know very well
that patients who never listen

87
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:15,231
are annoying and troublesome,
so I won't go on about that.

88
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:16,733
Please

89
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,817
show a good example

90
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,612
also as a patient, Doctor Kim!

91
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,623
Game over.

92
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,793
As always, Ms. Oh wins.

93
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,716
I'll lie down.

94
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,510
Okay.

95
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,180
Hey, that hurts. Do it slowly.

96
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,017
We'll take him out.

97
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,941
You can go.

98
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,156
Goodness.

99
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,658
He makes our heart drop
every once in a while.

100
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,329
-Let's get back to work.
-Gosh, I'm so relieved.

101
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,547
Ms. Oh.

102
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:28,888
Are you all right?

103
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,281
So?

104
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,284
How's Bu Yong-ju's condition?

105
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,120
Yes, okay.

106
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,181
Continue. And?

107
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,490
PERSONNEL RECORD

108
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,453
HEAD ADMINISTRATOR, JANG GI-TAE

109
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:35,955
HEAD NURSE, OH MYEONG-SIM

110
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,416
SPECIALIST, NAM DO-IL

111
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,377
SPECIALIST, SEO WOO-JIN

112
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,425
SPECIALIST, SEO WOO-JIN

113
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,722
This jerk.

114
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,275
Do you have any other pain
other than the wound I sutured?

115
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,319
That bus rolled over.

116
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,405
Of course my whole body aches.
Don't you think it would?

117
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,699
Any other pain other than your bruises?

118
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:12,950
None at all.

119
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,577
Doctor Bae.

120
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,871
You said my X-ray looks fine.

121
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,289
Yes, everything looked fine.

122
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,626
How about your hand?
It didn't look well in the OR.

123
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:25,463
I just had a cramp back then, that's all.

124
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,839
Other than CTS...

125
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,092
do you have any other symptoms?

126
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:37,683
Your elbows didn't look great last time,
if what I saw was correct.

127
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,144
What do you want to know?

128
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,812
Your current condition.

129
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,609
It's not something GS should worry about.

130
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,945
But still, I'm your doctor right now.

131
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:53,032
It'll help me to make a diagnosis
if you tell me your symptoms.

132
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,536
Hey, it's pretty late.
You can get back to work.

133
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,578
Doctor Kim.

134
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,121
You said I'm a patient.

135
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,208
Getting a good rest
is always top priority for a patient.

136
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,795
Stop bothering me, and get back to work.

137
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,090
I want to get some rest. Goodness.

138
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,185
Hey. You're all still here?

139
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,690
We need to hear how Doctor Kim is
before we can go home and sleep in peace.

140
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,858
I went out to grab some dinner,

141
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,486
then got a call as soon as I had a bite,

142
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,073
so I had to leave everything
to run back in a hurry.

143
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,324
How's Doctor Kim?

144
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,827
His X-ray looks fine,
and his fever dropped too.

145
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,999
Once his wound is healed,
there shouldn't be a huge problem.

146
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,417
-Goodness.
-What a relief.

147
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,751
I'm so relieved.

148
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:49,171
But he still needs to get a good rest,

149
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,174
so we should let him do that today.

150
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,759
Yes, let's do that.

151
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,137
He hates it when we make a fuss over him.

152
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,056
He'd be really stressed out
if he knew we were here.

153
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,016
All right.

154
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,852
Then let's all go home quietly.

155
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,312
Sure. Great work today.

156
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,354
-Great work.
-Great job.

157
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,564
-Goodbye.
-Great work.

158
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:07,565
-Great work.
-Sure.

159
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,108
-Goodbye.
-Let's go.

160
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,549
What does he mean to all of you?

161
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,551
Who?

162
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,136
Doctor Kim.

163
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,097
I began to wonder what he means

164
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,933
and how much he means

165
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:46,854
to you, to Ms. Oh,
and to everyone at Doldam.

166
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,946
PATIENT: DR. KIM, DOCTOR: SEO WOO-JIN

167
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,251
This is too suffocating.

168
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,452
How's your bed?

169
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,287
Is it comfortable for you?

170
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,664
It's great.

171
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,251
I'll get a good sleep tonight, Ms. Oh.

172
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,422
I'm sorry about earlier.

173
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,049
What?

174
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,844
I shouldn't have done that to you

175
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,638
in front of all those people.

176
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,099
Goodness, it's all right.

177
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:09,145
What you said was absolutely right.

178
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,315
Doctor Kim, if you collapse,

179
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,485
Doldam Hospital will collapse too.

180
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,487
You know that, don't you?

182
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:30,833
Get a good rest.

183
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,376
Okay.

184
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,629
Goodbye, Ms. Oh.

185
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,116
It's me.

186
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,452
It's about your request.

187
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,038
I'll do it.

188
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,583

Why do I feel so tired and bloated?

192
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,268
Good grief.

193
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:58,063
I ate all this by myself?

194
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,662
Good morning.

195
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,207
Hey, A-reum. You're here early.

196
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,167
Goodness.

197
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,045
Someone must have had snacks last night.

198
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,880
Exactly.

199
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,049
Why couldn't they at least clean up?

200
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:28,552
Some people just eat and eat,
and others have to clean up after them.

201
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,845
Isn't that so, A-reum?

202
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,806
-Exactly. Give it here. I'll throw it out.
-No, it's okay.

203
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,433
I can do this much.

204
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,728
Can you open the windows
to let in some fresh air?

205
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,361
-Good morning!
-Hey, good morning.

206
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:50,616
What?

207
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,368
What is it?

208
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,745
What?

209
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,039
You had snacks last night, didn't you?

210
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,582
No, I didn't eat anything.

211
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,711
Why are you looking at me like that?

212
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,049
It really wasn't me.

213
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,426
I'm on a diet right now!

214
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,644
I turned into Eun-jae the binge eater
from Eun-jae the disciplined.

215
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,063
Look at how puffy my face is.

216
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,314
What am I going to do?

217
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:27,486
Gosh, if my mom finds out,
she'll panic and slap me so hard.

Woo Jung-tae's saturation dropped

but Doctor Kim got him.

Hey, you're here.

239
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,765
It's because of Mr. Woo.

240
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,767
His oxygen saturation dropped last night.

241
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,561
You need to watch his ABGA

242
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,479
and perform an oxygen titration test
if needed.

243
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,480
Keep your eye on him.

244
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,191
Hey, Nurse Lee.

245
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,653
How's the CBC analysis for Ms. Jung?

246
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,030
Her hemoglobin went up to 10.1

247
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,615
after the blood transfusion.

248
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,826
But the Hemovac color isn't very good.

249
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,369
How's the volume?

250
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,745
It's not a lot.

251
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,456
If the volume goes up,

252
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,083
please call me right away.

253
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,835
-Yes, sir.
-Keep up the good work.

254
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,465
Please go back to your room.

255
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,634
Hey, my wound is healing well,

256
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,595
my fever is gone, and I feel great.

257
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,554
Why should I?

258
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,223
I told you that I need to run
a few tests today.

259
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,517
My temperature rose a little

260
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,145
after I got hurt and caught a cold.

261
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,939
Why do I need to be examined?

262
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,025
Do you have that much free time?

263
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:54,776
Move aside.

264
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:59,323
If you have that much time,
go look after another patient.

265
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,367
Is it because of them?

266
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,207
What do you mean?

267
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,292
The reason why you keep hiding your pain!

268
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,293
It's...

269
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,629
because of the people of Doldam.

270
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,299
You're an integral part of this hospital,

271
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,092
so you're not allowed to be ill.

272
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,970
That's why you keep hiding this,

273
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,265
because you think it'll make them
worried and anxious.

274
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,810
But...

275
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,064
I'm not sure if that's good for you.

276
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:36,401
And I'm not sure if it's healthy
to have everyone in this hospital

277
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,237
depend solely on you.

278
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,031
Seeing you hiding your pain to live up

279
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,950
to their expectations is honestly...

280
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,372
Honestly what?

281
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:51,792
Tacky.

282
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,921
In our world, we call it nifty.

283
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,381
In other words--

284
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,799
You need to get diagnosed.

285
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,093
And get treated too.

286
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,136
Okay?

287
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,163
Is Woo-jin ignoring you,
or is he unreachable?

288
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,958
Right, exactly.

289
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,585
I texted and told him to call me
once he comes in,

290
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,004
but he hasn't replied.

291
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:40,924
Anyway,

292
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,343
why are you here to see him?

293
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:48,473
Do you know that this is the fourth time
you asked me that question?

294
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,018
Oh, did I do that?

295
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,519
Why? What?

296
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:55,314
Are you worried that
I'll call him over and harass him?

297
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,733
Goodness, no. I'm not worried.

298
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,445
Anyway, I guess he's running late today.

299
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,071
Why hasn't he replied?

300
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,282
You can call him.

301
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,452
-Right now?
-Yes, now.

302
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:09,911
Right.

303
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,789
Okay. Then I'll...

304
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,459
give him a call.

305
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,882
Hey, Doctor Seo?

306
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,801
Doctor Seo?

307
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,679
He isn't here right now.

308
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,807
Hey, do you know what time it is?

309
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,392
Where are you now?

310
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,019
I'm in the OR.

311
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,188
What?

312
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,898
You haven't come to work yet?

313
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,649
What do you mean?

314
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,236
You saw me in the staff room just now.
Don't you remember?

315
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,572
Hey, what's wrong with your voice?

316
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:46,865
Are you ill?

317
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,284
-What? Me?
-What are your symptoms?

318
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,661
You have pain, body aches.

319
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,164
Yes. And you have a fever too?

320
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,375
What's wrong with you? You're scaring me.

321
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,876
Goodness, I see.

322
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:01,088
Then you probably can't come to work.

323
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,632
Goodness, this isn't good.

324
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,676
Actually, Hyun-jun is here to see you.

325
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:10,389
Okay. You're ill, so you can't help it.

326
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,640
All right.

327
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,184
I'll let him know instead.

328
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,769
Get a good rest today.

329
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,813
Okay. All right.

330
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,193
What's wrong?

331
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,654
Well, that was Doctor Cha,

332
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,740
-but she was a little weird.
-Doctor Cha?

333
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:33,662
She went to the staff lounge just now
with a guest who came from Seoul.

334
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,790
Why? What was weird about her?

335
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,837
Woo-jin seems to be ill, Hyun-jun.

336
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:43,713
Oh, really?

337
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,715
I think he came down with a cold.

338
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:50,262
On the outside, this hospital
may look quiet and slow,

339
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,055
but that really isn't the case.

340
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,850
We get loads of
emergency trauma patients.

341
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,645
He's had to perform at least
two to three emergency operations a day,

342
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:01,106
so I guess he's out cold right now.

343
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,275
I'm sorry, Hyun-jun.

344
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,319
What did he say when you said I was here?

345
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,238
Pardon?

346
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,615
-What did he say?
-Right.

347
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:15,996
Well, first off, he was so glad to hear

348
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,956
that you are here.

349
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,792
And he said it's too bad

350
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,170
and that he's sorry he can't see you.

351
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,006
He said he'll come to see you later.

352
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,966
Yes, that's what he told me to tell you.

353
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,677
He said that?

354
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,097
That it's too bad and he's sorry?

355
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,641
Yes. Yes, of course.

356
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,521
But why do you ask?

357
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,274
Is something wrong?

358
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,235
You must think I'm a joke.

359
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,823
What do you mean?

360
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,367
You think I'm a joke because I'm a nobody.

361
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:57,412
Goodness, no.
I never thought you were a joke.

362
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,663
Give me your phone.

363
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,375
Why?

364
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,336
You just talked to Woo-jin, didn't you?

365
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,963
I want to call and talk to him myself.

366
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,636
What are you doing? Give it to me.

367
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,227
Gosh.

368
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,899
Gosh, he's not here.

369
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,701
DOCTOR YOON A-REUM

370
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,747
Doctor, there you are.

371
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,582
What is it? An emergency patient?

372
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,293
No. Hurry up and go
to the staff lounge now.

373
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:55,428
Your call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message--

374
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,393
SEO WOO-JIN

375
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,775
Your call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message--

376
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,959
Hey, Woo-jin.

377
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,423
You said you had a cold.

378
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:32,591
How did you make it?

379
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,468
What about your fever? Do you feel chilly?

380
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,473
Why did you come here?

381
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:41,975
Just go. This won't be good.

382
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,978
What are you doing? Go.

383
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:47,689
You should go.

384
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,483
What are you going to do?

385
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,319
It's okay.

386
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,237
You can go.

387
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:06,499
Are you okay?

388
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,127
You made a really weird phone call,

389
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,545
so I came because I was worried.

390
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,588
This is bad.

391
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:14,090
Woo-jin really shouldn't see him.

392
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,426
Why not? Who is that guy?

393
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,888
He's this guy who ran Samjin Hospital.

394
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,307
They used to work there together.

395
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,809
Wait, Samjin Hospital?

396
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,940
I know! It's those two?

397
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,830
I heard Bu Yong-ju got hurt.

398
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,212
He's not in a serious condition.

399
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,966
Did you know that he seems to have CTS?

400
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,386
Yes.

401
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,971
Yet

402
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,391
you didn't even tell me?

403
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,560
I'm a little disappointed.

404
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,813
I thought we were on the same side.

405
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,026
I'm sorry, but I don't
take sides with people.

406
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,239
All I trust is my hands, medical skills,

407
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,200
and my principles.

408
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,329
And I came to find out
that the people of Doldam Hospital

409
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,498
are more talented than I thought.

410
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:34,254
I'd like to transfer those
great talents to Mirae Hospital.

411
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,214
Do you think that's plausible?

412
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:39,217
Back then,

413
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,846
you told me to choose one.

414
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:44,681
What will you choose?

415
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,099
Your livelihood

416
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,435
or pride?

417
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,939
I'm going to start playing that game now.

418
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,532
Nurse Park, what are you doing here?

419
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,124
Why? What's wrong?

420
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,751
It's Doctor Kim.

421
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,587
I'm worried about him.

422
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,135
What if it's because of us,

423
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:23,803
Ms. Oh?

424
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,681
What do you mean?

425
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,976
The reason why you keep hiding your pain!

426
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:30,977
It's...

427
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,688
because of the people of Doldam.

428
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:37,484
You're an integral part of this hospital,
so you're not allowed to be ill.

429
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,778
That's why you keep hiding this,

430
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:43,072
because you think it'll make them
worried and anxious.

431
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,451
What if that's why he's straining himself?

432
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:48,745
What should we do?

433
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,606
Hey, Seo-jeong.

434
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,359
Yes.

435
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:24,447
I just opened up the file
you sent me yesterday.

436
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,908
Yes.

437
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,703
It was an interesting article
on the procedure

438
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:32,413
for necrotizing mediastinitis.

439
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,665
INFLAMMATION OF CHEST CAVITY

440
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:34,666
Oh, really?

441
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,044
Then we should be able to see

442
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:40,588
the progress of the procedure next week.

443
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:42,632
Yes.

444
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,971
Yes, we're all doing well here.

445
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,681
Everything is going smoothly.

446
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,559
Yes.

447
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,520
Yes, I'm well.

448
00:30:57,146 --> 00:31:00,942
Doctor Yoon Seo-jeong,
you should look after yourself.

449
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,487
Yes, okay. I'll talk to you later.

450
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:05,864
Okay.

451
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:29,304
THE ODDBALL PROJECT

452
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:41,190
Why won't they say anything?
They're making me anxious.

453
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,859
Should we get Mr. Gu, Doctor?

454
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,574
How long has it been since that incident?

455
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,451
Has it been about a year?

456
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,202
A little over nine months.

457
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,495
I see.

458
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:59,042
I had something to do at this hospital,

459
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,795
then I somehow found out you were here.

460
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,965
I've been wondering how you were doing.

461
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,052
You look better than I thought.

462
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,180
Do I?

463
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,223
Didn't you wonder about me?

464
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,143
How have you been?

465
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,437
Well, I'm ruined.

466
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,276
My license was suspended for three years,

467
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,529
I lost my house because of the loan
I got to open up my hospital,

468
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,615
became a delinquent borrower overnight,

469
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:32,533
and my wife divorced me.

470
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,244
It must've been tough.

471
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,795
So? Have you been making enough here?

472
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,673
Did you pay off your debt?

473
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,051
Goodness.

474
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,637
Do those scary guys still chase after you?

475
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:56,349
If you have nothing more to say,
please excuse me.

476
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,395
Should I set you up with a good hospital?

477
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,236
-He's approaching him.
-What is he doing?

478
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,237
Should I go in?

479
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,576
It's nothing much.

480
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,745
I just

481
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:21,416
hook up good doctors
to good hospitals with good conditions.

482
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:22,875
That's what I do now.

483
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,293
I'm sort of a recruiter.

484
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:29,215
I do business with a couple of hospitals
with a lot of money and connections.

485
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,718
You'll get paid at least 1.5 times more.

486
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,845
Of course your salary is negotiable.

487
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,265
However, I'll take 30 percent of
your first year's salary as my incentive.

488
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,767
What do you think?

489
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:40,977
I'm not interested.

490
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,438
All right, fine. Twenty percent.

491
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,106
A discount only for my juniors.

492
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,026
You should find someone else.

493
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:50,903
Hey, you jerk.

494
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,033
You're still the same.

495
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,414
You still don't feel bad about
what you did to me.

496
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,041
Isn't that right?

497
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,085
You're still the same too.

498
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,297
You still don't think...

499
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,341
what you did was wrong.

500
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,971
You should get to your business.

501
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,351
STAFF LOUNGE

502
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,565
Are you okay?

503
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,318
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay, Doctor Seo?

504
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,198
-What is this?
-Well, you know.

505
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,492
Just in case.

506
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,453
Yes, I asked him to come just in case.

507
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:43,372
Your word is my command.
Should I go in and take care of him?

508
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:47,919
Well, it's all right.
You should get back to work.

509
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,149
Didn't you see my text?

510
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,819
Why did you barge in without warning?

511
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,363
I had it all figured out
and was covering for you.

512
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:20,118
Anyway, why is Hyun-jun suddenly here?

513
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,661
Did he come here to see you?

514
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,371
How did he know you were here?

515
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:28,251
I can't believe
he's been holding a grudge for so long.

516
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:31,420
That was ages ago.
Why did he come all the way here for you?

517
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,298
What in the world did he say to you?

518
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,424
Did he swear at you?

519
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:41,180
We can report him to the police if he
abused you verbally or threatened you.

520
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,350
Yes, tell me.

521
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:45,351
I'm here for you.

522
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,727
Do you need a lawyer?

523
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,480
My mom's best friend is one.
Do you want her number?

524
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,275
-Hey, Eun-jae.
-Don't worry about the cost.

525
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,443
I'll ask her for a discount too.

526
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,571
The cheapest, the most inexpensive,

527
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,947
only the basic cost.

528
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,324
If you're still short,
I can lend you money.

529
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,910
Why are you doing this?
It's none of your business.

530
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:08,416
I heard the rumors too.

531
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,337
Everyone says you're the bad guy
who betrayed him,

532
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:16,174
but what Hyun-jun did was wrong.

533
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,553
He took bribes to abuse procedures
and used ghost surgeons.

534
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:23,598
It's too embarrassing
to even call him my senior.

535
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:27,393
We shouldn't cover for a doctor like him.

536
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:29,270
I believe doctors should stand up

537
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,272
and ban such doctors from operating.

538
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,692
So don't be too scared, okay?

539
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,652
Not all seniors deserve our respect.

540
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,405
Only show your manners
to those who deserve it, okay?

541
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,489
Okay, I get it.

542
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,659
But why are you so angry over my business?

543
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,870
Goodness, you're so slow.

544
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,456
It's because I'm worried about you!

545
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:57,798
If...

546
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:02,386
I say that, would it be too much for you?

547
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,350
In that case, I'm sorry.

548
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,314
It's not too much.

549
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,984
-I see.
-But I'm sure...

550
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,654
I'll stay up a few nights thinking,

551
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:26,285
"Does she like me or not?"

552
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,830
"Should I wait for her or what?"

553
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,334
I'll do that all alone.

554
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:38,756
If I say that,

555
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,260
would I be crossing the line again?

556
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,266
How are his vitals?

557
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,768
130 over 80, 125 bpm.

558
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,103
Temperature is at 37.2 degrees.

559
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:37,773
Give him a liter of normal saline
and a half ampoule of pethidine.

560
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,066
Nurse Park?

561
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:40,901
Yes, ma'am.

562
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,279
-Sir.
-Yes.

563
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,114
I'll examine you while we prepare the IV.

564
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:46,574
Roll over on your back, please.

565
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:47,992
Lift your knees up.

566
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:50,911
I'll check your abdomen.

567
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,708
Seems you've had surgery before.
What kind of surgery was it?

568
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,501
Last summer,

569
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:01,088
I had surgery to remove my gallstones.

570
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,425
Did something go wrong with the surgery?

571
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,052
No, I'm sure that's not the case.

572
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:09,472
Had something gone wrong,
you would've had symptoms right after it.

573
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:10,848
Let me examine you first.

574
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,279
This looks like pan-peritonitis.

575
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,405
INFLAMMATION IN THE ABDOMEN

576
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,995
Sir, we're going to give you a shot.

577
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,830
Since it's an opioid pain reliever,

578
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:37,625
dizziness or nausea may occur.

579
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,044
-Tell us if you feel such symptoms.
-Okay.

580
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,004
We'll do an OP lab test after the shot.

581
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,672
Let's take an X-ray right away.

582
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,258
Please relax.

583
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,438
What's going on?

584
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:04,777
NURSING DEPARTMENT

585
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:21,752
Okay. I'll get ready right away.

586
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,757
Doctor Yang, just leave everything there
when you're done.

587
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:27,967
I'll clean up later.

588
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,343
Another ER patient?

589
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,303
Yes, pan-peritonitis
due to ulcer perforation.

590
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:33,848
I'm done.

591
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,478
Why don't you clean up now?

592
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,610
47-year-old male with pan-peritonitis
due to ulcer perforation.

593
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,321
-His vitals are stable at the moment.
-Underlying conditions?

594
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:52,908
About five to six months ago,
he had cholecystectomy due to gallstones.

595
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,119
Then there might be a bit of adhesion.

596
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:56,162
You called Doctor Nam?

597
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,371
Yes, I did.

598
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,373
Doctor Nam isn't coming.

599
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,335
What do you mean?

600
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,795
Doctor Nam isn't coming?

601
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,839
We didn't get a call from him.

602
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,467
Pan-peritonitis due to a perforated ulcer?

603
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,844
I'll be in the OR, Doctor Seo.

604
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,221
Keep that in mind and get ready.

605
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,984
What? Come again?

606
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:28,486
Doctor Yang.

607
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:32,531
I'm no longer needed at Doldam Hospital?

608
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,242
Did I hear you correctly?

609
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,244
Yes, you did.

610
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,501
Here you go.

611
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:44,835
It's from President Park.

612
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:50,174
And here.

613
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,303
Goodbye then.

Doctor Nam isn't picking up?

619
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,924
The person you're trying to reach...

620
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,217
No, he's not answering.

621
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,220
What if something happened to him?

622
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,931
Shouldn't we tell Doctor Kim?

623
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,270
We'll tell him later.

624
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:48,315
I'll find out what's going on
after we're done with the surgery.

625
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,734
Let's make sure...

626
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:55,030
Doctor Kim can take it easy today,
Doctor Yoon.

627
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:56,907
Sure, no problem.

628
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,497
He'll be okay, right?

629
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:05,708
Yes, of course.

630
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,431
I'm Sim Hye-jin, an anesthesiologist.

631
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:21,640
What's your name, sir?

632
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:24,018
I'm Song Chang-gi.
What's this surgery for?

633
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,769
It's for gastric perforation.

634
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:27,938
I'll administer the anesthesia now.

635
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,106
This is oxygen.

636
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:32,192
Please relax. Inhale and exhale deeply.

TERMINATION OF CONTRACT

638
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,517
A 47-year-old male with pan-peritonitis
due to ulcer perforation.

639
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:07,353
May I begin the surgery?

640
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,896
Yes, get started.

641
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,481
Scalpel.

642
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,569
Forceps.

643
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:18,781
Bovie.

644
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,377
Hello, Doctor Yang.

645
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:32,920
You're a little late.

646
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,256
You're so nosy.

647
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,051
Are you keeping track of me?

648
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,346
No, I was just saying hello.

649
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,934
-Where's Woo-jin?
-He's operating on an ER patient.

650
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:47,935
Another one?

651
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:52,022
Gosh, we get so many ER patients here.

652
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:56,110
I told everyone to get ready to welcome
the VIP patients starting today.

653
00:44:58,612 --> 00:44:59,530
Hello, sir.

654
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:01,699
Sure, I'll head over now.

655
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:02,950
Yes, sir.

656
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:04,827
Darn it.

657
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:08,455
Hey, follow me.

658
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,165
Me? Why?

659
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:14,044
-I'm not even in General Surgery.
-Fill in for the ones who aren't here.

660
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:16,046
Why are you playing dumb?

661
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,339
Just do as I say.

662
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,804
Does he have to boss me around like this?

663
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,894
What are you waiting for?
Aren't you coming?

664
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,647
I am. I'm coming. I should, of course.

665
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:41,029
I really hate myself for being like this.

666
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:07,848
Thank you for coming here.

667
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:11,101
You have such a peculiar taste.

668
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,395
Why did you even want to work here?

669
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,647
-Is this an actual hospital?
-Who is he?

670
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:18,192
I'm not too sure,

671
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,819
but I heard he's the son
of someone very famous.

672
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,199
My gosh, what is that?

673
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:28,952
Is he the founder of this hospital?

674
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:32,664
This is a sculpture of Hippocrates.

675
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,250
Oh, right. Hippocrates.

676
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,214
Why did a foreigner come all the way here
to build a hospital?

677
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,552
What? He doesn't know who Hippocrates is?

678
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:47,971
Hey, you.

679
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:49,681
I can hear you.

680
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,810
Where should we go?

681
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,269
-Mr. Jang.
-Yes.

682
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,771
It's this way. Please follow me.

683
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:13,288
Where's Woo-jin?

684
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,832
He's operating on an ER patient.

685
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,377
I want them at the ER station right away.

686
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,419
No problem, sir.

687
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:23,882
What about the thing I asked you to do?

688
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,301
I gave it to him
first thing in the morning.

689
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:29,888
Why are you here?

690
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:32,683
Oh, Doctor Yang asked me to...

691
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:36,186
Your job is done. You may go.

692
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,105
But you asked me to fill in--

693
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,648
Just go.

694
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,362
What was that about?

695
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,449
I honestly can't stand him.

696
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,664
They'll help you out here from now on.

697
00:47:56,915 --> 00:48:01,003
But the thing is, Ms. Oh is in charge
of delegating the tasks.

698
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:02,713
You can't take over like this--

699
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:03,714
I have no choice.

700
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:06,049
It's President Park's order, so cooperate.

701
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:08,886
I'll tell Ms. Oh later. Bye then.

702
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:13,181
-Excuse me.
-Gosh.

703
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,605
What is happening, Doctor Yoon?

704
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:21,398
I have no idea.

705
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,775
THE ODDBALL PROJECT

706
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,061
It's oddly quiet today.

707

SURGERY, FAMILY MEDICINE

708
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:17,412
WE PROVIDE HEART-TO-HEART TREATMENTS

709
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,710
BEWARE OF OPENING DOOR

710
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:33,887
-Doctor Kim.
-Hey.

711
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,055
What are you doing here?

712
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:38,767
It's oddly quiet today,

713
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,644
so I came to see what's going on.

714
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:44,064
By the way, where did everyone go?

715
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:47,234
We have a patient with pan-peritonitis
caused by a perforated ulcer.

716
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,735
Everyone is probably in the OR now.

717
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,779
We have a pan-peritonitis patient?

718
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,406
How come no one called me?

719
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,324
You're not well.

720
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,284
They all wanted you to rest.

721
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:03,291
Who are those ladies
at the nurses' station?

722
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:08,213
Oh, they're the nurses
that President Park brought.

723
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:09,756
Yes, exactly.

724
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,675
What are they doing here?

725
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:12,676
I'm not sure.

726
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,303
They must be here for a reason.

727
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:20,267
When will you get surgery for your CTS?

728
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,186
Let's talk about it some other time.

729
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,439
Don't put it off. Just get it done.

730
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,983
The sooner you recover,
the better it is for us.

731
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:28,900
You know that.

732
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,411
What?

733
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:41,538
They even took over the ER station?

734
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:44,583
Yes, Nurse Um and Nurse Joo
are beside themselves.

735
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,002
And Ms. Oh let that happen?

736
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:50,297
She's in the OR now,
so she doesn't know about it at all.

737
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,425
They took over while Ms. Oh is in the OR?

738
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:55,635
Wow, what a calculated move.

739
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:58,221
And we can't even reach Doctor Nam.

740
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,390
They called him regarding the surgery

741
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,059
but can't get a hold of him now.

742
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:06,229
Something serious must be going on.

743
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,857
Does Doctor Kim know about all this?

744
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,359
No, Ms. Oh said
we should let him rest today.

745
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:12,277
Why?

746
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:14,905
This situation calls for his attention.

747
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:16,364
But he's hurt, you know.

748
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:19,326
-Where?
-You didn't know?

749
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,954
He got hurt in the bus crash.
There was a ruckus about it last night.

750
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,540
Where? How bad is it? Is it serious?

751
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,501
No, it's not that bad.

752
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:31,922
But Ms. Oh and Nurse Park
are very worried.

753
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,091
They're concerned we might burden him.

754
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,344
I see.

755
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:39,930
I had no idea.

756
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:53,610
DOCTOR KIM

757
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,203
Hi, Doctor Kim.

758
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,080
What's up?

759
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:06,873
Oh, that.

760
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,960
Something came up at the pub,
so I couldn't leave.

761
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,088
Yes, of course. Everything's fine.

762
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,423
By the way, how are you feeling?

763
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:18,385
I heard you're already out and about.

764
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,846
Ms. Oh is very worried about you.

765
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:24,307
Can you come and talk to her?

766
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:27,060
She's driving me crazy.

767
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,357
Yes. All right.

768
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,711
Thankfully, the adhesion isn't too bad.

769
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,172
I'll look for the perforation first.

770
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:12,063
This is from a choledochojejunostomy.

771
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:13,815
PASSAGE UNITING THE BILE DUCT AND JEJUNUM

772
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,526
What's wrong? Is there a problem?

773
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:20,488
He said he had a cholecystectomy
because of gallstones.

774
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,241
I think the surgeon touched his CBD
by mistake.

775
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,496
The CBD is connected to the jejunum.

776
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,916
Did they cut it while taking out the GB?

777
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,543
I think so.

778
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,672
Why? Is that a problem?

779
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:40,550
He said nothing about his bile duct.

780
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,348
Let's just move on, Doctor Seo.

781
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:49,726
What do you mean?

782
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:53,188
Maybe he was told about it,
but didn't tell you.

783
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:54,397
Or...

784
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,652
maybe the operating surgeon hid the truth.

785
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:02,280
Isn't that what you want to check?

786
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,409
Ms. Oh, please record this for me.

787
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:08,536
-Nurse Kang.
-Yes, ma'am.

788
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,087
Started recording.

789
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,265
Doctor Seo.

790
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,853
About the pan-peritonitis patient...

791
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:37,565
Let's just cover it up.

792
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,652
-What?
-The thing about his bile duct.

793
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:42,362
Let's not tell his family.

794
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:44,322
Why do you always want to cover things up?

795
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:47,200
I don't know who operated on him,

796
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,869
but if the doctor didn't tell him,

797
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,539
he or she will be held liable for it.

798
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:54,165
The doctor should take responsibility.

799
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:57,252
It's not like he suffered
from an adverse effect.

800
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,089
Keep quiet, and it won't become a problem.

801
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,758
Don't stir things up
and turn it into a problem.

802
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:07,095
All patients have the right to know
what happened to their bodies.

803
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,764
And it's the doctor's job to inform them.

804
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:12,225
Will you repeat what you went through
at Samjin Hospital?

805
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:18,064
Obviously, you'll be the bad guy
and the traitor again.

806
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,066
Just turn a blind eye to it, okay?

807
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:24,821
Thank you for your concern...

808
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,365
but I'll deal with my problems.

809
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,621
Gosh, that fool.

810
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,666
I don't think you need to worry.

811
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:41,463
In my opinion...

812
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,175
he's a lot more clearheaded than you are.

813
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,442
Yes. Okay.

814
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:04,652
I'll come down now.

815
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,285
Something's come up, so I must step out.

816
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:15,413
Mr. Jang, take good care of Ik-joon
for me.

817
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:16,706
Of course, sir.

818
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:21,336
Doctor Yang, come with me.

819
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:22,253
Yes, sir.

820
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:32,472
All right. How about I give you
a tour of the wards first?

821
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:36,226
Before that,
can you tell me that girl's name?

822
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:37,644
"That girl"?

823
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,146
Who?

824
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,773
BEWARE OF OPENING DOOR

825
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:47,070
How are things going?

826
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:49,906
I feel like a bomb is about to go off.

827
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:51,491
Quiet.

828
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,842
What is going on here?

829
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:11,678
Can you explain what's going on?

830
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,266
We're here per President Park's orders.

831
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:18,268
I was never informed of such an order.

832
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,311
Okay?

833
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:27,026
You should talk to Mr. Heo.
We have nothing more to tell you.

834
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:34,159
Yes, it is President Park's order.

835
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:37,120
Even if that is the case,
this is unacceptable.

836
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:40,790
How dare you bring in new nurses
while I was away from the station

837
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,168
and put them to work without informing me?

838
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:44,919
I understand why you're upset,

839
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:49,674
but they won't get in the way
of the doctors or other nurses.

840
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:51,718
They'll just answer the calls.

841
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:53,887
They'll answer the calls?

842
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,055
What are you talking about?

843
00:57:58,433 --> 00:57:59,809
This is Doldam Hospital's ER.

844
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,686
A man fell from a roof while fixing it.

845
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:03,521
He fractured his knee.

846
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:05,607
I'm sorry. Our ER is full at the moment.

847
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,151
Please take him to another hospital.

848
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:11,696
To another hospital?

849
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,200
Isn't this Doldam Hospital?

850
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:16,534
Yes, it is.

851
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:20,205
But we can't accept more ER patients now.
Please take him to another hospital.

852
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:23,458
What...

853
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:26,628
That's their job? It makes no sense.

854
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:30,089
We'll have to operate
on Professor Park's VIP patients,

855
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:33,635
so you'll have to spend more time
in the OR than the ER.

856
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:37,347
We're already short-staffed,
and we only have two ORs.

857
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:40,767
So strategically speaking, we should
accept less trauma patients, right?

858
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,393
Look, Mr. Heo.

859
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:47,732
Doldam Hospital never
turns away sick or injured people.

860
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:51,152
And we don't leave them
wandering around the streets.

861
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:54,864
Over the past few years,
this has never happened.

862
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,659
You'll let all our hard work
and reputation

863
00:58:58,284 --> 00:58:59,786
go down the drain in a flash?

864
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:02,539
It's President Park's decision, not mine.

865
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:05,792
You can complain, but nothing
will change in terms of this decision.

866
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:26,980
Oh, I'm sorry.

867
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:29,148
Wait.

868
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:31,401
Are you Park Eun-tak?

869
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:35,488
Do I know you?

870
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:01,931
Did the surgery go well?

871
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,017
Yes. How has your day been?

872
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:07,020
Not bad. I stopped by the ER and...

873
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:09,439
Hey, what's that?

874
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:12,775
A recording of the patient's surgery.

875
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:15,445
He had a cholecystectomy elsewhere.

876
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:18,698
I think they cut his bile duct by mistake,
so I want to check with the patient.

877
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:22,493
Gosh, another surgeon buried his mistake.

878
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:25,955
How shameless and immoral.

879
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:27,707
But we don't know for certain yet.

880
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:31,044
All right, good luck. I'm rooting for you.

881
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:48,102
What is wrong with me?

882
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:50,938
"I'm rooting for you"? What the heck?

883
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:53,650
And what's with these fists?

884
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:56,027
Gosh, I'm mortified.

885
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:01,574
Hi, Mom.

886
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:09,290
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

887
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,712
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

888
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:26,724
What's going on, sir?

889
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,940
I asked his family
without giving away any information.

890
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:36,526
They know nothing about his bile duct.

891
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:40,863
Why don't we...

892
01:01:43,908 --> 01:01:45,451
go somewhere quiet and talk?

893
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:59,215
Nurse Joo. About my patient, Yoo In-seok.

894
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:00,883
He needs physiotherapy...

895
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:06,514
Tell him that he has to leave
if he won't receive it.

896
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:07,974
Okay, got it.

897
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:20,820
This is Doldam Hospital's ER.

898
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:24,115
We can't accept new patients now. Sorry.

899
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:34,459
There you are.

900
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,092
What do you want?

901
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:46,429
You egged Doctor Seo on...

902
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:49,140
and created a big mess.

903
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:53,853
What were you going to do with that?

904
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,774
I wanted to inform the patient.

905
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,609
There were no adverse effects,
why would you?

906
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:02,403
His doctor cut his bile duct by mistake.

907
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:05,198
And the patient has no idea?

908
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,074
It was tied back seamlessly,

909
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:08,993
and it won't affect his life.

910
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:15,833
Let's say you hit someone with your car.

911
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,669
Even if he's alive and well...

912
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:23,257
it doesn't mean that you can
walk away without even apologizing.

913
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:24,926
But stirring things up

914
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:27,887
might hurt an innocent doctor.

915
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,473
Then the doctor should've told him
instead of hiding it from him.

916
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:34,435
He should've admitted to his mistake
and taken responsibility.

917
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:35,520
Taken responsibility? How?

918
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:39,273
Being humiliated in court over and over

919
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:42,819
to the point where he's mentally
and physically distraught?

920
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:44,237
Then he'll lose a ton of money...

921
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:49,200
and won't even be able to face patients.

922
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:50,493
Is that what you mean?

923
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:55,832
Doctors, who should be at hospitals,
are dragged to court.

924
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:58,751
Instead of writing
their medical research papers,

925
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,628
they spend time reading up on the law.

926
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:01,587
Is that...?

927
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:07,426
Do you think that makes them
responsible doctors?

928
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:09,345
So, what then?

929
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:12,014
You want me to bury it?

930
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:14,559
I already found out who operated on him.

931
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:18,855
I will contact them myself and warn them.

932
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:23,234
What matters is
the doctor's remorse anyway.

933
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:25,570
This way, we can help them save face.

934
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:29,198
I think we should deal with this in a way

935
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:32,243
that can protect the authority of doctors.

936
01:04:32,326 --> 01:04:34,537
So we should cover up for each other

937
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:38,374
and hide the truth to save our authority?

938
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:41,460
Is that what you mean?

939
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:46,507
We live in a world
where people are waiting

940
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,551
to criticize and attack us.

941
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:53,890
We need to build a fence
that can at least protect us.

942
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:56,017
And getting rid of rebels like me...

943
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:57,935
is part of that?

944
01:04:58,019 --> 01:05:00,521
I'm sure you already know...

945
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:02,982
what it feels like to be kicked out.

946
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:06,569
You must never repeat the same mistake...

947
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:09,071
Doctor Seo.

948
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:16,329
Hand it over.

949
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:26,547
Now.

950
01:05:31,969 --> 01:05:33,512
I said, hand it over.

951
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:38,059
How much should I tell them?

952
01:05:38,142 --> 01:05:42,188
Just tell them the truth
and what you saw.

953
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:45,024
Be consistent, at all times.

954
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:48,361
No.

955
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:51,072
I'll hold on to this.

956
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:54,700
So you know who the surgeon is?

957
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:58,079
Then tell him to come here
and explain what happened to the patient.

958
01:05:58,162 --> 01:06:01,916
The mistake he made
and the fact that he hid it.

959
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:04,293
He should explain it.

960
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:05,920
Hey, Woo-jin.

961
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:08,923
I will wait until tomorrow evening.

962
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,551
I'll do that much, as his fellow doctor.

963
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:19,642
Do you know who the surgeon is?

964
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:23,938
Do I have to know who it is?

965
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:27,608
I think you should know.

966
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:32,405
Who is it?

967
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:38,911
Cha Eun-jae.

968
01:06:54,218 --> 01:06:55,886
My dad is a doctor.

969
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:57,513
Oh, really?

970
01:06:57,596 --> 01:07:00,182
So are my brother and sister.

971
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:34,550
Come in.

972
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:27,019
I bet Park Min-gook is
already sorting out who to get rid of.

973
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,854
I want this person gone.

974
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:31,273
Why keep putting them
up against each other?

975
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:32,900
That sly weasel.

976
01:08:32,983 --> 01:08:35,444
For now, we won't accept trauma patients.

977
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:37,738
Will we have our Fridays back again?

978
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:42,159
Does covering up for fellow doctors
dignify us as doctors?

979
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:43,410
Is that your answer?

980
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:45,621
Why are you just observing the situation?

981
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:48,207
We might actually lose someone this time.

982
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:52,253
Can you folks take responsibility
for Seo Woo-jin's future?

983
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,588
I'm sorry, Woo-jin.
