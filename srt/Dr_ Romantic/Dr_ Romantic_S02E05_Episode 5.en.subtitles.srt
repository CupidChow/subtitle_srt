1
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,295
TREATMENT ROOM 3, TREATMENT ROOM 2

2
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,799
Gosh, Woo-jin.

3
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,801
There you are.

4
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,889
Hey, we looked everywhere for you.

5
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,349
I was wondering where you were.

6
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,727
You were here in the middle of nowhere.

7
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,229
Is this a hospital or what?

8
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:05,648
Let's talk outside.

9
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,234
Stop trying to run away.

10
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,115
Let's talk outside.

11
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,833
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

12
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:50,819
Goodness.

13
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,243
Ma'am, can you ring me up?

14
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,202
Sure.

15
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,247
You were…

16
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,958
too rash with this case.

17
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,837
I couldn't imagine that your team

18
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,380
would make such a mistake.

19
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,883
But don't be so hard on yourself.

20
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,179
Let's just think of this
as a casual opening game.

21
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,348
I don't understand what you mean.

22
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,353
It's a bird's-eye view of the hospital

23
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,813
we'll build next year.

24
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,860
-It looks more like a luxurious resort.
-Precisely.

25
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:33,778
It sits by the lake,

26
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,030
and we'll have a nine-hole golf course.

27
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,491
A golf course

28
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,577
within the hospital?

29
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,121
There's a stem cell center
to practice functional medicine,

30
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,914
and we'll have spa
and healthcare facilities

31
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,833
along with additional facilities

32
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,294
for people to shop and enjoy themselves.

33
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,381
Also, there's a casino half an hour away.

34
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:58,052
We're providing a place
for healthcare, hobbies, and leisure time.

35
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,723
That's the main purpose of this hospital.

36
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:03,933
I don't…

37
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,144
really understand.

38
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,146
People who are hurt and ill

39
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,773
no longer make any money for us.

40
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,483
People who can splurge

41
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,736
on maintaining their health and youth.

42
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,615
We'll be a hospital that provides
exceptional medical services for them.

43
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,116
This will be

44
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,036
the core business
of the Geosan Foundation.

45
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,334
The era of cost-effectiveness.

46
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,758
This looks like ten million won.

47
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,718
Woo-jin.

48
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,803
Are you kidding me?

49
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,264
When will you pay off your 70 million?

50
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,724
Why is it 70 million won?

51
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,602
I gave you ten million won.
I have 40 million left.

52
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,812
What about the interest over that time?

53
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,357
The amount of money

54
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,276
I have given you to this day is

55
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,697
-probably twice as much as the principal.
-Exactly.

56
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,492
Don't try to work so hard to pay it off.

57
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,120
Just make up your mind

58
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,206
and do as we say.

59
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,416
Then we'll deem what you'll do

60
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,501
as 70 million won.

61
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,502
See that?

62
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,337
Isn't that totally cost-effective?

63
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,172
This is a world

64
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,841
where every relationship is evaluated

65
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,134
on efficiency and benefits.

66
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,137
It's what this generation wants.

67
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,266
Medical fees are terribly low,

68
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,309
and hospitals are overly competitive.

69
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,271
Even if you save a dying man with CPR,
they sue us instead

70
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,563
for their rib fracture.

71
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:37,068
Responsibilities and duties
degenerate into irrational sacrifice.

72
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:40,738
People easily swear at doctors
and abuse them physically as well.

73
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,992
Why does this world only force the doctors
to be responsible and to sacrifice?

74
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,995
Don't you think this is unfair?

75
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,289
The world has turned into a place

76
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:53,126
where even our common good and kindness
has turned into benefits and numbers.

77
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,085
So…

78
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,380
what are you trying to say?

79
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,799
If the world doesn't respect us,

80
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,634
we'll find a way to survive

81
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,762
with dignity by keeping our value.

82
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,557
So, what now?

83
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,935
What will you do?

84
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,356
Will you do it or not?

85
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,569
Will you be a part of this with me?

86
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:43,676
A LIVING FRIDAY NIGHT

87
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,013
-Hello.
-Hello.

88
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,639
-Good morning.
-Hello.

89
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,683
-Hello.
-Hello.

90
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,060
Hello, Mr. Yeo.

91
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,062
You're here.

92
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,730
Hello.

93
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,023
Mr. Yeo, hello.

94
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,358
Hey, hello.

95
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,359
Hello, Mr. Yeo.

96
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,235
Yes, good morning.

97
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,615
Hey, Dr. Yoon.

98
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,283
Good morning.

99
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,284
Yes, Mr. Yeo.

100
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,746
Good morning.

101
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:12,997
Okay.

102
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,250
Hello, Mr. Yeo.

103
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,210
Good morning.

104
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,378
Yes, good morning.

105
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,274
There's someone he likes.

106
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,985
What? Who?

107
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,654
Nurse Park.

108
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,531
Nurse Park?

109
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:50,118
It's Dr. Woo Yeon-hwa
who worked here as a hospitalist.

110
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,828
He used to like her.

111
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,330
She left a year ago,
but he's still not over her.

112
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,957
Oh, I see.

113
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,126
And?

114
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,254
I just thought you should know.

115
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,010
What was that?

116
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,054
What?

117
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,348
What are you talking about?

118
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,599
A dismissal notice?

119
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,435
DISMISSAL NOTICE: YEO UN-YEONG

120
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,103
DISMISSAL DATE: NOVEMBER 29, 2019

121
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,646
PRESIDENT YEO OF DOLDAM HOSPITAL

122
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,148
FAILED TO TURN THE HOSPITAL

123
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,816
INTO A PROFITABLE ORGANIZATION

124
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:31,659
What?

125
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,202
A dismissal notice?

126
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,120
Quiet.

127
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:38,374
There are people around here.
Let's go to Doctor Kim's office for now.

128
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,753
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

129
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,761
TREATMENT ROOM 4

130
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,473
What's going on?

131
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,061
What are you talking about?
Mr. Yeo has been dismissed?

132
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,646
Who says so?

133
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,191
I got a call from the executive office

134
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,775
of the foundation just now.

135
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,945
It seems like the board
already made the decision last week.

136
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,739
I can't believe

137
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,783
Do Yun-wan is daring to mess with Mr. Yeo.

138
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:13,993
I can't believe it.

139
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,163
But there's something more absurd.

140
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,456
There's more?

141
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,833
There's a rumor that

142
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,460
the new president will be

143
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,128
Professor Park Min-gook.

144
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,297
What?

145
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,356
What?

146
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,608
Professor Park will be the president here?

147
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,859
Apparently so.

148
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,363
Who told you that?
Did Professor Park tell you himself?

149
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,031
The head administrator said so.

150
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:53,407
He said that

151
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,785
the board already made this decision.

152
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:57,703
Goodness.

153
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,455
What does this mean?

154
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:03,334
-Has he been promoted or demoted?
-That's what I've been wondering.

155
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,671
It seems like he was told
to take responsibility for the minister.

156
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,881
But he will become the president.

157
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,551
It doesn't seem like a demotion then.

158
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,469
Then what about us?

159
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,054
Do we have to stay here too?

160
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:20,810
No.

161
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,730
I will not abide
by such an absurd decision.

162
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,190
Ms. Oh, the rules say

163
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,193
we must abide by the board's decision
with the president's appointment.

164
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,029
That's why Do Yun-wan resigned

165
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,072
three years ago.

166
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,242
How is Do Yun-wan the same as Mr. Yeo?

167
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:39,829
He became the main hospital's president
and enjoyed his power to the fullest.

168
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:40,997
But Mr. Yeo is…

169
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:45,126
a president at this desolate hospital
where no one gives him any credit.

170
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,505
He's a guy who went through so much
to be here today.

171
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,509
I thought this run-down hospital

172
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,554
was finally coming together.

173
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,389
How dare they change the president

174
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,474
however they'd like?

175
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,893
And who? Professor Park Min-gook?

176
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:06,814
How can they make such a decision
unless they all have become insane?

177
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,399
Calm down, Ms. Oh.

178
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,943
It hasn't been decided yet.
It's just a rumor at this point.

179
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,445
Rumor, tumor, whatever!

180
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,949
Whatever the case is, I can't accept this.

181
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,910
If we must go on a strike,

182
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:23,080
we should do that
to get across our opinion, Doctor Kim.

183
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,082
Once we do that,

184
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,960
Chairman Do will be the one
who's the most thrilled.

185
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,838
And the one who'll have the toughest time

186
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,632
is Mr. Yeo.

187
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,800
You know that already, Ms. Oh.

188
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,805
I'll head over

189
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,891
and see Mr. Yeo.

190
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,394
Will you protect him?

191
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,690
Will you protect Mr. Yeo?

192
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,569
You will protect him, won't you?

193
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,421
MEDICAL MONITOR

194
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,760
What's the urine discharge?

195
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,054
About 40 ml per hour.

196
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:21,889
I see. That's good.

197
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,934
If he has any pain, give him tramadol
through the IV, and call me.

198
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:25,976
All right.

199
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,855
STAFF ONLY, ICU

200
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,069
What are you doing this weekend?

201
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,114
-Why?
-I'm just curious.

202
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,658
Why are you just curious?

203
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,745
It's our first weekend down here.

204
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,123
I don't know many people around here,

205
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,334
and I'm wondering if there are
any places to hang out around here.

206
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,253
You won't have any time to hang out.

207
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,590
Why not?
Did something happen at the hospital?

208
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,300
Because it's Friday.

209
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,472
Goodness!

210
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,725
All right.

211
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:09,854
What are you doing?

212
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,983
Why are you suddenly stretching?

213
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,651
Because today is Friday.

214
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,157
And so it begins.

215
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,116
What?

216
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,702
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

217
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,458
It has begun.

218
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,341
POLICE

219
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,393
My gosh. Relax!

220
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,896
Relax! Okay? Calm down. All right, relax.

221
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,356
They're Russian performers
who work at the casino.

222
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,108
They were in a minibus,

223
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,735
and their bus turned over as they tried

224
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,320
to avoid hitting a water deer.

225
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:00,863
Five patients have laceration.

226
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,949
Patients who have glass inserted in them
and the one with a hip joint fracture

227
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,117
are in the hybrid room.

228
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,285
What is this?

229
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,788
I thought this was a country hospital.

230
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,247
There's a freeway

231
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,665
and four local roads nearby.

232
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,959
And there's a casino half an hour away.

233
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,337
We expect to see
about 50,000 people every weekend.

234
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,340
-Dr. Bae!
-Coming.

235
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,674
Dr. Seo?

236
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,176
Yes.

237
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,806
Unbelievable.

238
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,602
Oh, I'm a CS.

239
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,774
Where are you hurt?

240
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,739
But…

241
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,659
What is he saying?

242
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,786
Doctor!

243
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,246
-Doctor, please!
-Wait.

244
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,372
Are you a doctor?

245
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,958
-Please help our son. He's ill.
-This way, please.

246
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,520
Do not move.

247
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,814
Whatever. Goodness.

248
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,315
Don't move, okay?

249
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,071
What?

250
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,329
You can't smoke in the hospital.

251
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,167
Let me see.

252
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,669
Just stay with me a little longer.

253
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,257
Goodness, you're holding out so well.

254
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,466
One more.

255
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,678
Will you please lie down?

256
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,222
I'm fine.

257
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,141
You aren't okay.

258
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,601
Will you please sit still?

259
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,185
What's going on?

260
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:58,856
I think his right knee and hip joint
were fractured in the traffic accident.

261
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,900
But he's refusing to be treated.

262
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,159
If he fractured his hip joint,
it must hurt a lot.

263
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,994
But it doesn't look like he's in pain.

264
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,287
Do you want to see this?

265
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,333
Hey.

266
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:22,796
One second.

267
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,134
It's definitely that, right?

268
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,302
I think so.

269
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,763
He has needle marks
and his pupils are dilated.

270
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,307
But if he keeps refusing to be treated,
we can't do anything.

271
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,975
If he's high and hallucinating,

272
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,769
that means he's unfit to make a decision.

273
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,479
It means he doesn't have solid judgment.

274
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:56,997
There you are.

275
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,588
Please don't concern yourself
with the board's decision.

276
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,257
Your decision matters the most to us.

277
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,676
If necessary,

278
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,971
I'll go see Do Yun-wan myself.

279
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,308
There's no need
to make a scene, Doctor Kim.

280
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,979
I'm a guy who must leave soon.

281
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,523
That's why I came back.

282
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,964
I guess it's taking them a while.

283
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,384
It's not an easy subject to discuss.

284
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,016
You should get back to work.

285
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,018
I'll call you when Doctor Kim returns.

286
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,480
Let him go.

287
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,983
Let him go, sir!

288
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,359
Goodness.

289
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,414
What's going on?

290
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,958
His hip joint was fractured in a TA,

291
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,501
but it looks like he's high.

292
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,003
Hey, Dr. Seo, what are you doing?

293
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,546
Hold him back.

294
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,006
It's all right.

295
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,390
Yes, Ms. Oh?

296
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,476
Please look after that patient.

297
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,852
Yes, ma'am.

298
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:42,770
Be careful.

299
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,229
He fractured his hip joint.

300
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:53,947
Okay.

301
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:02,998
Ativan, please.

302
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:06,460
Let's get the OP lab done first.
Put him on one liter of normal saline.

303
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,754
When he goes for the OP lab,
we'll screen him for drugs.

304
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:09,880
Yes, sir.

305
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,048
Patient incoming!

306
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,343
It looks like drug poisoning.

307
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,470
The kids were reported as unconscious.

308
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,765
When we got there, one of them had died
already, while the other is in P status.

309
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,517
Her BP is 70 over 40, heart rate, 30.

310
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,976
Get her to the hybrid room.

311
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,814
Dr. Jeong? A potential drug poisoning.

312
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:27,731
This way.

313
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,316
We're almost done here,

314
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,943
-so please give them a hand.
-Got it.

315
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,444
-We'll move her.
-Okay.

316
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,238
-One, two, three.
-Three.

317
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,324
What's her condition?

318
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,034
The initial reporter is her mom.

319
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,577
She couldn't get ahold of their dad,

320
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,620
and the door was locked.

321
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,123
When she went in with the police,
the kids were unconscious,

322
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,583
and she found a number
of medicine bottles in the bin.

323
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,293
We found their dad
in the apartment garden.

324
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,003
He had fallen down from above.

325
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,258
Is this a family suicide case?

326
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,676
It seems so.

327
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,428
This is the bottle we found at the scene.

328
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,559
The boy who looked like her brother
already had livor mortis,

329
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,270
so we handed him to the police
without attempting CPR.

330
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,272
Let's begin with intubation.

331
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,254
She's at 70 over 40,

332
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,131
heart rate between 30 to 35.

333
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,803
Woo-jin!

334
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,181
Woo-jin!

335
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,643
Woo-jin.

336
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,729
Woo-jin!

337
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,356
What's going on?

338
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,025
Woo-jin…

339
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,527
Wake up, Woo-jin.

340
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,696
Goodness, Woo-jin.

341
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,449
Please save him.

342
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,909
Ma'am, please wait outside.

343
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,577
No, Woo-jin!

344
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,078
-Ma'am, please.
-Woo-jin!

345
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,455
Doctor, please.

346
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,292
Dr. Seo!

347
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,377
Dr. Seo!

348
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,799
Doctor, is Soo-jin all right?

349
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,593
Ma'am, please.

350
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:20,844
-Soo-jin…
-Wait outside.

351
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,804
-Ma'am. Wait outside.
-Soo-jin!

352
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,765
Wake up! It's me, Mom!

353
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,767
Soo-jin!

354
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,561
It's Mom, Soo-jin!

355
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,063
-Soo-jin!
-Ma'am.

356
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,482
-Soo-jin, it's Mom!
-Calm down.

357
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,277
If the peripheral line is on,
give the ampoule from the side.

358
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,987
We'll put in dopamine with this line.

359
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,822
Mix 500 ml with D5W,

360
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,741
and put her on 10 ml per hour.

361
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,660
One second.

362
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,082
Oh, no.

363
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,547
Soo-jin… Oh, no.

364
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,300
What am I going to do?

365
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:04,263
Her father who fell down will be here too.

366
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,061
Nurse Park.

367
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,522
Please check the prescription on this.

368
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,523
Yes, ma'am.

369
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,706
A water deer suddenly jumped out.

370
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,124
What? A water deer?

371
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,918
Yes, you know how that road is.

372
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,086
You know that

373
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,005
the corner turns like this.

374
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,131
-Yes.
-Right.

375
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:40,632
And that's where…

376
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,968
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

377
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,105
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

378
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,482
I heard a funny rumor.

379
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,568
I heard you plan on coming to Doldam.

380
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,446
Gosh, word gets around quickly.

381
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,033
I received the offer,
but I haven't made a decision yet.

382
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,369
If you come to this humble place,

383
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,537
we'll be grateful.

384
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:13,332
But I'm not sure if you'll be okay.

385
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,376
It doesn't look like it,

386
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:21,423
but this is actually a trauma center.

387
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,885
Over 80 to 90% of our patients

388
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,220
are either from TA
or industrial accidents.

389
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,930
They're laborers who work

390
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,515
at apartment construction sites

391
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:34,269
and foreign workers who work at factories.

392
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,021
On top of that, there are thugs

393
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,814
who get beaten up

394
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,941
after they get drunk,

395
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,860
et cetera.

396
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,237
So,

397
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,156
can you deal with them?

398
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:48,700
Are you…

399
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:50,702
trying to scare me right now?

400
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,832
Are you scared, Dr. Park?

401
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,213
Please excuse me. I'm busy.

402
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,467
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

403
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,677
-Hey.
-Come here.

404
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:17,938
Today is Friday,

405
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:19,648
of all days.

406
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,234
We don't have enough facilities or staff,

407
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:25,320
but we get a huge number of patients.

408
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,905
Every Friday

409
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,907
is just a huge chaos.

410
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,869
Someone who doesn't have enough energy
or willpower can't last here.

411
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:36,748
Can you really

412
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,168
be in charge of a hospital like this?

413
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:50,512
What happened?

414
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,055
She's a 15-year-old girl

415
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,390
suffering from drug poisoning.

416
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:54,975
It seems like her father tried

417
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,893
to commit suicide with his two children.

418
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,353
Did you check the drug?

419
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,813
I just checked.

420
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:00,939
It's CCB.

421
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,232
He got a month's prescription

422
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,650
for nifedipine two weeks ago.

423
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,485
Her vitals are 80 over 40, 40 BPM.

424
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,863
Dr. Jeong, let's put her on the L-tube

425
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,906
-and feed her charcoal first.
-Yes, sir.

426
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,325
-Give me the stethoscope.
-Sure.

427
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,084
-What about the BST?
-She's at 140.

428
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,587
Give her 50 units of RI through her side.

429
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,380
Fifty units?

430
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,800
Yes. Mix 100 ml of NS with 500 units,

431
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,011
and give her 10 ml for the first hour,

432
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,429
then drop it to 5 ml after that.

433
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,556
Can we really give her that much insulin?

434
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,475
It's a high-dose insulin therapy

435
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,518
used for CCB overdose.

436
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,145
Put her on the IV,

437
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,814
and check her BST every 20 minutes.

438
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,774
Yes, sir.

439
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,777
Did you talk to Mr. Yeo?

440
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,408
Let's talk later.

441
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,328
Patient incoming!

442
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,165
You jerk!

443
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,168
You jerk.

444
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,421
You horrible jerk!
How can you call yourself human?

445
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,256
No matter how tough life is,

446
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,382
how can you kill our kids?

447
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,468
-Please don't do this.
-Calm down.

448
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,887
You! How can you call yourself human?

449
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,015
What did our kids do wrong?
How will you save Seung-chan?

450
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,226
You jerk!

451
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,727
-Hold her back.
-Yes.

452
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,145
What happened?

453
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,438
He fell from the fifth floor.

454
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,107
He got caught in a tree
and now has severe abdominal pain.

455
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,194
-Let's get him into the hybrid room.
-Okay.

456
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:31,947
Just leave him to die.

457
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,866
He jumped off to kill himself.

458
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,159
-Just let him die.
-Calm down.

459
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,744
-Save my daughter first!
-Nurse Park.

460
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:38,745
Nurse Park!

461
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,163
-Hold her.
-Save my daughter first.

462
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,290
-Please calm down.
-Seung-chan!

463
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:46,127
Soo-jin! I'm right here!

464
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,130
Seung-chan! Soo-jin!

465
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,347
He's been like that

466
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,057
for a little while.

467
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,229
Doctor Kim!

468
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,689
We have a five-year-old boy.

469
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,316
He had an entire bottle of ibuprofen
in a day.

470
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,360
He's unconscious,
and his vitals don't look great.

471
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:15,615
Seo Woo-jin.

472
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,577
Seo Woo-jin.

473
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:22,956
Look after the fallen patient in there.

474
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,332
I'll be right back.

475
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:28,962
Dr. Seo?

476
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,427
Darn it.

477
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,933
He caught a cold, had a high fever,
and he vomited too.

478
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,311
She fed him a spoonful
whenever he said he was in pain

479
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,520
without checking the time.

480
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,439
Let's run the ABGA test

481
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,357
and put him on an admission panel

482
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,192
including the electro.

483
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,319
Yes, sir.

484
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,322
-Excuse me, doctor.
-Yes?

485
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,324
What will happen to our son?

486
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:00,535
When it comes to cold medicine

487
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,287
that contains ibuprofen,

488
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:06,666
it may be fatal for a five-year-old
if you do not stick to the stated dosage.

489
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,127
-What?
-And because of his high fever,

490
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,588
his organs aren't functioning well.

491
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,881
Because of the medicine,

492
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,884
his liver and kidneys
may not function well either.

493
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,344
And there is a possibility

494
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,971
of internal bleeding in his stomach.

495
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,557
Wait, so are you saying

496
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,477
this stupid woman just killed our son?

497
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,271
Sir, your son isn't dead.

498
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,191
Goodness, you ignorant idiot!

499
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,693
-Let her go!
-You witch.

500
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,278
Hey, you…

501
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,364
You couldn't even look after a kid?

502
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,199
How could you do this to him?

503
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,700
-Sir, please. Sir?
-You idiot!

504
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,035
You stupid idiot!

505
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,119
Will you please stop?

506
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,497
Goodness, you!

507
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,831
I'll get you!

508
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,673
Hey.

509
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,592
-That wench…
-Gosh.

510
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,678
-Get him out of the ER.
-You idiot!

511
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:00,887
Darn it!

512
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,639
And do not let him back in

513
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,641
until I tell you to do so.

514
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,102
What a jerk.

515
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:08,687
Eun-jae.

516
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,230
Are you okay?

517
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,024
I'm all right, Doctor Kim.

518
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,068
Okay.

519
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:19,531
Are you okay?

520
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,617
Goodness, ma'am.

521
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:23,618
Ma'am?

522
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,541
-Goodness.
-My son…

523
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,711
Doctor Kim.

524
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,671
You need to come right now.

525
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,808
What are you doing?
Aren't you going to treat him?

526
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,228
Dr. Seo?

527
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,489
Does this hurt?

528
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:05,744
What about here?

529
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:11,541
That hurts. Please be gentle.

530
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:14,043
You were trying to die.
Why are you complaining about the pain?

531
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,128
Dr. Seo.

532
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,129
You need to see…

533
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,300
what you have done right now.

534
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,189
One second.

535
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,196
What's with you, Dr. Seo?

536
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,655
Why aren't you treating him?

537
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,990
He wanted to die,

538
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,201
so I see no reason to save him.

539
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,119
What are you talking about?

540
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:52,081
Put him on four liters of nasal oxygen,
one liter on each side,

541
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,458
and give him the central line.

542
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,627
-Warm saline, correct?
-Yes, warm saline.

543
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,922
-Hurry up and grab the FAST.
-No.

544
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,715
What's with you, Dr. Seo?

545
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,008
I'm sorry, but I cannot

546
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,135
treat this patient.

547
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,094
Hey!

548
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,391
Why can't you treat him?

549
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,268
Are you telling him to die?

550
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,479
He already decided to kill himself.

551
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,273
What?

552
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,658
What did you just say?

553
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,915
Sir!

554
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,959
He's unconscious.

555
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,257
He's in PEA arrest.

556
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,592
Inject 1 ml of epinephrine
every three minutes.

557
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,723
Bring the FAST!

558
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:01,609
I can't breathe.

559
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,153
Help me.

560
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:27,594
Hey.

561
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,053
Dr. Seo!

562
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:30,638
Where are you going?

563
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:46,571
Charge to 200 joules.

564
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:50,867
Shock.

565
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,212
Mom…

566
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,308
I'll check his vitals.

567
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,354
His pulse is back.

568
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,358
His BP is 80 over 40.
The heart rate is 100 BPM.

569
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,026
Good.

570
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,364
Time and date of death,

571
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:30,990
4th November,

572
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,742
11:14 a.m.

573
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,078
Mom…

574
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:11,447
What are you doing here?
I told you not to come to the hospital.

575
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,492
I need an answer to stop coming here.

576
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,161
Stop dragging this out
and make your decision.

577
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,164
It's not like I told you to kill a man.

578
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,332
What are you worried about?

579
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,126
What if my career as a doctor ends

580
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,128
after I do as you say?

581
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,422
Will you take responsibility?

582
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,716
Hey, that's why it's for 70 million won.

583
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,426
You need to be willing to take

584
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,219
such a risk for 70 million won.

585
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,055
Let's do it tonight.

586
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,348
Come out by 10:00 p.m.

587
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:39,642
All right?

588
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,728
Dr. Seo!

589
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,538
Who was that?

590
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:01,748
None of your business.

591
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,207
How do you know him?

592
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,584
Why do you want to know?

593
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,086
He didn't look like a gangster,

594
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,298
but he looked like a good-for-nothing thug
sitting between a bully and a mugger.

595
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,466
That's enough.

596
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,053
Will you please leave me alone?

597
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,429
I want to be alone.

598
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:20,975
Fine, okay.

599
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,102
I won't mind it. It's your business.

600
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,020
But…

601
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,314
But still,

602
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,566
you can't run out like this, okay?

603
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,193
The ER is in chaos.

604
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,737
I'm not an EM board.
I don't have to be in the ER anyway.

605
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,239
Do you think I'm there treating cuts
because I'm an EM board?

606
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,532
Just get out of there then!

607
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,909
How can I do that?

608
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,453
This tiny hospital
is flooded with patients!

609
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,413
Since when were you worried about Doldam?

610
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,373
I'm not worried about the hospital.

611
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,542
Then is this your idea
of making up for your inability

612
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:47,960
to do anything in the OR?

613
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,802
Fine, you're right.

614
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,639
If I can't do anything in the OR,
I should do that much

615
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,891
to earn my keep
without becoming a nuisance.

616
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,644
You know, Woo-jin,

617
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:05,686
I'm unable to do it,

618
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,896
but you refused to do it.

619
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,528
As a doctor, what do you think is worse?

620
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:32,547
That narrow-minded jerk!

621
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,841
It's impossible to like him.

622
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,092
He's so far-fetched.

623
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,469
He's an alien from a faraway universe.

624
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,804
From another dimension.

625
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,183
Gosh, you idiot.

626
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:50,857
My goodness.

627
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,153
Both patients are unstable.

628
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,445
Which one should we do first?

629
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:59,365
Bowel perforation and hemoperitoneum…

630
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,286
He went into PEA from his BP dropping,

631
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,371
and now, he needs surgery immediately.

632
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:07,081
As for the patient with the fractured hip,

633
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,958
I can't feel his dorsalis pedis artery.

634
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:11,419
-I did a lower extremity angiogram.
-Yes.

635
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:14,380
His popliteal artery had a dissection,
which resulted in occlusion.

636
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:18,134
If we don't perform surgery soon,
we might need to amputate his leg.

637
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,761
Femur neck fracture…

638
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,264
Since he's still young,

639
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,474
a femur neck fracture is bad news.

640
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:26,809
What should we do?

641
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,269
They both need surgery immediately.

642
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,271
We have to do
the life-threatening case first.

643
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,355
At worst,

644
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,191
the femur neck patient will lose one leg,

645
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,692
but it won't kill him now.

646
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,629
-Dr. Jeong.
-Yes, sir?

647
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,422
Please continue to check up on the girl.

648
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,049
-And, Dr. Yoon…
-Yes?

649
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,218
Please look after the ibuprofen child.

650
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,887
-Yes, sir.
-How should we set the operating rooms?

651
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,264
The bowel perforation patient in OR one,

652
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,225
and the femur neck patient in OR two.

653
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,936
-Do you plan to operate on both?
-Once I finish

654
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,188
the right popliteal artery bypass,

655
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,773
you can take over, Dr. Bae.

656
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,690
Yes, sir.

657
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,859
Nurse Park, please tell Dr. Seo

658
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,152
to come to the front of OR one.

659
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,195
Yes, sir.

660
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,989
Okay. Let's move the patients first.

661
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,658
Okay. Let's go, Dr. Jeong!

662
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,535
Please contact Dr. Yang at Jungil.

663
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,037
Okay, will do.

664
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,173
He plans to open up both operating rooms.

665
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,344
It looks like he'll simultaneously operate

666
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,012
on both the fall
and fracture patients.

667
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,525
Yes, come in.

668
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,708
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

669
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,713
Please drink this and calm yourself.

670
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,094
Wait a second.

671
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,269
By any chance, did your husband do this?

672
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:42,069
Hey.

673
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,613
You don't deserve to be sitting there

674
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,574
after what you've done to our child.

675
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,118
Do you even have a conscience? Geez!

676
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,077
Please stop.

677
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,705
Do you want to get kicked out of here?

678
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,041
Gosh.

679
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,341
Wait, sir.

680
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,094
Please keep a close eye on them.

681
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,013
It might be a case of domestic violence.

682
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,556
Okay, understood.

683
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:15,686
Hey.

684
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,482
If something happens to our child,

685
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:22,026
I'll kill you. Darn it.

686
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:23,652
Okay?

687
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,332
Dr. Seo,

688
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,501
Doctor Kim asked you to come to OR one.

689
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,294
It's the fall patient who just came.

690
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,213
He has bowel perforation
and hemoperitoneum.

691
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,839
I said, I won't see him.

692
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:47,176
He even went into cardiac arrest,
so we can't delay the surgery anymore.

693
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:50,971
I didn't become a doctor
to save someone like that.

694
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,891
That's not for you to decide.

695
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,853
Patients can choose their doctors,

696
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,439
but doctors can't choose their patients.

697
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,359
No matter who they are,

698
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:06,070
what life they've lived,
or what wrongs they've committed,

699
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,488
once they came to us as patients,

700
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,198
we can't discriminate at all.

701
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,325
That's what I learned.

702
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,539
Are you trying to educate me?

703
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:17,456
No.

704
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,167
I want you to feel ashamed.

705
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,795
That's why I'm saying this.

706
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,441
-Did you call me, sir?
-Yes.

707
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,819
Have you performed an angiorrhaphy before?

708
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,696
No, I've only assisted.

709
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:49,864
Come here.

710
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,578
Along with the right femur neck fracture,
there's also a knee joint ligament injury.

711
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:58,414
Before the OS surgery,

712
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:01,125
I'll do a right popliteal artery bypass.

713
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,377
Can you assist?

714
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,175
But you told me not to come into the OR.

715
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,309
What is that?

716
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,688
This medicine will get rid of your nausea.

717
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:26,233
It's a special medicine I made,

718
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,944
so there are no big side effects
and it won't make you drowsy.

719
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,365
Of course, I want to give you more time,

720
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,201
but this is an emergency situation.

721
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,203
As soon as you're ready,

722
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,996
come to the front of OR two.

723
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:02,895
It would've been better

724
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,355
if he had died.

725
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,609
That would've been easier.

726
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,071
How will…

727
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:16,909
that little one live on his own
from now on?

728
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,037
It would've been better

729
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,581
if they had all died together.

730
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,121
Dr. Yang is off?

731
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:06,500
Dr. Yang is off today and tomorrow.
He won't pick up his phone either.

732
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:09,461
We don't have a choice.

733
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,879
We have to postpone one of them.

734
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,339
I'll inform Doctor Kim.

735
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:13,632
Wait a second.

736
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,807
What did you just say?

737
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,310
Please prepare for surgery.

738
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:25,853
Do you know me?

739
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,939
You're an anesthesiologist from Geosan.

740
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:32,484
Geez. That's not what I asked.

741
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,946
I'm wondering why you asked me to do that.

742
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,241
We suddenly received two patients

743
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:40,576
who need emergency surgery.

744
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,494
Our usual anesthesiologist

745
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:43,996
is off today, unfortunately.

746
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:46,749
It's out of the blue,
but it's an urgent situation.

747
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:47,708
Please help us.

748
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,376
I don't think I can.

749
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:53,088
Their lives will be at risk
if they're not operated on immediately.

750
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,673
That's exactly why.

751
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:57,384
I don't want to be liable for such risks.

752
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,137
On top of that,

753
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,805
I don't even work at this hospital.

754
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:06,393
Are you really…

755
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:08,854
not going to help?

756
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:13,192
I'm sorry, but I'm not a philanthropist.

757
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:15,402
I didn't come here to help someone.

758
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:17,613
Besides,

759
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:20,699
you shouldn't ask strangers for favors.

760
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,534
I feel a bit uncomfortable.

761
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:35,673
Professor Sim.

762
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,716
What brings you here, Dr. Yang?

763
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,426
Professor Park is looking for you.

764
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:43,764
I'm sorry.

765
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,643
We can't operate simultaneously, sir.

766
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,771
We should decide which one

767
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,022
we will perform first.

768
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:03,951
What about Dr. Seo?

769
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:05,661
He's not here yet.

770
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,040
What about Dr. Cha?

771
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,751
She's also not here yet.

772
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,411
We can't delay any longer.

773
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:49,913
Let's operate on the bowel perforation.

774
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,082
Okay.

775
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,543
Let's do that, Dr. Nam.

776
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:56,128
Then I'll get ready.

777
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,257
Doctor Kim.

778
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,138
I heard from Professor Sim…

779
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,433
that you need an anesthesiologist.

780
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:16,774
Professor Sim.

781
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,194
Let me see the patient first.

782
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:23,363
Please come this way.

783
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:27,326
RESTRICTED AREA: OPERATING ROOM

784
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:32,039
I heard that you don't believe…

785
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,708
in unrewarded acts of kindness.

786
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,835
Rather than an act of kindness,

787
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,297
I'd call it an obligation.

788
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,847
This is not an easy place, Professor Park.

789
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,434
Our patients are much more diverse,

790
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:53,727
and the cases we see

791
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:57,564
are much more difficult
than you could imagine.

792
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,108
Your conceited attitude

793
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,944
and sense of superiority

794
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:05,030
won't work for life-or-death matters.

795
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:07,574
Are you

796
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,451
giving me advice?

797
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:12,704
Unless you're sincere,

798
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:15,374
it'll be hard for you to hold out.

799
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,169
Well, it doesn't matter.

800
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,380
What I'm interested in

801
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:22,631
is not Doldam Hospital.

802
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:24,466
It's Doctor Kim.

803
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:30,264
He makes me want to challenge him.

804
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:35,185
So…

805
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,273
will you be able to handle Doctor Kim?

806
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:44,403
Will you really be able to handle it?

807
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:46,321
Bu Yong-ju might be…

808
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:50,158
harder to handle than Doldam Hospital.

809
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:52,119
So,

810
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:53,912
can you deal with them?

811
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,084
I want to…

812
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:01,837
handle it.

813
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,803
Stop with the bravado

814
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,306
and just get out of here, okay?

815
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:16,518
I don't know what Do Yun-wan offered,

816
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:19,813
but it's just an inedible dog chew toy.

817
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,774
So stop panting
and drooling all over the place.

818
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,114
Hello, Chairman Do.

819
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,116
It's Park Min-gook.

820
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:36,413
About the president position at Doldam…

821
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,502
I'll accept your offer.

822
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:48,884
Yes.

823
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:50,636
Yes, understood.

824
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:54,306
RESTRICTED AREA: OPERATING ROOM

825
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,185
Doctor Kim.

826
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:35,138
What will happen to Mr. Yeo?

827
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,683
Will he be dismissed like this?

828
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,978
What about Dr. Seo and Dr. Cha?

829
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:43,105
I'll call Dr. Seo again.

830
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:44,773
I'll call Dr. Cha too.

831
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:45,774
No, don't.

832
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,902
It's better not to push them too much.

833
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,529
Dr. Bae and I can operate

834
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:53,073
on the femur neck patient together…

835
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,116
I'm here!

836
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,332
I'm here, Doctor Kim.

837
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,585
The patient is under anesthesia.

838
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,546
Anesthesia has started.

839
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,677
Get ready for the femur neck patient now.

840
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,512
-Sure, will do.
-Will do.

841
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:19,349
Doctor Kim.

842
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,392
Ms. Oh.

843
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:24,604
Let's only think about our tasks for now.

844
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,524
The bowel perforation
and femur neck patients.

845
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:29,609
Let's only think of these two patients.

846
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,320
Yes, sir.

847
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,490
Dr. Seo is not picking up the phone.

848
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,078
RESTRICTED AREA: OPERATING ROOM

849
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,133
I'm not here to save the man in the OR.

850
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:55,469
To me, he's still…

851
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:58,847
someone that I don't want to treat.

852
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:00,557
But?

853
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:03,185
Someone said to me

854
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,229
that choosing not to treat
when you're able to

855
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:08,273
is a terrible thing to do as a doctor.

856
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,527
That it's something to be ashamed of.

857
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,324
And if I want to pay back what I owe you,

858
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,867
I have to work hard anyway.

859
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:20,494
That's why I came.

860
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,496
Yes, you need to work hard.

861
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,873
Control the bleeding for now.

862
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,542
As soon I'm done
with the popliteal artery,

863
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:28,877
I'll be right over.

864
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,547
Please don't let the patient die.

865
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,325
Are you feeling okay, Eun-jae?

866
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:04,287
You're talking casually to me now.

867
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:07,374
I finally remembered

868
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:08,375
who you are.

869
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:11,503
Smart Smurf with the delicate phalanx.

870
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,505
Cha Eun-jae. Freshman class of 2007.

871
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:16,258
Wow, you finally remembered.

872
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:18,718
Will you be okay

873
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,303
with today's surgery?

874
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,556
I hope so.

875
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:26,101
I even took the medicine
that I got from Doctor Kim.

876
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,436
That medicine should work well.

877
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:31,439
I know because I've taken it before.

878
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:33,692
You have, Moon-jung?

879
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,036
Relax.

880
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:47,122
It'll be fine.

881
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,042
Thank you, Moon-jung.

882
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,008
May I start the operation?

883
00:52:58,091 --> 00:53:01,178
His vitals are a bit unstable since
he had gone into cardiac arrest already.

884
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:04,514
I'll keep them as stable as possible,
so go ahead.

885
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:10,520
Scalpel, please.

886
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:20,030
The patient has
a right femur neck fracture

887
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:22,616
and a knee joint ligament injury.

888
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:26,536
I'll do the right popliteal artery bypass.

889
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,872
I marked the great saphenous vein.

890
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:30,624
The patient's vitals are fine.

891
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:31,958
Thank you, Dr. Sim.

892
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:34,586
Dr. Cha.

893
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:36,630
How about your vitals?

894
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,591
The heart rate is rising a bit,

895
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:41,509
but it's in the normal range so far.

896
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:47,307
Let's collect the graft first. Scalpel.

897
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:48,683
GRAFT: A PIECE OF HEALTHY SKIN

898
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,243
Block it.

899
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,512
Eun-jae!

900
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:32,560
Do you want me to do this?

901
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:35,647
I'll do it.

902
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:51,246
More.

903
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:52,163
That's good.

904
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,796
PRESIDENT YEO UN-YEONG

905
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,446
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

906
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:13,703
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

907
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:39,604
Hello.

908
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:41,356
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

909
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:44,109
Hello.

910
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:46,319
PRESIDENT YEO UN-YEONG

911
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,550
WE HOPE TO SEE YOU HEALTHY

912
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,931
By the way, Nurse Joo…

913
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:19,811
-Pardon?
-What you said about Nurse Park earlier…

914
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:21,896
Why did you say that out of the blue?

915
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,690
Gosh, well…

916
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,401
You make it too obvious

917
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,945
that you like Nurse Park.

918
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:29,863
Pardon?

919
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:33,575
When did I act like I like Nurse Park?

920
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:36,619
I also saw the two of you talking alone.

921
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:41,916
Gosh, is that why you misunderstood?

922
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:44,419
No way. That was because

923
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:46,754
I was talking to him about President Yeo.

924
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,339
About President Yeo?

925
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,340
Yes.

926
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:50,675
Well, actually,

927
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:52,802
when I was examining him, his lungs--

928
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:53,970
What about his lungs?

929
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:59,017
When you examined him, did you hear

930
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,727
a sound from President Yeo's lungs?

931
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:03,396
No, I didn't hear anything.

932
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,191
Gosh, I misspoke.

933
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:07,817
Right.

934
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:11,029
Please forget everything I just said.

935
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:12,447
Well, then…

936
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:14,824
What was that?

937
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:19,329
VISITING HOUR INFORMATION

938
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:24,501
Seriously.

939
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,170
Please answer quickly.

940
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:32,634
I'll do the anastomosis now. Scalpel.

941
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:38,389
Potts scissors.

942
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,521
Suture.

943
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:48,733
Doctor Kim, it's the emergency room.

944
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:50,401
A patient with a gunshot wound is coming.

945
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:54,447
A gunshot wound?

946
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,037
-Cut.
-Cut.

947
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:05,250
Yes, there was a gang fight at the casino,

948
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,961
and the accident happened
while the police were making arrests.

949
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,338
GS should examine the gunshot wound.

950
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:11,256
What should we do?

951
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:13,007
Gosh, what should we do?

952
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:14,425
Both Doctor Kim and Dr. Seo

953
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:15,635
just got started.

954
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:17,220
Vitals, please.

955
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:19,889
They're okay so far.

956
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,567
In everything,

957
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,610
if there's a beginning,

958
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,279
then there's also an end.

959
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:48,960
It's not so bad…

960
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:53,089
to leave like this.

961
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:05,101
To a man like me who doesn't have family,
the past ten years at Doldam…

962
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:09,522
are quite precious,

963
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,441
and they fill me with gratitude.

964
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:17,780
I'll remove the clamp now.

965
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,786
Nothing seems to be leaking.

966
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:27,957
Well, Dr. Bae,

967
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:29,250
let's wrap up.

968
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:31,669
The patient with the gunshot wound
is coming,

969
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,087
so we'll need an operating room.

970
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:34,172
Yes, sir.

971
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,132
-We'll wrap up here for now,
-Okay.

972
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:38,301
move him to the ICU,
and reschedule the surgery.

973
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:41,804
Good job, everyone.

974
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:44,515
Dr. Cha.

975
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:48,186
Good job.

976
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:55,026
Shall we wrap up now?

977
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:57,487
Yes, doctor.

978
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:58,946
Let's wrap up.

979
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:01,282
Irrigation, please.

980
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:07,330
In going through a life-long journey,

981
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:10,792
there are moments
when you can pause briefly,

982
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,711
but there are no moments you can stop.

983
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:17,715
So, let's not be too sad.

984
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,511
Mom, it's me.

985
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:25,765
I couldn't answer since I was operating.

986
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:28,643
What?

987
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:31,396
Because I'm happy.

988
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:35,149
The surgery went so well.

989
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:38,653
So I'm so happy.

990
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:43,282
Yes, I did it.

991
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:49,080
Yes, I got lots of compliments…

992
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:52,625
because it was a very difficult surgery.

993
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:54,377
Yes.

994
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:57,046
The places you leave behind

995
01:01:57,130 --> 01:02:00,341
are filled with new things again.

996
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,429
And that's a very natural thing.

997
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,186
Pads, please.

998
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:16,441
Hemostat.

999
01:02:17,608 --> 01:02:18,526
Scalpel, please.

1000
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:25,032
I wanted to hold each of your hands

1001
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:27,952
as I said goodbye.

1002
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:31,622
But that might make me sad as I leave,

1003
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:33,166
so I'll just leave.

1004
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:35,501
I don't see any other bleeding.

1005
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:38,838
I'll check the part with perforation
and proceed with resection.

1006
01:03:12,997 --> 01:03:13,998
Are you leaving now?

1007
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:16,000
Well…

1008
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:19,128
I should go, of course.

1009
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,132
By the way…

1010
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:26,844
you know today's Friday, right?

1011
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:45,738
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

1012
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:48,032
Where is he?

1013
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:50,117
-Over there.
-He's over there!

1014
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:52,912
-Gosh.
-Boss.

1015
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,372
-This way.
-Where?

1016
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:55,748
Where is he?

1017
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:57,792
-Faster.
-Hurry.

1018
01:03:57,875 --> 01:03:59,794
-Come on.
-Faster.

1019
01:03:59,877 --> 01:04:02,588
-Hurry.
-Over there.

1020
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:05,383
-Hurry.
-Faster.

1021
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:07,510
-Get out of my way!
-Darn it.

1022
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:08,886
-Over there.
-Let's go!

1023
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:11,180
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

1024
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:13,266
-Boss!
-Boss!

1025
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:15,351
-Where is he?
-Boss!

1026
01:04:15,434 --> 01:04:17,645
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

1027
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,903
-Let's go that way!
-Come on.

1028
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:28,489
-Come on.
-Boss!

1029
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:29,782
-Boss!
-Where is he?

1030
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,784
-Boss!
-Where are you?

1031
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:34,370
-Where is he?
-Where are you?

1032
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:51,429
Dr. Yoon!

1033
01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:52,638
Yes, I'm coming!

1034
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,149
Be well, everyone.

1035
01:05:04,191 --> 01:05:05,610
Like Doldam,

1036
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,820
like yourselves.

1037
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,238
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

1038
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:48,861
What did you want me to do?

1039
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,572
-You can do it, right?
-Yes, sir. I can do it.

1040
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:53,491
I heard that you're an HPB specialist.

1041
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:55,409
Show us your abilities.

1042
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:57,203
-You've got skills.
-Pardon?

1043
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:58,955
You promised me.

1044
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:00,915
What are you talking about? Nurse Park.

1045
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:02,875
I found a way to push out

1046
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:03,918
Bu Yong-ju.

1047
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:07,838
He might be tougher than Do Yun-wan.

1048
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,174
In order to do that, Dr. Bu Yong-ju,

1049
01:06:10,257 --> 01:06:13,177
I'll have to control your craziness first.
