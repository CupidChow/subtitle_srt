1
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:32,073
STUDENT ID, JANG HYEON-JU

2
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:35,493
STUDENT ID, JANG HYEON-JU

3
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,120
"Geosan University,

4
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,707
College of Medicine, Jang Hyeon-ju"?

5
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,709
What are you doing in there?

6
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,006
Teacher Kim.

7
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,221
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,682
The door was open, so I--

9
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,103
What do you think of Dr. Bu?

10
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,607
Do you think he is a good person?

11
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,358
Get out.

12
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:08,818
Teacher Kim.

13
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,529
I want to know

14
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,281
why you are asking this question.

15
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,158
I will need your answer

16
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,952
before getting you on my side.

17
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,872
What do you think?

18
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,999
Do you want to join hands with me?

19
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,126
Get out.

20
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,846
Teacher Kim.

21
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,265
MEDICAL OFFICE

22
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,024
I don't know what to say.

23
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,610
You neglected me once.

24
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,403
Consider it a progress

25
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,156
of me testing your worth.

26
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,368
When you become my age,

27
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,246
you'll be able to see things.

28
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,832
Whether someone is the real deal or not.

29
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,794
Whether he will make it or not.

30
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:10,964
So...

31
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,842
do you think that

32
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,594
I'm the real deal?

33
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,513
You'll get a 15-percent increase in salary

34
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,890
and the research fund of
100 million won every year.

35
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,810
I think that's a good start.

36
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,731
It is an exceptionally good offer.

37
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,526
In fact, I don't feel comfortable
about that.

38
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,778
Let me show you how it'd be like to be

39
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,156
on my side.

40
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,408
No matter what you want,

41
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,952
you will get more than that.

42
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,170
I don't think you will do that
for me with no strings attached.

43
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,341
What do you want from me in return?

44
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,594
Bu Yong-ju.

45
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,470
I want him.

46
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,850
He wants to operate
on the chairman of the foundation.

47
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,020
And it bothers me a lot.

48
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,646
Are you afraid of

49
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,025
all the spotlight that he will be in

50
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,735
after the operation?

51
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,195
Even if he gets to perform the operation,

52
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,990
I don't want it to be successful.

53
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,702
What do you mean?

54
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,079
Come on, you know what I mean.

55
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,833
Why did you do that?

56
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,127
What were you doing
in Teacher Kim's office?

57
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,797
I saw Manager Jang rummaging
through the garbage can in there.

58
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,090
I just got curious.

59
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,342
Manager Jang did that?

60
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,260
I was just glad
that my orderly job was over,

61
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,387
but I'm back on his blacklist again.

62
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,972
What should I do?

63
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,307
You have no choice.

64
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,310
You will just have to face the fact
that you will be

65
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,478
on his blacklist forever.

66
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,690
I think this is all about the student ID.

67
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:53,775
What are you talking about?

68
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,527
I found a student ID with the name
Jang Hyeon-ju.

69
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,655
I guess he is mad because of that.

70
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,617
Do you know anything about that?

71
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:06,579
It says she was a medical student
of Geosan University in 1998.

72
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:10,917
I don't know anything about what happened
in Geosan Medical Center.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,919
I first met Teacher Kim

74
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:16,923
in the winter of 2002
when the World Cup was held.

75
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,591
I see.

76
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:21,970
There's one.

77
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,554
There's what?

78
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,516
There is someone who might know
about Jang Hyeon-ju.

79
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,019
-Jang Hyeon-ju?
-You started college in 1999

80
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,230
and started your internship
two years late.

81
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:36,234
Hey, you didn't have to say
that I started my internship late.

82
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,405
So do you know Jang Hyeon-ju or not?

83
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,656
I do know.

84
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,825
-But...
-But what?

85
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,660
She died in her second or third year

86
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,245
of medical school.

87
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,497
I heard she died
during liver abscess surgery.

88
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,582
LIVER ABSCESS: PUS-FILLED MASS
INSIDE THE LIVER

89
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,836
STUDENT ID, JANG HYEON-JU

90
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,051
Excuse me.

91
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,514
Do you happen to know
who Dr. Bu Yong-ju is?

92
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,984
STUDENT ID, JANG HYEON-JU

93
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,992
Times of concealment of truth.

94
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,243
If you want,

95
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,621
I can make you the next Dr. Bu.

96
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:35,501
Times of distorted truth and full of lies.

97
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,254
A success rate of 97 percent
in all operations.

98
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,630
I'm the one

99
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:43,092
who made the legend of Bu Yong-ju.

100
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,721
How is that even possible?

101
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,057
It is a matter of life and death.

102
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:53,019
Let's say that I had the marketing point
in tune with the times.

103
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,521
The miracle hands.

104
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,983
I got him that nickname.

105
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,277
I can do the same thing to you.

106
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:05,490
With all the groundless rumors
and vicious gossip

107
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,450
the essence of a man
has to take a back seat.

108
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,118
All you need to do is make up your mind.

109
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,912
What's real?

110
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,121
I will take care

111
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,416
of the rest.

112
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,168
And what's not real?

113
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:21,297
We can't even tell
what is real in this world.

114
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,591
Do you know

115
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:28,012
who performed the liver abscess surgery?

116
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,641
I don't know. We were not that close.

117
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,184
It can't be

118
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,770
Teacher Kim, right?

119
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:38,106
No way!

120
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,565
I know.

121
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,736
Wait. It's not at all impossible.

122
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,448
Dr. Song told me Dr. Bu was
kicked out of the hospital

123
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,991
because he killed a patient.

124
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,703
Dr. Song also mentioned
that he killed his pupil.

125
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,789
-He killed his pupil?
-Wait.

126
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,083
It was 1998,

127
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,418
so Dr. Bu was kicked out

128
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:03,381
in the year of Jang Hyeon-ju's death.

129
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,843
Is it true that she was his pupil?

130
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:09,387
This is scary.

131
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,140
I just got goose bumps.

132
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,809
Where is the patient with effusion?

133
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,647
The patient with effusion.

134
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,111
He's in the hybrid room.

135
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,360
Did you step out this morning?

136
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,237
Yes.

137
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,658
Did you meet with President Do?

138
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,122
Yes, I did.

139
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,290
What did you

140
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,501
talk about with him?

141
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,252
Do I have to tell you that?

142
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:28,341
I was just wondering if he said
anything about me.

143
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,429
No. I got a great offer though.

144
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,015
A great offer?

145
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,184
What is that?

146
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,061
A 15-percent increase in salary

147
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,898
and the research fund
of 100 million won every year.

148
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,444
So did you take it?

149
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,949
Did you take it?

150
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,786
Did you take that offer?

151
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,079
Dr. Kang Dong-ju.

152
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,457
I told him I'd think about it.

153
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,585
It was an exceptionally good offer,

154
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,255
so I couldn't take it immediately.

155
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,256
Are you saying

156
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,008
that you will take it eventually?

157
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,969
Why would I not take it?

158
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,929
It is a great offer.

159
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,891
I should get going.

160
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,893
I'm tired.

161
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,319
-We are ready for thoracentesis.
-Okay.

162
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,867
Let's begin.

163
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,333
It's done.

164
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,378
Send it to the lab for testing.

165
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,838
Yes, Doctor.

166
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:54,218
Tell me if it exceeds 1L.

167
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,054
I will need to check his condition to know
whether I need to extract more.

168
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,389
Okay.

169
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,309
It's done. Thank you.

170
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,904
Why? Do you want to tell me something?

171
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,032
Well, it's...

172
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,701
Do it later if it is not about a patient.

173
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,288
-Teacher Kim.
-Yes?

174
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,748
There you are.

175
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,583
This is an emergency.

176
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,793
What's wrong?

177
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:31,797
President Do suggested
a great offer to Dr. Kang.

178
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,008
A 15-percent increase in salary

179
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,010
and the research fund
of 100 million won every year.

180
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,305
He tried to kick Dr. Yun out
with her pay cut down,

181
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:43,225
and now he tries to appease
Dr. Kang with a pay raise.

182
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,728
The whole scenario is a part of his plan

183
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,980
to bring down Doldam Hospital.

184
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,732
Don't you think?

185
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,858
What?

186
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,985
To bring down Doldam Hospital?

187
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,953
What's that noise? It's loud.

188
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,585
Hey, can't you hear me?

189
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,803
Don't you see I'm trying to sleep?

190
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,263
I didn't see that. Were you sleeping?

191
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,104
I heard you met President Do.

192
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,608
Did you hear that already?

193
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,568
A 15-percent increase in salary

194
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,613
and the research fund
of 100 million won every year?

195
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,032
So, will you take it?

196
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,826
I'm thinking about it.

197
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,703
Are you saying
that you actually want to take it?

198
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,373
If you were me,
wouldn't you even consider it?

199
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,166
No, I wouldn't.

200
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,921
Why would he offer such a big money

201
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,006
to a fellow surgeon like you?

202
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,009
It means he wants something from you.

203
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:03,597
And you will have to do anything
to meet his expectation.

204
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,017
You will be used and manipulated by him.

205
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:10,354
Eventually, it will destroy
your life and conscience.

206
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,731
Don't be so dramatic about it.

207
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,360
I just got a good offer,

208
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,487
and you are destroying
my life and conscience already.

209
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,531
There is no such thing as a free lunch.

210
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,368
Based on my own experiences,

211
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,246
that's how life is.

212
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,841
Why are you so worried?

213
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,011
If he wants to go, he'll go.
If he doesn't, he won't.

214
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:48,100
His life may get ruined
once he does that because of money.

215
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,895
Do you like him that much?

216
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:54,398
What are you talking about?

217
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,401
Why do you say that?

218
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,236
Aren't you two dating?

219
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,946
Dating? Who?

220
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,907
Me? With him?

221
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:06,118
My gosh.

222
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,871
Who said that? Did Dong-ju say that?

223
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,207
No, it seems like that.

224
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,918
Then I guess you are wrong.

225
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,712
No, never.

226
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:19,298
My gosh. Why would I date him?

227
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,634
Yes, President Yeo.

228
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:25,888
Right now?

229
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,859
-Who is that?
-Hey, Dr. Kang.

230
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,861
I was about to call you.

231
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,738
We have a patient with abdominal pain.

232
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,406
Is Dr. Jeong gone?

233
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,326
It's his lunchtime. Should I call him?

234
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,036
No, I got this.

235
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,958
How may I help you?

236
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,460
It's not me. It's my friend.

237
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,753
I see.

238
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:58,921
Wait.

239
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,383
Can we talk to a different doctor?

240
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:05,427
I would prefer to see the doctor
who stitched up my knee before.

241
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,638
It's lunchtime.
I'm the only one available.

242
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,474
-Let me take a look.
-Okay.

243
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,726
-Ms. Eom.
-Yes.

244
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,229
Sir, where do you have pain?

245
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,481
His stomach.

246
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,317
He kept on saying
his stomach hurt since yesterday.

247
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,487
Sir, can you lie down?

248
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,406
Turn over slowly.

249
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:32,955
Let me take a look.

250
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,631
How are his vitals?

251
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,133
It's 100 over 70, pulse 130.

252
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,843
-Check for his temperature.
-Okay.

253
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,137
Sir, I will feel your stomach now.

254
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,893
The tenderness is very severe.

255
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,394
His temperature is 39.6 degrees.

256
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,062
-Bring FAST.
-Okay.

257
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:01,859
Does this hurt?

258
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,154
Sir.

259
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,072
How did you get hurt?

260
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,660
When did you get hurt?

261
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,496
Doctor, can you give him
some painkillers first?

262
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,749
Did you hit him?

263
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,292
-No.
-Dr. Kang.

264
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:19,752
Move.

265
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,433
I see some fluid in there.

266
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,354
Could it be trauma hemoperitoneum?

267
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,314
TRAUMA HEMOPERITONEUM: BLOOD DUE TO WOUND

268
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,608
Set up IV lines and hydrate him with 2L.

269
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,485
Mix 50ml of Demerol
and 2 ampules of Denogan

270
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,195
with 100ml of normal saline.

271
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,405
We'll keep him hydrated
and start with CT scans.

272
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,574
-Check his OP Lab, too.
-Okay.

273
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,662
Sir, we'll give you some painkillers

274
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:55,996
and proceed with the CT scan.

275
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,373
Stay here, okay?

276
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,298
Are you okay?

277
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,467
-Ms. Oh.
-Yes?

278
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,221
Something is odd about them.
What should I do?

279
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,644
What do you mean, odd?

280
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,270
That patient with abdominal pain

281
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,107
looks like he's been beaten badly.

282
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,567
The patient is
very conscious about the other guy.

283
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,403
I don't think
I should leave them together.

284
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:34,493
Yeong-gyun.

285
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,288
-What do we do?
-Don't worry.

286
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:41,166
We'll leave after you get that painkiller.

287
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,090
What?

288
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,341
A lawsuit?

289
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,428
Against who? Me?

290
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:56,306
Are you the one
who collected the blood sample

291
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,350
of the drunk driver yesterday?

292
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,977
Yes, I am.

293
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,021
Did you know you have offended the law

294
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,439
by injuring him

295
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,774
with an unconsented

296
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,609
blood collection?

297
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,778
What are you saying? I was consented.

298
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,572
-Were you?
-Yes.

299
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,741
She got his consent.

300
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,826
Do you have a consent form?

301
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,120
It wasn't a situation
where I could fill out a form,

302
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,247
but he gave me
the consent with his own words.

303
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,792
He kept insisting on a blood test
instead of breathing into a machine.

304
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:27,087
He has no recollection
of giving such a consent.

305
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,384
My gosh.

306
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,895
-Excuse me, we need to talk.
-Hey.

307
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,521
I'm about to die.

308
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,732
-Help me.
-Just hang in there.

309
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:47,900
Darn it.

310
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,819
You said it yourself.

311
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,238
You wanted a blood test
for your blood alcohol level.

312
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,908
That's why I took your blood sample.
What are you trying to do?

313
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,413
Who are you?

314
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,624
Mom.

315
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:08,128
She's the girl who drew my blood.

316
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,592
I see. It's you.

317
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,345
You are the one who drew out blood
from my precious son.

318
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,014
I heard you made a claim for damages.

319
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,058
You can talk to my lawyer about that.

320
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,518
He has the power of attorney.

321
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,604
Son, I brought some soup.

322
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,940
-You can have one, too.
-Thank you.

323
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,032
-My goodness.
-Did you ask for extra meat?

324
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,368
Of course. It's me, your mom.

325
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,079
Eat up.

326
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,375
It's good.

327
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,045
Look at you two.

328
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,964
People have died.

329
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,217
A man died on the scene and
another died in the emergency room.

330
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,719
There are eight people
seriously and lightly injured.

331
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,764
And two road workers even lost their legs!

332
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,474
So what?

333
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,603
Do you feel like eating now?

334
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,481
How can you play games?

335
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,859
You are unbelievable.

336
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,653
It's not like you paid

337
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:17,364
for these soups.

338
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,783
Who are you to say anything
about my son having a meal?

339
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:23,162
His blood-alcohol level was
at 0.18 percent.

340
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,415
That's like committing a suicide,
driving in that condition.

341
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,209
We'll deal with the legal issues.

342
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,880
My lawyer and the insurance company
will sort it out and compensate them.

343
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,464
My goodness.

344
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:38,594
How dare a mere doctor
like you come up to me

345
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,180
and try to teach me?

346
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,848
Are you a judge or something?

347
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,266
Don't you feel

348
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,936
any guilt or blame as a human being?

349
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,814
A young guy like him
can have a drink from time to time,

350
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,649
and he might want to drive!

351
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,651
Didn't you hear that people have died?

352
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:58,030
This hospital is awful.

353
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,532
-Let's go to a different hospital.
-Mom.

354
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,326
No.

355
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,370
Police will come after me
the moment I walk out.

356
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,414
Our lawyer told us

357
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,708
to stay here for a while.

358
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,251
This isn't the only hospital around.

359
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,502
Eat up.

360
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,214
-I'll take care of this.
-Okay.

361
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,050
Lawyer Hong, it's me.

362
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:22,221
Some weird doctor came
and tried to boss me around.

363
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,473
She's giving me a headache.

364
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,599
Have you eaten?

365
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,317
It's not hemoperitoneum.
It's pan-peritonitis.

366
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,069
It's bowel perforation.

367
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,405
I can see diverticulum,

368
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,243
but I don't think it's
diverticulitis perforation.

369
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,577
I think

370
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,788
it's bowel perforation caused by a trauma.

371
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,251
I saw a bruise on his stomach which
looked like a result of a beating.

372
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,128
I think that's more likely.

373
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,965
He has sepsis,
so he needs an operation now.

374
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,175
I will do it.

375
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,640
I'll tell Dr. Do

376
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,016
to assist you.

377
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:09,977
Ms. Oh.

378
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,688
-Will you call Dr. Do?
-Yes.

379
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,942
Aren't you going to ask me anything?

380
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,026
Like what?

381
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,655
I met President Do today.

382
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,157
I thought you'd know already.

383
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:27,160
Would that change anything?

384
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,412
But still.

385
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,956
I thought you'd say something.

386
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:37,254
It's your life.

387
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,880
The decision is yours, too.

388
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,842
Our hospital

389
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,178
can't give you what he offered.

390
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,889
You can choose to go if you'd like.

391
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,186
You wanted me
to become a doctor that's needed.

392
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,565
Isn't that what you said?

393
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,109
How can you

394
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,153
ask me to follow terms and conditions?

395
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,656
I meant that I can't stop you
if you wanted those.

396
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,952
Even if I persuade you
to stay here with this and that,

397
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,871
you will

398
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,208
always wonder what lied
in the road you haven't taken.

399
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,981
Why did you talk to him like that?

400
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,942
-What do you mean?
-I know you don't want

401
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,320
to let Dr. Kang go.

402
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:50,327
You could have told him
that he's the kind of doctor we need.

403
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,705
That's probably what he wanted to hear.

404
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:58,919
He's the one who has to make
the decisions in his life.

405
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,630
I can't make him to do anything

406
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,591
against his own will.

407
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,052
Let's just say
that he decided to stay here.

408
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,970
Do you think he'll be happy?

409
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,057
Unless he finds the reason

410
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,185
for him to stay here,

411
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:19,439
he won't be happy here no matter what.

412
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,900
Dr. Kang respects you.

413
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,235
That's not true at all.

414
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:29,282
He just wants to learn
how to operate like me.

415
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,910
That's about it for him now.

416
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,664
Gosh.

417
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,251
-You know what?
-What?

418
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,795
That you're a very twisted man.

419
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,132
-Am I twisted?
-Yes, you are.

420
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,979
I just don't understand.
Am I the wrong one here?

421
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:01,064
Every time he talks,
he tries to lecture someone.

422
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,691
I'm so tired of--

423
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,861
How can someone be so stubborn?

424
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,530
I don't understand how
anyone can be so shameless.

425
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,365
No one in this world will like him

426
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,200
if he never speaks from his heart.

427
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,786
Does speaking the truth
mean the end of the world to him?

428
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,039
She's not even slightly remorseful
when people have died.

429
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,960
She even brought her son hangover soup.

430
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,964
I will never understand
such irrational people.

431
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:29,926
I've been working by his side
long enough to understand,

432
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,845
but how will a fresh face like Dr. Kang

433
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:34,097
be able to understand
Teacher Kim's true intentions?

434
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,766
-Don't you think so?
-That's exactly my point.

435
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,394
Did something happen?

436
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:42,772
He told Dr. Kang that he could leave
here any time

437
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:46,318
for places with better conditions
and that he will not stop him.

438
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:49,404
What? Are you serious? No way.

439
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,072
That's exactly my point.

440
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:54,201
What's going on with you, Dr. Yun?

441
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:57,913
I just got sued by the drunken driver.

442
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,164
What?

443
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,458
Is he crazy?

444
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,878
What is this world coming to?

445
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,214
That's exactly my point, Ms. Oh.

446
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:10,967
Excuse me.

447
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:13,845
May I help you?

448
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,056
A soldier went AWOL from his base.

449
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,268
We're on a search for him at the moment.

450
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,603
He ran away from his base?

451
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,314
Can I look around the hospital?

452
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:33,114
Please be quick
and don't disturb the patients.

453
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:36,534
Excuse me.

454
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,502
What...

455
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,599
Hang in there.

456
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,980
I'll take you to the operating room now.

457
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,653
Ms. Eom, have you seen the patient
on that bed?

458
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:12,904
Why? Is he not there?

459
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,156
No. His friend is missing, too.

460
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,075
What? That's strange.

461
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,326
What's going on?

462
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:19,828
The male patient with pan-peritonitis.

463
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,080
I came to take him to the operating room,
but he's gone.

464
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,498
He's gone?

465
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,334
Can you describe
what that patient looked like?

466
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,919
How old did he look? What was he wearing?

467
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,754
He looked in his early 20s.

468
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,383
Is this him?

469
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,387
Yes, it is.

470
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,223
-Hey, this way.
-Yes, sir.

471
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,060
What's going on, Ms. Oh?

472
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:45,812
He's a run-away soldier.

473
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,063
-What?
-What?

474
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,192
-A run-away soldier?
-Yes.

475
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,654
The military police
are searching the hospital.

476
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,031
Two guys just disappeared.

477
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,117
It's not safe for him to walk around.

478
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:03,246
He could die
if we don't open him up right now.

479
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:18,845
Get up.

480
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,097
Ju-hyeok. Hang in there, Ju-hyeok.

481
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,475
Yeong-gyun. I...

482
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,102
I'm not going to make it.

483
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,439
I'm...

484
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,232
in pain.

485
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,735
Wake up. Wake up, Ju-hyeok!

486
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:38,865
No.

487
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,121
Are you leaving Doldam Hospital?

488
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,166
Why are you guys leaving
when he's in such bad condition?

489
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,626
-Get him on my back.
-No.

490
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,419
We can't go back there.

491
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,838
If my friend goes back there,
they'll take him away.

492
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:57,967
Your friend could die
if you don't go back right now.

493
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:02,764
Dr. Kang. I just got a call from Dr. Nam.

494
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,850
He's on his way to the ER
with that run-away soldier.

495
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,648
Aren't you coming?

496
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,008
Can you hear me, sir?

497
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:40,677
Sir.

498
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,856
-What happened?
-He lost consciousness out there.

499
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,942
-How are his vitals?
-It's 80 over 40. This isn't good.

500
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,694
His body temperature is 39.8 degrees.

501
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,280
How could you take him with you
with the condition he's in?

502
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,783
Did you get his consent?

503
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,035
I got it from himself
when he still had consciousness.

504
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,370
-Okay.
-Dr. Nam.

505
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,873
I'll be right back after I get changed.

506
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,542
Let's move this patient
to the operating room.

507
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,461
Stop.

508
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,338
Hold on.

509
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,968
It's him, Private Park Ju-hyeok.
Call it in.

510
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,345
Private Park Ju-hyeok.

511
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,389
Park Ju-hyeok.

512
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,435
You have the right to remain silent,

513
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:33,354
and anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

514
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,398
You have the right
to consult an attorney. Got it?

515
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,649
What are you doing?

516
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,110
Can't you see he's unconscious?

517
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,281
By principle, we have to read
AWOL soldiers their Miranda rights.

518
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,242
As of this moment,
Private Park is under our control.

519
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,327
You can't do that.

520
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:51,122
He's a sepsis patient.
He could lose his life any minute.

521
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,792
I'll contact the army hospital
to transfer him from here.

522
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,502
Can't you see his condition?

523
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,420
He can't afford to lose more time.

524
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:01,800
If that's the case, you should move him
to the operating room right now.

525
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:06,346
-What's the hold up?
-Teacher Kim.

526
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,766
Are you the person in charge
of this hospital?

527
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:13,353
I wouldn't say
I'm in charge of the entire hospital,

528
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,356
but I am responsible for this operation.

529
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,441
He's a run-away soldier.

530
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,401
I'm requesting for extradition.

531
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,029
You can do that after we operate on him.

532
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,239
If you keep this up,

533
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:28,284
you'll be charged
with obstruction of justice.

534
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,205
Once the doctor decides
that it can't be done,

535
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,124
you're not allowed
to transfer the patient.

536
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,919
I'm sure you're aware of interference
with medical treatment.

537
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,841
-Doctor.
-Yes?

538
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,509
What are you still doing there?

539
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,053
Move him to the operating room.

540
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,638
Okay. Let's move him.

541
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,564
Officer.

542
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,024
Don't worry about it.

543
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,861
He's almost as good as dead.

544
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,613
He's not going to run out
of the operating room now.

545
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,788
Do you have the contacts
of your friend's parents?

546
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,082
-I do.
-Notify them right away.

547
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,918
Tell them to get here as soon as possible.

548
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,044
Okay.

549
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,177
Set up the C-line with ODW

550
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,388
mixed with 32ml of norepinephrine.

551
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,640
-Execute a drop of 10cc per hour.
-Yes, Doctor.

552
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,183
What condition is he in?

553
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,853
It's 70 over 40. He's barely holding on.

554
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,108
-Shall we start?
-Okay.

555
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:48,907
What are you doing?

556
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,326
Teacher Kim told me
to record this operation.

557
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,082
Let's begin, Dr. Kang.

558
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,711
Scalpel.

559
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,885
I'll report back to you right away.

560
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:09,844
Yes, sir.

561
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,138
The situation is complicated.

562
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,641
No, sir.

563
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:17,018
They seem pretty busy.

564
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,479
-I'll take care of it.
-It's a run-away solider

565
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:22,106
being operated in a general hospital.

566
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,483
No wonder they're busy.

567
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:26,986
Whenever military abuses occur,

568
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,490
at least one of the high up personnel
ends up getting fired.

569
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:35,411
Have you served in the military?
Army? Navy? Or the air force?

570
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:36,996
What?

571
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,791
Why do you ask?

572
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,376
I'm just curious.

573
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,169
Which unit were you in?

574
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,171
Well, it's a...

575
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,466
-A...
-The army?

576
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,094
-I see.
-Yes.

577
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:56,099
Dr. Yun, you're here.

578
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,518
May I see you?

579
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,398
What could Dr. Song want with me?

580
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,565
I don't know.

581
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,531
Did you want...

582
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,159
me?

583
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,285
Dr. Yun.

584
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,914
Did you threaten a patient today?

585
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,040
Pardon?

586
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,668
Threaten?

587
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,587
Why did you run into their room

588
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,506
and say unnecessary things like

589
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:31,718
that they should feel sorry,

590
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,095
and that many people died because of him?

591
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,306
You shouldn't show

592
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,518
your feeble heart of justice
in public, Dr. Yun.

593
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,687
A doctor

594
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,524
should only do what a doctor should.

595
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:50,361
Apologize to them. Now.

596
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,113
What did you say?

597
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,322
Didn't you hear?

598
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,659
Apologize to them.

599
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,119
I can't.

600
00:33:58,911 --> 00:33:59,996
What?

601
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,080
Right.

602
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,833
I was overemotional.

603
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,960
I did barge into their room

604
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,962
and told them about the people he hurt.

605
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,674
I know that
I shouldn't have gone that far.

606
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:14,469
However, I won't apologize.

607
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:15,553
Dr. Yun!

608
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,388
This is unbelievable.

609
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:19,390
They can

610
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,310
walk out of here
with a few pain relief patches right now,

611
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,187
and they'll be totally fine.

612
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,066
Their car was such an expensive car,

613
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:31,110
and six airbags went off.

614
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,529
They are not hurt at all.

615
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:37,241
They are sitting here
because they don't want to get arrested.

616
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,952
Hey, Miss. Are you finished?

617
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,788
I'm not a Miss.

618
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,998
I'm Dr. Yun Seo-jeong.

619
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,209
Unbelievable.

620
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:49,087
Your hospital is a mess, Dr. Song.

621
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,213
My gosh.

622
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,341
I haven't been here for long.

623
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,886
Where are your manners?

624
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,013
Apologize immediately.

625
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,432
Apologize for everything
including what you just said.

626
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,017
Like I said, I won't.

627
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,645
Are you going against
the words of the chief surgeon?

628
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,439
Please only give me orders
which I can comply with, sir.

629
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,111
If you are finished,

630
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,571
I'll be leaving.

631
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,699
Look at her.

632
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,869
Hey, Dr. Yun!

633
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:23,746
Stop right there!

634
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,630
Dr. Yun.

635
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,341
What will you make of me
if you leave like this?

636
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,344
She is

637
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,139
the wife of the provincial assembly,
Han Gi-jun,

638
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,765
who's also a close friend of the governor.

639
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:43,891
So what?

640
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,644
What does he have to do with me,

641
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,354
let alone his wife?

642
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:51,357
You don't know the real world.

643
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,736
What I mean is,
she is someone you should apologize to

644
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,697
regardless of your opinion about her.

645
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,699
Why would I do that?

646
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,410
I'm not a politician or a public worker.

647
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,705
Like you said, I'm a doctor.

648
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:08,291
You said I just need to do
what a doctor does.

649
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:11,669
Then why would I need
to apologize to someone like her?

650
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,839
That's the order of this world.

651
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:16,674
Dr. Yun!

652
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,261
Let's go and apologize.
It'll make things so much easier.

653
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,387
I will talk to her

654
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:24,140
into dropping the charges against you.

655
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,684
Forget about it and tell her to sue me.

656
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:29,896
My goodness!

657
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,274
Darn it.

658
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,821
Hey! Dr. Yun!

659
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,075
Turn in a written apology
and explanation by tomorrow!

660
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,285
Do you understand?

661
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,674
I'll get him.

662
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,725
-Please come with me.
-To where?

663
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,602
Wait.

664
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:10,978
Get up and sit here.

665
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,274
Hey.

666
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,444
I already got checked up.

667
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,363
Where are we going?

668
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,531
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

669
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,078
-What are you doing?
-Look at them.

670
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:29,330
Look at what you've done.

671
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,437
Did you say you'll compensate with money?

672
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,609
Do you think their lives are
compensable with money?

673
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,489
Look at them!

674
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:08,202
You'll realize what you've done
only after you see this.

675
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,557
Money is your talent.

676
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,561
Your rich mother is your supporter.

677
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,480
That's great.

678
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,525
That's great, but...

679
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,778
shouldn't you at least learn

680
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:46,782
what conscience is?

681
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,578
What are you doing over there?

682
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,332
Mom.

683
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,500
My...

684
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:58,544
Hey!

685
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,432
-Did you just hit me?
-Yes, I did.

686
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,517
What will you do?
Press charges against me?

687
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:14,935
Go ahead.

688
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,064
How dare you make my son cry?

689
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,523
Who do you think you are?

690
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,108
Why are you so shameless?

691
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,528
-Don't you know what you've done?
-What did you say?

692
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,573
You feel no guilt and you have no shame.

693
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,118
Since when did the world

694
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,038
let people like you get powerful?

695
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,999
-How dare you say--
-Forget about it.

696
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:41,170
I will file a countercharge
of your assault.

697
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,673
There will be

698
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,760
no settlement or compromise whatsoever.

699
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,305
Who does she think she is?

700
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,767
My goodness. She's unbelievable.

701
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,477
Unbelievable.

702
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,564
My goodness.

703
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,942
Who on earth is she?

704
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:11,283
The inflammation is only
within the perforation site.

705
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,412
It's not in the diverticulum, is it?

706
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,205
Definitely not.

707
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,500
It's definitely caused by a trauma.

708
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,752
They must have beaten him to death.

709
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,380
Do you think he was bullied
by the entire infantry?

710
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:27,258
I understand why he would
want to run away after this.

711
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,676
We'll conduct bowel resection

712
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,637
and functional end-to-end anastomosis.

713
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,141
Dr. Kang, his blood pressure is dropping.

714
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,518
-Increase norepinephrine to 20cc.
-Okay.

715
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:41,355
-Is he okay?
-I think he's in a septic shock.

716
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,357
-We must hurry.
-Okay.

717
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:44,608
GIA, please.

718
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,360
GIA: INTESTINE CUTTING STAPLER

719
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,376
Specimen.

720
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,466
Warm saline, please.

721
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,385
Keep it coming.

722
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,359
Teacher Kim.

723
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,320
-Teacher Kim.
-Yes?

724
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,238
-I've been looking for you.
-Why?

725
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,990
You have to come to the president's room.

726
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,826
Dr. Yun got herself into trouble again.

727
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,428
The discipline
of this hospital is unacceptable.

728
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,973
She ignores the order of the chief.

729
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:01,602
And she crossed the line
with her words to a patient

730
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,646
and his guardian.

731
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,397
Look at this.

732
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,817
This is unacceptable, isn't it?

733
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,155
I thought about letting this slide,

734
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,199
but I get angrier
the more I think about this.

735
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,951
I won't let this pass.

736
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,994
Kneel down and apologize immediately.

737
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,747
I must receive her apology.

738
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,171
What are you doing?

739
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,715
She said, you should apologize.

740
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:36,470
-Pardon?
-Apologize to her.

741
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:40,849
Bowing at a 45-degree angle
would be enough.

742
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,479
What do you mean by that?

743
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,772
I mean...

744
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,316
I heard what she said,

745
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:52,945
but I don't think Dr. Yun did
something to deserve to kneel down.

746
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,738
But she keeps insisting for an apology.

747
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,199
We can't just ignore her request.

748
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,369
Ma'am, why don't we

749
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:03,289
settle this with a 45-degree bow?

750
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,873
Wait a second. Teacher Kim.

751
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:08,961
I forgot. We need you to apologize first.

752
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:11,797
-What are you talking about?
-You hit her.

753
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,967
Then, you should apologize to her first

754
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,760
even if you won't compensate her.

755
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,262
Are you kidding?

756
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,058
Do I look like I'm kidding?

757
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,562
So is that how you're going to
deal with this?

758
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:31,108
All right, then. It seems you don't
want to apologize to me.

759
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,234
Let the law decide.

760
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,070
I'll make sure to humiliate

761
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,489
both you and that lady doctor.

762
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:40,117
Go ahead, then.

763
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:44,663
I'm an expert at dirty fights.

764
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:49,293
What's wrong with you?
You should resolve the situation.

765
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:54,298
She simply wants Dr. Yun's apology.
Why are you making things complicated?

766
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:56,592
Gosh.

767
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,513
Are you sure you'll be okay?

768
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,807
Rich people have so much

769
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,269
to lose through a dirty fight.

770
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:09,605
What did you say?

771
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:12,775
President Yeo and Manager Jang are

772
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:16,487
such gentlemen
that they can't fight dirty.

773
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,531
But I'm different.

774
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:24,203
I'm such an ignorant person.
When I get angry,

775
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,872
I wouldn't mind doing anything
to get what I want.

776
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:30,834
I feel sorry for you.

777
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,212
You might lose everything.

778
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:35,130
Are you threatening me?

779
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,841
You're the one who threatened first.

780
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:41,970
You mistreat others using your money
and your husband's power.

781
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,639
How dare you say such a thing?

782
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:47,017
Your son caused a six-car
rear-end collision while drunk driving.

783
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,228
Then, you came to the hospital

784
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,397
and pushed a doctor around.

785
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,816
You even slapped her in the face.

786
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:04,118
If this story makes the headlines,
I'd be very entertained.

787
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:06,954
-Are you sure about this?
-You!

788
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,206
Darn it.

789
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,041
Gosh.

790
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,093
Apologize to her first.

791
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:24,805
If you don't,
she won't apologize to you either.

792
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:41,113
Why do you keep smiling like that?

793
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:43,991
It's the first time you have
taken my side.

794
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,160
I'm on cloud nine.

795
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:50,122
It means I've been recognized
as your pupil, right?

796
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,582
Am I right?

797
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,418
Who says you're my pupil?

798
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:58,630
-Am I not?
-I don't keep pupils.

799
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:06,346
Is it true that she was his pupil?

800
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,598
STUDENT ID, JANG HYEON-JU

801
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,270
I'll still be your pupil even if
you don't think of me as one.

802
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:19,234
My dream is to become like you.

803
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:29,411
Remain impartial with your patients
from now on.

804
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:33,665
Even if he did something wrong,
he's just a patient to you.

805
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,000
Do you hear me?

806
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,960
Yes, sir.

807
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:39,213
I'll bear that in mind, Teacher Kim.

808
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:07,783
Excuse me.

809
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:13,872
I am sorry.

810
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:17,793
I am really...

811
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:30,472
I am sorry.

812
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,854
My goodness.

813
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:11,305
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

814
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,311
This is ICU.

815
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,605
One patient will go there soon.
Please prepare a bed.

816
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,189
That's impossible.

817
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,652
Everyone in the ICU needs to be
monitored until today.

818
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,489
No bed is available in the ICU.
What should we do?

819
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,950
Let's take the patient
to the hybrid room for now.

820
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,285
Can we take care of him in there?

821
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,661
I'll stay with him.

822
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:37,372
Let's keep him there
until there's a bed available in the ICU.

823
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:38,582
Okay, Dr. Nam.

824
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:41,209
-Please keep that for Pathology.
-Yes, Dr. Kang.

825
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:42,377
Let's move the patient.

826
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,304
Run the ABGA.

827
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:53,430
Yes, sir.

828
00:48:58,393 --> 00:48:59,811
He doesn't look so good.

829
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:03,065
-What are his vital signs?
-The BP is 80 over 40, pulse 130.

830
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:04,691
What was the last dosage
of norepinephrine?

831
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,652
-20cc per minute.
-Double the dosage, please.

832
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,154
Is urine coming out?

833
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:10,947
URINE

834
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,824
-No.
-Check his OP Lab again.

835
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:15,327
-Do we have the ABGA result?
-Yes, it's here.

836
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:18,372
The acidosis is severe, too.

837
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,833
Give him three ampules
of sodium bicarbonate, not through C-line.

838
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:22,834
Yes, Dr. Kang.

839
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:25,003
-Is his guardian here?
-Not yet.

840
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:41,728
The patient is in a critical condition.

841
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,231
Did the surgery go wrong?

842
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,358
The surgery was successful.

843
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:50,362
We completed
his abdominal operation successfully.

844
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:52,364
However,

845
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,533
he has severe intra-abdominal infection.

846
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:57,661
He developed septic shock
due to peritonitis.

847
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:59,913
What will happen to him, then?

848
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:03,041
We're giving him vasopressor drugs
for now,

849
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,210
but if his blood pressure keeps
dropping despite that,

850
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:07,713
his organs would be damaged

851
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:09,589
and in the end,

852
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:12,134
he may die.

853
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:14,553
I see.

854
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,931
If you think of the probability,

855
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,726
what's the probability that he'll die?

856
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,478
We can't be sure about it now.

857
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:28,442
In fact, it seems that the cause

858
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,570
of his injury is external shocks.

859
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:34,156
What do you mean by external shock?

860
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:37,200
To put it simply, he's been beaten up.

861
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:42,330
He has bruises on different parts,
which can't be done by one person.

862
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:43,665
It is highly likely

863
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:47,294
that he was gang beaten
by two or more people.

864
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,712
Are you...

865
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:51,882
saying

866
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,177
that he was bullied by other soldiers?

867
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:59,222
I'm telling you about
the cause of his injury.

868
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:01,767
I see.

869
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,199
-Good shot.
-Good shot.

870
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,122
Hello. It's been a long time.

871
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,875
I have been quite busy.
I couldn't call you often.

872
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:28,585
What is the matter?

873
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,674
I see.

874
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,093
I understand what you mean.

875
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:41,640
I'll take care of it
as quietly as possible.

876
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:43,433
Bye.

877
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:48,230
Yes, President Do.

878
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:52,067
I was worried because you have been
avoiding my calls.

879
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:55,320
A run-away soldier was taken
to that hospital today, right?

880
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:56,655
Is that so?

881
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:59,616
Why do you not know
what happens in that hospital?

882
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:02,327
I'm sorry. I'll go look into it
right away.

883
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:05,205
Find out who operated on him

884
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,582
and check the patient's condition.

885
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:10,293
See if he'll make it through tonight, too.

886
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:11,461
Yes, I will.

887
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:17,926
RECEPTIONIST

888
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:33,066
Dr. Kang.

889
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,403
-Yes?
-I heard we have a run-away soldier here.

890
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:39,239
We moved him to the hybrid room
after the operation.

891
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:42,576
-The intensive care unit is full.
-I see.

892
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,287
Did you perform the operation?

893
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,540
Yes. Why?

894
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:50,208
I see.

895
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:52,919
Doctor, a cardiac arrest.

896
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,713
Inject 1ml of epinephrine every 3 minutes.

897
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:05,307
-What's going on?
-His vital signs dropped rapidly.

898
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:06,558
Now he is in PEA arrest.

899
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:07,684
I will check his pulse.

900
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:12,147
-PEA compression.
-I will do that.

901
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,029
President Do, it's me.

902
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:21,781
Things are not going well here.

903
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:23,742
The patient is in arrest.

904
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,827
It seems Dr. Kang performed the operation.

905
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,288
The chart says
he's the doctor in charge as well.

906
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:29,539
GENERAL SURGERY, KANG DONG-JU

907
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,918
Okay. I will be there soon.

908
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:38,089
Okay.

909
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,885
Do we need the death certificate

910
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:43,386
with death from disease?

911
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:46,473
Okay. I will do that.

912
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:54,773
Did someone die?

913
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,067
What do you mean?

914
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:59,361
I heard you

915
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:02,197
talking about a death certificate.

916
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:05,116
I'm just wondering who it is for.

917
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,369
I don't understand what you mean.

918
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:08,995
Are you saying

919
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,915
that I'm hearing things or what?

920
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:13,875
Excuse me.

921
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,723
Why does he keep glaring at me?

922
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:36,940
I will check his pulse.

923
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:43,530
It's back.

924
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,705
His vital signs are still unstable.

925
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,248
The BP is 70 over 60, pulse 100.

926
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:08,388
He has no light reflex

927
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,890
and no stem sign.

928
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:15,061
At this rate, he will soon
have brain death.

929
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,539
Doctor.

930
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:37,709
Is he your friend?

931
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:40,587
Doctor.

932
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,839
Can you please go check my friend?

933
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:45,717
Don't worry. His doctor is
treating him now.

934
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:50,138
He is young,
but he is an experienced doctor.

935
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:51,848
Dr. Kang.

936
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,350
Can I see you for a moment?

937
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:59,773
Go see him. Dr. Nam and I
will take care of the patient.

938
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:03,068
I will be right back.
Call me if something happens.

939
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:13,411
By the way,

940
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,372
why did your friend run away
from the army?

941
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:19,501
Can you tell me

942
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,796
how he got hurt?

943
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:47,445
Have a seat.

944
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:58,832
-Why did you want to see me?
-I need you to do something for me.

945
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:01,376
Open it.

946
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:06,214
MEDICAL CERTIFICATE OF DEATH

947
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:13,221
PARK JU-HYEOK, DOB: OCTOBER 31, 1995

948
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,600
DEATH FROM DISEASE

949
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,312
DR. KANG DONG-JU

950
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:46,212
They are having an important meeting.

951
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:48,715
I know. I need to join as well.

952
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,067
What is going on?

953
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,987
What are you doing here?

954
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:22,790
But President Do won't give up.

955
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:25,293
He will

956
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:28,880
take away things

957
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:30,840
that matter to you

958
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:33,301
one by one.

959
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:37,388
So...

960
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:40,767
what are you going to do?

961
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,146
Let's say

962
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:49,150
I will help you keep
Doldam Hospital with my money.

963
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:50,818
But

964
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:54,948
I can't change a person's mind with money.

965
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:57,242
What's your plan?

966
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:03,164
What's your plan to protect your people?

967
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,182
