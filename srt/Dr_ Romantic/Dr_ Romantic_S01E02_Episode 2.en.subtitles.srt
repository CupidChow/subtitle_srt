1
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:29,237
The number you have dialed is currently
not available. Please leave a message...

2
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:06,357
Are you all right?

3
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,694
You fractured your right ankle.

4
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,446
I gave you a soft cast.

5
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,990
You'll be fully recovered
in 2 or 3 months.

6
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,412
The problem is with your wrist.

7
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,416
Your right palm has been
severely fractured.

8
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,295
We did what we could,

9
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,838
but even after you're fully recovered,

10
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,466
you'll only be able to utilize it
at 70 percent capacity.

11
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,347
Is the angulation that severe?

12
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,640
ANGULATION: DEGREE OF DISPLACEMENT

13
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,267
Are you a medical student?

14
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,354
I'm in my fourth year residency
in emergency medicine.

15
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,651
It'll depend on the rehab,

16
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,029
but in the worst case scenario,

17
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,323
you might not fully recover.

18
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:14,968
DONG-JU DUMPLINGS

19
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,223
Three thousand won, please.

20
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,892
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

21
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,064
Two plates, please.

22
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,161
Why didn't you go home to eat?

23
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,747
I wanted to eat dumplings tonight.

24
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,666
Don't they give you time to eat?

25
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,960
Why do you look so exhausted?

26
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,504
I eat well, don't worry.

27
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,257
I'm just so busy in the ER.

28
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:58,386
Why do you want be a doctor anyway?

29
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,639
That wouldn't bring back your father.

30
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,225
I don't get how you can work at a hospital

31
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,436
where your father had passed away.

32
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,941
I know you're my son,
but I just don't get you.

33
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,908
You should live your life.

34
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:23,161
Make new friends.
Find yourself a girlfriend.

35
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,715
OCTOBER, 2016

36
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,176
They'll be joining the Surgery Department
of Geosan Medical Center.

37
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,930
Doctor Kang Dong-ju and Doctor Do In-beom.

38
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,098
As for Doctor Kang,

39
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:47,977
his score was top of the whole country
on the qualifying exam.

40
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,732
We're expecting a lot from you two.

41
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,067
Welcome to the team.

42
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,903
Thank you. I'm glad to join the team.

43
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,993
-I'll do my best, sir.
-We're counting on you.

44
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,955
-I'll do my best, sir.
-Right.

45
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,832
I'll do my best, sir.

46
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,461
I'll do my best, sir.

47
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,462
He's my son.

48
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:17,423
He's a handsome man.

49
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,509
Nice to meet you.

50
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,177
I guess we have to ask you for the favors.

51
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,345
He must be talented.

52
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,725
You know what to do, right?

53
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,643
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

54
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,563
Times of discrimination.

55
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,278
This is my son I told you about before.

56
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,155
Let's talk on our way there.

57
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:46,327
Your background and connections
are what matters more.

58
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:50,581
Even in hospitals where
everything's a matter of life and death,

59
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,209
things aren't any different.

60
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,087
There is discrimination everywhere.

61
00:04:56,629 --> 00:05:00,341
I think there are only two ways
to solve this situation.

62
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,011
You either have to reborn
as the son of the president,

63
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,513
or you get yourself
a powerful VIP patient.

64
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,724
There's no way they'll
let me attend to VIP patients.

65
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,268
You're right. They won't.

66
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:13,688
Which is why this vicious cycle
of discrimination will never end.

67
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,273
I have to go.

68
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,733
I have an operation in 30 minutes.

69
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,650
Again?

70
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,987
You're getting enslaved.

71
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,991
Doctor Kang?
The president is looking for you.

72
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,118
PRESIDENT DO YUN-WAN

73
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,122
There's an emergency operation
of a VIP patient.

74
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,625
Senator Go Man-seok used to be
the Chairman of the Congress.

75
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:39,130
I'm sorry, but my operation schedule
is full for today.

76
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,091
Don't be stubborn.

77
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,594
That's for you to sort out.

78
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:48,014
Don't you know why we're letting you
operate on a VIP patient?

79
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,266
It must be a very difficult operation.

80
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,938
You need someone to blame on
when it doesn't go well.

81
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,524
And I'm the best candidate, right?

82
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:00,943
Am I wrong?

83
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,695
Doctor Kang.

84
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,364
I'll operate on my patients as scheduled.

85
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,824
It's a sepsis patient.

86
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,368
I can't delay the operation
without risking the patient's life.

87
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:10,828
Please excuse me.

88
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,623
Why did you become a doctor?

89
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,462
I heard you're from a poor family.

90
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,049
You must have studied harder than
any other to become a doctor.

91
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,301
Isn't success the reason
why you became so determined?

92
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,136
This is your opportunity.

93
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:29,931
Back then,

94
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,392
you're the little boy who made a scene
in the emergency room.

95
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:35,770
That was you, right?

96
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:39,774
You're right.

97
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,568
This is a very difficult case.

98
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,862
HCC rupture.

99
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,157
The rate of a successful operation
is 30 percent at best.

100
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:53,287
But opportunities always come
with certain amount of risks.

101
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,416
Don't tell me that
you dare to challenge me

102
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:01,796
without having the guts
to handle something like this.

103
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,223
If you really want revenge,

104
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,642
become a better man.

105
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,152
What do you mean
the operation has been postponed?

106
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,864
Is there something wrong with my dad?

107
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:32,034
I have to prove myself.

108
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,079
We'll have to wait and see
for a few more days

109
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,665
and decide on the date
of the operation again.

110
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,001
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,128
Doctor.

112
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,716
My dad is all right, isn't he?

113
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,220
Yes, he is.

114
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,690
I'll prove them that I'm a better man

115
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,484
than they are.

116
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,287
Doctor Oh, I'm going to cut
the abdomen open now.

117
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,415
The blood pressure will
start to drop right away. Scalpel.

118
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,212
Bovie.

119
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,549
Scalpel.

120
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,094
Suction.

121
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,139
Retractor.

122
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,145
Get yourself together. Suction.

123
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,606
Hold it there. Now.

124
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,567
Hold this. We'll start
the left hemi-hepatectomy now.

125
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,777
Pull yourself together.

126
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,488
Doctor Oh, how's the patient doing?

127
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:53,074
The pulse is getting faster,
but it's fine at the moment.

128
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,453
Suction.

129
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:58,871
Suction.

130
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,748
I can't see where the bleeding
is coming from.

131
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,917
-Scalpel.
-The vital signs are unstable.

132
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,669
It's dropping to 70 over 40.

133
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,465
Suture.

134
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:16,889
Cut.

135
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:18,307
Bovie.

136
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,061
Spread it open. I can't see
where the bleeding is coming from.

137
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,731
It's progressed
to disseminated intravascular coagulation.

138
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,608
There's too much bleeding.

139
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,653
Really? 30 percent success rate?

140
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,405
I doubt it.

141
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,367
It was five percent at best
when I opened him up.

142
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,160
I tried my best,

143
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,788
but the result was unsuccessful.

144
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,624
Get the defibrillator!

145
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,921
-Increase to 200J.
-Ready, Doctor.

146
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,840
Move aside.

147
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,425
Clear.

148
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,640
Give me 200J again.

149
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,518
Step away. Clear.

150
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,568
Doctor.

151
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,878
The time of death is 5:25p.m.

152
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,756
The patient died from excessive bleeding.

153
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,702
Former Chairman of Congress Senator
Go Man-seok passed away...

154
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,204
Lay low for a while.

155
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:06,290
Many are paying their respects
to the deceased.

156
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,250
Reporter Kim Ju-yeong
will be bringing the news.

157
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,795
PERSONNEL TRANSFER FOR KANG DONG-JU
TO DOLDAM HOSPITAL, JEONGSEON

158
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:11,879
Doldam Hospital.

159
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,507
Where is this?

160
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,217
It's a small branch in Jeongseon.

161
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,303
We'll call you back
when things get settled.

162
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,264
So be on your best behavior.

163
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,266
Think of this as a break.

164
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:26,602
Okay?

165
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,647
Basically,

166
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,732
I'm screwed.

167
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,652
DOLDAM HOSPITAL, JEONGSEON,
GANGWON PROVINCE

168
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,292
What is this place?

169
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:59,802
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

170
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,683
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

171
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,910
MOM

172
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,764
What are you staring at?

173
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,018
I thought we had a guest,
but he's leaving.

174
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,771
He must have taken a wrong turn.

175
00:12:58,903 --> 00:12:59,862
Darn it.

176
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,420
Dong-ju.

177
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,632
I hope you got to Jeongseon safely.

178
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:56,585
It must be difficult
to settle down at a new place.

179
00:13:57,294 --> 00:14:00,839
But give me a call
once things get less hectic.

180
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,050
I wonder how you're doing.

181
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,887
Don't skip your meals.

182
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,514
Okay?

183
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,614
PERSONNEL TRANSFER FOR KANG DONG-JU
TO DOLDAM HOSPITAL, JEONGSEON

184
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,003
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

185
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,779
Excuse me.

186
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,157
-May I have more pickles?
-Sure.

187
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,201
I, KANG DONG-JU,

188
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,848
RESIGN AS OF TODAY

189
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:43,984
I'd like to resign

190
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,530
as of today.

191
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,998
Hey, wake up. Hey.

192
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,709
-Call 911 now. Hurry!
-Okay.

193
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,711
Hey.

194
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,046
-Do you work here?
-Yes.

195
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,091
-Do you have a defibrillator?
-We do. I'll bring it.

196
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,224
Don't come in.

197
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,278
Do you know how to use it?

198
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,656
No, I was taught once,
but I don't remember.

199
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,283
Keep pressing here.

200
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,827
-Press hard with two hands.
-Okay.

201
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,544
What are you doing?

202
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,921
I'm trying to save this man
from a heart attack.

203
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,844
Are you insane? Get your foot off!

204
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,013
This man is dying!
What do you think you're doing?

205
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,765
What about you?
Are you trying to kill him?

206
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,183
-Hey.
-Yes?

207
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,561
Stop doing that and help him stand up.

208
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,354
Don't stop. Keep going.

209
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,898
I said stop it and help him up.

210
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:10,279
I'm a doctor at Geosan Medical Center.

211
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,115
Don't stop. He will die
once you stop pumping.

212
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:16,660
If you want to play doctor,
you shouldn't be drunk.

213
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,996
And if you're drunk,
you shouldn't step up.

214
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,416
This is why you were sent
to a small local branch.

215
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,793
Hey.

216
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,755
Get him up if you don't want
to see a dead body.

217
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,048
Are you insane?

218
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,342
This is so annoying.

219
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,343
Step aside.

220
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,306
Will you take the responsibility
if he dies?

221
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,932
What if I save him?

222
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,185
You can't save him. I bet my life on it.

223
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,313
Okay.

224
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,023
Deal.

225
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,733
Darn you.

226
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,863
Move.

227
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,865
-I said, move!
-Okay.

228
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,076
-Grab him.
-Okay.

229
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,285
-Help him get up.
-Okay.

230
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,832
-Get him up.
-Okay.

231
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,212
Pull in right under

232
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,923
the xiphoid process

233
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:15,385
as if you are gently pushing the place up.

234
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,387
And get it out at once.

235
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,023
-Look.
-He did it.

236
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:34,196
All right. Hey, man.

237
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,825
You should chew well.

238
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,244
Thank you very much. Thank you.

239
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,751
Well?

240
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:49,503
He's alive.

241
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,557
Let go.

242
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,322
What are you doing?

243
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,449
What are you doing in my kitchen?

244
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,202
Let me use some of your tools. Guys.

245
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,121
Hold this.

246
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,043
Damn it. Let go of me.

247
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,257
Tools? Why?

248
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,386
He bet on his life and lost.

249
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,181
Excuse me.

250
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,725
If this is a joke, it's not funny.

251
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,560
No one said it's a joke.

252
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,520
You lost. Your life is mine.

253
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,857
Well, cutting your wrist
is equivalent to taking your life, right?

254
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,945
Why didn't you sharpen this?

255
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,781
I use my strength to cut things.

256
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,160
That's why the blade is all ruined.

257
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,664
If the blade is dull,

258
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:11,251
you can't cut anything clean.

259
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,462
Don't splatter blood all over.

260
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,632
My boys had a hard time
cleaning up all the blood last time.

261
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,219
-Blood?
-It looks much better now.

262
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,185
Are you really cutting my wrist off?

263
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,436
Are you serious?

264
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,439
You're a man. Stick to your words.

265
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,524
That's what a man is.

266
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,568
No objections, right?

267
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,529
Who are you?

268
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,614
Are you a gangster?

269
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,326
I'm more used to using a knife.

270
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,872
Hey, don't worry about it.

271
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,042
It'll hurt, but it won't take long.

272
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:58,006
All right. I'll cut off
your tendons and bones.

273
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,885
-I'll cut them off at once.
-No!

274
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:02,928
Darn it!

275
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,849
What are you doing? Go and send him off.

276
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:20,112
Please call the security guard.

277
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:21,780
-Pardon?
-Where is it?

278
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,991
Call the police now!

279
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,117
There he is.

280
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,924
Gosh. Where is it?

281
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,182
Seriously. Taxi!

282
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,184
Taxi! Over here!

283
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,355
Go!

284
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,822
AVAILABLE

285
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,701
Where should I take you, sir?

286
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:13,540
Sir, where are you going?

287
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,972
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

288
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:43,111
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

289
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,164
REGISTRATION

290
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,834
Excuse me.

291
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:02,672
Sorry. We're closed.

292
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,508
I'm not here to be treated.

293
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,051
Is it for the discharge procedure?

294
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,178
Then, please go to window number two.

295
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,357
I'm Kang Dong-ju. I'm a doctor.

296
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,942
I'm a surgeon from Geosan Medical Center.

297
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:26,154
I've been transferred
to this hospital as of today.

298
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:30,826
Could I see the letter of appointment?

299
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:31,827
In fact,

300
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:36,540
something happened on the way here
and I lost it.

301
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,834
-If you call the hospital--
-It's 8 p.m.

302
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,919
No one would be working now.

303
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,755
I think you have to wait
until tomorrow to confirm it.

304
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,799
Wait.

305
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:50,053
I couldn't find a place to stay
as I came here in such a hurry.

306
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:53,306
Is there any way you could
help me with that?

307
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,392
I'm sorry,

308
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,769
but this hospital
provides only our employees

309
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,146
with benefits like that.

310
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,482
I can't help you unless
I confirm your identity.

311
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:07,214
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

312
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:29,736
What's going on?

313
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,364
Where am I?

314
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:37,661
Don't worry. The surgery was successful.

315
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:38,995
Surgery?

316
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,539
Your right hand.

317
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,792
Thanks for the present.

318
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,842
No!

319
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,321
I just contacted the main hospital.

320
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,117
-Sorry?
-Please follow me.

321
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,326
Doctor Kang Dong-ju.

322
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,376
EMERGENCY CENTER

323
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,386
He is the president of Doldam Hospital.

324
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,848
It's nice to meet you. I'm Yeo Un-yeong.

325
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,475
I'm Kang Dong-ju, GS.

326
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,685
GS: GENERAL SURGERY

327
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:47,022
I wish they had sent a physician.

328
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,232
Pardon?

329
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:53,111
I'm not saying that
I have a problem with you.

330
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:56,823
We already have
a competent head of General Surgery.

331
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:59,117
We also have a resident.

332
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,327
That's why I said that.

333
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:04,247
Our hospital is a general hospital
with all sorts of department.

334
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,375
Internal Medicine, General Surgery,
Family Medicine, and Emergency.

335
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,294
RECEPTIONIST

336
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:10,879
We have a lot of patients.

337
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,423
You will be very surprised.

338
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,343
"Rembrandt, the painter of light.

339
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,428
He left a few self-portraits."

340
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:23,099
"His self-portrait painted
in his early years looks like his son..."

341
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:26,061
Anyway, welcome to Doldam Hospital.

342
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,189
I'm Jang Gi-tae,
the head of Administrative Office.

343
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:33,068
That's okay.
You don't need to worry about me.

344
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,528
I'm not planning
to work here for a long time.

345
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,865
I'll stay here
for about one or two months.

346
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,285
If I can't go back
to Geosan Medical Center within that time,

347
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,746
I'll find a job
at another big hospital in Seoul.

348
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:49,292
I thought I should tell you
before I start working here.

349
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,630
I see. I fully understand
what you're trying to say.

350
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:00,053
Does he not like this hospital?

351
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:02,806
He won't even last a week.
I'll bet 50,000 won.

352
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:06,059
He gave me a good first impression.
I liked him.

353
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,310
Three days.

354
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,813
Then I'll bet 100,000 won.
He'll leave in 3 days for sure.

355
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:11,981
Good morning.

356
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,611
Or not.

357
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,117
Doctor Yun is leaving soon, right?

358
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,578
Mind your own business.

359
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,874
What about the handsome doctor?

360
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,335
Where is he now?

361
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,462
He said he wanted to change his clothes,

362
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,631
so I took him to the staff room.

363
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,342
He wanted to get changed?

364
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,599
-Wait.
-Oh, no.

365
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:35,356
Seo-jeong.

366
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:57,670
Why are you here?

367
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,427
What are you doing here?

368
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,930
I was going to ask you the same thing.

369
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:10,683
How did you...

370
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,521
Since when did you work here?

371
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:18,733
I asked you first.
What are you doing here?

372
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,530
I've been transferred
to this hospital as of yesterday.

373
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,199
-You've been transferred?
-Yes.

374
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,536
I'll be working here for a while.

375
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:30,578
It just happened.

376
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,997
How long will you be working here?

377
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,457
It's your turn to answer.

378
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:39,420
-How long have you worked here?
-How long will you be working here?

379
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,550
Have you been working here since then?

380
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,387
Since that day five years ago,

381
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,724
have you been working here until now?

382
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,561
Forget it. You don't have to answer me.

383
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,396
Why didn't you call me?

384
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,818
For a month since you disappeared,

385
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,239
I left you text and voice messages
every single day.

386
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,370
Did you even check them?

387
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:16,749
No.

388
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,898
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

389
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:35,453
PRESIDENT OF DOLDAM HOSPITAL
YEO UN-YEONG

390
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,582
We have a patient. Get ready.

391
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,667
Yes, ma'am.

392
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,014
Give me.

393
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:03,815
Move him to the emergency room.

394
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:05,566
Unfasten the seat belt.

395
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,538
Sir, do you hear me?

396
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,957
Sir.

397
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,460
What? This is my car.

398
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,463
Gosh.

399
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:39,892
Over there.

400
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:40,977
Be careful.

401
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,234
He is conscious.

402
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,653
-What are his vital signs?
-It is 70 over 40, pulse 140.

403
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,530
Lung sounds diminished on the left side.

404
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,492
-Doctor.
-It's a tension.

405
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,411
Administer 10L of oxygen
through a reserve mask

406
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:00,038
and prepare saline for hydration.

407
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,956
Also, I need a dressing set
with 24 gauge needles--

408
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,834
If he's bleeding because of a car crash,
it might be hemopneumothorax.

409
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,089
-Please prepare 16 gauge needles.
-Okay.

410
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,643
What's wrong with your right hand?

411
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,062
Are you hurt?

412
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,856
-Prepare a chest tube.
-Okay.

413
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:33,112
-What are his vital signs?
-It is 80 over 40, pulse 120.

414
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,364
It has increased a little bit
after some fluids were injected.

415
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:38,117
What are you doing?
He is complaining of abdominal pain.

416
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,286
Why are you talking like that?
That doesn't sound like you.

417
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,497
Is a resident allowed to talk down
to a specialist?

418
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,207
If so, I will.

419
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,958
I have no idea what you mean.

420
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:49,128
You were a senior resident five years ago.

421
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,088
What are you saying?

422
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,631
I'm studying Cardiovascular Surgery.

423
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:55,468
Will you focus on the patient's condition,
Doctor Kang Dong-ju?

424
00:34:56,594 --> 00:35:00,264
He has muscle guarding.
It means he has an internal hemorrhage.

425
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:03,726
We need to put in a chest tube
and send him to a bigger hospital.

426
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,269
Palpation has limits.

427
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,855
We have an ultrasound device, too.

428
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,780
The hospital may seem small,
but we have pretty much everything.

429
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,264
He seems to have hemorrhage
in the spleen, right?

430
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,808
It looks serious.

431
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,061
-What should we do?
-It's simple.

432
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,188
We should send him
to a bigger hospital without delay.

433
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,357
How long does it take
to the nearest hospital?

434
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,484
It takes about two hours by car.

435
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,736
One and a half if you step on it.

436
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,365
He might die from excessive bleeding
before reaching the hospital.

437
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,783
You'd better treat him here instead.

438
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:03,161
This is not something we can do here.

439
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,621
-Don't you see that?
-Are you not feeling confident?

440
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:07,915
Cutting a patient's abdomen open

441
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,793
in an inappropriate condition
is no better than murder.

442
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,753
It's not that I can't do it
but that I won't do it.

443
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,714
Quiet down!

444
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:44,243
-What are his vital signs?
-It is 60 over 40, pulse 120.

445
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,537
He has hemorrhage in the spleen.

446
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,707
He is unidentified,
and we don't know the cause of injury.

447
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:53,002
He drove his car here
and hit another car in the parking lot.

448
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,712
The car is a wreck.

449
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:57,298
What are you doing standing here?
Keep doing your job.

450
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,966
Yes, Doctor.

451
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:04,972
Get him an intubation and a ventilator.

452
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,142
-Prepare for ligation.
-Are you

453
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,646
-going to operate on him here now?
-Inject 20mg of Etomidate.

454
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,450
He's fast.

455
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:27,870
Get him propofol continuous infusion
and an ampule of rocuronium.

456
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,372
Yes, sir.

457
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,876
Set the ventilator on CMV mode.

458
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,631
-Pass me the tube.
-We don't have time for that.

459
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,883
-Use a trocar.
-Pass me the trocar.

460
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,885
Trocar? Do they have it here?

461
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:58,317
-How much are we getting?
-It's been 400cc and still running.

462
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,403
Okay. It's my turn.

463
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,988
Hey.

464
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,741
Step aside. If you don't want to do it,
just move out of the way.

465
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,745
Are you cutting a patient's abdomen
open right here?

466
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,748
This is neither an operating room
nor a hybrid room.

467
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,126
-What if it gets contaminated?
-Nurse.

468
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,669
Get this thing out of my way.

469
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:20,298
What? Did you call me "this thing"?

470
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:21,882
What are you...

471
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,677
Let go of me!

472
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,013
-Scalpel.
-Stop right there.

473
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:30,182
Excuse me. Have you all gone insane?

474
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,018
He will bleed a lot. Get ready.

475
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,686
Are you really a doctor?

476
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:40,693
Suction.

477
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,451
Suction.

478
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:52,747
Okay.

479
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,671
I got it.

480
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,507
Already?

481
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:04,675
Pass me the hemostat.

482
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,635
HEMOSTAT:
FORCEPS USED TO COMPRESS BLOOD VESSELS

483
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,516
Hold this.

484
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,810
Silk three.

485
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:34,955
Stay focused.

486
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,564
What was that? What is he doing?

487
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:22,503
What am I watching now?

488
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,843
Cover him with film
and move him to the operating room.

489
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:32,096
I will operate on him for ruptured spleen
and damaged intestine, okay?

490
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,222
-Yes, Doctor.
-Yes, Doctor.

491
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:39,145
Who on earth is he?

492
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,564
What? Do you have a problem?

493
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,277
That was reckless, irresponsible,

494
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,863
-and dangerous.
-Do you think so?

495
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,323
We had no choice.

496
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:54,076
It means his life was at stake.

497
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,288
Do you think you can explain
to the patient

498
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:58,914
what he's gone through?

499
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,000
Are you talking
about the human rights of patients?

500
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,710
Or code of medical ethics?

501
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,172
Don't bother asking me about such things.

502
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:09,175
In my premises,
there is only one thing that matters.

503
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,801
Saving the patients.

504
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,678
No matter what.

505
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:18,601
I don't give a damn about anything else.

506
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,567
OPERATING ROOM

507
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:31,238
Prepare 10 packs of RBC and 8 FFP.

508
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,115
I'll get the operating room ready.

509
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:40,956
OPERATING ROOM

510
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:52,676
What on earth is this place?

511
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,844
OPERATING

512
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,190
Aren't you going in?

513
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,361
I can't. I'm not allowed.

514
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,823
Why didn't you make an objection?

515
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:18,619
Cutting the abdomen open
in an emergency room

516
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,704
was totally against common sense.

517
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,583
He didn't take the patient's safety
into consideration.

518
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,671
What about you?

519
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,925
You put off the surgery
on your own patient to attend to a VIP,

520
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,176
but he ended up dying.

521
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:37,805
You tried to make a name
for yourself only to get ousted.

522
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,809
Is that what's right for you?

523
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:47,314
Did you hear that from In-su?

524
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,358
I heard it from one of the people here.

525
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:53,737
Someone from Geosan Medical Center
told him everything about you.

526
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,532
It was inevitable.

527
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:02,121
I had to take the risk because that was
the only way to seize an opportunity.

528
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,707
What opportunity?

529
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,085
An opportunity to prove myself.

530
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:09,420
To whom?

531
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:11,005
You really don't know?

532
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,424
To the higher ups at the hospital.

533
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,718
It's all about the connections there.

534
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:19,471
People like me who have
no background must do anything.

535
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:20,848
I must look for the right connection

536
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,559
or prove myself by treating a VIP patient.

537
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,901
What happened to you
in the past five years?

538
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:37,031
You became a coward making excuses.

539
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,284
What changed you?

540
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:46,749
Was life that hard?

541
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,881
Did you say you'll be here
for two months at most?

542
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:58,677
Let's see if you can even last that long.

543
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,159
I like you.

544
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,130
This is your last year
as a resident, right?

545
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:37,091
Let's get married when you're done.

546
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:39,760
I'm sorry.

547
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,496
That won't make it go away.

548
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:13,877
What's wrong?

549
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,754
Does seeing him again...

550
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,132
makes your heart flutter?

551
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,466
Get it together.

552
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,428
This is a hallucination.

553
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,471
It's just a hallucination.

554
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:26,682
It's a hallucination.

555
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,715
I have something to tell you.

556
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:02,384
I'm tired. Let's do it later.

557
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,540
This song is great, right?

558
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:36,919
She sounds the best from a cassette tape.

559
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:38,754
Oh, gosh.

560
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,005
My goodness.

561
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,514
I said, I have something to say.

562
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,810
The human rights of patients
and code of medical ethics.

563
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,939
-Let's say you're beyond all that--
-Hey.

564
00:46:57,814 --> 00:46:59,441
How many patients have you killed?

565
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,820
I'm not talking about the times
you read out the time of death.

566
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:07,991
How many patients died
on your hands as a doctor?

567
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:10,744
Just one.

568
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:13,080
Right before I got sent here.

569
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,791
Add 10 to that.

570
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:20,462
Come back when you killed
that many patients.

571
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:24,633
I'll hear what you have to say then.

572
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:35,018
How's your right wrist?
Is that still intact?

573
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:37,312
Don't lose it.

574
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:40,107
I'll come looking for it
whenever I need it.

575
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,572
I'm sorry,

576
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,366
but I won't stay for so long.

577
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:51,410
I'll try to leave in a month.

578
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:53,120
Shorter than that if possible.

579
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,497
I'm going to get out
of this stupid hospital as soon as I can.

580
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:58,125
And when you do,

581
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,501
do you have a place to go?

582
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,920
I'll go back to where I belong.

583
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:09,678
Who says they want you back?

584
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:12,681
Let me tell you this.

585
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,934
They didn't send me out here
because I'm incompetent.

586
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,311
I was just unlucky.

587
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:20,063
I didn't spend my entire life
studying, practicing,

588
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,734
and dissecting to get stuck here

589
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,653
in some small hospital in the countryside.

590
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:30,407
What are you getting at?

591
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,492
No matter what happens,

592
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,996
I'm going back to the main hospital.

593
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:07,986
Doctor Kang.

594
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:12,282
You got a call from Seoul.
It's your mother.

595
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:15,035
She tried your cellphone,
but she couldn't get through.

596
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,620
So she called the hospital.

597
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:22,125
IN-SU

598
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:26,463
Later.

599
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:29,758
Tell her I'm busy.

600
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,469
Hello, In-su. It's me.

601
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:35,847
Hello?

602
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,808
Doctor Kang is very busy right now.

603
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:42,145
I understand. Sorry for bothering you.

604
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:51,446
What are you talking about?

605
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:54,658
President Yeo and President Do
are friends?

606
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:55,784
That's right.

607
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:59,538
President Do and President Yeo

608
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:01,665
are old friends from college.

609
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:03,917
I see.

610
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,337
You didn't forget to visit
President Yeo, did you?

611
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:14,052
You have to make sure he likes you.

612
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,263
The only way to change President Do's mind

613
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:18,932
is going after President Yeo.
Do you hear me?

614
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:23,687
This is another piece of information
I got for you.

615
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:26,898
President Yeo loves playing Go.

616
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,734
And he loves orchids.

617
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,361
He's crazy about oriental orchids.

618
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:34,281
In-su. I don't know a thing
about playing Go.

619
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:38,285
And plants look all the same to me.

620
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:39,703
Stop being so stubborn.

621
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:42,080
Do you want to stay there for good?

622
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,547
What is it?

623
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,591
Well...

624
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:03,226
It's all right. You can say it.

625
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:07,272
I was too tied up in the morning

626
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:09,316
and forgot to come
and introduce myself properly.

627
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:13,612
If I made any mistakes,

628
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:15,071
please do understand.

629
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:23,747
You didn't do anything like that.

630
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,707
Really?

631
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,628
Oh, right.

632
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:33,590
-I heard you met Teacher Kim.
-Pardon?

633
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:36,635
-Teacher Kim?
-The head of General Surgery.

634
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,597
Is that what he's called?

635
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:45,560
He may appear rude at first,
but you can learn a lot from him.

636
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,521
I'm not sure about that.

637
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,898
Make sure you are very polite.

638
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:52,818
Make sure he thinks nice of you, okay?

639
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,363
Yes. I will do my best.

640
00:51:57,322 --> 00:52:00,033
-Okay. See yourself out.
-Yes.

641
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:04,704
What is it?

642
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,457
Do you have anything else to say?

643
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,292
Well...

644
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:11,086
President Yeo!

645
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:13,839
-Doctor Yun is having a seizure!
-Again?

646
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:17,425
-Call Teacher Kim immediately.
-Okay.

647
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:30,188
Seo-jeong.

648
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:34,276
Doctor Yun.

649
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:37,445
Let go of that.

650
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,204
Don't step in.

651
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:47,956
Trust Myeong-sim.

652
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,125
You've done well so far.

653
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,753
You can go back to the operating room
in just a few days.

654
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,922
I'm dead because of you.

655
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,049
I keep hearing voices.

656
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,677
It's because you believe you hear them.

657
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:04,347
You are already well
and you are completely healed.

658
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,765
So please.

659
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,851
Give me that.

660
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,314
Give me...

661
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:14,608
the scalpel.

662
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,028
Help me.

663
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,158
Help me.

664
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:28,371
I'm dead because of you.

665
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:29,998
Seo-jeong.

666
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:35,378
What's wrong?

667
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:37,797
What is it?

668
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:41,718
Why are you holding a scalpel?

669
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,096
I like you, Seo-jeong.

670
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:57,901
Give it to me.

671
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,072
Come on.

672
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:06,534
No.

673
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,204
No, Seo-jeong!

674
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,131
Bring elastic bandage. Hurry!

675
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:37,774
That's enough.

676
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:08,346
She overdosed on sedatives.

677
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,432
Her vital signs are unstable.

678
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,726
Does it look like she cut an artery?

679
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:16,229
Keep her hydrated
and move her to the operating room.

680
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:17,897
Okay.

681
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,966
-Is the tourniquet ready?
-It is.

682
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:29,677
-Keep the pressure at 200.
-Yes, Doctor.

683
00:56:58,498 --> 00:56:59,582
Tourniquet on.

684
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,478
Her wound is small but deep.

685
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,565
An artery, a nerve, and two tendons.

686
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,776
Three tendons. We have to put
five together. Have you ever done this?

687
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,573
Have you?

688
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:35,869
No, I've only seen a video.

689
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,203
It's my first time.

690
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:40,415
If you make a single mistake,

691
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:43,626
I'll cut off your wrist
and give it to Seo-jeong.

692
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:44,794
Understand?

693
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:53,595
Let's begin.

694
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:56,264
Mosquito.

695
