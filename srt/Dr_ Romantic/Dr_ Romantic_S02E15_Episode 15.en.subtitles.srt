1
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:00,435
Honey. Can you come home this weekend?

2
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,480
Byeol misses her daddy.

3
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,111
What happened to moving hospitals?

4
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,074
Can our family finally
get to live together? Please?

5
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,586
Goodness.

6
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,899
Nurse Park.

7
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,029
By any chance, did you tell Doctor Kim?

8
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,407
No.

9
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,786
Isn't that something
you should tell him yourself?

10
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:05,291
If you've made your decision,
do tell him quickly.

11
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,962
He needs time to get a new EM board.

12
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,588
EM BOARD: EMERGENCY MEDICINE SPECIALIST

13
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,173
You're right.

14
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,198
Yes, what is it?

15
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,201
What?

16
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,995
A death on the table?

17
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,580
DEATH THAT OCCURS DURING SURGERY

18
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,549
The second son
of Sejen Group's chairman just died?

19
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:55,758
What?

20
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,093
GEOSAN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

21
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,929
Professor Park is the best surgeon.

22
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,764
What happened to him?

23
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,683
I see.

24
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,020
The main hospital
wasn't very happy about that.

25
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,064
"Why did he start taking away
our VIP patients

26
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,108
as soon as became Doldam's president?"

27
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,402
"Why did he take the second son
of Sejen Group's chairman

28
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,154
out of all the patients
who needed surgery?"

29
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,698
"Is he showing off? Is this a show?"

30
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,783
There was a lot of talk behind his back.

31
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,702
My goodness.

32
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,829
A death on the table?

33
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,497
Exactly.

34
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,334
A death on the table now, of all times.

35
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,046
This is how fate helps me yet again.

36
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,380
Pardon?

37
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:36,841
What do you mean?

38
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,970
You need to go
to Doldam Hospital tomorrow.

39
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,682
Well… Let's see.

40
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:59,030
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

41
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,366
What?

42
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,117
Doctor Do In-beom?

43
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,661
You saw Doctor Do In-beom?

44
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,121
Nurse Um, you know Doctor Do too?

45
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,917
Of course, I know him well.
He worked here at Doldam for two years.

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,585
He was here for two years?

47
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,545
Wow, I didn't know that.

48
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,923
You're in a different department,
so that can happen.

49
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,967
I only heard about him too.

50
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,802
I heard he's aloof and cool.

51
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:25,139
Gosh, he's not that great.
More like a sensitive nerd.

52
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:28,685
You're right. He does have
that sensitive side

53
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,312
which makes him seem unapproachable.

54
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,147
But that's just the way he talks.

55
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,816
He's a softie inside.

56
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,075
Doctor Yoon, how do you know Doctor Do?

57
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,994
-What?
-Yeah.

58
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,372
You talk about him
as if you two are very close.

59
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:50,915
I do?

60
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,335
Are you acquainted with Doctor Do?

61
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,797
No, not at all.
We don't have any kind of relationship.

62
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,467
I saw him a few times
while I was at the main hospital.

63
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,636
That's all.

64
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,139
I'm serious.

65
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,311
Gosh, the coffee tastes really nice today,
doesn't it?

66
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,607
Who wants another cup?

67
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,156
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT, STAFF ONLY

68
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,243
Run a full lab test for Mr. Park tomorrow.

69
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,494
Yes, Doctor.

70
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,793
Excuse me, where is Mr. Yeo?

71
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,253
Over there.

72
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,351
His vitals are all stable.

73
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,853
You need to go down and get some rest.

74
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:57,273
I already got
some sleep early this morning.

75
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,859
Don't worry about me.

76
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,199
Goodness.

77
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,710
Doctor Do.

78
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,045
Long time no see, Ms. Oh.

79
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,090
Doctor Kim.

80
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,269
What brings you here without notice?

81
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,607
I finally heard about Mr. Yeo yesterday.

82
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,859
I heard he has terminal lung cancer.

83
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,277
Yes.

84
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,823
We found it a little too late.

85
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,576
How are you doing?

86
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,620
Me? Why do you ask?

87
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,414
I heard that you have CTS.

88
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,873
CTS: CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME

89
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,209
Word got around fast.

90
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,921
Seo-jeong is worried to death.

91
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:05,091
She told me to stick around
until you get treated.

92
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,886
If I don't do that,
she might fly in any day now.

93
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,723
Goodness, that Mad Whale.

94
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,020
Anyway,

95
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,190
what really brings you here?

96
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,777
Tell me.

97
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,405
What's the real reason
you came down so abruptly?

98
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,574
A fact-finding committee

99
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,577
will come down in the afternoon.

100
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,537
What?

101
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,709
They'll investigate the death on the table
that happened here yesterday.

102
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,462
And I'm a member of that committee.

103
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,509
There are four fact-finders
who came from a law firm.

104
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,179
Medical fact-finders
include a cardiologist

105
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,346
from the main hospital,

106
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,849
an anesthesiologist, and me,
a GS, so there's a total of three.

107
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,351
Mr. Song Hyeon-cheol is the man in charge.

108
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,606
That's a lot of people from a law firm.

109
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,567
That's not a usual number of people
for a committee that investigates

110
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,943
a death on the table.

111
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,446
What do you mean?

112
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,283
It looks like his next target is…

113
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,204
Doldam Hospital.

114
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,417
You all have my full trust.

115
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,668
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

116
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,547
So what?

117
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,550
How can we avoid this?

118
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,222
Professor Park Min-gook.

119
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,850
-What?
-You need to lose him…

120
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,604
to save Doldam, Doctor Kim.

121
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:06,504
TRUST RELATIONSHIP

122
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,550
What? There will be
a fact-finding committee?

123
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,553
I'm sure Sejen Group is
really putting the pressure on them.

124
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,096
Their son died.

125
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,431
This is quicker than I expected.

126
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:21,018
If something goes wrong,
Professor Park may take the full blame.

127
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,480
We should agree on one story
before they barge in--

128
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,606
I don't want to lie

129
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,068
and tell the same story
just to avoid the blame.

130
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,070
Why are you doing this?

131
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:35,825
We went ahead with his surgery with
your confirmation as the anesthesiologist.

132
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:40,663
I remember that I warned him enough
about the WPW syndrome.

133
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,251
Will you avoid the blame all by yourself?

134
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,670
I don't care if it's
the fact-finding committee or whatever.

135
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,922
I'll tell them everything exactly
as it happened.

136
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,132
I won't add or hide anything.

137
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,342
-No unnecessary comments either.
-Professor Sim!

138
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,599
Professor Park, you're here.

139
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:05,896
I already made my position clear.
You can hear about it from Doctor Yang.

140
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,447
Don't worry, sir. I'll persuade her.

141
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:26,876
Don't worry.

142
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,878
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

143
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,214
Mr. Jang. What's going on?

144
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:37,678
Professor Park's VIP patient
died during the operation yesterday.

145
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,931
It looks like they're here for him.

146
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,602
The VIP patient?

147
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,729
You mean, that kid, Kang Ik-joon?

148
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,689
Yes, that's right.

149
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,488
Professor Sim.

150
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,203
TREATMENT ROOM 3

151
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,128
You have to think about him.

152
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,631
We'll all end up going down together!

153
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,549
It's not that simple.

154
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,552
-What's going on?
-We'll all suffer from this!

155
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,055
We're all in this together!

156
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,432
Professor Sim.

157
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,270
Excuse me. Are you Doctor Cha Eun-jae?

158
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:29,939
TREATMENT ROOM 3

159
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:58,426
THE ODDBALL PROJECT

160
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,303
OPERATION RECORDS

161
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,018
What are you doing?

162
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,069
You look familiar. Your name is…

163
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,071
Seo Woo-jin. I'm a general surgeon.

164
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,489
I'm a GS too.

165
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:24,577
I know. You're two years my senior.
Doctor Do In-beom.

166
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,873
Anyway, why do you have this file?

167
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,041
Homework from Doctor Kim.

168
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,252
You must be good.

169
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,254
Yes, kind of.

170
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,305
Please excuse me. It's an emergency.

171
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,868
No. That's not it.

172
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,788
Yes.

173
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,372
Yes, all right.

174
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,250
TREATMENT ROOM 1

175
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,132
May I leave these here for a while?

176
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,262
TREATMENT ROOM 1

177
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,276
What's his condition?

178
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,946
He got into a TA by himself.
He drove into a tree head-first.

179
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,156
It seems he drove under the influence.

180
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,034
-Do people still drink and drive nowadays?
-When we got to the scene,

181
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,202
he gave a verbal response.

182
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,079
His abdomen was behind the steering wheel.

183
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,039
-What are his vitals?
-80 over 40.

184
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,332
Do you have his identity?

185
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,667
We haven't confirmed it yet.

186
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,502
You can register him as unidentified male.

187
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,587
Establish both lines and give him fluid.

188
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,923
And run an OP lab test.
Get two emergency RBC packs.

189
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,508
-Should I get the MAC ready?
-Yes.

190
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:03,551
Sir.

191
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,594
Sir?

192
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,349
He's at 1, 2, 4 on the GCS.
A total of seven points.

193
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:12,393
Let's intubate him.

194
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,645
-We need to do the RSI.
-Yes, I'll bring it.

195
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,273
Give me one ampoule each
of etomidate and rocuronium.

196
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,275
-Yes, Doctor.
-The MAC is ready.

197
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,910
His abdomen is bloated.

198
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,329
-Let's look at the FAST.
-Okay.

199
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,207
BAE MOON-JUNG

200
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,209
JEONG IN-SU

201
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,211
DO IN-BEOM

202
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,801
GENERAL SURGEON DO IN-BEOM

203
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,437
GENERAL SURGEON DO IN-BEOM

204
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,455
There's no hemopneumothorax.

205
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,916
It's not a cardiac tamponade either.

206
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,919
But this is obviously hemoperitoneum.

207
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,004
BLOOD IN THE ABDONIMAL CAVITY

208
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,049
Bingo.

209
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,800
Does his brain look okay?

210
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,265
Hey. Doctor Do.

211
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,391
Long time no see, Doctor.

212
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,769
What happened? When did you get here?

213
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:37,853
Just now.

214
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,897
Long time no see, Nurse Park.

215
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,857
Yes, it has been a while.

216
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,485
Hey, what's going on?

217
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,280
60 over 30, 140 bpm.

218
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,283
Give him normal saline on full drop
and two more packs of RBC.

219
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,242
Yes, Doctor.

220
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,037
Was he unconscious to begin with?

221
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,790
Yes, he's drunk, so we aren't sure
if he's unconscious

222
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:00,125
because of a brain injury or alcohol.

223
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,795
-Should we take the brain CT first?
-No.

224
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:06,256
-I'll work on the hemoperitoneum first.
-Without a brain evaluation?

225
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,426
If we don't stop him from bleeding,
he won't have any time to be evaluated.

226
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,306
Then let's open him up right away.

227
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,058
-Doctor Yoon?
-Yes?

228
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,602
Call Doctor Nam Do-il and Ms. Oh
to the OR.

229
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:19,728
Yes, Doctor.

230
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,438
Doctor Seo and I will open him up,

231
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,774
stop the bleeding,
then move him to the OR.

232
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,275
You'll open him up in here?

233
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,527
Can you do this?

234
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,823
-Doctor Jeong.
-Yes?

235
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,491
Can you sedate him?

236
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,536
We'll perform a laparotomy
on the unidentified male.

237
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,745
I'll get ready.

238
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,497
Goodness.

239
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,463
What's going on?

240
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:01,603
Ik-joon wanted to give this
to the lady doctor.

241
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,274
It just got here from Seoul this morning.

242
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,617
Hey.

243
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,995
I'll eat the macarons after the surgery,

244
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,747
so leave some for me. Okay?

245
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,138
All right then.

246
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,891
Excuse me.

247
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,061
I have a question.

248
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,232
Doctor Do In-beom is here?

249
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,153
Yes, he's performing a laparotomy
on a patient in the hybrid room.

250
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,405
I see, two surgeons are greeting
one another

251
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,324
by performing a laparotomy together.

252
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:56,700
I'm getting curious.

253
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,370
The patient will come in after
his bleeding is under control,

254
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,581
-so let's hurry up and get ready.
-Yes, ma'am.

255
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,417
-What are his vitals?
-It's low. 60 over 40.

256
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,711
Okay. I'll perform the surgery.
Let's change positions.

257
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:08,754
He's my patient.

258
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,965
-I'll stop his bleeding.
-I didn't drive here all night

259
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,717
to be a second-year's assistant.

260
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:14,760
Exactly.

261
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,263
I can't be a nuisance to a doctor
who drove all night long.

262
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,475
I'll get his bleeding under control.
Scalpel.

263
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,579
Let's begin. Gauze.

264
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,421
Forceps.

265
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,173
Bovie.

266
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,159
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

267
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,243
You're here.

268
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,872
I was wondering if I should
stop by your office or not.

269
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,748
Who are these people?

270
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,003
President Park got into major trouble.

271
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:32,546
What can we do?

272
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,217
We'll have to pretend to
conduct an investigation to settle this.

273
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,053
It's just a formality. Don't mind us.

274
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,975
-He'll see you at the president's office.
-Really?

275
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,476
-Let's go.
-Yes, let's go.

276
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,857
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

277
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:54,943
So?

278
00:19:55,694 --> 00:20:00,240
Do you want me to get rid of him
and promote you to president?

279
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,994
Hey. Get up there and do your job right.

280
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,830
Be just and fair as a fellow doctor.

281
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,832
Don't be biased in any way.

282
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,879
This is your chance to get rid of Park.
Don't you want to catch it?

283
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:17,591
If you're here to find the facts,
make sure you do that right.

284
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,552
Stop acting like an old fart.

285
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,305
You have the weirdest personality.

286
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,307
That's why you still
live like this in this place.

287
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,225
What?

288
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,061
Let's go. We should go. Right?

289
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,564
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

290
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,696
It's not just blood.

291
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,283
-What's this?
-His stomach must be perforated.

292
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,286
-I see sea snails and noodles everywhere.
-My gosh.

293
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,789
-Irrigation.
-Suction.

294
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,754
His liver and spleen look fine.

295
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,381
Keep the irrigation coming.

296
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,761
I found the perforation site.

297
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,389
Repair the perforation in the OR.
Control the bleeding for now.

298
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,182
BLEEDING: HEMORRHAGE

299
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,314
What? You can't find it?

300
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:17,901
I heard you have good hands,
but I guess you don't have good eyes.

301
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,325
Gauze.

302
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,829
If you don't find it
in three seconds, I'm going in.

303
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,080
One.

304
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:33,792
Two.

305
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,298
-Three. Move your hands.
-I found it.

306
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,717
It was his mesenteric artery.

307
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,010
Take a look.

308
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:45,971
Hemostat.

309
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,518
Give me the tie.

310
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:58,775
Irrigation.

311
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,747
His BP is coming back.

312
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,206
-Cut.
-Cut.

313
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:19,254
Okay. Let's continue in the OR.

314
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,798
Let's cover him with a surgical drape
and move him to the OR.

315
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:25,010
Before he goes into the OR,
please check his brain and C-spine.

316
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,179
Sure, I'll check before we move him.

317
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,987
NURSING DEPARTMENT

318
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:47,115
-Nurse Joo, portable oxygen, please.
-Sure.

319
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:51,912
Go easy on him.

320
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,623
You didn't have to do that
to a good doctor like him.

321
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,583
So why did you give
the scalpel to a second-year?

322
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:57,542
You made me anxious.

323
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,046
You just wanted to see
what Doctor Seo can do, no?

324
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,426
So you still don't like me, Nurse Park.

325
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,722
I still find you uncomfortable,
that's all.

326
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,978
Nurse Park. Doctor Jeong
and Seo are looking for you.

327
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,271
Here's the portable oxygen.

328
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,189
NURSING DEPARTMENT

329
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,323
What?

330
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,742
May I borrow a pen?

331
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,411
What? Oh, sure.

332
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,539
Are you new here?

333
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,374
Yes, I'm Nurse Joo Young-mi.

334
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,875
I'm Do In-beom, a GS.

335
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,797
Give me a call when the CT scan is out.

336
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,632
Yes, of course.

337
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,092
Thanks, Nurse Joo.

338
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,945
What are you doing right now,
Doctor Do In-beom?

339
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:08,947
Do I know you?

340
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:10,991
Come on, In-beom!

341
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,033
What?

342
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,078
We agreed we'd be strangers at Doldam.
You wanted to do that.

343
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,205
That's not what I'm talking about.

344
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,040
Why are you so mean to everyone?

345
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,877
You were really mean to Doctor Seo.
And what's with you and Nurse Park?

346
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,005
This is how I do my job. So what?

347
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,964
Goodness.

348
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,968
Will you stop pretending like
you're strong and cool?

349
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,928
Try to get along with everyone.

350
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,725
What about you?
Are you studying for the exam?

351
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,185
Your board exam is coming up.

352
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,770
I'll manage that myself.

353
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,397
If you don't pass it on the first try,

354
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,858
I'll make fun of you forever
and call you a bonehead.

355
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,653
My gosh, what's with him?

356
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:51,990
I knew it.

357
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,997
"In-beom"?
How are you two acquainted?

358
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,628
You two have different surnames,
so you can't be siblings.

359
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:08,757
Is he a childhood friend?
A guy from your church?

360
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:13,136
Or is he just a guy you know?

361
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:20,185
There are a lot of items they want us
to cut back on this month.

362
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,645
What can we do?

363
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:24,814
We'll have to put together
the materials to explain our needs.

364
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,568
Goodness, it feels like we're in

365
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,112
an endless fight
with the evaluation committee.

366
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:36,535
Let's just think of this as
both parties doing their jobs well.

367
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,664
They manage and supervise thoroughly,

368
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:44,125
and we continue to demand what we need.

369
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,463
We can only keep a balance…

370
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:52,467
when both parties do their best

371
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,303
to guard their position.

372
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:59,724
Yes, Doctor. I'll do my best
to put the materials together.

373
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:01,643
Doctor Bae.

374
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:08,441
Woo-jin's creditors are gone now, right?
You did that, didn't you?

375
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:12,320
Well, I wouldn't say they're gone.

376
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:17,909
I felt bad seeing Doctor Seo
suffer so much.

377
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:21,079
Since when were you worried about him?

378
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:26,251
You've never cared about anything else
other than bones.

379
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,420
I thought you came to Doldam

380
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:31,923
and decided to stay here for good
to not get involved with the world.

381
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:33,550
I did.

382
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,093
That's true.

383
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,805
Isn't it ever since you saw
that file on Doctor Seo on my desk?

384
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:43,893
SEO AND HIS WIFE, YOO HEE-JAE…

385
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:46,980
Tell me.

386
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:51,735
What's going on between you and Woo-jin?

387
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,362
Aren't you going to tell me?

388
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,407
There's nothing to tell.

389
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:00,952
Then why do you call him "In-beom"?

390
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,495
Will you be quiet?

391
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:13,340
Wait, you aren't two-timing them, are you?
Doctor Do and Nurse Park, I mean.

392
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:16,343
No way. What kind of nonsense is this?

393
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,261
What are you saying?

394
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:21,514
Who's two-timing whom?
Doctor Yoon, are you two-timing?

395
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:24,351
I'm sure one of them is Nurse Park.
Who's the other guy?

396
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:25,977
Goodness, one second.

397
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,813
Who is it? Who's the other guy?

398
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,442
What? Do…

399
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,613
Do…

400
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,491
Doldam Hospital, we can do it.

401
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,285
Doldam, we can do it.

402
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,339
"Two-timing"?

403
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,801
I've never dated anyone before this.

404
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,527
WHY DID THEY MAKE A DRASTIC CHOICE?
A FAMILY OF THREE COMMITS SUICIDE

405
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,285
Yes, come in.

406
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,124
Hey.

407
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,127
Are you busy?

408
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,337
Why? What is it?

409
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:38,341
Well, it's because
I have something to tell you.

410
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,467
Yes, go ahead.

411
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,429
-One second.
-Sure.

412
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:45,932
Yes, Mr. Jang.

413
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:49,936
Really?

414
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,273
I see. I'll be there.

415
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,608
I'm sorry for cutting you off.

416
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,318
The main hospital sent us

417
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,196
a fact-finding committee to investigate

418
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,825
how Professor Park's patient
died during the surgery yesterday.

419
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,620
I have to go up
to the president's office because of that.

420
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,165
Then you should hurry up and go.

421
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:13,460
No, I can spare a moment. What is it?

422
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:17,672
Well, I'm not in a huge hurry.
You should go.

423
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:23,178
Okay then. I'll take care of the urgent
matter first. Let's talk after that.

424
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:24,971
Okay.

425
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,224
Thank you, Doctor Jeong.

426
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,020
-Pardon?
-Whenever I'm away,

427
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:36,941
you're always the doctor in charge.
You know that, don't you?

428
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,613
Yes. Of course.

429
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,156
I know that.

430
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,867
I'll leave it to you then.

431
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,744
Yes, sir.

432
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,088
This is awful.

433
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:04,719
OR 1, OR 2

434
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,056
-Great work.
-Sure.

435
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,098
-Great work.
-Great job.

436
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,016
Doctor Seo.

437
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:13,353
Could you head over
to the staff lounge for a moment?

438
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,897
A fact-finding committee was sent here

439
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,733
from the main hospital
regarding the death on the table.

440
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:22,195
They have a few questions
to ask you and Doctor Yang.

441
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:23,863
Right now?

442
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:28,159
You must be tired after the surgery,
but please do cooperate for a moment.

443
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,538
Sure. I'll get changed and go over there.

444
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,250
Has it begun?

445
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:39,045
Yes, I'd be grateful if you two could
return to your posts too.

446
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,965
Okay, sure. Let's go, Ms. Oh.

447
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,466
Okay.

448
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:45,301
RESTRICTED AREA: OPERATING ROOM

449
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:05,822
STAFF LOUNGE

450
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:10,910
Take a seat.

451
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:12,871
STAFF LOUNGE

452
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:29,053
Let's begin the examination.

453
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,931
Then shall we get started?

454
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,228
I'll ask Doctor Seo first.

455
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:41,733
Were you the first assistant
for Mr. Kang Ik-joon's surgery?

456
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,109
Yes.

457
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:46,779
How many times have you been
Professor Park's first assistant?

458
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,032
I've gone into surgery with him
three times,

459
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,575
and I was the first assistant twice.

460
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:55,747
Doctor Yang, I believe you are
usually Professor Park's first assistant.

461
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,541
Why were you suddenly switched out
during Mr. Kang's surgery?

462
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,501
My specialty is laparoscopy.

463
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,878
OPERATING PERFORMED WITH A CAMERA

464
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,671
But this surgery was a laparotomy.

465
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:05,632
That's why.

466
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:12,472
I heard you were the first person
to suspect that he had WPW syndrome.

467
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:15,141
I became suspicious after I saw his EKG.

468
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:19,062
And I clearly told the surgeon in charge
that I was concerned about his condition.

469
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:22,607
Are you saying you were
against operating on him?

470
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,779
Then why did you open up the OR?

471
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,782
Were you forced by the surgeon in charge?

472
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:36,704
I have no comment.

473
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:38,456
Why not?

474
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,960
This is my team, and they're my teammates
no matter what anyone says.

475
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:45,213
I do not wish to refute
every single thing that my teammate said.

476
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:48,883
But I'd like to get an answer
from you to clarify the truth.

477
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,009
Of course.

478
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,554
This is just a formality,
but you still need to answer.

479
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:57,225
Have you ever forced or urged
the anesthesiologist

480
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:01,604
to go ahead with the surgery
although she did not agree with you?

481
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,066
I have…

482
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,654
never put any kind of pressure…

483
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:12,407
on Anesthesiology.

484
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,575
You can't even persuade Anesthesiology.

485
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,703
How could you ruin my plans like this?

486
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,914
The same goes for Internal Medicine.

487
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,959
Professor Na, it's me.

488
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,627
Please hand your answer

489
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:28,172
directly to me, not through Ho-jun.

490
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,465
Right now.

491
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:37,598
I made my case very clear
regarding his WPW syndrome.

492
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,143
It was just reported as a reference.

493
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:43,896
I suggested we reschedule his surgery
after he was treated in the main hospital.

494
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,900
Internal Medicine gave me an answer
that said we could study his case

495
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:51,237
at the main hospital after the surgery.

496
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:53,656
Is that true?

497
00:33:58,494 --> 00:33:59,412
Yes.

498
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,874
It's true.

499
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,884
I believe you were involved in
another accident three years ago.

500
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,385
That was also a death on the table.

501
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,304
DEATH THAT OCCURS DURING SURGERY

502
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:18,514
That is correct.

503
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,933
You lost the case at the second trial.

504
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:24,187
I believe you had to pay
a huge compensation to the bereaved.

505
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,356
Yes. I did.

506
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,194
And I heard you divorced your husband
after that incident.

507
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,199
I believe you have a son.

508
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,076
Who's raising him right now?

509
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,787
What does that have to do with this case?

510
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,000
Well, I didn't mean much by it.

511
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,753
I was just personally curious.

512
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:56,344
I mean, think about it.

513
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,721
Professor Park is a big shot.

514
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:02,433
There's no reason for him to push ahead
with a risky operation.

515
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,311
And he was the son of the chairman
of Sejen Group! Come on.

516
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,772
He probably needed to show results.

517
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:09,690
What?

518
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,193
What do you mean, Doctor Seo?

519
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,530
He failed to suture in the second surgery
for the Minister of National Defense,

520
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:18,032
and then he never showed any great results

521
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,034
after he was instated here
as the president.

522
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,412
He must've been anxious.

523
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:26,082
Hey, Seo Woo-jin.

524
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:28,876
He was so desperate
that he changed his first assistant

525
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,294
on the day of the surgery.

526
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,296
Isn't that so?

527
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:36,425
He sent away emergency patients
to only accept VIP patients.

528
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,886
When one of our doctors was gashed
with a box cutter,

529
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,430
he covered it up
without calling the police.

530
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,517
Then he tried to take the staff here
and move them to another hospital.

531
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,476
Hey!

532
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,897
He held the title of doctor,
but everything he did was far from it.

533
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:52,900
Of course, he was anxious.

534
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,153
-You jerk! Do you want to die?
-Stop it.

535
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,445
Calm down, Doctor Yang.

536
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,030
Let him go.

537
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,323
Darn it!

538
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:05,288
This jerk?
He's just venting his spite right now.

539
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:08,624
He was fired from Professor Park's team
while he was working at the main hospital.

540
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,626
He blew the whistle on a senior colleague

541
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,129
and committed all kinds of
degrading acts as a doctor,

542
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,715
so Professor Park had no choice
but to dismiss him.

543
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,301
He's doing this because he has a grudge.

544
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,720
He's framing Professor Park. Okay?

545
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,515
Okay. I understand what you're saying.

546
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,103
Hey, Doctor Do.

547
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,190
You know Professor Park very well too.

548
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:34,442
You respect him, don't you?

549
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,197
You're right. He's competent and gracious.

550
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,239
Right?

551
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:45,286
But we need to put
our personal feelings to the side.

552
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,414
A man died.

553
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:56,047
It looks like we've heard enough for now.

554
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,465
Let's end it here.

555
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,052
I might contact you again
with additional questions,

556
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:04,347
so please don't go
too far away from the hospital today.

557
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,351
Goodbye.

558
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,235
Darn it. You jerk.

559
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:19,946
Darn you.

560
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,009
What was that just now, Doctor Seo?

561
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:45,888
What do you mean?

562
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,558
You just needed to tell us
about the death on the table.

563
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:51,769
So what?

564
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:55,815
Did you have to rat Professor Park out
that badly?

565
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,608
I thought that was necessary.

566
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:01,279
You said we need to lose him
to save Doldam.

567
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,073
So I was giving you the grounds to do it.

568
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,200
Why? Is something wrong?

569
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:12,164
I think you're
misunderstanding something, Doctor Seo.

570
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:16,502
What Doctor Kim hates the most
is doctors playing politics at a hospital.

571
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,587
I never did that.

572
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,923
If you give the grounds,
criticize, and slander others

573
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,759
to get what you want, what else is that
other than playing politics?

574
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,720
I was just sharing the facts.

575
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,806
If you wanted to complain and vent,
you should go face him yourself.

576
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:31,142
How can I face a guy like him?

577
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,856
He's the president of this hospital,
and I'm just a mere fellow.

578
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:39,817
We're in different places
and levels in this society.

579
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,027
If you know that,

580
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:44,363
why did you put in unnecessary emotions?

581
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:48,492
The moment you add emotions to facts,
it becomes propaganda.

582
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:51,746
The more unfair you think this is,
the less persuasive your argument gets.

583
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,247
The more frustrated you are,

584
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,916
the less credibility your words have.

585
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,837
People will be suspicious of the facts
mixed with the emotions.

586
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,552
The moment you add your emotions

587
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:10,473
to a fight that can be won with facts,
things can get distorted.

588
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,101
Do you understand?

589
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,608
No one can mess with them.

590
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:28,783
I'll make sure no one messes with…

591
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,578
Doldam or Doctor Kim.

592
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,448
Did the hearing go well?

593
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,368
No. Actually, I'm not sure.

594
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,917
By the way,
about that patient, Kang Ik-joon…

595
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:24,630
I heard he consented to the surgery,
knowing that he had WPW syndrome.

596
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:25,923
Did you know about that?

597
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:28,968
What do you mean?

598
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,180
He knew.

599
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:35,766
He knew?

600
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,976
Yes.

601
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:40,604
Professor Park Min-gook
explained everything.

602
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:42,898
However…

603
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,276
CONSENT FOR SURGERY

604
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,111
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

605
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,781
Let's not tell my parents.

606
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,032
Ik-joon.

607
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,327
This isn't something you should hide.

608
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:58,164
They said the surgery could go wrong.

609
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,374
I don't want to worry them anymore.

610
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,794
I haven't shown any symptoms yet,

611
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,213
and they said me being young helps.

612
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,633
And the chances of something
going wrong during surgery are quite slim.

613
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:13,012
Are you thinking
of just proceeding with the surgery?

614
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,933
CONSENT FOR SURGERY, WPW SYNDROME

615
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,727
KANG IK-JOON

616
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:21,520
Hey.

617
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,148
What if something happens, though?

618
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:26,317
Then that's probably my fate.

619
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,447
Whether it's from the cancer
or WPW syndrome,

620
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,449
death is all the same.

621
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,497
KANG IK-JOON, SIGNATURE

622
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,584
What? So you're saying…

623
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:47,713
The patient was well aware
of his condition,

624
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:50,841
but he still consented
to the surgery of his own accord.

625
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:54,136
Unless there was
a mistake during the surgery--

626
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,971
No, there wasn't. I'm sure of it.

627
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:00,684
Then Professor Park can't really be
held accountable for it.

628
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:04,563
Maybe morally.
But legally, he's not responsible.

629
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,859
Why hasn't the fact-finding committee
been notified of this?

630
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,736
Exactly. It's so odd.

631
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:13,906
Why make things worse
by keeping that information quiet?

632
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:21,288
It seems that a follow-up investigation
will be unavoidable.

633
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,209
A follow-up investigation?
What do you mean by that?

634
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:28,254
While investigating this table death case,

635
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,798
we came across

636
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:34,093
many systematic shortcomings
that Doldam Hospital has.

637
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,763
And we're noticing some things
that require immediate attention.

638
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,723
Like what?
Could you give us examples?

639
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,686
First, we'll have to look into it more.

640
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:47,273
Aren't you just trying
to complicate things?

641
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:55,197
I agree that a follow-up investigation
is necessary.

642
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:58,534
I also think that we should evaluate

643
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,869
the medical staff's qualifications.

644
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,496
I agree.

645
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,206
Me too.

646
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,794
Gosh. This will turn into a huge headache.

647
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,629
Oh, dear.

648
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:18,429
Well, it is the committee's decision,
so we must follow it.

649
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,055
We don't know much about the law anyway.

650
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,143
Right, President Park?

651
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:28,397
President Park.

652
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,650
Listen to me carefully.

653
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:36,864
I don't intend
to reproach you for your mistake.

654
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:41,952
But at the same time, we cannot
just sweep it under the rug.

655
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:46,206
A fact-finding committee will be formed.

656
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:49,752
The table death case
will only serve as a pretext.

657
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,086
Their real objective

658
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:56,425
will be finding out what's going on
at Doldam through in-depth investigations.

659
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,470
What are you trying to get out of it?

660
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:03,515
There's only one thing that I want.

661
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,686
To shut down Doldam Hospital

662
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,440
and build our new future there.

663
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:13,901
And to do that,

664
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,820
I need your utmost cooperation.

665
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:21,116
This might be your only chance

666
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,160
to survive.

667
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:33,879
Mr. Jang.

668
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:37,716
-Yes, sir.
-Give the committee…

669
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:44,014
full access to our files.

670
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,561
You mean, everything?

671
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,356
Yes. Everything they need to see.

672
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:57,861
Please cooperate.

673
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:09,748
Everything will go
according to their plan.

674
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:23,011
Their goal is to find a reason
to shut down Doldam at all costs.

675
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,808
And to do that, they will
try to find whatever reason they can.

676
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,810
So once they have a reason,

677
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,563
and President Park and Chairman Do

678
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,190
decide to shut down the hospital…

679
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:36,692
It can't be stopped.

680
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,697
So this "fact-finding committee"

681
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:45,159
is actually a committee
for shutting down Doldam.

682
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:49,955
It looks like they're even
going to desert Professor Sim, Doctor Kim.

683
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:56,587
Knowing the situation, do you still
wish to give Professor Park a chance?

684
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:03,051
Do you still see hope in him?

685
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,407
Hi, Doctor Seo.

686
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:28,452
What are you doing?

687
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:31,413
I'm packing my stuff in advance.

688
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:33,874
I'll probably be suspended soon.

689
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:34,958
Suspended?

690
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:38,670
-Why?
-I can tell from what's been going on.

691
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,381
They're "investigating"
with a decision already in mind.

692
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,468
The patient was aware of his WPW syndrome,

693
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,137
and I heard we had his consent.

694
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,181
You see,

695
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:52,601
there are times when it's just better

696
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:54,019
to own up to it

697
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:58,190
than to drive yourself crazy
just to avoid responsibility.

698
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:02,736
I was wrong to consent to the surgery,

699
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,155
and whether I was pressured or not,

700
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,158
I should be held accountable
in some way or another.

701
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:12,412
I've been feeling
indebted to Professor Park.

702
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,123
But we're now even. I'm relieved.

703
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,501
Still, this is wrong.

704
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,921
If it isn't a case of malpractice,

705
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:23,924
those people have no reason to be here.

706
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,342
Look, Doctor Seo.

707
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:30,931
The table death is only an excuse to them.

708
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:34,017
It was never important
to them to begin with.

709
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:36,520
Don't you get it?

710
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,191
Then we shouldn't let them find anything
they can use against us.

711
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:02,337
WE PROVIDE HEART-TO-HEART TREATMENTS

712
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:22,065
Kang Ik-joon, who was in Room 208.

713
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:25,277
-Can I get his guardian's phone number?
-Just a second, please.

714
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:36,288
Gosh, please… Please pick up.

715
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:37,789
Please.

716
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,631
Please.

717
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:47,925
Please pick up.

718
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:50,093
The person you're trying to reach is…

719
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:02,356
-Are you looking for something?
-Kang Ik-joon's surgery consent form.

720
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,941
Do you know if it's here?

721
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:07,361
Doctor Yang took it this morning.

722
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,747
PRESIDENT PARK MIN-GOOK

723
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:20,958
WPW SYNDROME, PANCREATIC CANCER

724
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,836
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

725
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,297
PATIENT NAME: KANG IK-JOON

726
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,257
DOCTOR: PARK MIN-GOOK

727
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:40,936
If you're okay with a photocopied version,
you should ask Doctor Kim.

728
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,021
What? Doctor Kim?

729
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:46,817
Yes, he had asked me to make a copy of it.

730
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,318
He took it just now.

731
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,255
Come on.

732
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,048
Have a look.

733
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,679
DOCTOR: PARK MIN-GOOK

734
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:21,393
PATIENT NAME: KANG IK-JOON

735
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,774
Not only did he sign the consent form,

736
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:31,319
but he also signed a form
saying he was given an explanation

737
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,405
regarding his WPW syndrome.

738
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:36,450
Don't you think…

739
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:43,040
this is enough evidence
to help you avoid getting suspended?

740
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,150
All right.

741
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:14,071
Those folks who are ransacking this place.

742
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:15,906
Tell them to leave.

743
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:24,247
As surgeons, our job is to save lives.

744
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:30,462
It is our duty to save
our patients at all costs,

745
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,673
but there are times when we fail.

746
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:38,470
That's what happened
to Kang Ik-joon yesterday.

747
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:42,641
You made an informed decision

748
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:46,686
that his aggressive cancer could be
more of a threat than his WPW syndrome

749
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,522
and pushed ahead with the surgery.

750
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:50,732
I respect the decision you made.

751
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:54,111
It would've been nice
if you had managed to save him,

752
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,280
and I'm sorry that's not what happened.

753
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,490
However…

754
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,744
you playing politics and using his death,

755
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:05,497
that I cannot accept.

756
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:09,709
President Park.

757
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:14,923
I don't really know
how big your ambition is.

758
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:21,096
But I thought you at least took some pride
in your profession as a doctor.

759
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:27,978
You never avoided treating patients
or walked away from them.

760
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:33,150
I thought you were hard-headed,
but I never thought you were incompetent.

761
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:36,319
I also knew you had a big ego,

762
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,071
and for that reason,

763
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:43,785
I didn't think you'd ever
give up on your patients.

764
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:50,917
Who knew you'd show your true colors
all of a sudden like this?

765
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,379
I really didn't expect this.

766
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,842
You hid those signed consent forms.

767
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:02,637
You even deserted your teammate.

768
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:03,972
And now,

769
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,308
you're even trying

770
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:10,270
to mess with the entire hospital.

771
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,690
What will you get out of this?

772
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:14,858
Enough, please.

773
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:16,985
You're out of line.

774
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,445
Answer my question.

775
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:22,949
What the heck
will you get out of doing all this?

776
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:28,413
Doctor Bu Yong-ju.

777
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,084
Your failure.

778
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:35,837
What?

779
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,890
Your hypocrisy and reckless bravado…

780
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:52,437
and the way you put on airs.

781
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,733
I wanted the whole world to see it.

782
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:00,820
How wrong, full of it, and crazy you are.

783
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:07,244
I'm not the one
who should get off the bus!

784
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:11,122
It's you.

785
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,834
That's it?

786
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:19,589
You're putting Doldam in jeopardy
and helping Do Yun-wan get what he wants

787
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:20,799
just to take me down?

788
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,842
Just to see me fail?

789
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,970
This hospital can't be saved.

790
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:26,930
No matter how hard you try,

791
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:29,599
you can't save it because
you already missed the golden hour.

792
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,851
We can't declare it dead just because

793
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,145
we don't think we can save it.

794
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:35,939
You must think you're always right

795
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,733
and better than everybody else.

796
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:41,778
My pride,

797
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:44,364
my countless efforts,

798
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:46,992
and everything I've achieved so far.

799
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,581
Don't you dare belittle them.

800
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:58,920
I don't deserve to be belittled like that.

801
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,463
Do you understand?

802
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:08,930
Look, President Park.

803
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:14,686
You're not just a fool,
you're a complete loser.

804
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:20,483
You're obstinate,
bull-headed, and insecure.

805
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,485
And that arrogant, pretentious belief…

806
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:25,739
No. You can't even call that a belief.

807
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:30,452
It's just an obsession created
by your greed and delusion.

808
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,289
To tell you the truth,

809
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:38,501
I once thought
it'd be nice to have you here.

810
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:40,295
I actually thought that.

811
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:46,009
I mean, you had
a pretty good reputation as a doctor.

812
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,429
But now, I'm grateful.

813
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:55,018
To know that it was a useless thought.

814
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:56,311
You taught me that.

815
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:00,482
All right.

816
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:04,694
While you still have this title…

817
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,404
PRESIDENT PARK MIN-GOOK

818
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,990
You'd better clean up the mess…

819
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:11,868
that you've created.

820
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:17,374
I'll no longer wait or be patient.

821
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:20,919
Those days are over.

822
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:14,973
I'll be honest with you.
You people really irk us.

823
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,393
Are you aware of that?

824
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:23,022
-What's the problem now?
-You guys make us feel uneasy.

825
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:30,321
We all thought we were doing our best.

826
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,367
But when we're here with you folks,

827
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:37,745
we're embarrassed to have thought that.

828
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:41,332
But we're too proud to admit it.

829
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:47,964
Shouldn't we at least know

830
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:52,093
what we're working so hard for?

831
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:03,313
He talked about pain in his left chest,
so I took a chest X-ray.

832
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:06,107
The left lung looks a little weird.
But it may be nothing serious.

833
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:08,860
-I'll run it through the AI program.
-Incoming!

834
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:10,653
-Tell me the results right away.
-Okay!

What's the problem?

840
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:23,625
A stomach ache.

841
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:25,376
I told him to always watch what he eats,

842
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:28,338
but he overate this morning
and got an upset stomach again.

843
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:30,256
Sir, I'll examine your abdomen.

844
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:33,593
What kind of operation did he have?

845
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:37,096
He had a bowel perforation years ago,
so they cut out a bit of his intestine.

846
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,640
Years ago? How long ago was it?

847
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:41,726
Gosh, a long time ago.
It was when he was young.

848
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,645
It was about 40 years ago.

849
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:45,480
-Yes, that sounds about right.
-40 years?

850
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:48,274
-And this one?
-Oh, this, about five years ago,

851
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,651
he had his gallbladder removed.

852
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:52,779
-What are his vitals?
-145 over 80, 70 bpm, and 36.8 degrees.

853
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,656
-Move him to bed number nine.
-Okay.

854
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:55,907
-Nurse Um.
-Yes.

855
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,033
Let's get the X-rays first.

856
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:58,868
-Put him on fluids during the lab test.
-Okay.

857
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:01,287
-Give him some tramadol as well. Good.
-Got it.

-I have the results.
-Okay!

861
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:12,173
-He has a pneumothorax.
-What is it? Do you have something?

862
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:15,718
Yes, we have your X-ray results.
There's an air buildup in your left chest.

863
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:16,970
-What?
-An air buildup?

864
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:19,556
My gosh! Doctor, over here.

865
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,849
-Help me, please.
-My gosh. Sir, you're back.

866
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:25,270
You said come back if it hurt again.
I told you to see a urologist

867
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:27,105
-if the pain recurs.
-When did you say that?

868
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,982
When I prescribed the medication.

869
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,192
I said the medication might not be enough

870
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:33,778
and told you to see a urologist
for a lithotomy.

871
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:34,904
I clearly said that.

872
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,990
Nonsense! I don't recall hearing that!

873
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,825
-Lie down, please.
-I can't die yet!

874
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:41,035
-Make the pain go away!
-Doctor Jeong!

875
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,287
-Doctor Jeong!
-I'm coming.

876
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:43,830
-Just a moment.
-This hurts.

877
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:50,962
I tripped and rolled down while hiking.
I tore open my forehead.

878
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:53,673
-Oh, I see. Nurse Joo.
-Yes!

879
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,759
-Take this patient to the hybrid room.
-This way, please.

880
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,303
-I'm dying!
-I'm coming.

881
00:59:58,386 --> 00:59:59,929
-Could you explain the rest?
-Oh, right.

882
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:02,390
-Gosh!
-Doctor Yoon, call Doctor Seo!

883
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:03,308
-Okay!
-Got it!

884
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:04,225
Yes?

885
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:06,561
My kid fell off a slide and can't walk.

886
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:07,478
-She can't walk?
-No.

887
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:10,189
I'm dying here! Do something!

888
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,317
Doctor, you need to explain the rest.

889
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,526
-Please explain.
-You're fine.

890
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,570
-Kid, give me a second.
-Gosh, Doctor!

891
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:17,322
-What are you doing?
-Help me out first.

892
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:21,409
Wait, just a moment. Okay, just wait!

893
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:23,953
-I can't wait!
-I can't breathe.

894
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,330
Doctor! My daughter…

895
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:27,040
This is crazy.

896
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:30,501
Doctor Jeong.

897
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:33,129
What a mess. Do you need a hand?

898
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:34,380
-Yes, please.
-Okay.

899
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:37,842
Could you examine the laceration patient
in the hybrid room?

900
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:39,218
Okay, no problem.

901
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,803
-Thank you.
-Oh, hold on.

902
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:43,556
What were you going to say earlier?

903
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,600
-Pardon?
-Doctor!

904
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:47,602
-Oh, that was…
-Doctor, please.

905
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:50,813
-Doctor!
-Why isn't anyone helping me?

906
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:54,233
Is it about something important?
Then just say it now.

907
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:59,364
No, it's nothing. I'll take care of it.

908
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:01,866
-Doctor Jeong!
-Yes, I'm coming!

909
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,077
-Take the laceration case.
-Okay, go.

910
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,912
Doctor Yoon, take care of that kid!

911
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,042
Please lie on your back.

912
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:15,713
And just like that,

913
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:19,467
Doctor Jeong ended up staying at Doldam.

914
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:20,635
Doctor!

915
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:23,805
Hi, honey.

916
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:26,933
Yes, that's what happened.

917
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:29,227
The other hospital…

918
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,021
I did some research,
and the place is a mess.

919
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:33,898
The salary they offered was a lie,

920
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:35,733
and the other options are terrible.

921
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:37,735
That's right.

922
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,571
Doldam is much better.

923
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:43,700
I figured it'd be wiser to just stay here

924
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:48,204
and wait for a position
to open up at the main hospital.

925
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:50,498
Yes, exactly.

926
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:55,545
-Doctor Jeong, we have a new patient.
-Honey, I have to go.

927
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,004
I'll call you later.

928
01:01:57,964 --> 01:01:59,966
I love you. A lot.

929
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,722
I'm coming, okay?

930
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:11,728
I'm glad that everyone seems
to have overcome the hurdle.

931
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,410
Mr. Yeo.

932
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:30,788
You're staying strong too, right?

933
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,763
What are you going to do, sir?

934
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:49,849
About the fact-finding committee.

935
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:00,693
Give it to them.

936
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:03,571
Sir, but…

937
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:06,157
Can't you see?

938
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,121
We've lost this fight.

939
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:22,006
So? You'll just back down?

940
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:24,091
Gosh. What can we do then?

941
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:26,969
They have a consent form that shows

942
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:29,055
the patient agreed to everything.

943
01:03:30,097 --> 01:03:32,475
Even the patient's guardian is saying

944
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:35,895
the patient signed it of his own accord.
That's what's happening now.

945
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:40,483
Yes, Ik-joon heard the explanation
and signed it himself.

946
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:42,777
-What is going on?
-That's it, then.

947
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:46,239
You fool. I'm hanging up!

948
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:49,784
Goodness.

949
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,329
The older you get,

950
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,123
the kinder you should become.

951
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:02,755
Such idiots.

952
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:06,008
I told them exactly what to do,
yet they still messed it all up.

953
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:07,635
You morons.

954
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:11,764
-Sir.
-What?

955
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:15,059
Someone is here to see you.

956
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:30,032
I'm sorry I'm a little late, Mr. Chairman.

957
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,548
-You're leaving?
-Yes.

958
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:48,259
My work here is done, so I should leave.

959
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:53,890
We have a patient with bowel obstruction.
Necrosis hasn't occurred yet, though.

960
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:56,934
I'm thinking of performing
laparoscopic adhesiolysis.

961
01:04:58,311 --> 01:04:59,687
Could you show me how it's done?

962
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:05,026
It's a small bowel obstruction.

963
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:07,778
I'll now begin the adhesiolysis.

964
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:10,573
I haven't been in surgery with Doctor Do
in a while.

965
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:12,617
You're the best laparoscopic surgeon.

966
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:16,621
Thank you.
But, Doctor Seo is in charge today.

967
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:18,789
Me?

968
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:20,875
I got your back, so give it a go.

969
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:22,168
You can do it, right?

970
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:25,421
Let's swap places then.

971
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:39,185
We'll begin now. Scalpel.

972
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:45,232
Bovie.

973
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:49,695
-Kelly forceps.
-Kelly forceps.

974
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:55,493
Trocar.

975
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:03,626
Gas on.

976
01:06:07,588 --> 01:06:09,131
The cavity isn't filling up.

977
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:11,842
It can happen when there's an adhesion.
Camera.

978
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:21,227
Scalpel.

979
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:24,480
Kelly forceps.

980
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:27,400
Trocar.

981
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:40,579
The adhesion looks bad.

982
01:06:42,206 --> 01:06:44,083
-Dissector.
-Grasper.

983
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:46,794
Energy device, please.

984
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:09,859
I heard you gave him homework.

985
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:12,278
Woo-jin told you that?

986
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:16,323
I saw our project binder on his desk.

987
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:18,367
In about a year or two,

988
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:21,746
both you and Dong-ju
will have to brace yourselves.

989
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:23,164
No way.

990
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:25,708
Is he your favorite now?

991
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:34,050
When do you plan to get the surgery
for your carpal tunnel syndrome?

992
01:07:36,093 --> 01:07:38,596
After Woo-jin finishes his homework.

993
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:41,140
I'll wait until then.

994
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,070
You did a good job

995
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:55,905
with the surgery.

996
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:58,908
I owe it all to your guidance.

997
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:00,618
I learned a lot.

998
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:04,663
To us surgeons, experience is everything.
You know what I mean, right?

999
01:08:05,706 --> 01:08:06,999
Yes, I do.

1000
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:11,128
Look after Doldam for me
until I come back.

1001
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,674
-You plan to come back?
-You didn't know?

1002
01:08:16,383 --> 01:08:18,302
This is where I belong.

1003
01:08:18,385 --> 01:08:20,513
I'm at the main hospital temporarily.

1004
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:23,057
I see.

1005
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:26,769
Also, make sure
you complete your homework.

1006
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:32,066
Your mentor asked you
to diagnose his condition.

1007
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:35,653
He wouldn't have asked just anybody.

1008
01:08:52,711 --> 01:08:54,547
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

1009
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,929
Still, how could you not even say goodbye?

1010
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:07,143
Anyway, it got a little risky at times,
but no one found out about us.

1011
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:08,769
Thank goodness, right?

1012
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:11,397
All right.

1013
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:13,065
You take care too.

1014
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:16,235
Oh, tell Auntie that I said hi.

1015
01:09:17,611 --> 01:09:19,238
Okay, bye.

1016
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:30,374
When did you get here?

1017
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,002
Before you came in.

1018
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,714
Oh, I see.

1019
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:40,301
How come I didn't see you?

1020
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:44,513
By the way,

1021
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:48,017
who were you talking to on the phone?

1022
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:43,989
RESTRICTED AREA: OPERATING ROOM

1023
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:46,408
The ICU. It's Mr. Yeo.

1024
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:50,579
Gosh. Doctor Yoon.

1025
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:53,707
Doctor Yoon! Darn it.

1026
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:56,043
Where did Doctor Yoon go?

1027
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:02,675
-Where are you going?
-The ICU, to see Mr. Yeo.

1028
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:03,801
Oh, I see.

1029
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:26,448
THE ODDBALL PROJECT

1030
01:11:50,055 --> 01:11:53,267
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

1031
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:10,367
THE ODDBALL PROJECT

1032
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:50,908
Eun-jae will return to the main hospital.

1033
01:12:50,991 --> 01:12:52,951
What do I do with her?

1034
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:55,996
-Just tell her how you feel.
-Why aren't you asking me to stay?

1035
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,956
Are we still good?

1036
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:02,294
Does Doctor Kim have something
other than CTS?

1037
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:05,130
About the homework…
I think I've found the answer.

1038
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:07,007
Professor Park!

1039
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:08,050
I need your help.

1040
01:13:09,301 --> 01:13:12,179
Can we kick Doctor Kim out with that?

1041
01:13:13,013 --> 01:13:15,974
And you think you should
still be allowed in the OR?

1042
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:18,227
I'm seriously considering letting you go.
