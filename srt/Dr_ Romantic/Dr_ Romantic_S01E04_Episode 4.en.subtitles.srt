1
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,569
Teacher Kim.

2
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,957
Teacher Kim, let me explain.

3
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:47,672
Scalpel blade number ten.

4
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,720
I asked for her help.

5
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,556
I don't have any experience
with burn patients,

6
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:57,515
so I asked her for help.

7
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,934
Inject antibiotics and tetanus vaccine.

8
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,644
Prepare oxygen as well.

9
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,354
Finish dressing the burn wounds.

10
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,564
Okay.

11
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,026
-Teacher Kim.
-Did you call the burn center?

12
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,445
Yes. The chopper will be here
in 25 minutes.

13
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,030
-Teacher Kim.
-Teacher Kim!

14
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:13,907
Teacher Kim!

15
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:15,784
Teacher Kim.

16
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,371
Hyeong-gu, Myeong-bo!

17
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,041
-Please calm down.
-Myeong-bo!

18
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,795
Oh, my goodness.

19
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:28,755
Teacher Kim.

20
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,508
Are they going to be okay?
They will be fine, won't they?

21
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,928
Geon-su. We should take care of
your wounds first.

22
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,722
-Ms. Oh, dress his wounds.
-Okay.

23
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,892
Where is Yeong-cheol? Where is he?

24
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,769
He's not in a good condition right now.

25
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,608
You can save him, right?

26
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,904
Teacher Kim.

27
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,532
You even brought a dead person
back to life.

28
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,451
I saw you doing that many times.

29
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,583
Yeong-cheol.

30
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,752
Please save him.

31
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,965
We'll do the very best we can here.

32
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,425
Then we will send them to the burn center.

33
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,593
Let's do that.

34
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,388
-Yeong-cheol.
-Let's do that.

35
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,848
This way, please.

36
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,733
Are the kitchen staff all right?

37
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,154
Burn patients can never be okay.

38
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,739
They will suffer
from serious aftereffects, too.

39
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,908
The entire medical expenses

40
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,452
will be covered by the company.

41
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,663
It's no surprise.

42
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,751
Chairman Shin wants to see you again.

43
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,463
Would you like to come with me
once the emergency is over?

44
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,757
As you can see, I'm quite busy here.

45
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,677
Then are you available tomorrow?

46
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,097
If he wants to see me,
he should come here.

47
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,181
Oh, right.

48
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:07,437
I will charge you
for this with a medical certificate.

49
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,605
Just for your information.

50
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:14,152
Isn't she the general manager
of the casino?

51
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,741
Why is she here to see Teacher Kim?

52
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,493
THREE HOURS AGO

53
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,872
Times of money.

54
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:30,585
It's the time where
money makes you a boss.

55
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:36,633
The world is full of those who are
willing to do anything for money

56
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,594
and those who believe
there is nothing they can't do

57
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,012
with money.

58
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,108
I guess you've been here for a while.

59
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,027
It's been about two days.

60
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,990
Excuse me. Thank you.

61
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,161
Have some water.

62
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,537
Thanks.

63
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,834
Security. Please call 911.

64
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,253
We have a stroke patient here.

65
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,129
Stroke?

66
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,427
Hurry! Call 911 now.

67
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,471
Call 911. We have a stroke patient.
Hurry up.

68
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,515
Look at my fingertip.

69
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,683
Follow my finger.

70
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,119
Wait. Please pass this to the doctor.

71
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,954
-Okay.
-Thank you.

72
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:56,462
You just saved someone's life once again.

73
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,049
So what?

74
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,677
It doesn't do me any good.

75
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,681
It's only good for other hospitals.

76
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,517
Come with me.
The chairman wants to see you.

77
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,550
I'm sorry.
This is an order from the chairman.

78
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,569
Why is this steak so chewy?

79
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,329
Hey.

80
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,082
Are you Teacher Kim?

81
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:18,669
You didn't have to beat me up
to see me. I'd come anyway.

82
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,672
Why did you beat me to a jelly?

83
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,299
You jerk.

84
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,969
I heard you hustle money from sick people.

85
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,931
Do you call yourself a doctor?

86
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,268
On top of that, it was against my VIPs
at my very own casino.

87
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:39,190
At least I help them get better.

88
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,901
But you are extorting money

89
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:45,863
from poor people
without even lifting a finger.

90
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,282
In terms of the seriousness
of the offense,

91
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,869
you are a lot worse than I am.

92
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,163
Is it true that

93
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,957
you are a skilled doctor?

94
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,633
Get off me, you jerks.

95
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:11,264
It's true that the lives I've saved
are more than the ones I've lost.

96
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,849
I heard that

97
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,644
your touch can bring

98
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,897
even the dead back to life.

99
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:23,025
It's not like I can perform miracles.

100
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,695
There's no way I can bring
a dead person back to life.

101
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,072
If you are meant to live, you will live.

102
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,700
And if you are meant to die,
you will die anyway.

103
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,953
I want you to work for me.

104
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,790
Stop looking for a patient in the casino.

105
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,293
You should be my personal doctor.

106
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,463
I will pay you as much as you want.

107
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:48,050
What's the maximum amount you can pay me?

108
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:49,886
Hey.

109
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,472
Bring me more steaks.

110
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,141
This is not enough.
Look at how small this is.

111
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:56,934
Yes, sir.

112
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,353
Hello?

113
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,730
Okay.

114
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:04,066
Listen. We just got an order
for more steaks from the chairman.

115
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,318
-Put the pan on the heat.
-Okay.

116
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,652
-Bring the meat.
-Okay.

117
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,571
-Prepare filet mignon.
-Okay.

118
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,910
What's wrong?

119
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,453
Nothing.

120
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,788
It's acting up again.

121
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,715
Yeong-cheol!

122
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:33,638
How much money do you have
under your name?

123
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,933
Is it about one billion won?

124
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,978
If you give me all the money you have,
I will think about it.

125
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:45,107
If not, you can't just buy me.

126
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,322
I might not look like it,
but I'm a quite expensive doctor.

127
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,160
If you are done,

128
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,996
I will leave you alone.

129
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,832
You know, it's Friday.

130
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,462
Ma'am, we have a problem.
A fire broke out in the kitchen.

131
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,964
What?

132
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,137
Go get a fire extinguisher.

133
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,138
Extinguisher!

134
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,811
Teacher Kim! Teacher Kim!

135
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:25,731
-Geon-su!
-Go find Yeong-cheol!

136
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,858
Go help Yeong-cheol!

137
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,278
Help!

138
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:18,868
Don't worry. They will be fine. Just go.

139
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,997
Avoid spicy or strong flavored foods.

140
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,041
-Cashier is this way.
-Okay.

141
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:09,460
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

142
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,463
Mr. Park.

143
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:16,300
I'll send these two
to the burn center tomorrow.

144
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,387
Take care of them in the ICU until then.

145
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,513
Yes, Doctor.

146
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,696
I have something to tell you.

147
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,116
It's about Seo-jeong.

148
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:45,121
Like I said, it's not her fault.
I asked for her help.

149
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,623
I've never dealt with a burn patient.

150
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:51,001
I'm not interested in talking about her
with you.

151
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,295
Go on.

152
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,054
What should I have done then?

153
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,473
I had an emergency burn patient,

154
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,017
and I had no idea what to do about him.

155
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,478
Should I have left him to die?

156
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,982
The only person on the emergency
medicine board here is her.

157
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:17,445
Should she be just sitting around
doing nothing for the patient?

158
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,656
That's not right.

159
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,076
I should do anything and everything
at such an emergency.

160
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,036
Nonsense.

161
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,497
What?

162
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,291
Hey.

163
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,962
It looks like you believe
you were really heroic

164
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:39,175
to bring in Seo-jeong for help
in such an emergency.

165
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,593
That's nonsense.

166
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,387
You're a coward who can't react quickly.

167
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,641
Here you go again.

168
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,604
Did you just call me a coward?

169
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:55,316
Look. You have worked so hard
to become the top of your class,

170
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,985
and you can't let go
of Geosan Medical Center's name.

171
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,070
It's all because you're a coward.

172
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,907
If you don't have those to fall back on,

173
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,159
you're just scared.

174
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,495
Are you done?

175
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,084
Why? Are you angry?

176
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,796
Then don't ever be pretentious
in front of me.

177
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,382
Pretending to be someone.
Pretending to know.

178
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,176
Pretending to be a righteous doctor.

179
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:25,179
Pretending to be a hero
after just doing your job.

180
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,680
I never did any of those.

181
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,516
Hey.

182
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,560
You didn't bring Seo-jeong in
because of the patient.

183
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,313
You needed her for yourself,
not for the patient.

184
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:38,192
You didn't want to look like a fool
while treating that burn patient.

185
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,402
You didn't want to be ashamed
in front of our staff.

186
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,656
And now you're here pretending
to look out for Seo-jeong

187
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,033
and pretending
like it was for the patient.

188
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:49,203
Stop blabbering about yourself.

189
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:50,246
Understood?

190
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,292
You idiot.

191
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,849
Teacher Kim.

192
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,811
What's with you? What?

193
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,523
If you got nothing, I'm leaving.

194
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,733
Forgive me, Teacher Kim.

195
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:28,158
Please give me another chance.
I promise I'll be better.

196
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:32,454
I'm serious. I will never let you down.

197
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,664
I promise.

198
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,250
-Get up right now.
-No.

199
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,461
I'm not moving an inch

200
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,380
until you forgive me.

201
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,382
I won't move.

202
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,718
Alright then.

203
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,487
You coward.

204
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,656
You idiot.

205
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,786
Dong-ju.

206
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,580
Stay here.

207
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,165
Don't step in.

208
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,334
What are you doing?

209
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,518
That's enough, okay?

210
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,314
What do you know?

211
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,444
You don't know anything about me.
Don't talk about me like that!

212
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,239
I know you're older than me,

213
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,532
but it doesn't mean you're wiser.

214
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:55,496
Does age give you the right
to look down on other people?

215
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,498
No.

216
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:01,210
You don't even know a thing about me!

217
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,632
If you're an adult,
you shouldn't talk like that.

218
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,635
Exactly. Adults shouldn't talk like that.

219
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,474
I am older, but I may not be the wisest.

220
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,644
And I don't know anything about you.
However,

221
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,400
if you reach my age,

222
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,027
you'll begin to see something.

223
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,905
You'll be able to see
if someone's a real deal or not.

224
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,701
You'll also be able to see
if someone has a future or not.

225
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,494
Are you saying

226
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,912
I'm a fake?

227
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,623
And that I don't have a future?

228
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,834
You probably know that better.

229
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,715
Hey, let go.

230
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:49,925
Let go.

231
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,719
Let go.

232
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:55,973
-Seriously.
-Let go. Let go of me.

233
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,142
Mr. Gu, let go of him.

234
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,269
Let go of me!

235
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,771
Calm down, Dr. Kang. This is a hospital.

236
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,024
I'm going to kill him today.

237
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,359
-Darn you. I'll kill you.
-Gosh.

238
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:11,822
Stop it!

239
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,412
Myeong-sim started again.

240
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,874
What? Started what?

241
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:27,004
This is the moment
when Myeong-sim is the sexiest.

242
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,300
What are you two doing?

243
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:35,471
This is a hospital
and we still have patients.

244
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,056
That's exactly what I'm saying.

245
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,725
Okay, Mr. Gu. Get rid of him.

246
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:40,976
Stop it, Teacher Kim.

247
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,563
Do you know how hard Dr. Kang worked

248
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,273
at the emergency room today?

249
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,318
Do you know how hard he worked

250
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:53,489
in this small-town hospital
that lacks in every aspect?

251
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,909
No one else could have done
better than he did.

252
00:17:56,992 --> 00:18:00,537
You should be praising him,
not bashing on him.

253
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,749
You were getting beaten
while he was working.

254
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:07,503
Come on, Ms. Oh. That's true, but--

255
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,671
Look at Dr. Yun's incident.

256
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,300
President Yeo asked and Mr. Nam asked.

257
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:17,679
On top of that,
Dr. Yun kneeled down with all sincerity.

258
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,265
Then you should give her
the benefit of the doubt

259
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,810
and give her a second chance.

260
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,563
How can you be so harsh?

261
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,984
Dr. Yun has worked with us for so long.

262
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,611
Is this who you are?

263
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,948
Come on, Ms. Oh. About that--

264
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,407
I don't want to hear it!

265
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,911
Please reconsider your decision

266
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:41,954
on Dr. Yun.

267
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,373
Hey, Ms. Oh.

268
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:48,293
-You can't ask me to do--
-I will take that as a yes.

269
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,838
Teacher Kim!

270
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,596
It's over. Everything's been dealt with.

271
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,058
What are you talking about?

272
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:07,437
I'm saying that you'll probably be fine.

273
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,699
My goodness.

274
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,414
GEOSAN MEDICAL CENTER

275
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,839
See you.

276
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,549
-See you.
-Thank you.

277
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,764
I saw Dr. Jo of Seonil Medical Center

278
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,516
walking out of the head surgeon's room.

279
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,395
We can't leave
Dong-ju's spot open forever.

280
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:49,938
We're on a schedule here.

281
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,110
Scouting from the outside?

282
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,820
Yes, exactly.

283
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,906
Two doctors just did their interviews.

284
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,825
What are you going to do?

285
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,162
I think your spot will be
taken over by someone else.

286
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,876
Kang Dong-ju, you idiot!

287
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,962
You're doomed. Do you understand?

288
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:25,432
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

289
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,324
What are you doing?

290
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,994
I'm waiting for his decision.

291
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,248
They're all inside discussing
what to do with me.

292
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,588
Goodness gracious.

293
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,424
There is nothing to consider.

294
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,551
We need all the doctors we can get.

295
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:09,226
I feel bad about what happened to Dr. Yun,

296
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:13,981
but I have faith
that she'll overcome her difficulties.

297
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,899
Don't you think so, President Yeo?

298
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,610
What are you going to do?

299
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,707
Are you crazy?

300
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,709
I'm done with this place anyway.

301
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,752
I want to speak up before I go.

302
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,879
If you're going to go, just go.

303
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,631
Don't cause any trouble in there.

304
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:40,841
Come in.

305
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,263
Goodness, Dr. Kang.

306
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:50,475
We were just talking about
how you excellently handled

307
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,728
the Friday night shift.

308
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:57,733
You must be tired from working
all night. What brings you here?

309
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:03,739
What's this?

310
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,117
-It's my letter of resignation.
-What?

311
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,744
Dr. Kang.

312
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,538
I don't think I'm the right doctor

313
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,874
you're looking for here at this hospital.

314
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,418
I don't think I'm capable enough.

315
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,504
-That's all I needed to hear.
-Please, Teacher Kim.

316
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,758
You can't do this.
Please think about it again.

317
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:26,053
There's so much for you
to do here at this hospital.

318
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:30,057
I completely understand why you're upset.

319
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,642
At least stay here until
you go back to Geosan Medical Center.

320
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,062
I'm looking for other places,
not Geosan Medical Center.

321
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:40,859
I already got offered
by a couple of hospitals.

322
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,237
That's good news. Off you go, then.

323
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,948
Teacher Kim. Sit down.

324
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,033
Please.

325
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,702
You can't make the man stay
just because you want him to.

326
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,954
Kids like him are good for nothing.

327
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,998
Please think it over. You must.

328
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:02,380
Thank you for your help.
I owe you much for your kindness.

329
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,263
I almost forgot.

330
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,976
I get that you're a great doctor

331
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,270
and that you're a big shot.

332
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,231
But

333
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:23,693
you're the one who thinks
you can lecture other people

334
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,821
after just doing your job.

335
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,869
You're right about me.

336
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:37,124
I'm a stupid coward like how you said.

337
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,501
I studied so hard because
I was anxious about having

338
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:43,505
Geosan Medical Center's name
to fall back on.

339
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,424
I did try to flatter in order to
climb up the social ladder.

340
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:49,594
And I'm not proud of
every decision I've made in my life.

341
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:53,932
But you must know this.

342
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,102
Old fossils like you

343
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:59,938
are the ones who made me live like this.

344
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,531
You shaped this world
so that people with no background

345
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:13,160
can't become anything
unless they live like I did.

346
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,245
And you look down on us

347
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:17,831
calling us idiots and cowards.

348
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:18,790
Dr. Kang.

349
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,084
You don't even know
what it's like to live a proper life.

350
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,924
Stop trying to teach me how to live right.

351
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:30,552
You disgust me.

352
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,105
That'll be all.

353
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:45,984
Where are you going, Dr. Kang?

354
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,158
Why are you so scared?

355
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,619
You haven't done anything wrong.

356
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,163
What's so great about this hospital
to make you be like that?

357
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,875
Anywhere is better than here.

358
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,419
Do you want me
to look for your position as well?

359
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,632
Dr. Kang.

360
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,301
Let's calm down and talk this out.

361
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,011
Let me know when you change your mind.

362
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,930
It's not hard to find open positions.

363
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,309
Dr. Kang!

364
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:26,524
-What are you going to do?
-I'm not sure.

365
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,527
What should I do, indeed?

366
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,950
Dr. Kang, you shouldn't take this
so personally.

367
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:38,286
I know Teacher Kim irritates people.

368
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:42,082
I know that. He's done it to me, too.

369
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,042
But still,

370
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,962
it's not right for you to quit
just because of one person.

371
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:50,215
It's not just about him.
I hate everything about this hospital.

372
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,260
Really?

373
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,720
Tell me what you don't like about
this hospital.

374
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,974
I can't even tell whether it's
a surgery department or an ER.

375
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,558
The nurses come in and out

376
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,477
from the operating room
to the emergency room.

377
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,937
Nothing is organized here.

378
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,064
I don't even know
who is responsible for what.

379
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,942
That's simply because of lacking manpower.

380
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,235
There are no departments here.

381
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,654
Everyone works together--

382
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,364
That's why I want to work at a hospital

383
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,491
where I can put my specialty to good use.

384
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:17,867
A big and clean hospital

385
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,912
with the latest technology and equipment.

386
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,540
I admit that our hospital
lacks a little in some areas

387
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,417
compared to big hospitals
in big cities, but--

388
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,127
It's not just a little bit.

389
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,922
We're very lacking in many areas.

390
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,049
The building is old.

391
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,801
The system is out of date.

392
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:37,095
Also, the equipment is just awful.

393
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,848
So stop wasting your time
in a place like this

394
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,516
and go to a different hospital.

395
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,394
And then what? Live like you?

396
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,064
You value the opinions of higher ups
more than of the patients.

397
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:51,860
All you care about is
how to climb the social ladder faster.

398
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:55,905
It's either that or being stuck
in a place like this forever.

399
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,826
-You're a disgrace.
-Dr. Yun.

400
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:04,372
How are those the only things
you think about

401
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,583
with all your capabilities?

402
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:10,086
Because nothing works out for me
even with these capabilities.

403
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,131
Of course nothing would have worked out
with that victim mentality.

404
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,132
What did you say?

405
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:16,092
Break it up, you two.

406
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,553
I heard you loud and clear, Dr. Kang.

407
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:21,931
I'll discuss with President Yeo
and improve the working conditions.

408
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,934
Do you need a raise?
A house to stay in? You name it.

409
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:28,021
There's no need for that.
He won't even be grateful.

410
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:30,065
Why are you doing this, Dr. Yun?

411
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,608
Help me out here, okay?

412
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,276
I'm really fine, Mr. Jang.

413
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,112
Like what she said just now,
those things won't change my mind.

414
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:39,324
-Dr. Kang.
-See? He's like that.

415
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:40,533
Dr. Yun.

416
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,202
I wish you the best of luck

417
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,996
in this rubbish place you call a hospital.

418
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,916
Mind your own luck.
I don't need you to worry about me.

419
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,464
My goodness.

420
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:57,967
-Please, Dr. Kang.
-Let go of me.

421
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,345
-Please. Just this once.
-Let me go!

422
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:03,098
-Dr. Kang.
-This hospital is really noisy.

423
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,233
What are you two on about

424
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:17,112
in this early afternoon?

425
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:26,287
Ms. Ju. What a pleasant surprise.

426
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,001
-Is he your father?
-He's Chairman Shin.

427
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,965
Nice to meet you, Chairman Shin.

428
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,260
I'm Jang Gi-tae of Doldam Hospital.

429
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:43,471
I've been meaning to say hello.
Thank you for coming down here.

430
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,516
Is there something wrong
with Chairman Shin?

431
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,102
He's here to see Teacher Kim.

432
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,688
What? To see Teacher Kim?

433
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,692
These are the candidates
for the operation on the chairman.

434
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:58,611
One of them is Dr. John Woo.

435
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,572
He is a renowned surgeon in the US.

436
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:05,160
This will surely guarantee

437
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,996
your third consecutive term.
Congratulations in advance.

438
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,707
Don't get too ahead of yourself.

439
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:15,295
We still have two months left
before the board decision.

440
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,713
I'm not getting ahead of myself.

441
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:20,258
I'm just stating the obvious,
President Do.

442
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,178
Give Ms. Ju a call.

443
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,181
I'll go down to Jeongseon myself.

444
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,266
Okay.

445
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,478
What brings you here?

446
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:35,690
I heard you said I should come
if I wanted to see you.

447
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,650
I'm the desperate one here.

448
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,737
I'm here to see you now.

449
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,448
If you want me to be your doctor,

450
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,493
I've already told you my answer.

451
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:03,259
It's been about two years
since the operation, right?

452
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,969
You're exactly right.

453
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,639
How does it look?

454
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,517
Do you think the operation went well?

455
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,689
It must have gone perfectly
since you're alive and well.

456
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:21,569
It's been two years now
since I've been living with

457
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,864
electric wires inside of my body.

458
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,158
The way I look at it,

459
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,536
there's something wrong with

460
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:32,330
the battery inside my body.

461
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:36,668
It feels uncomfortable
when I'm not even doing anything.

462
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:40,797
They told me that I have to live like this

463
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,549
unless I get a heart transplant.

464
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:47,178
Who knows when

465
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,764
that's going to happen?

466
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,976
You've lived so well with all that money.

467
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:56,396
Isn't it about time for you to start
giving away to other people?

468
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:59,357
Try to do something good for a change.

469
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,902
Who knows? If you start to live like that,

470
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:07,448
the heavens may be touched
and send you a perfect heart.

471
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:11,160
Even if I do find a perfect heart,

472
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,372
the problem is this.

473
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:18,710
I don't have the perfect doctor.

474
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:21,754
What about the one
who gave you that artificial heart?

475
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,256
He died.

476
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,465
He died with a heart attack.

477
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,386
He was in a heart surgery
to save someone else's life,

478
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,763
but he got a heart attack and died.

479
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,640
Funny, isn't it?

480
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,851
It's sad.

481
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,398
Will you do it?

482
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,736
I heard you used to be
a cardiothoracic surgeon.

483
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,447
Why me?

484
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,825
There are many other qualified doctors.

485
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:55,663
I know that there are
millions of qualified doctors.

486
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:56,789
However,

487
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,334
not many of them are the real deal.

488
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,798
And you think I am?

489
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,718
How do you think

490
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,680
I made this much money?

491
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:17,685
It's all because I have an eye for people.

492
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,814
I can see

493
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:23,775
who is the real deal.

494
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,236
In that case,

495
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:30,698
your eye for people probably grew old.

496
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,825
Why? Don't you want to perform

497
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:33,993
my surgery?

498
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,871
Is it because I'm not worth it?

499
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,388
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

500
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,723
Please let me introduce
some of our tea menu

501
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,434
prepared just for our VIP patients.

502
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:01,354
We have Earl Grey tea,
English breakfast, and Ceylon tea.

503
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:04,565
We also have
three different types of green tea.

504
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,567
You can have them in both hot or iced

505
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,695
or as a milk tea if you wish.

506
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,405
What would you like?

507
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,816
Have you ever

508
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:31,944
thought about me?

509
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,492
Have you ever missed me?

510
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,166
Can't you hear me?

511
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,751
What's with you?

512
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:49,921
What?

513
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,090
What did you say?

514
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,134
Did you say something to me?

515
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,761
Have you ever missed me?

516
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,478
For the last five years,

517
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,816
have you ever thought of me?

518
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,623
I got lost in the mountains.

519
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,794
I slipped on a slope and hurt my wrist.

520
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,964
My focus was only on rehabilitation
for the next three years.

521
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,717
Thankfully, 90 percent
of my wrist is back to normal.

522
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,719
That's how I got
on the emergency medicine board.

523
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:45,017
After that, I wanted to be certified
as a cardiothoracic surgeon.

524
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,104
Most of the patients
in the emergency room have

525
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,606
heart or lung problems.

526
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,693
That sounds like you did not
have any time to think of me.

527
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,613
Is that right?

528
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,374
Okay. I get it.

529
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,128
I heard you.

530
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:20,928
I missed you, too.

531
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,642
I don't know why,

532
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,979
but I thought of you from time to time.

533
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,693
Are you saying this because I'm leaving?

534
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,613
Do you feel pity for me?

535
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,869
Is that what it sounded like to you?

536
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,541
Then I guess that's what you heard.

537
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:57,715
TEACHER KIM

538
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,967
I have to go.

539
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,052
Goodbye.

540
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,609
Being successful and
advancing in your career.

541
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,612
They're all great.

542
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,199
But Dong-ju.

543
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:25,993
We're doctors.

544
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:27,954
So what?

545
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,748
We're doctors, so what?

546
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,626
We're only doctors,

547
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,420
but we're still doctors.

548
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,133
Don't forget that.

549
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:36,981
Are you off duty?

550
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,942
No. I am leaving.

551
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,738
Did you say goodbye to President Yeo?

552
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,782
I turned in my resignation.
That should suffice.

553
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,286
I'm so sorry,

554
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:55,124
but we have a hand laceration case
in the emergency room.

555
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,961
I know you're leaving,
but can you stitch it up before you go?

556
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,051
Please.

557
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,184
Where's the patient?

558
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,770
The patient is waiting
in the hybrid operating room.

559
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:32,870
I'm listening.

560
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:38,542
I will comply with
whatever decision you made.

561
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,086
I mean...

562
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,380
I will comply

563
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:46,717
with anything but getting fired.

564
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:56,852
Come closer.

565
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,648
-Pardon?
-Let me see your hand.

566
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:01,774
Come closer.

567
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,860
Okay.

568
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:36,851
Are you doing okay?

569
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,186
Yes, I am.

570
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,242
You're good.

571
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:55,661
You would have made
a great plastic surgeon.

572
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:58,038
Are you saying that because I'm slow?

573
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,124
I'm complimenting you for your precision.

574
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,255
What do you hate so much
about Doldam Hospital?

575
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:12,803
Pardon?

576
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,639
I asked you to tell me three reasons

577
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,225
why you want to stay here so much.

578
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,021
First of all, I don't like Teacher Kim.

579
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,315
I want to learn from you.

580
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,692
Second, I don't like this hospital.

581
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,944
I want to learn from you.

582
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:32,072
I can't see my future in this hospital.

583
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,699
I want to learn

584
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,286
from you.

585
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:43,083
I want to carry out a collaborative
surgery with you some day.

586
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:46,003
It is my dream.

587
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:49,882
I want to become the best doctor,
not a good doctor.

588
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,092
That means

589
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,803
this isn't where I belong.

590
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,013
Is that so?

591
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,391
Then let me ask you one more thing.

592
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,227
From your perspective,

593
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:05,898
is Teacher Kim a good doctor
or the best doctor?

594
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,086
Which one is he?

595
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,421
Is Teacher Kim

596
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,924
a good doctor

597
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,176
or the best doctor?

598
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,428
These are the best doctors.

599
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,055
Please take a look.

600
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,391
I feel so bad.

601
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,269
You came all the way here for nothing.

602
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:45,563
Pardon?

603
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,816
Actually,

604
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:53,946
I've already found a doctor
to operate on me.

605
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,616
He's a talented doctor.

606
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,369
May I ask who you have in mind?

607
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,163
Chairman Shin,
it's a call from Teacher Kim.

608
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,540
Okay. I'll take it.

609
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:08,377
Yes, Teacher Kim. It's me.

610
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,046
Have you made up your mind?

611
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:15,301
First, I need a new ultrasound machine.
The latest model.

612
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:19,597
Are you asking me for that
instead of the surgery fee?

613
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,681
No.

614
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,017
This would be the settlement money.

615
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:26,604
Because I got beaten up badly yesterday,

616
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:30,899
I have injuries requiring
two or three weeks of medical treatment.

617
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:35,446
As I've already told you,
I'm worth a lot of money.

618
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:39,533
All right.
I'll buy you the latest equipment.

619
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:43,912
Then will you take up my operation?

620
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,540
In order to change
the battery of your artificial heart,

621
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,501
we need a new ultrasound machine
to begin with.

622
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:52,212
We also need the latest model of
operation table, anesthesia machine,

623
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,131
and a heart-lung machine.

624
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:58,552
If you consider a heart transplant
in the future...

625
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,179
I'm listening.

626
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:04,975
We'll also need a clean room
for the immunosuppression therapy,

627
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,436
but, I mean...

628
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,855
They are very expensive equipment.
I'm worried.

629
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:13,233
I wouldn't mind how much it'd cost.
Don't worry about it.

630
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,486
No matter how much it'll cost me,

631
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:18,739
I'll buy you the latest equipment.

632
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:23,202
If I do that, will you operate on me?

633
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:27,206
Once we get the equipment,
I'll set the date for your surgery.

634
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,588
You heard that, right? Teacher Kim said

635
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,091
he'll operate on me.

636
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,425
I'm glad to hear that.

637
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:39,885
Chairman Shin.

638
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,513
Have I done

639
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,641
anything to upset you?

640
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,226
What are you talking about?

641
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:52,106
You've been doing a great job
in running Geosan Medical Center.

642
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,983
Then, why did you refuse
all the doctors I recommended you

643
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,903
and let a random doctor operate on you?

644
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,449
-Do you want to know?
-If I may,

645
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,412
I'd like to hear the reason.

646
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:11,291
Ms. Ju, show it to him.

647
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,418
Yes, I will.

648
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:24,555
-What do you see?
-It looks like the scene of a fire.

649
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,432
Is this the kitchen in the casino?

650
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:30,102
The fire broke out last night.

651
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,522
What do you see?

652
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:36,191
It seems that the staff
in the kitchen got badly injured.

653
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:38,944
Right. What else?

654
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:41,572
This man is...

655
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:44,074
That's right.

656
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,118
That's him.

657
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:49,121
He jumped into the fire

658
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:51,498
to save other people's lives.

659
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,376
I don't think I'm following you.

660
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,504
Usually, when people get hurt,

661
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:01,300
doctors only care
about the treatment of their wounds.

662
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:06,180
But he tried to help them
get injured less.

663
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,765
He might have lost his own life,

664
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:11,393
but he still jumped into the fire.

665
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:14,188
Do you still not understand

666
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,982
the difference?

667
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,527
No, I don't think I do.

668
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:25,157
This man is the doctor
who's called Teacher Kim.

669
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:28,243
He's the true doctor whom I can entrust

670
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,579
my life with.

671
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:57,648
It looks like you finally
recognized his face.

672
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:04,446
You're right. That's him.

673
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:12,162
He's in ventricular fibrillation. Sir.

674
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:18,752
Move him to the hybrid operating room
and bring the defibrillator.

675
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,506
-Epinephrine every three minutes.
-Yes, Doctor.

676
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,723
Did you meet Teacher Kim?

677
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,352
Dr. Yun.

678
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:39,523
What did you say?

679
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:43,360
What did he say?
Did he say you can stay here?

680
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,656
Actually...

681
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:51,577
You can stay here if you want to.

682
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,622
Thank you.

683
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,877
I won't forget that you gave me
the second chance

684
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:04,840
and I'll do everything in my power
to repay your generosity.

685
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:08,510
But, I can't allow you

686
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,512
to treat patients yet.

687
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,641
If I don't treat patients,

688
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:16,852
what should I do here?

689
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,731
You'll work as an orderly.

690
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:24,735
-Orderly?
-Yes, I'm an orderly.

691
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:29,239
Did you just tell me to work

692
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,324
as an orderly?

693
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:33,785
I need to be sure if I can let you
be with the patients or not.

694
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,788
Until you become able to
control yourself solely

695
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:39,333
with your willpower
without taking medications,

696
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,752
the only job you can take
in this hospital is

697
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:43,670
to be an orderly.

698
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:48,342
Why? Can't you do that?

699
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,554
No. It's not that.

700
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,181
Did you accept it?

701
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:57,100
I asked him for some time
to think about it.

702
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,894
Why would you say that?

703
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,854
You should have refused it.

704
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:02,272
You think so?

705
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:06,443
-Working as an orderly is--
-Really? You don't want to?

706
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:15,327
You can just leave if you can't do it.

707
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:18,538
-I won't stop you.
-I didn't say that.

708
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,540
You can't make her work as an orderly.

709
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:25,045
This is the best offer
I can give her, Ms. Oh.

710
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,213
Don't try to change my mind.

711
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:35,180
You heard him. I should go now.

712
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,313
Charge 200J.

713
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:45,649
It's ready.

714
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:48,527
Clear.

715
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,537
-Fill me in.
-He had a car accident.

716
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:01,540
He has right-sided hemopneumothorax
and his right hip is dislocated.

717
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:04,793
He went into ventricular fibrillation
while being hydrated.

718
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:06,753
Please hang in there.

719
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,339
I'll check his heart rhythm.

720
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,427
-Let's try it again. 200J.
-Yes, Doctor.

721
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:16,847
Ready.

722
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:20,267
Clear.

723
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,982
-How long has it been?
-It's been about three minutes.

724
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:31,528
Please, please.

725
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:35,699
I'll check his heart rhythm.

726
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,453
Doctor, we have his pulse now.

727
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,501
Print out the electrocardiogram
and prepare the central line.

728
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,754
-For the blood transfusion--
-You said you'd quit.

729
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,965
Why are you still here?

730
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:56,553
I'm considering him as my last patient
in Doldam Hospital.

731
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:58,889
Did you get his CT scan result?

732
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:01,933
He has multiple rib fracture
and right-sided hemopneumothorax.

733
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,728
I put in a tube
and he's not bleeding much.

734
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:07,063
Simple dislocation on the right hip

735
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,608
and compound fracture
on the left humerus was also found.

736
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:11,651
Have you ever dealt
with hip dislocation before?

737
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:12,903
No.

738
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:15,655
I know how to do it, though.
Do you want me to do it?

739
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,157
Mr. Park.

740
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,366
Bring me a sheet.

741
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,668
What are you doing?

742
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:29,836
Tie up the other side.

743
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:42,766
Are you doing it alone?

744
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:50,440
Is it done?

745
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:58,156
It's done.

746
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,283
What about his vital signs?

747
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,827
-They're stable.
-Okay.

748
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:04,871
Next up is the humerus.

749
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,462
Which one are you?

750
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:13,964
What do you mean?

751
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:17,050
Are you a good doctor

752
00:52:17,133 --> 00:52:18,218
or the best doctor?

753
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:48,623
Wait.

754
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:58,717
KANG DONG-JU

755
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,809
I want to hear it from you.

756
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:11,938
Are you a good doctor or the best doctor?

757
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:24,117
If the patient lying down here
gets to choose,

758
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:27,120
which one do you think he will want?

759
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,831
-The best doctor.
-Wrong.

760
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,418
He will need a doctor
who can treat his injury.

761
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:39,049
What this patient needs so badly now

762
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:41,927
is an orthopedic surgeon
who can treat fractures.

763
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:44,804
So I'm playing all my cards

764
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:48,808
to be the right one for him.

765
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:50,727
Does this answer your question?

766
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:55,982
You can blame the system and the world.

767
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:59,819
You can blame all the people
who messed up the world if you want.

768
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:00,987
That's fine.

769
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:04,699
But nothing will change
even if you keep blaming others.

770
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,412
Those people won't even

771
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:12,457
remember your name.

772
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:21,758
If you really want to win,
become a doctor people need.

773
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:23,843
Stop blaming them
and pay them back with your capability.

774
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,601
Unless you change,

775
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,603
nothing will change.

776
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:35,230
Understand?

777
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,526
Unless you change,

778
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,529
nothing will change.

779
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:47,117
Okay?

780
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,493
That's it.

781
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:51,746
I will let you finish up
on the last patient

782
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:53,707
at Doldam Hospital.

783
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:03,800
No way.

784
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:09,681
Is that him?

785
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:13,101
Dr. Kang!

786
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:17,147
He will be back. Let's just wait.

787
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,663
DEAR DR. BU YONG-JU,
MY NAME IS KANG DONG-JU

788
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:35,623
Teacher Kim.

789
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:39,044
What? Do you still have things left
to say to me?

790
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:42,380
You are him, right?

791
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:44,799
You are the doctor.

792
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:50,805
Aren't you?

793
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,017
You are Dr. Bu Yong-ju.

794
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,317
Is that him?

795
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:06,071
Is Teacher Kim at Doldam Hospital

796
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,573
Dr. Bu Yong-ju?

797
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,366
Well, I don't know.

798
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,659
President Yeo.

799
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:16,289
I don't know the real name of Teacher Kim.

800
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:19,084
There's no way for me to confirm it.

801
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:20,835
Hey, Un-yeong!

802
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,295
Answer my question!

803
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:26,716
I'm sorry, but there is nothing
I can tell you.

804
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,302
President Do, I have to go.

805
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,264
PRESIDENT YEO UN-YEONG

806
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:38,269
Look at these fools.

807
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,273
Is this your way of getting back at me?

808
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,159
Please tell me.

809
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:55,286
Dr. Bu Yong-ju.

810
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:00,917
You are him,

811
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:03,419
aren't you?

812
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,390
Hey.

813
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:17,767
You bonehead.

814
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:21,771
I already told you who I am.
What are you talking about?

815
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:28,528
Teacher Kim.

816
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,905
I'm Dr. Kim.

817
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:33,616
I don't have any other names.

818
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,701
Happy now?

819
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:40,290
Dear Dr. Bu Yong-ju,

820
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:44,127
my name is Kang Dong-ju.

821
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:48,006
When I grow up,

822
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:51,009
I want to be a good doctor like you.

823
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:54,929
Excuse me.

824
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:58,057
Where can I find Dr. Bu Yong-ju?

825
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,350
Dr. Bu Yong-ju?

826
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:01,978
He doesn't work here anymore.

827
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:04,898
He doesn't?

828
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:10,236
Do you know where I can find him?

829
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,988
I don't know that.

830
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:13,364
Excuse me.

831
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,909
This is Geosan Medical Center.

832
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:19,787
Yes. Okay, I will.

833
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:28,671
So that

834
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:33,760
there will be no patients treated unfairly

835
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,345
like my father.

836
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,228
I'm sure.

837
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,314
Dr. Bu Yong-ju.

838
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:50,985
He's the one.

839
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:01,287
