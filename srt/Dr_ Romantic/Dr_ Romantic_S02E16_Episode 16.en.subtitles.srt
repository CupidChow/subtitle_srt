1
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,427
Who were you talking to on the phone?

2
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,638
What? Oh, right.

3
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,058
Is it hard to tell me?

4
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,688
Okay.

5
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,482
I won't pry.

6
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,778
It was Dr. Do In-beom.

7
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,911
He's actually my cousin.

8
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,497
He's my aunt's son.

9
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,131
Goodness, Mr. Yeo.

10
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,259
Mr. Yeo.

11
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,390
He keeps fighting the ventilator,
so the alarm keeps going off.

12
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:21,766
We'll wean him off.

13
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,060
-Ms. Oh.
-Yes?

14
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,938
Give him an ampoule
of dexamethasone through his side.

15
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:27,897
Yes, sir.

16
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,443
Mr. Yeo, I'll take out the tube.

17
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,030
Suction.

18
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,540
Let me extubate you.

19
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,000
EXTUBATE: REMOVAL OF A TUBE

20
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,835
The syringe.

21
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,757
Mr. Yeo.

22
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,760
You can relax and take a deep breath.

23
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,013
Breathe in slowly.

24
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:04,851
And exhale.

25
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,776
How do you feel, Mr. Yeo?

26
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,905
Is it easier for you to breathe?

27
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,537
All right.

28
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,624
You're all right.

29
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,007
I'm sorry, Mr. Yeo.

30
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:40,970
I couldn't…

31
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,309
keep my promise to you.

32
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,429
I was wondering what happened.

33
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,140
I requested a meeting
with Chairman Shin a few times,

34
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,559
but I haven't heard back from her.

35
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,187
She has been busy
over the inheritance issue.

36
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,856
She's almost finished with that.

37
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,191
As soon as she returns,

38
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:39,445
I'm sure she'll give you an answer
regarding your request.

39
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,242
I heard you stopped by Doldam Hospital.

40
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,286
How did you know?

41
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,997
I'm sure Doctor Kim didn't tell you.

42
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:54,544
There are a few people there
who are like my eyes and ears.

43
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,505
It looks like

44
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,341
Doctor Kim still gets under your skin.

45
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,303
Of course not.

46
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:07,640
I'm just trying to get a gist
of how things are going at Doldam.

47
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,185
Now that Chairman Shin Myeong-ho
has passed away,

48
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,565
Bu Yong-ju doesn't have
any solid connections left.

49
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,901
There's no need to be concerned about him.

50
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:20,778
You should probably

51
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:22,822
keep him in check.

52
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:27,702
He can still pull…

53
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,788
a few more strings.

54
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,756
"The Oddball Project"?

55
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,924
What kind of name is that? What is it?

56
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,763
-It's Doctor Kim's homework.
-Homework?

57
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,648
I just saw Moon-jung's dad here.

58
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,443
They looked kind of gloomy.

59
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,237
Does he have a bad relationship with him?

60
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,115
Why are you so concerned about others?

61
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,869
Moon-jung is the type
to get along with anyone.

62
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,039
He's an easygoing guy without a temper.

63
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:18,044
He's nice, generous,
gentle, and softhearted.

64
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,214
That's why I liked him back in med school.

65
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:27,053
I wanted to meet him so badly
that I even joined the Bone Club.

66
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,223
Did you really?

67
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:35,478
One day, I heard from someone
that he only drank espresso shots,

68
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,065
so I only had espresso shots for a while.

69
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,566
It was absolutely bitter.

70
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,111
I wouldn't drink it now
even if it was free.

71
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,362
Isn't that funny?

72
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,117
-Why are you looking at me like that?
-I actually hate it.

73
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:50,701
Hate what?

74
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,996
I thought you should know.

75
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,676
Have you been hiding
in a place like this all along?

76
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,886
I wasn't hiding.

77
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,097
I just didn't keep in contact with you.

78
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,266
Are you

79
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,644
still bitter over divorcing Hae-won?

80
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,814
The only thing…

81
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,109
that troubles me in this world is you.

82
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,571
You know that already.

83
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:33,369
You've had enough for a year.
Stop putting up a fight and come back.

84
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,913
I plan on living this life a bit longer.

85
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,249
Don't expect anything from me.

86
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,544
Why did you study hard to become a doctor

87
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,963
only to live in a country town like this?

88
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,342
This life is more valuable and meaningful

89
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,970
than living as your trophy son.

90
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,031
You haven't left?
I heard your father is here.

91
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,825
Yes, he has to leave soon.

92
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,076
I see.

93
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:25,046
By any chance, are you Dr. Seo Woo-jin?

94
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,176
Yes, I am.

95
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:35,264
A person should live a life
lending to others

96
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,808
instead of continuously borrowing.

97
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,560
You're a young man.

98
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,479
You shouldn't live like your father.

99
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,565
Pardon?

100
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,110
You should always be grateful…

101
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,988
to my son.

102
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,782
That's enough!

103
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,625
What was that all about?

104
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:14,887
I mean, why?

105
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:17,390
He said he only takes his coffee black.

106
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,684
Why didn't he say he hated it
to begin with?

107
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,484
-Do you want to take this one?
-No, I only drink black coffee.

108
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,528
Hey, take the coffee.

109
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,988
I pressed the wrong button.

110
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,364
You can have it.

111
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:39,829
Wait.

112
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,623
Was he trying to let me have it first?

113
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,545
Come on, no way.

114
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:48,838
That can't be right.

115
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,798
You're overthinking it.

116
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,680
PROFESSOR OH

117
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,351
Hey, Eun-jae, it's been a while.

118
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,352
Have you been well?

119
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,230
Yes, I'm doing well. What about you?

120
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,524
Things have been very hectic for me.

121
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,320
Anyway, while I'm on the subject,
you should come back to the main hospital.

122
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,616
-Pardon?
-I heard your nausea is completely gone.

123
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,870
Doctor Kim gave me a call already.

124
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,581
Doctor Kim called him?

125
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:28,294
I thought you could never be a surgeon,
so I gave up on you.

126
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:32,798
But, man, he's as good as they say he is.
I can't believe he cured you.

127
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,927
Why did Doctor Kim call him?

128
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,893
How do you know the name
of that private loan company?

129
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,774
That man you just met
is the chairman of that company.

130
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:55,112
I thought he was your father.

131
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,532
Yes. That's right.

132
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,326
He's my father.

133
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,579
He's a big player in Myeong-dong,

134
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,083
and the owner of the private loan company
that your father…

135
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,211
borrowed money from.

136
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,298
Why…

137
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,927
do these things…

138
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,888
continue to happen?

139
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,808
Come to the main hospital next week.

140
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,185
I'll have a talk with Doctor Kim.

141
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,144
Okay?

142
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:29,730
Why does life…

143
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,484
never leave us in peace?

144
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,623
KOI'S LAW

145
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,086
Hello.

146
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,090
Nurse Jung, try to be on time, okay?

147
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,066
Nurse Joo.

148
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,779
What's with Dr. Yoon and Nurse Park?

149
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,490
NURSING DEPARTMENT

150
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,202
See that? I was right.

151
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:26,829
Right about what?

152
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,206
About her two-timing.

153
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,875
I'm guessing Nurse Park found out.

154
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,547
Look.

155
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,717
Hey, Nurse Park.

156
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,803
Yes, Dr. Yoon?

157
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,472
Is everything all right?

158
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,307
What do you mean?

159
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,810
I mean, with Mr. Yeo and other things.

160
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,105
He's regained consciousness.

161
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,441
I see.

162
00:12:58,652 --> 00:12:59,528
What about us?

163
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,868
Are we all right?

164
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,727
Goodness, Mr. Yeo.

165
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,272
How are you feeling?

166
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,193
What is…

167
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,738
all this?

168
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,867
You're on TPN, dopamine, and dobutamine.

169
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:51,038
And you're getting some mucolytics
and antibiotics too.

170
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,832
MUCOLYTICS: MEDICINE THAT THINS MUCUS

171
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,085
You put me…

172
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,171
on a lot of things.

173
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,594
Let's…

174
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,764
take all these things off.

175
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,601
But, Mr. Yeo…

176
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,275
We live according to the course of nature,

177
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,404
then we leave when it's our time.

178
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,784
Just as you respected my life,

179
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,204
please respect…

180
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,208
my death too, Doctor Kim.

181
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,434
Professor Park.

182
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,580
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

183
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:19,710
Yes. Yes?

184
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,173
Goodness, Chairman Do.

185
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,799
You're here.

186
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,677
I came to see Professor Park.

187
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,930
He hasn't come to work yet.

188
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,015
Please take a seat.

189
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,516
I'll call him.

190
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:51,784
The phone you have reached is turned off.
Please leave a message after the beep.

191
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,622
The phone you have reached is turned off.
Please leave a message after the beep.

192
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,207
He can't be reached?

193
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,875
He didn't come to work,

194
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,378
and his phone is turned off.

195
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,506
And I found this on his desk.

196
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:06,966
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

197
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,626
What did you say Mr. Yeo wanted?

198
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:45,963
Death with dignity?

199
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,758
Yes.

200
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,301
He said that

201
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:52,886
to Doctor Kim.

202
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:57,266
And is he planning on doing this?

203
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,560
If he's already made his decision,

204
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,147
we have no choice but to do it.

205
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:11,822
Yes?

206
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,166
What is it?

207
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,752
Actually,

208
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:29,256
I received a call
from Professor Oh last night.

209
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,676
He told me to return to the main hospital.

210
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,181
That's great news.

211
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,934
Is it?

212
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,980
You always wanted to go back.

213
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,523
Isn't it great news?

214
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,320
Don't you need me here anymore?

215
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:58,452
I think I did a pretty great job here.

216
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:00,871
Isn't that so?

217
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,334
If…

218
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,713
you want me to ask you to stay, then no.

219
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,258
I won't do that, Eun-jae.

220
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,512
Does this mean you don't need me?

221
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:24,228
I mean that I can't let my opinion
make an impact on your career.

222
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,273
But you can still give me some advice.

223
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,863
Take a seat.

224
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,621
Well,

225
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:46,917
if you decide to stay, things will be

226
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,628
more hectic than it has been,

227
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,422
and you'll have to make sacrifices too.

228
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:58,303
You'll have to run to the OR at all hours
because of our patients.

229
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,473
And in the midst of the patients
that swarm into the hospital,

230
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,227
you may get worn out and exhausted.

231
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:08,438
However,

232
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,442
someone has to take up this work.

233
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,737
The weight of responsibility
you feel on the front lines

234
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,699
may become tormenting.

235
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,829
But when you see the patients
you save every single day,

236
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:29,251
you will definitely keep
your pride as a doctor.

237
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:37,968
However, if you return
to the main hospital…

238
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,637
What if I return?

239
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,807
You'll develop your career

240
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,268
under much better conditions.

241
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,980
You'll receive more grants
for your research too.

242
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:55,319
And you'll make many great connections,

243
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:59,781
which will lead
to many different opportunities in life.

244
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,160
And you'll be monetarily compensated

245
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,830
in proportion
to your experience and skills.

246
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,210
But still, doctor…

247
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,964
If you're asking
which is more befitting of a doctor,

248
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,468
which is a better life,

249
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:23,096
and which side is more valuable,

250
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:26,975
I don't think

251
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,354
that's something we can judge.

252
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,857
Life is…

253
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:42,366
not about comparing yourself with others.

254
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,080
It's about the choices you make.

255
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,090
I am sure of this, though.

256
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,009
You'll do well no matter where you are.

257
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,972
No matter which journey you take
or which choice you make,

258
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,061
do not doubt yourself, Eun-jae.

259
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,897
Do you understand?

260
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,000
Dr. Seo.

261
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,294
Dr. Seo.

262
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,171
Dr. Seo!

263
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,302
Do you have something to say to me?

264
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,888
I thought we should have a talk.

265
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:47,848
I'm sorry,

266
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,976
but I still have a lot on my mind.

267
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,438
Yes, I'm angry.

268
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,316
But I don't know who I'm angry at.

269
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,777
And I can't just cover it up
saying that it was all in the past,

270
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,738
that it was something between our parents.

271
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,949
It's honestly appalling and absurd.

272
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,036
But it's not like…

273
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:13,040
this is your fault.

274
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,551
Would you feel more at ease…

275
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,095
if I left this hospital?

276
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:32,184
I've been through this often,
so I'm used to it.

277
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,437
That's how I've lost my friends…

278
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,649
and someone whom I loved.

279
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,032
I never wanted to go through this again,

280
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,368
so I ran all the way here.

281
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,495
But

282
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,289
things don't always work out well.

283
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,713
SURGERY, FAMILY MEDICINE

284
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:15,936
What's with you?

285
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,692
Did you get a scolding from Doctor Kim?

286
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,822
You know, Woo-jin…

287
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,490
Yes? What is it?

288
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,034
He told me to return.

289
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,373
Professor Oh told me to return
to the main hospital.

290
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:43,547
When?

291
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,007
Right away, starting next week.

292
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:56,685
That's great news.

293
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:58,562
Congrats.

294
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,651
SURGERY, FAMILY MEDICINE

295
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,923
Please give Professor Park
one more chance.

296
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:31,678
If you give him one more chance,
we'll make sure we'll turn it around.

297
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:35,807
What's your name?

298
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:37,976
I'm Yang Ho-jun.

299
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,646
I've been working with Professor Park
for over ten years.

300
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:45,233
I'm ready to do anything for him.

301
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,319
Please let me know.

302
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,573
You tell me.

303
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:56,369
How far can you go
for Professor Park's sake?

304
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,797
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

305
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,132
DECEMBER 19, 2019, PARK MIN-GOOK

306
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:27,400
How's Dr. Seo's homework coming along?

307
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,568
I'm not sure.

308
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,820
He'll have a tough time.

309
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,741
It's a tough condition
for a second-year fellow to diagnose.

310
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,537
Do you know
what Doctor Kim's condition is?

311
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,289
I'll get going now.

312
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,959
Hey. You definitely know something.

313
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,043
Hey.

314
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,045
Hey, Moon-jung!

315
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,089
Hey! Wait a second.

316
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,140
Hey.

317
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,936
Have you heard?
Eun-jae is returning to the main hospital.

318
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:05,897
Yes, I heard.

319
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:08,483
We're talking about
throwing her a farewell party.

320
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,487
Okay. Let's put
something together, Nurse Um.

321
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,281
Okay, let's do that.

322
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,408
Somewhere else
other than Once in a While. Please?

323
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,785
There's no place better than that.

324
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,163
Gosh, I'm so sick of Once in a While.

325
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,040
What's the patient's condition?

326
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,295
It's acute appendicitis.

327
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,171
He's had a part of his lung removed,

328
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,465
and I think it was
the left lower lobectomy.

329
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:36,094
-There's not an effusion there, right?
-No, it looks fine.

330
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,805
After a lobectomy,
it gets a little tough to tell

331
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:42,058
what the reactive fluid is
in the early stages of pneumonia,

332
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,269
but this patient looks fine.

333
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,186
Really?

334
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,063
Okay, then.

335
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,984
Anything else?

336
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,527
No. Nothing else.

337
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,447
Okay, then.

338
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,326
Okay. Good.

339
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,509
What's going on between them?

340
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:17,761
Beats me.

341
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,387
Did they break up?

342
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,722
-What?
-What?

343
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,807
Wait, they were dating?

344
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,977
Weren't they?
I thought they were dating all along.

345
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:44,120
I mean, you wouldn't react like that
if you heard that your neighbor's dog

346
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,163
was leaving their house.

347
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:47,957
I mean, of all people, I'm about to leave.

348
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,918
How can he be so nonchalant?

349
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,336
Don't you think that's awful?

350
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,715
She said she's going back next week,

351
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:59,177
but how can she be so casual
as if she's talking about someone else?

352
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,804
She didn't even ask how I felt about it.

353
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:04,349
Of course, nothing would change
even if he asked me to stay.

354
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,392
Of course,

355
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,478
it's not like I'd ask her to stay.

356
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,524
But still,
he shouldn't ignore me completely.

357
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:15,235
But she can't disregard me like this,
can she?

358
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,572
Why aren't you saying anything?

359
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:23,159
Oh, right. I was trying
to figure out the situation.

360
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:26,871
I thought you were very angry at me.

361
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:27,997
But you barged in

362
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:30,792
and started talking to me about this.

363
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,836
And? Am I making you uncomfortable?

364
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,045
No, not at all.

365
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:35,296
I'm fine…

366
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:38,007
as long as you're fine.

367
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,391
Anyway,

368
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,520
why did you want to run away
from your father?

369
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,774
Did I ever tell you how I got divorced…

370
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,819
after being married for a month?

371
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,654
No.

372
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:03,408
She was the daughter of an assemblyman
whom my father had been sponsoring.

373
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:08,371
She said she married me
for my father's money, not because of me.

374
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,167
He thinks money can resolve everything,

375
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,253
so he bought his daughter-in-law too.

376
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,756
I really liked her, though.

377
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,012
I didn't want to be his puppet anymore.

378
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:28,641
It looks like…

379
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,520
you didn't have such a great life either.

380
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,607
But it wasn't as unfortunate as yours.

381
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,949
What should I do with Eun-jae?

382
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,493
You should just ask him out first.

383
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,036
How can I do that?

384
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,497
We were in the same class
and we work at the same hospital.

385
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,041
What would we do if we broke up?

386
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,627
Don't you think it's too early
to worry about breaking up with him

387
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,128
when you haven't started dating him?

388
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:00,381
And I don't think I'll be good
at working and dating at the same time.

389
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,550
You can do both slightly less well.

390
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,344
You don't have to be good at both.

391
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:07,597
I'm jealous.

392
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,308
Why is everything so easy for you?

393
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,852
Why is everything so tough for you?

394
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:16,147
You have Dr. Seo,
you're a specialist, and you're tall.

395
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,566
According to my standards,
you have everything.

396
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,319
She's right.

397
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,114
Why is everything so tough for me?

398
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,632
Are you leaving?

399
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,593
Yes, I am.

400
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:02,902
Actually,

401
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,363
I have a question.

402
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:07,991
What is it?

403
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:09,450
Why

404
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,661
aren't you asking me to stay?

405
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,124
Do I

406
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,502
not mean that much to you?

407
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,635
I was just scared.

408
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,932
I didn't want to get greedy
and cross the line…

409
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:35,810
and lose you.

410
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:40,189
What are you talking about?

411
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:45,111
I'm the one who's crossing over the line.

412
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:47,947
Don't you get it?

413
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,911
You wanted to go back.

414
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,872
So you don't want to ask me to stay?

415
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,833
What if you regret this later?

416
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,335
Then I will…

417
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:02,921
just do that thing

418
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,131
you told me about.

419
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,344
That thing I told you about?

420
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,180
Resetting.

421
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,450
Oh, I'm sorry.

422
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,328
I was in a bit of a rush, wasn't I?

423
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:39,707
I'm pretty good at learning things…

424
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,169
TREATMENT ROOM 1

425
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,381
Dr. Bae.

426
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,301
-Are you going home?
-Hey, Dr. Yang.

427
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,096
-You're still here?
-Well, you know.

428
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,306
Professor Park didn't come in,

429
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,934
so I should be here to hold down the fort.

430
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,061
By the way,

431
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:45,440
does Doctor Kim have something
other than CTS?

432
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,192
What do you mean?

433
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:51,112
Well, I overheard people talking about it.

434
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,113
Just some rumors.

435
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,031
Well…

436
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,782
I'm not sure.

437
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,117
Oh, really?

438
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,119
I see.

439
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:00,747
All right, then.

440
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,707
See you.

441
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,196
As of today,

442
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,698
we'll be taking Mr. Yeo…

443
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,328
off life support per his wishes.

444
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,751
Those of you…

445
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,589
who wish to say your last goodbyes…

446
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,217
may do so now.

447
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,178
That's what we'll do.

448
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,608
As he was announcing the last farewell,

449
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,653
he sounded calmer than I expected.

450
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,322
And…

451
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,618
our last farewell itself

452
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:05,580
wasn't as somber as we thought it'd be.

453
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:12,962
If I fail my board exam,
will you accept me back here at Doldam?

454
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:19,010
-Dr. Jeong.
-Yes, sir?

455
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,012
What are your thoughts on this?

456
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,556
I think she's worried for nothing.

457
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,558
Enough. Just do well on the exam.

458
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,770
Overachievers tend to worry all the time.

459
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,481
I really hope I'm worried for nothing.

460
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,409
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

461
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:51,584
Nurse Um.

462
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,841
Gosh, I'm sorry.
I really didn't want to cry, but…

463
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,763
Don't cry.

464
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,476
It's sad that we have to say goodbye.

465
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,480
But maybe…

466
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,775
death…

467
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:20,780
isn't as sad as we presume it to be.

468
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,588
Sir, how about I sing a song for you?

469
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:39,924
A-reum.

470
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,801
Let's not do that.

471
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,636
You're not really a great singer.

472
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:49,600
I'd love to hear you sing, Dr. Yoon.

473
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:53,980
Okay. I'll sing
my favorite children's song.

474
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,190
A children's song? Why?

475
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:04,740
It can bloom wherever

476
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:10,288
It can bloom without a name

477
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:14,750
It can bloom in any shape

478
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:18,421
In the end, they're all flowers

479
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:23,676
It's a flower even if it blooms
In the mountains

480
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:27,888
It's a flower even if it blooms
On the field

481
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:32,518
Even the ones on the streets
Are flowers too

482
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:35,938
In the end, they're all flowers

483
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:41,193
It can bloom wherever

484
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:46,741
It can bloom in any shape

485
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:52,079
It can bloom without a name

486
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:56,292
In the end, they're all flowers

487
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,087
Come in.

488
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,177
Doctor Kim.

489
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,723
Mr. Yeo is waiting for you.

490
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:00,981
All right.

491
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:05,611
Let's go.

492
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,286
TREAT PATIENTS LIKE YOUR FAMILY

493
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:24,922
Ms. Oh,

494
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:28,634
mix 100 mg of pethidine
into his IV solution.

495
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:30,761
Okay, got it.

496
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,149
Let's remove the TPN,

497
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,901
dopamine, and dobutamine.

498
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,695
Okay.

499
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,210
I'll do it.

500
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,202
Sir.

501
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:41,373
We've removed everything
that's been hanging off you.

502
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:45,461
Sadly,

503
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,756
there's nothing more we can do for you.

504
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:54,136
Thank you.

505
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:01,352
I'm sorry we must say goodbye like this.

506
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:05,356
But personally,

507
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,901
I'm very grateful…

508
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,655
and happy that I can now say goodbye.

509
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:21,497
I wish you…

510
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,252
all the best.

511
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:50,776
And, Doctor Kim…

512
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,362
Yes, sir? Go ahead.

513
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,865
You wanted to open a trauma center.

514
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:00,286
I really hope…

515
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,956
you achieve that goal of yours.

516
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,293
Thank you.

517
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:11,672
I promise…

518
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:14,967
I'll make it happen.

519
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,068
Till we meet again, sir.

520
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:57,903
Whatever form it takes…

521
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:01,907
a farewell always leaves a scar
in your heart.

522
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,953
It torments you…

523
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:09,998
and makes you feel pain.

524
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,586
It makes you sad…

525
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,384
or lonely.

526
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,888
And because of that, you don't want…

527
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,893
to have to say goodbye to anyone anymore.

528
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,104
TREAT PATIENTS LIKE YOUR FAMILY

529
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:34,231
But…

530
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,249
TREATMENT ROOM 1, TREATMENT ROOM 2

531
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,503
What's up?

532
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,630
About the homework…

533
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,469
I think I found the answer.

534
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:26,658
THE ODDBALL PROJECT

535
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:28,410
What should I do?

536
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:30,996
I can't find any clues.

537
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,540
Why don't you narrow things down first?

538
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,877
-How?
-Remember what Doctor Kim said?

539
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,757
I don't think it requires GS's opinion.

540
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:45,260
Then all the GS binders are out.

541
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,138
THE ODDBALL PROJECT

542
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,474
Other than for CTS, OS is also irrelevant.

543
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:51,934
So OS is out too.

544
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,352
THE ODDBALL PROJECT

545
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,313
Then what about CS?

546
00:46:56,396 --> 00:47:00,192
Based on the symptoms he described,
I don't think it's a CS issue.

547
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:02,152
Then CS is out too.

548
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:06,114
So, what's left?

549
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,115
THE ODDBALL PROJECT, EM

550
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:09,451
That leaves us with EM.

551
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,955
Then we should look for emergency cases

552
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:15,666
that didn't require trauma surgery.

553
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:20,712
We started collecting cases
for this project about two years ago,

554
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:24,174
and Dr. Yun Seo-jeong
compiled most of this information.

555
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:28,303
Is there anyone who is as knowledgeable
as she is about this project?

556
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:31,265
Yes, I've been a part of the project
from the get-go.

557
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,559
Why do you ask?

558
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:36,728
Doctor Kim gave him some homework.

559
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:41,441
And he won't get the surgery for his CTS
until Dr. Seo completes his homework.

560
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,778
Tell me what the symptoms are.
Let's work on it together.

561
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,104
PATIENT RECORD, MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS

562
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,733
DIAGNOSIS OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS

563
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:25,652
LIMB WEAKNESS

564
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:46,965
Since you're my doctor, I'd like you…

565
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,469
to speak with OS and book my surgery.

566
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:54,222
Yes, sir.

567
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:12,115
This is where you can enjoy…

568
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:15,619
the best view of the lake.

569
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,709
What's life all about anyway?

570
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:26,588
I can't believe I've been too busy
to enjoy this beautiful view.

571
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:31,426
Why did you want to see me?

572
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,599
The surgery for my right wrist
has been booked.

573
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,020
-And?
-For three weeks after the surgery,

574
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,066
I can't operate on any patients.

575
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:49,444
So what?

576
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:50,696
It'd be great…

577
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:56,576
if you could fill in for me
and operate on patients during that time.

578
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:03,291
Quite frankly, I don't understand
why you're asking me to do that.

579
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:09,006
Because you are still
the president of Doldam Hospital.

580
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:12,134
I'm sorry, but I already resigned…

581
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:16,138
which means it has nothing to do with me.

582
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:18,682
Ask someone else.

583
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,810
Are you running away again?

584
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,774
You see,
if you keep running away like that,

585
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,611
you'll never be able
to escape from anything.

586
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:38,201
You've gotten so used
to acting like a mentor and boss

587
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,245
among a bunch of clueless fools…

588
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,583
that you try to lecture
anyone that comes your way.

589
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:49,713
Don't treat me like I'm one of those fools

590
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:51,214
because it offends me.

591
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:53,216
They're not fools.

592
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,303
They're just people with emotional wounds.

593
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:01,224
And everyone, including us,

594
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:04,895
has such wounds.

595
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:10,067
It'll only be for three weeks.

596
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,569
I'm not asking you to do it for anyone.

597
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,238
As a fellow doctor,

598
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:17,407
please consider helping me out.

599
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:35,592
Sir!

600
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,261
You're here.

601
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,680
I couldn't reach you,
and you didn't even come in.

602
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,058
I was so worried about you.

603
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:46,978
Did you take my letter of resignation?

604
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,898
-Yes, I did.
-Go bring it back now.

605
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:51,441
I threw it away already.

606
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:54,111
How dare you do such a thing
without my permission?

607
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:55,695
I'm sorry.

608
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:58,198
But, you see,

609
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,242
you can't just resign like that

610
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,577
without even telling me.

611
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:06,998
Do you have any idea
how much time and effort

612
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:08,834
I have invested in you?

613
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,794
-What?
-You see…

614
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:14,214
I bet everything on you.

615
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:17,634
So you cannot give up like this, sir.

616
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:21,513
At this lousy hospital in the countryside
and because of that absurd doctor.

617
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:23,598
Look, Dr. Yang…

618
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,100
I refuse to accept…

619
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:28,311
your letter of resignation.

620
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:31,565
You always do things your way

621
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:35,318
and make your own decisions about
everything, but your decision to resign…

622
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:38,780
I won't let it happen.

623
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:40,907
Do you understand?

624
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:43,243
Gosh, you're being pathetic.

625
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,537
Sure, you can call me pathetic.

626
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,747
I don't even care if you call me a fool

627
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,292
or a clingy moron,

628
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,545
so just stay where you belong.

629
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:55,088
Okay?

630
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,548
Have you lost your mind?

631
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:59,176
When you decided to transfer here,

632
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,137
I followed you without a single complaint.

633
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:05,473
I've been your drinking buddy and driver.

634
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,685
I took care
of all sorts of things for you…

635
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:11,730
without complaining about it.

636
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:14,191
Do you know why I did that?

637
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:18,236
Because I wanted a successful career too.

638
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:20,405
Okay?

639
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:26,077
I wanted to assist the famous
and competent Professor Park…

640
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:30,040
and become one of the successful people.

641
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:36,963
But if you give up now,
what am I supposed to do?

642
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:42,010
You can do whatever you want
with your life,

643
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:43,970
but what about me?

644
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:48,642
Your old position
at the main hospital is still vacant.

645
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,188
I'll make sure they'll take you back.

646
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,150
I don't mind being your minion,

647
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,319
but I refuse to be seen as a loser.

648
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:04,241
I've been loyal to you
for the past ten years…

649
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:07,702
so it's on you now.

650
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:09,663
Do not run away.

651
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:10,789
Stay here…

652
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,918
and make up for the time I devoted to you.

653
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,236
All right. Let's do this.

654
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,493
You guys were waiting for me?

655
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:50,453
Let's go.

656
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:58,586
RESTRICTED AREA: OPERATING ROOM

657
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:02,090
OR 1, OR 2

658
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:04,676
What are you all doing here?

659
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:12,225
Well, please take good care of me.

660
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,691
-Let's go in.
-Doctor Kim.

661
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:22,360
They're also here to see you.

662
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:26,656
Oh, gosh.

663
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,591
My gosh, Mr. Gu.

664
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,640
RESTRICTED AREA: OPERATING ROOM

665
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:56,353
Now,

666
00:55:57,645 --> 00:55:59,939
I want to ask you my last question.

667
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:02,734
Why did you give me this homework?

668
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:06,029
You said you need
better intuition and luck.

669
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:09,407
You're right.

670
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:10,700
To us, surgeons,

671
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:14,079
being intuitive and lucky is important.

672
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:19,250
However, that level of intuition and luck…

673
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,837
can't be obtained
without hard work and experience.

674
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,632
You need to remember that.

675
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,053
In those binders,

676
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:32,889
you'll find information on all the cases

677
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:36,351
of trauma surgery I've performed

678
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:40,522
and emergency treatments
I've given since joining Doldam.

679
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:44,734
The surgeons that took part in the project

680
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:48,279
went over each case
from five to dozens of times.

681
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:51,199
We reflected on each case over and over

682
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:53,618
and tried many different simulations.

683
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,454
We learned from the successful cases

684
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:58,581
as well as from our mistakes.

685
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:02,168
"Could there have been a better way?

686
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:05,213
Could we have further reduced
the risks for the patient?"

687
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:08,550
It's the outcome
of our research and hard work.

688
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,222
Incoming!

689
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,016
The intercostal vessel.

690
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:21,271
What I'm saying is, my intuition and luck
weren't the only reason I could diagnose

691
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:25,066
the pneumothorax
and find the intercostal vessel.

692
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:33,032
There's only one way we can train
ourselves to make less mistakes.

693
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:36,286
Gaining as much experience as possible.

694
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:41,875
Hence, we're compiling all our past cases
to create a new protocol.

695
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,961
That is what "The Oddball Project"

696
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:46,671
is all about.

697
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:52,677
It must've taken a long time
to compile all the information.

698
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:55,972
Why share it with me?

699
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:04,481
Because you're one of the oddballs.

700
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:08,693
Does that…

701
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,237
answer your question?

702
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,007
Senn retractor.

703
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,259
One more, please.

704
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:36,471
Nurse Joo, focus the light, please.

705
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:37,388
Okay.

706
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,019
How does it look, Dr. Bae?

707
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,563
Self-retaining retractor.

708
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:56,282
There. We see
the transverse carpal ligament.

709
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,951
A FIBROUS BAND NEAR THE WRIST

710
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:01,913
It's severely inflamed.

711
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:03,122
Yes, it is.

712
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:06,167
He performed all those surgeries
despite that.

713
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:14,092
Now, we just need to take out
the tenosynovium.

714
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:47,166
PRESIDENT PARK MIN-GOOK

715
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:52,964
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

716
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:59,304
Let's move the patient. One, two, three.

717
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:02,015
We'll remove the flap. One, two, three.

718
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:07,353
Do you suffer from any chronic conditions?
Were you diagnosed? Any medications?

719
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:09,689
No, never.

720
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:12,025
But my stomach hurts so much.

721
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:13,735
Vitals?

722
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:16,821
-120 over 70, 110 BPM.
-I'm going to press your stomach.

723
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:22,577
This is the liver.
Set up an IV line and run the lab tests.

724
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,120
Give him nasal oxygen, two liters.

725
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:25,622
A dose of tramadol as well, please.

726
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:26,581
Got it.

727
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:29,917
Once the IV is in,
we'll take CT scans and X-rays.

728
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,127
-Dr. Yoon.
-Yes?

729
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:34,047
I'll give the orders.
Check the FAST before the CT scans.

730
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,006
Got it.

731
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:37,258
Sir, we'll do an ultrasound first.

732
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:43,264
What?

733
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:46,976
What is this?

734
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,653
Go ahead. They're almost done here.

735
01:00:58,571 --> 01:00:59,656
Okay.

736
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:07,205
PROFESSOR OH

737
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:13,419
Hello, Professor?

738
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:16,130
What? Situs inversus?

739
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:18,341
You mean, the organs are reversed?

740
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:20,885
It seems like all his organs are reversed,

741
01:01:20,968 --> 01:01:23,012
which means it's situs inversus totalis.

742
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:24,222
Have you seen it before?

743
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:27,308
No, I've only read about it.
This is my first time actually seeing it.

744
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:32,313
The contrast medium is leaking here.
I think a mesenteric vessel is ruptured.

745
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:34,982
I don't think his spleen tore
due to trauma.

746
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:37,819
It looks like he has multiple spleens.

747
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:42,407
Situs inversus is caused by malrotation,

748
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:45,868
and some malrotation patients have been
reported to have multiple spleens.

749
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,620
ANOMALY OF ROTATION OF THE MIDGUT

750
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:49,455
He needs surgery.

751
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,456
What should we do?

752
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,792
Doctor Kim can't do it now.

753
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:15,064
Professor Park, just a moment.

754
01:02:17,608 --> 01:02:19,318
We have a traffic accident victim.

755
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:25,074
He has situs inversus.

756
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:29,245
Situs inversus totalis.
And he has multiple spleens.

757
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:32,290
He needs surgery right away
due to intra-abdominal bleeding,

758
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,209
but I've never done it before.

759
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:37,837
I need your help.

760
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:44,177
Are you running away again?

761
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,889
You see,
if you keep running away like that,

762
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:51,684
you'll never be able
to escape from anything.

763
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:55,271
I'm not asking you to do it for anyone.

764
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:59,192
As a fellow doctor,
please consider helping me out.

765
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:03,446
Professor.

766
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,831
-Where's the patient?
-In the hybrid room.

767
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,220
How is he?

768
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:33,476
FAST.

769
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:56,332
Bu Yong-ju, this fool.

770
01:03:57,416 --> 01:03:59,001
He kept this from everyone?

771
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,130
Can we…

772
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:07,009
kick Doctor Kim out with that?

773
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,470
That will depend
on how we'll make it look.

774
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:13,599
I have to say, well done.

775
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:18,479
You achieved something
even Park Min-gook couldn't do.

776
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:22,775
What was your name again?

777
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:25,528
I'm Yang Ho-jun, sir.

778
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,322
I'll definitely…

779
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:31,158
remember your name now.

780
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:33,619
Dr. Yang Ho-jun.

781
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:39,041
OR 1, OR 2

782
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:47,341
What are you doing?

783
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:48,676
Were you waiting for me?

784
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:54,807
Do you want coffee?

785
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:06,861
It's good.

786
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:22,668
Talk to me.

787
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,670
I know you have something to say.

788
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:26,088
What?

789
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,299
Do you even read minds now?

790
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:30,134
I've known you since med school.

791
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:32,803
Just one look at your face

792
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:36,641
tells me if you're in a good or bad mood.

793
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:39,644
I can tell when you're stressed out,

794
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:41,312
embarrassed…

795
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:44,941
or have something to say.

796
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:47,151
I can tell that much.

797
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,196
The thing is,

798
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:53,407
I got a call from Professor Oh.

799
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:56,077
He's swamped with urgent cases.

800
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,537
He has three overlapping operations,

801
01:05:58,829 --> 01:06:00,706
so he asked for my help.

802
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:04,168
He said two or three days would do.

803
01:06:08,756 --> 01:06:10,716
So you'll go back to the main hospital?

804
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:13,052
He's my professor,
so I can't really say no.

805
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:19,558
Can I go for a few days? Yes?

806
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:25,189
Yes, of course.

807
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,919
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

808
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:50,464
POST

809
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:55,594
Good morning.

810
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:57,054
Good morning.

811
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:58,222
Hey.

812
01:06:58,305 --> 01:06:59,515
Sleepy morning.

813
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:02,476
Good morning.

814
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,894
Good morning, Dr. Yoon.

815
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:06,355
So? How did your exam go?

816
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:08,858
When will you find out the results?

817
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:11,318
Who wants coffee?

818
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,405
Me.

819
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,582
What are you doing here alone?

820
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:30,046
Trying to figure out
how I can hide from everyone.

821
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:34,133
You don't know the results yet,
so don't worry.

822
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:40,639
I feel like everyone at Doldam
is a genius.

823
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:43,434
Why am I so dumb?

824
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:47,188
I think you're a genius too.

825
01:07:48,689 --> 01:07:50,024
-I am?
-Yes.

826
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:53,152
Your smiles are genius.

827
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,196
Gosh.

828
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:03,871
You're back to being
the version of you that I like.

829
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:08,626
You were very curt with me for a while,
so I was a little scared.

830
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:11,504
"Curt" may not be the right word.

831
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:13,422
I was just being a loser.

832
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:18,844
To tell you the truth, when I found out
that you and Dr. Do are related…

833
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:20,930
How should I put this?

834
01:08:21,138 --> 01:08:23,599
I felt this weird distance between us.

835
01:08:23,682 --> 01:08:26,685
It's true that he comes
from a very powerful family,

836
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:29,146
but my family is very ordinary.

837
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:31,774
My dad is an elementary school teacher.

838
01:08:31,857 --> 01:08:34,318
My aunt and uncle were always so busy.

839
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:36,612
That's why he hung out at our place often.

840
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:39,323
And I started bugging him
when I entered med school.

841
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,702
A-reum, why do you like me?

842
01:08:44,703 --> 01:08:45,913
Because you're handsome.

843
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:50,334
You have a handsome face,

844
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:52,628
a healthy mind,

845
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:54,713
and a beautiful heart.

846
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:17,278
From now on,

847
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:20,990
I'll try to be
an even better boyfriend to you.

848
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:27,705
Okay.

849
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,552
All right. Let's have a look.

850
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:44,889
Let's see.

851
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:54,315
-How does it feel?
-Good.

852
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:58,485
The chronic pain
that used to bother me is gone.

853
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:01,113
And I can move the wrist much easier.

854
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:04,700
I feel like I should be able to operate
on patients right away.

855
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:07,745
No, you can't do that.

856
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:11,498
Please avoid surgery
and refrain from any strenuous activities.

857
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:14,210
Don't you worry, doctor.

858
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:19,882
With this wrist, I can easily work
for another 30 years.

859
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:24,470
Keep taking your medication.

860
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:26,722
We'll begin the physiotherapy next week.

861
01:10:28,098 --> 01:10:29,725
Please follow the instructions.

862
01:10:29,808 --> 01:10:31,852
I will, Bone Doctor.

863
01:10:32,436 --> 01:10:34,396
Doctor Kim!

864
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,065
It's finally here.

865
01:10:36,148 --> 01:10:37,274
Here, look!

866
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:39,026
Okay, later.

867
01:10:39,693 --> 01:10:41,362
Let's talk about it later.

868
01:10:42,821 --> 01:10:43,739
Oh, okay.

869
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:45,491
Got it.

870
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:47,117
NEXT-DAY EXPRESS MAIL

871
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,168
I don't think we need to worry.

872
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:59,588
The surgery went well,
and he's recovering fast.

873
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:03,133
Also, it looks like
he's trying to be very careful.

874
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:06,220
Okay. Sounds good.

875
01:11:06,845 --> 01:11:08,180
By the way, how's Eun-jae?

876
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:09,974
Still no word from her?

877
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:14,186
So two days?

878
01:11:14,728 --> 01:11:16,355
Two or three days.

879
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:18,023
Just two days.

880
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:21,694
Okay. Two days, it is.

881
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:37,918
I'll go there if you don't come back.

882
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:39,712
Hey.

883
01:11:40,879 --> 01:11:44,091
The guy I'm head over heels for
is right here.

884
01:11:44,174 --> 01:11:46,051
How could I not come back?

885
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:47,970
Right?

886
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:54,768
Drive safely. Okay?

887
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:57,313
Okay.

888
01:12:11,243 --> 01:12:12,870
That's what Eun-jae said,

889
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:14,747
but it's been a week.

890
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:15,998
No, not a week.

891
01:12:16,081 --> 01:12:19,084
It's been almost ten days,
yet no word from her whatsoever.

892
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:20,627
And she's clearly not back yet.

893
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:23,005
Professor Oh got her good.

894
01:12:23,088 --> 01:12:26,842
Everyone knows that
he's got a thing for competent people.

895
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:30,721
Whenever he notices anyone who's good,
he wants the person to work for him.

896
01:12:30,804 --> 01:12:33,599
And he takes great care of his people.

897
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,185
Are you not going to eat your noodles?

898
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:37,728
-It'll swell up.
-Oh, right.

899
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:43,859
Anyway, I think Eun-jae…

900
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:51,408
She won't come back, Dr. Seo.

901
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:05,631
Suction, please.

902
01:13:06,256 --> 01:13:07,257
Suction.

903
01:13:08,425 --> 01:13:09,593
Suture.

904
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:11,136
Suture.

905
01:13:21,688 --> 01:13:23,315
-Cut.
-Cut.

906
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:28,821
What happened to you at Doldam
in the past two months?

907
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:33,283
I owe it all to Doctor Kim.

908
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:36,161
I learned so much from him.

909
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:38,288
Since you're already here,

910
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:41,125
how about you take on
the lobectomy case too?

911
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:43,752
But I already did three more operations
than we had agreed on.

912
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:45,379
With the skills you have now,

913
01:13:45,462 --> 01:13:48,340
you could run the entire department
in a year or two.

914
01:13:49,007 --> 01:13:51,385
Why go back to the countryside?

915
01:13:51,468 --> 01:13:53,929
If you stay with me,
you'll have a great career ahead.

916
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:57,099
I'll make sure you can fly high.

917
01:13:58,183 --> 01:14:00,269
I wish you had said that a long time ago.

918
01:14:01,728 --> 01:14:04,064
When I was lost and bad at my job,

919
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:07,151
when I dozed off or passed out in the OR.

920
01:14:07,901 --> 01:14:10,487
Why didn't you believe in me
and guide me back then?

921
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:13,323
Back then, you were a huge mess.

922
01:14:16,201 --> 01:14:19,496
Do you know about the Koi's law?

923
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:20,914
What's that?

924
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:24,042
The size of the fish tank
or pond they're in determines

925
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:25,836
how big the koi will grow to be.

926
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:27,629
What does that have to do with you?

927
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:29,590
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

928
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:34,511
but I think I've already outgrown
the aquarium

929
01:14:35,095 --> 01:14:36,972
you can provide for me.

930
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:40,726
I'll get going then.

931
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:48,525
That jerk.

932
01:14:53,405 --> 01:14:55,032
Doctor Kim said this.

933
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:59,453
People do as well as you trust them,
mature as much as you adore them,

934
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:02,498
and grow as much as you acknowledge them.

935
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:07,336
He said the circumstances I choose
and the thoughts I have

936
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:11,048
will bring about
a huge difference in the result.

937
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:17,888
I heard you had 15 different operations
in one week.

938
01:15:19,097 --> 01:15:23,352
Our staff have been praising you
for owning the operating room.

939
01:15:23,435 --> 01:15:25,687
If you were that good
at emergency operations,

940
01:15:26,271 --> 01:15:30,150
why have you only been working
on cancer patients to this day?

941
01:15:30,234 --> 01:15:33,445
I've been telling you this from day one,

942
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,322
but I like doing things
according to a routine.

943
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:39,284
I like seeing stable patterns
and facing situations I can control.

944
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:42,746
I guarantee that you,

945
01:15:44,289 --> 01:15:45,499
Professor Park,

946
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:47,417
are definitely one of us.

947
01:15:50,462 --> 01:15:52,381
You used me as an excuse to come here,

948
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:55,050
but you wanted to come here, didn't you?

949
01:15:55,133 --> 01:15:57,469
No, you got me wrong.

950
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:00,806
Let's just do this together.

951
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:07,563
Rebellious surgeons like you and me
can't work with VIP patients.

952
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:09,731
You're definitely the type

953
01:16:09,856 --> 01:16:13,151
to be happier saving people
out in this secluded hospital

954
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:15,362
than making it big out there.

955
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:16,822
Isn't that so?

956
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:20,450
So,

957
01:16:21,451 --> 01:16:23,036
stop running away.

958
01:16:25,706 --> 01:16:27,624
If I decide to stay here,

959
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:30,294
things will be more troublesome for you.

960
01:16:34,172 --> 01:16:36,258
It's not always a bad idea

961
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:39,386
to have an adequate amount of anxiety.

962
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:45,100
And I can't keep working with this system.

963
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:48,186
Do you have a plan?

964
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:50,647
If I decide to stay,

965
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:53,317
in three years,

966
01:16:54,401 --> 01:16:57,404
I'd like to turn this place
into a trauma center on state support.

967
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:03,076
I want to establish a trauma center
more than anyone else.

968
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:08,540
In order to do that,
we'll have to play a lot of politics.

969
01:17:10,917 --> 01:17:12,085
Can you deal with that?

970
01:17:13,837 --> 01:17:15,672
Sure. Let's do it.

971
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:24,765
You know what?

972
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:32,439
Doctor Kim, you are…

973
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:35,817
completely insane.

974
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:07,307
Hey. I need to talk to Vice Minister Lee
of the Ministry of Health and Welfare.

975
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:12,145
That's how Doctor Kim began
to put the pieces of dreams together

976
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:15,524
that would make up Doldam Hospital.

977
01:18:16,733 --> 01:18:19,778
BOARD EXAM RESULTS
EXAM NUMBER: 204631, NAME: YOON A-REUM

978
01:18:20,904 --> 01:18:22,114
Today's finally the day.

979
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:24,783
Drumroll…

980
01:18:24,908 --> 01:18:27,119
Drumroll…

981
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:30,205
What?

982
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:33,458
-Gosh.
-Why?

983
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:35,502
What's wrong?

984
01:18:35,585 --> 01:18:37,129
Did I fail?

985
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:44,302
It's all right, though.

986
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:48,473
I'll study harder
and take the exam again next year.

987
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:51,977
I can spare a year to achieve my dream

988
01:18:52,102 --> 01:18:53,103
in 20 years.

989
01:18:56,982 --> 01:18:57,816
You passed.

990
01:18:59,484 --> 01:19:00,527
What?

991
01:19:04,364 --> 01:19:06,658
Really? Did I really pass?

992
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:07,909
Of course, you passed.

993
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:09,870
Ninety-six percent of the people passed.

994
01:19:09,953 --> 01:19:10,912
Let me see.

995
01:19:12,372 --> 01:19:13,874
Hey, that's my name.

996
01:19:13,957 --> 01:19:17,878
There's my name. My gosh! I passed!

997
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:20,088
Congratulations.

998
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:21,047
-Congrats.
-Congrats.

999
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:22,924
-Congratulations!
-You should treat us.

1000
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:25,302
Anyway, what is your dream in 20 years?

1001
01:19:25,385 --> 01:19:27,262
Oh, my dream?

1002
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:30,432
In 20 years,

1003
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:33,310
I want to be the new Doctor Kim of Doldam.

1004
01:19:33,393 --> 01:19:35,645
-Wow.
-Hey.

1005
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:37,355
That's pretty cool.

1006
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:40,317
Wait, in 20 years, I'll be…

1007
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:41,568
-Sixty-eight.
-Hey.

1008
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:44,738
Then I'll be the new Ms. Oh of Doldam.

1009
01:19:44,821 --> 01:19:45,822
-Hey.
-Hey.

1010
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:47,491
My gosh, that'll be so awesome!

1011
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:51,703
You'll be like Doctor Kim in 20 years,
you'll be like Ms. Oh in 20 years.

1012
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:54,122
-That sounds great.
-Both Doctor Kim and Ms. Oh

1013
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:56,625
should keep working harder
if you don't want them to catch up.

1014
01:19:56,708 --> 01:20:00,921
Goodness, I will gladly step down
and let them take my position.

1015
01:20:01,004 --> 01:20:03,423
-Don't you think so?
-I completely agree, Ms. Oh.

1016
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:08,762
Recently, you two have been agreeing
upon many things very smoothly.

1017
01:20:09,888 --> 01:20:11,723
-Let's get back to work.
-Let's get to work.

1018
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,225
Hey, wait. Hey!

1019
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:14,309
Hey, new specialist.

1020
01:20:14,392 --> 01:20:15,560
What should we do first?

1021
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:16,728
-Let's do this!
-I'm serious.

1022
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,522
I'll make sure I'll expose this romance.

1023
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:39,251
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

1024
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:47,384
What brings you here this time?

1025
01:20:47,467 --> 01:20:49,803
There are only two reasons
for me to visit you.

1026
01:20:50,303 --> 01:20:53,181
One, to get rid of you.

1027
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:56,142
And what's the other one?

1028
01:20:57,310 --> 01:20:59,521
To get rid of Doldam Hospital
along with you.

1029
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:06,152
Chairman Do,
you're an awfully consistent man.

1030
01:21:06,987 --> 01:21:09,447
I definitely commend you for that.
I'll give you that.

1031
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:17,372
You have MS.

1032
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:26,298
So what?

1033
01:21:28,508 --> 01:21:30,927
You dropped a sponge stick in the OR,

1034
01:21:31,011 --> 01:21:33,138
and you had a CTS operation.

1035
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:37,183
Your hands are wrecked,
and now, your nerves are dying.

1036
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:40,520
Do you still think you can go into the OR?

1037
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:43,523
Why can't I?

1038
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:47,360
I've been recovering fine
after a successful CTS operation.

1039
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:51,615
And the MS isn't serious,
so I've been controlling it with medicine.

1040
01:21:51,698 --> 01:21:52,574
But…

1041
01:21:53,533 --> 01:21:55,118
if we turn the MS…

1042
01:21:56,202 --> 01:21:59,456
into a problem,
we can make it into a problem.

1043
01:21:59,539 --> 01:22:00,415
You're right.

1044
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:03,668
If you want to create a problem,

1045
01:22:03,835 --> 01:22:06,379
you can turn just about anything
into a problem.

1046
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:07,589
That's why…

1047
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:10,592
the board members of the Geosan Foundation

1048
01:22:10,675 --> 01:22:12,928
are seriously considering your dismissal.

1049
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:16,473
And why are you making
that consideration here?

1050
01:22:16,556 --> 01:22:17,724
Didn't you know?

1051
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:20,060
The foundation has the final say

1052
01:22:20,143 --> 01:22:23,104
when it comes to personnel appointments
for Geosan Hospital…

1053
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:25,732
and its branch, Doldam Hospital.

1054
01:22:31,571 --> 01:22:32,948
Mr. Jang.

1055
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:35,200
ADMIN OFFICE

1056
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:36,326
Yes?

1057
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:38,995
Can you give me that envelope?

1058
01:22:52,759 --> 01:22:53,760
Looks great.

1059
01:22:56,763 --> 01:22:57,681
Here.

1060
01:22:57,764 --> 01:22:59,849
MEDICAL CORPORATION LICENSE

1061
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:03,728
Gosh, this came in the mail today.

1062
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:08,608
NAME: DOLDAM MEDICAL FOUNDATION
CEO BU YONG-JU

1063
01:23:09,734 --> 01:23:11,611
-What is this?
-You didn't know?

1064
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:14,114
Doldam Hospital

1065
01:23:14,197 --> 01:23:17,367
just became a separate corporate entity

1066
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:19,202
that has nothing to do with Geosan.

1067
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:22,580
-What?
-We've been promised

1068
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:25,333
four billion won
from the Geosan Foundation every year,

1069
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:28,628
but our operations and system
will be completely separate

1070
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:30,755
from the foundation.

1071
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:36,720
That was in the late
Chairman Shin Myeong-ho's will.

1072
01:23:39,889 --> 01:23:42,183
She has been busy
over the inheritance issue.

1073
01:23:42,726 --> 01:23:43,685
You should probably

1074
01:23:44,602 --> 01:23:45,854
keep him in check.

1075
01:23:48,773 --> 01:23:50,025
He can still pull…

1076
01:23:51,609 --> 01:23:53,069
a few more strings.

1077
01:24:04,247 --> 01:24:07,042
CHAIRMAN DO YUN-WAN

1078
01:24:08,084 --> 01:24:10,545
Yes, Chairman Do? It's been a while.

1079
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:13,590
Oh, that? That's right.

1080
01:24:13,673 --> 01:24:15,967
That was in his will.

1081
01:24:17,093 --> 01:24:20,764
Things got a little delayed with
the inheritance issue because of that.

1082
01:24:23,641 --> 01:24:24,726
What can I do?

1083
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:30,106
If I didn't protect Doldam Hospital,
he said he wouldn't give me a penny.

1084
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:33,860
That's why I did that,
so don't be so heartbroken.

1085
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:36,279
Anyway,

1086
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:39,824
is Doctor Kim doing all right?

1087
01:24:53,213 --> 01:24:54,881
There's no one on my side!

1088
01:24:54,964 --> 01:24:56,341
No one!

1089
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:07,310
Hey, Chairman Do.

1090
01:25:10,396 --> 01:25:12,273
No one! There's no one for me!

1091
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:13,733
Chairman Do.

1092
01:25:13,817 --> 01:25:17,153
Don't ever come to Doldam Hospital again.

1093
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:18,488
Shut up!

1094
01:25:19,572 --> 01:25:21,407
Stop eyeing Doldam's site.

1095
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:24,202
And stop meddling in our business.

1096
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,414
I'm saying you should stop misleading
and distorting the truth

1097
01:25:28,498 --> 01:25:31,626
to make it fit your absurd argument.

1098
01:25:31,709 --> 01:25:35,630
If people don't know any better,
they might think it's true, okay?

1099
01:25:35,713 --> 01:25:38,591
You jerk. Bu Yong-ju!

1100
01:25:39,884 --> 01:25:41,719
-What is he doing?
-Stay out of it.

1101
01:25:42,637 --> 01:25:43,763
Let him go!

1102
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:45,306
-How could you…
-Let go.

1103
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:49,185
My gosh, it's all wrinkled.

1104
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:53,439
Will you stop making a scene and leave?

1105
01:25:56,359 --> 01:25:57,193
Move.

1106
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:01,072
Move aside.

1107
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:04,993
Don't you know who I am, you jerk?

1108
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:08,830
The chairman.

1109
01:26:08,913 --> 01:26:10,456
I'm the chairman, you jerk.

1110
01:26:18,339 --> 01:26:19,299
Please leave.

1111
01:26:23,428 --> 01:26:24,721
Chairman Do.

1112
01:26:38,651 --> 01:26:40,528
Doctor Kim! This is bad!

1113
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:42,739
What's wrong?

1114
01:26:42,822 --> 01:26:44,741
There was a huge fire at a sauna.

1115
01:26:44,824 --> 01:26:46,201
How many are injured?

1116
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:48,036
-There are 24 casualties,
-Okay.

1117
01:26:48,119 --> 01:26:49,871
and seven of them look serious.

1118
01:26:49,954 --> 01:26:51,748
-You all heard her.
-Yes, sir.

1119
01:26:51,831 --> 01:26:54,834
There are 24 at the moment,
but that number can easily increase.

1120
01:26:54,918 --> 01:26:56,377
-Ms. Oh.
-Yes?

1121
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:58,880
Tell them divide up the patients
to serious and minor injuries,

1122
01:26:58,963 --> 01:27:01,716
send minor patients to a nearby hospital,
and send the critical patients

1123
01:27:01,799 --> 01:27:03,927
-to Doldam Hospital right away.
-Yes, sir.

1124
01:27:04,677 --> 01:27:06,846
Woo-jin, Bone Doctor, and, Nurse Park,

1125
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:09,682
work with Dr. Jeong
and keep checking the patients' condition

1126
01:27:09,766 --> 01:27:11,142
-as they come in.
-Yes, sir.

1127
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:12,644
-Hurry up and go.
-Dr. Yoon!

1128
01:27:14,395 --> 01:27:16,397
-And, Mr. Jang…
-Yes, Doctor Kim?

1129
01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:18,358
Call Professor Park and…

1130
01:27:18,441 --> 01:27:19,442
I'm here.

1131
01:27:31,537 --> 01:27:33,790
What are you doing?
Aren't you going to work?

1132
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:36,417
Yes, I will.

1133
01:27:37,627 --> 01:27:39,587
I'll go get changed quickly.

1134
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:52,642
All right, then. Let's get the OR ready.

1135
01:27:52,725 --> 01:27:55,603
I was going to play
Battlegrounds with my son today.

1136
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:09,951
See that?

1137
01:28:12,745 --> 01:28:16,124
These are people whom we call doctors.

1138
01:28:22,505 --> 01:28:24,465
The law of the conservation of romance.

1139
01:28:26,175 --> 01:28:28,803
Most people know these values exist,

1140
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:31,014
but they also don't believe they're real.

1141
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:34,517
But they also hope someone is out there

1142
01:28:35,226 --> 01:28:37,061
preserving such beautiful values.

1143
01:28:39,272 --> 01:28:42,984
Life is about taking
a new journey every single day.

1144
01:28:44,777 --> 01:28:46,779
It doesn't matter if you want it or not.

1145
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:50,783
It's about facing the reality
that gushes in every single day.

1146
01:28:54,704 --> 01:28:55,747
Patient incoming!

1147
01:28:58,499 --> 01:29:00,001
Dr. Jeong, bed number one.

1148
01:29:00,084 --> 01:29:01,127
Yes, bed number one!

1149
01:29:02,128 --> 01:29:03,087
Into the hybrid room.

1150
01:29:07,633 --> 01:29:08,926
Bed number two.

1151
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:09,927
This way, please.

1152
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:10,887
Two, three.

1153
01:29:10,970 --> 01:29:12,472
Sir, wake up.

1154
01:29:12,555 --> 01:29:13,848
Let's move him.

1155
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:17,143
We can't find the right answer
in every single moment of our lives.

1156
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:20,271
But Doctor Kim still said this.

1157
01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:22,607
Don't ever stop asking

1158
01:29:23,441 --> 01:29:26,652
why we should live
and what we should live for.

1159
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:30,365
The moment you stop asking that question,

1160
01:29:31,532 --> 01:29:33,159
our romance…

1161
01:29:33,868 --> 01:29:34,994
will end too.

1162
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:36,579
Got it?

1163
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:38,790
That's what he said.

1164
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:45,380
Is Kim Da-eul's guardian here?

1165
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:50,009
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

1166
01:29:54,138 --> 01:29:57,225
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

1167
01:30:03,523 --> 01:30:06,901
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

1168
01:30:15,993 --> 01:30:19,038
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

1169
01:30:53,364 --> 01:30:56,409
WE THANK OUR ENTIRE CAST, STAFF,
AND THOSE WHO GAVE US ASSISTANCE

1170
01:30:56,492 --> 01:30:59,328
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING DR. ROMANTIC 2
