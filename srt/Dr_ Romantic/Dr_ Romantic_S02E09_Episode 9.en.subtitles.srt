1
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:57,682
What's wrong?

2
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,350
This is killing me.

3
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,186
Do you still feel dizzy?

4
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,229
I feel humiliated.

5
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,149
What am I going to do?

6
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,361
It keeps getting replayed in my head
like a broken record.

7
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,782
I throw up, faint, and get carried out.
I throw up, faint, and get carried out.

8
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,868
-Stop sitting on that and forget it.
-How can I forget that?

9
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:19,079
I did the top three worst things
you can do

10
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,997
in an anatomy dissection lab all at once.

11
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,126
I also completely lost my chic image
with that one mistake.

12
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,213
Gosh, this is so annoying.

13
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,383
Do you want me to show you a way?

14
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:36,179
-To do what?
-To reset your head at once.

15
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:38,723
How?

16
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,101
Like this.

17
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,235
What are you doing?

18
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:54,572
That didn't work?

19
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,158
It didn't work.

20
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,869
-Really?
-Yes.

21
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:30,817
How's that?

22
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,444
That helped you reset, didn't it?

23
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:35,363
You…

24
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,574
crazy jerk.

25
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,251
What are you doing?

26
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,296
I said, what are you doing?

27
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,047
Do you not know, or are you making sure?

28
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,425
Are you kidding me? This isn't funny.

29
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,844
That's why I said we shouldn't be serious.

30
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:01,639
The moment we become serious,
things will become boring and pointless.

31
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,808
-Hey, Woo-jin.
-So, please,

32
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,690
don't get broken-hearted
over someone else's business.

33
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:12,817
It's confusing.

You were still here?

37
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,465
I should go. I'll leave soon.

38
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:24,222
-Were you in my office by any chance?
-Oh, yes.

39
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:28,726
I left the explanation for budget cuts
for the Evaluation Committee on your desk.

40
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,396
Anything else?

41
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,774
No, not really. Nothing.

42
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,567
Okay.

43
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,989
Keep up the good work then.

44
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,621
You can pick it up.

45
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,872
Right, yes.

46
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,465
Hello?

47
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,801
Yes, sir. Did you find anything?

00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,732
A round of applause.

68
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,028
Nice to meet you.
I'm Oh Myeong-sim, the head nurse.

69
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,448
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

70
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:33,077
Goodness, did you practice your greeting?
You're in perfect harmony.

71
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,872
We're a hospital
with many trauma patients.

72
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,874
You should watch and experience a lot.

73
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,251
It'll help you greatly
when you do your job.

74
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:44,505
Ms. Um Hyun-jung and Ms. Joo Young-mi
will guide you throughout the month.

75
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,340
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

76
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,093
-Keep up the good work.
-Yes.

77
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,137
Let me split you up into teams of two.

78
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,473
You'll be going to the ER, the ICU,
the regular ward,

79
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,057
and the outpatient clinic.

80
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,851
You two at the ER can stay here,

81
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,061
and the rest of you can follow me.
Come on.

82
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,650
They must be student nurses.

83
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:08,613
Yes. Student nurses come for training
at this time of the year.

84
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,157
I see.

85
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,035
We don't have any patients now,
so stand aside and try to get a grasp

86
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,786
of everything that's going on in the ER.

87
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,456
The bed numbers and all.

88
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,084
Don't get in the way of the doctors. Okay?

89
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,503
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

90
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,837
Excuse me.

YANG HO-JUN, SEO WOO-JIN, CHA EUN-JAE

92
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,390
What's going on?

93
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,644
We had two empty treatment rooms.

94
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,229
Professor Sim is using one of them,

95
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,688
and the three of us

96
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,524
are sharing the remaining room.

97
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,525
Why?

98
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,110
-Is there a problem?
-No.

99
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,033
I get why Doctor Seo is here
because he's also a GS.

100
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,201
But why am I here?

101
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,745
I'm a cardiac surgeon. Why am I here?

102
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,747
You said you'll hold out
as long as you can.

103
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:04,460
That's why I'm giving you a chance
to stand up against me

104
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:05,878
as much as you want.

105
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:07,838
Don't like it, get lost.

106
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,676
No.

107
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,302
I'll stay.

108
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,061
Can someone get me coffee?

109
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,482
I'll take an Americano
with no more or less than

110
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,568
two teaspoons of sugar.

111
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,446
I'll go.

112
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,290
Do you know what
Professor Park hates the most?

113
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,502
-What?
-When two people hit it off at work

114
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,461
and start dating.

115
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,798
What do you mean?

116
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,593
I didn't mean anything.

117
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,595
I'm just telling you to be careful.

118
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,533
HYBRID ROOM

119
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,037
-Doctor Yoon.
-Yes, Nurse Park?

120
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,954
What?

121
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,123
I mean, Nurse Um.

122
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,084
What is it, Nurse Um?

123
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,128
We just got a patient

124
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,504
with asthma symptoms.

125
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,423
-He's on bed three.
-Really?

126
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,467
Okay.

127
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,260
I'll go take a look.

128
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,723
Do you want this?

129
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,224
Really?

130
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,476
Is this for me?

131
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,144
Gosh, thank you.

132
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,646
Thanks!

133
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:47,563
Sure.

134
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,524
Goodness, Ms. Um.

135
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,277
You're completely clueless.

136
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,618
What are you doing, Doctor Yoon?
Bed number three.

137
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,370
Yes, coming!

138
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,085
My goodness!

139
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,344
You almost shocked me to death, Ms. Oh.

140
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,555
Did something good happen?

141
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,599
You know, it's a great morning.

142
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,352
Good morning. Feeling new every morning.

143
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,897
-Have you been studying English lately?
-The sun sets early,

144
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,274
and the nights are long.

145
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,234
I have no one at home to scratch my back.

146
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,737
What am I going to do all alone
through such long nights?

147
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,448
So I went downtown and signed up to take

148
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,158
short-term English classes.

149
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,453
Anyway,

150
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,248
what's all that about?

151
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,458
What?

152
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,334
What do you mean this time?

153
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,336
The president's office.

154
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,715
I prepared this for you, Mr. Park.

155
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,551
The coffee machine you wanted,
a desk and furniture

156
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,011
from the brand you specified.

157
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,388
-On top of that…
-What's that?

158
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,063
That's a token of my appreciation for you.

159
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,274
The nature of Doldam Hospital will

160
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,818
often make you feel dizzy from now on.

161
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,737
You can rest here when that happens.

162
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,363
Okay. You may go.

163
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,490
Pardon?

164
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,534
Yes, okay. Goodbye.

165
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:11,081
Do you just have no pride,
or do you just never learn?

166
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,375
Three years ago, you were used
then abandoned by Mr. Song.

167
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,629
-Why are you doing this again?
-He's a man on a different level.

168
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,924
Mr. Song was just a chief surgeon,
but he's the hospital's president.

169
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:20,925
So what?

170
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,346
You're going to humor the president
to get your big break this time?

171
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,307
I'm not doing this just for my sake.

172
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,477
I'm laying the groundwork
for the entire hospital's sake.

173
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,729
Groundwork, groundhog, I don't care.

174
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,731
Boycotting won't resolve all problems.

175
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,192
You might end up getting left back alone.

176
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:41,529
I'd rather journey slowly than live
as a sly opportunist.

177
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,156
I'll walk in my stride, my speed,

178
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,242
without stress, and at ease!

179
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,413
The five percent raise

180
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,707
for our salary and overtime.

181
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,293
Do you know who made that happen?

182
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,463
Yes, it was me!

183
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,425
It was Jang Gi-tae's work.

184
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,386
President Park is

185
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,555
now in my hands.

186
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,098
You have to trust me, Ms. Oh.

187
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,185
Yes, Mr. Park. It's me.

188
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,355
People never change.

189
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,734
Yes, right now?

190
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,986
My phone died.

191
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,958
This time, it wasn't mine…

192
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,927
Gosh, that's suffocating.

193
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,639
-After you wrap that up,
-Yes.

194
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,641
-please go see bed two.
-Yes, ma'am.

195
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,518
SURGERY, FAMILY MEDICINE

196
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,197
Ms. Oh. What are you doing?
Aren't you coming up?

197
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:49,990
To where?

198
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,117
I got a call for the weekly meeting.

199
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,331
You didn't?

200
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,293
I'll check with Mr. Jang.
You should go first.

201
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,336
Okay.

202
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,219
Admin office.

203
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,137
Yes, Ms. Oh.

204
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,306
Mr. Jang?

205
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,809
He went up for the weekly meeting.

206
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:17,977
What is it?

207
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,936
Oh, really?

208
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,980
No, nothing.

209
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,690
I'll call him on his cell phone.

210
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,245
OH MYEONG-SIM

211
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:46,088
-Goodness, I'm sorry. I'm a little late.
-It's all right. Take a seat.

212
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,631
Doctor Seo, sit on this side.

213
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,717
Here's the coffee you asked for.

214
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:52,594
PRESIDENT
PARK MIN-GOOK

215
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,305
Okay, thanks.

216
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,559
You can give me 500 won later.

217
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,857
Doctor Yang, did you make him
get your coffee without giving him money?

218
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,151
It's not like that.

219
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,113
I'm guessing GS still bullies its juniors.

220
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:15,617
It has been a while since ER doctors
stopped making our juniors get coffee.

221
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,204
Shouldn't we stop bullying our juniors

222
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,330
in this day and age?

223
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,583
Gosh, it's not like that.

224
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:24,960
All right.

225
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,087
It looks like you're all here.

226
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,506
Let's begin our meeting.

227
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,179
Where's the chief surgeon?

228
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,599
Well, I actually stopped by his office.

229
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:41,769
Doctor Kim?

230
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,396
Doctor Kim?

231
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,649
He hasn't even come to work yet?

232
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:48,734
No.

233
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,736
He has never been like this before.

234
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,780
I don't know why he hasn't even called.

235
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,578
Let's start the meeting.

236
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,289
Excuse me, Ms. Oh isn't here yet.

237
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,540
Oh, that's because--

238
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,335
Our weekly meetings will just be
the people in this room from now on.

239
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,171
-What?
-We're doing our weekly meetings

240
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,215
without our head nurse?

241
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,674
The head administrator will

242
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,427
pass on whatever she needs to know.

243
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,684
OH MYEONG-SIM

244
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,194
What about Doctor Cha? Why isn't she here?

245
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,071
She'll be going to
a different hospital soon.

246
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,531
Eun-jae?

247
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,324
Where is she going?

248
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,992
Why? What's the reason?

249
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,787
Things happened.

250
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,872
That's all you need to know.

251
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:45,707
All of a sudden?

252
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,086
OPERATING PLANS

253
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,131
Those are our future operating plans.

254
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,592
Doldam Hospital will undergo
a radical reform from now on.

255
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,266
We'll reduce the number of trauma
and emergency patients drastically.

256
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,183
What?

257
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,146
Trauma and emergency patients make up
most of our patients.

258
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,607
-How can you reduce that?
-We'll change the system to revolve around

259
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,484
the outpatient clinic
and regular surgeries.

260
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,738
-But we have no patients.
-My patients who were scheduled

261
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,491
to be operated on at the main hospital
will come in starting tomorrow.

262
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,452
Doctor Yang, please come up
with a treatment schedule

263
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,164
-that's comfortable for our patients.
-Yes, sir.

264
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,125
We cannot continue to manage

265
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,960
this hospital without any plans.

266
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,212
Once we get the system going,

267
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:35,507
we'll consider introducing
performance-based benefits

268
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,925
for each department.

269
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,304
Please remember that and do your best.

270
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,028
It seems he has acute gastroenteritis.

271
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,530
Establish an IV line
and put him on fluids.

272
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:02,117
We'll confirm the lab results as soon as
Doctor Jung is done with the meeting.

273
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,285
Okay, got it.

274
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,246
Will you take a step back?

275
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,331
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

276
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,460
Have either of you put anyone
on an IV before?

277
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,921
I know how it's done in theory,
but I've never done it.

278
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,173
In theory? Forget it.
Do you know how to do this?

279
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:19,509
This is my first hands-on training too.
But I'll give it a try!

280
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,012
Forget it. I can't let you kill him.

281
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,277
The student nurses look very nervous.

282
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,530
It's their first day. They should be.

283
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,118
I was awfully clumsy

284
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,037
back during my first internship too.

285
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:48,997
I had no idea what was going on,

286
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,000
I couldn't do anything,
and no one told me what to do.

287
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,421
It would've been great
if one of my seniors helped me out.

288
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,050
Doctor Yoon.

289
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,970
I've been working
two night shifts in a row.

290
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,722
We're short on people,
and we have patients swarming in.

291
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,058
I have no energy
to look after student nurses.

292
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,559
I should look after one more patient

293
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,521
-if I had enough energy to do that.
-Gosh, I know that too.

294
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,855
I know, but still…

295
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,023
Well,

296
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,858
I get what you're saying.

297
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,360
But mind your own business.

298
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,404
We'll manage our own department.

299
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,378
Ms. Oh. May I have a moment?

300
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,512
What? I'm going to a different hospital?

301
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,723
Who said that?

302
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:48,765
Was it Doctor Yang?

303
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,642
Yes, he made an official statement

304
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,519
in the meeting with the president.

305
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:56,023
Wow, I can't believe
how he stabbed me in the back.

306
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,359
He told me to try to defy him,
but he changed his mind already?

307
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,778
What's going on?
Why does he hate you so much?

308
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,282
That's a long, long story.

309
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:09,119
It'll probably take
a bottle of soju with five dried pollacks.

310
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,830
You're in deep trouble.

311
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,915
What did Doctor Kim say?

312
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,627
He doesn't believe
what Doctor Yang said, does he?

313
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:21,089
I'm not sure if you were lucky or not,
but he wasn't at the meeting.

314
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,258
He wasn't there?

315
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,634
He's not at work?

316
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:25,552
No.

317
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,721
Mr. Jang said he hasn't come to work yet.

318
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:32,392
-I called him twice. He won't pick up.
-What's going on?

319
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,854
-He's never been like this.
-Your call cannot be connected. Please--

320
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:36,772
Anyway…

321
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,651
Since when was his arm like that?
It looked like he was in a lot of pain.

322
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,694
Oh, his wrist?

323
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,863
He injured it three years ago,

324
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,282
and the pain gets worse
when he has many operations

325
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,283
or overworks himself.

326
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,452
Wrist?

327
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,454
But what I saw yesterday wasn't…

328
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,763
DOCTOR KIM

Excuse me.

00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,864
Was this why

359
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,700
you left me out of the weekly meeting?

360
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,501
A reduction of trauma and emergency
patients, and a temporary shutdown?

361
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,295
Then where will all of those

362
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,130
trauma patients go?

363
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,674
That's not for you to worry about.

364
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:10,675
On average,

365
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:15,514
we have about 30 to 40 trauma patients
visiting Doldam Hospital in a week.

366
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,267
And half of them are
on the brink of death!

367
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,312
Does this mean
they should die on the road?

368
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,731
Why would they die?

369
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:28,610
The government has made regional trauma
centers all around the country already.

370
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,738
The nearest trauma center is
an hour and 50 minutes away.

371
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:34,407
Do you know that
it could take up to two, three hours

372
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,492
when there's traffic?

373
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,412
Then do you have any idea

374
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:43,291
how much of a deficit Doldam Hospital
has created over the last three years?

375
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,254
At this rate, we might shut down

376
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,838
in just a few months.

377
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:50,757
Are you aware of that?

378
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:58,223
If I stepped in to save the hospital,
you should be thanking me.

379
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,643
How dare you try to patronize me
with such sentimentalism?

380
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:02,644
Mr. Park!

381
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,104
Doctor Nam, please.

382
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,022
Then you should just shut it down.

383
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,651
Ms. Oh. How can you say that?

384
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,278
Doldam Hospital is a place

385
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,823
where patients rush in
with their last bit of hope

386
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,200
before their golden hour is up.

387
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,119
And you're telling us to look away

388
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:22,038
because we don't make any money
and operate on a deficit?

389
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,626
You shouldn't even work so hard
to improve the system or whatever.

390
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,836
Just shut it down.

391
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,379
-Ms. Oh!
-If a doctor

392
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,089
and a hospital

393
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:34,175
place profit before patients,

394
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,095
that means the hospital is finished.

395
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,599
We should just shut down.

396
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,230
WE PROVIDE HEART-TO-HEART TREATMENTS

397
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,488
-Mr. Park.
-Goodness.

398
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,285
Mr. Park!

399
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,166
Ms. Oh must be very powerful.

400
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:09,961
There's no order,
and the hierarchy is a mess.

401
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,256
I can't believe
she told the president off to his face.

402
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,550
That's our hospital.

403
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,720
We have no order or hierarchy.

404
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:20,555
Instead,

405
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,891
we respect one another.

406
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:26,144
On top of that, you have
hopeless romanticism too.

407
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,730
What are you all going to do?

408
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,441
The entire world has gone crazy
with materialism.

409
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,985
People will sell anything and everything

410
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,655
if it's worth some money,
including their dignity and character.

411
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,156
But still, there should be…

412
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,159
one place where that isn't the case.

413
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,911
Are you saying this is that place?

414
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:43,995
If it isn't,

415
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,914
there's no reason for us

416
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,207
to stay at Doldam.

417
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,461
Ms. Oh?

418
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,762
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

419
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,186
I'm sorry.

420
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,729
Ms. Oh has always

421
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,315
cared deeply for the patients.

422
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,985
Are you saying only she cares about them,
and not us?

423
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,363
No, that's not what I meant.

424
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,490
Pick your side wisely, Mr. Jang.

425
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,868
If you keep playing for both sides,

426
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,245
you'll never make it big.

427
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,081
I can't believe you tried to feel us out.

428
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,715
TREATMENT ROOM 3, TREATMENT ROOM 2

429
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,309
You won't even say hi to me now?

430
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,730
-What?
-I'm sure you heard that I'll be going

431
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,565
to a different hospital at the meeting.

432
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,275
And?

433
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:56,735
Are you?

434
00:28:56,818 --> 00:29:00,155
No, why should I?
Holding out is the trend now.

435
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,908
I'll hold out and stand up against him
until I return to the main hospital.

436
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,952
I'm going to hold out the best I can.

437
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:07,537
That's good then.

438
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,377
OPERATIVE ORTHOPEDICS

439
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,013
What are you looking for? What is it?

440
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:29,309
CARPAL TUNNEL, ULNAR TUNNEL,
AND STENOSING TENOSYNOVITIS

441
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,478
Hey, man. Doctor Seo.

442
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,271
Can you hear what I'm saying?

443
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,818
Will you keep ignoring me like this?

444
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:42,030
What if I don't ignore you?
Should I continue from where we left off?

445
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,491
Come on. What?

446
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,369
Your only colleague from the same class

447
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,330
is being framed by an evil senior,

448
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,165
and, you know, got backstabbed,

449
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:54,918
and, you know, is about to get kicked out!

450
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,671
-Why are you stuttering?
-I didn't.

451
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,298
"Oh, you know, and you know…"

452
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,258
You're buffering.

453
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,593
It's because I'm angry.

454
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,471
I can't believe what Doctor Yang is doing.

455
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,057
And you.

456
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:12,310
You should be worried about me
as my colleague

457
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:14,604
instead of just leaving after saying,
"Good then."

458
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:16,397
"Good then." Is that all?

459
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,566
I get what you're saying.

460
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,568
What do you get? I didn't say anything.

461
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,530
I'm no more than a colleague to you,

462
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,782
so you don't want me to cross the line.

463
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:27,408
I got it.

464
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,413
Why are you like this?

465
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,375
You know, I'm trying to overcome,

466
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,836
you know, the mistake you made yesterday

467
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,671
by talking to you like this--

468
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:40,922
It wasn't a mistake.

469
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:43,383
I'm trying to

470
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,511
save our relationship
from potential awkwardness--

471
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:48,513
I don't feel that awkward.

472
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:51,975
Whatever.

473
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,143
Can't you see how much I'm trying?

474
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,397
I'm telling you to stop trying.

475
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,400
I already got what you're saying.

476
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:01,860
Okay?

477
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,997
So why are you looking up CTS?

478
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,082
Do your wrists hurt?

479
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,333
It's not for me.

480
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:21,045
-Is it for a patient?
-Then I would've handed it over to the OS.

481
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:22,755
Then who is it

482
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,382
if it's not you or a patient?

483
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:29,929
Who is it?

484
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,057
Doctor Kim.

485
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:35,810
Doctor Kim?

486
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:49,866
What?

487
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,202
Doctor Kim has CTS?

488
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,289
Yes. That's what I heard.

489
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,041
Doctor Bae, how long have you known?

490
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,667
Not that long.

491
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:03,254
Was it right before Doctor Seo
and Doctor Cha joined us?

492
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,674
He came to me with a stiff wrist,
so I checked it for him.

493
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,509
What's the cause?

494
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,930
He injured his wrist three years ago,
and he's been overworking himself.

495
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,265
He should've gotten surgery long ago,

496
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,684
but he's been putting it off
to care for our patients.

497
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,770
Ms. Oh. and Doctor Nam
don't know about it?

498
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:19,896
No.

499
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,774
He said he'd tell them
when his surgery is booked,

500
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:24,859
so I've been keeping it to myself.

501
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:26,903
I have a question.

502
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:31,074
Can CTS patients experience pain
or numbness in their elbows?

503
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:33,117
No, CTS patients wouldn't get that.

504
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:37,330
Last week, he said that his wrist
wouldn't bend backwards.

505
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,124
We did an MRI scan to see
if he had a herniated cervical disc,

506
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,084
but nothing showed up.

507
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,670
I see.

508
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,923
By the way,
you asked me the same question earlier.

509
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,466
Why do you keep asking about it?

510
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,302
Is there something that you're suspecting?

511
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,388
Is there?

512
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,223
What is it?

513
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,018
No, I don't know anything for certain yet.

514
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,570
Here.

515
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,784
It's the list
of President Park's VIP patients

516
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,035
and their diagnoses.

517
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,412
Come up with a schedule

518
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,539
based on the numbers beside their names.

519
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,875
And we're expecting four residents
from the main hospital.

520
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,378
You should take care of them.

521
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:28,506
Make sure they eat dinner,
and take them to their dorms.

522
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:33,302
President Park handpicked them himself
based on how well they did in the OR.

523
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:36,222
He's in charge of all these patients?

524
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,766
Well, I can take care of the simple ones.

525
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:42,687
Oh, right. One more thing.

526
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,691
About the loan shark causing a scene here.

527
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,154
Make sure that never happens again.

528
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:55,324
If something like that happens again
when President Park's patients are here,

529
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,535
you'll get fired.

530
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,257
Do you think he heard us?

531
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:14,469
If he heard us,
he would've asked about it right away.

532
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:19,307
Let's make sure they don't find out
about Doctor Kim's wrist pain.

533
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,143
Come on. CTS isn't a big deal.

534
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,437
He'll recover three weeks
after the surgery.

535
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,396
Still.

536
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,523
Let's keep our lips sealed, okay?

537
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,524
Okay, got it.

538
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,777
We'll keep it a secret for the time being.

539
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,446
-Okay?
-Okay.

540
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:34,906
Okay.

541
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,378
CHUNGHYODANG

542
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:50,588
Let's drink.

543
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:52,882
Cheers, everyone.

544
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,383
Cheers!

545
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,426
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

546
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:03,059
Chairman Do, we sincerely congratulate you

547
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,644
on your return.

548
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,271
Cut it out.

549
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:10,441
I'm sure you were all
very comfortable while I was gone.

550
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,653
No. You're hurting my feelings, sir.

551
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:17,198
You have no idea how much I waited

552
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,533
for your return, sir.

553
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:22,036
If that is the case,
why didn't you visit me sooner?

554
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,121
Pardon?

555
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,248
Well…

556
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,459
My gosh. Please forgive me, sir.

557
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,339
I wanted to come see you
the day you were inaugurated,

558
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:36,467
but I was appointed the head of the center

559
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,427
even though I was underqualified,
so I couldn't.

560
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:41,973
Anyway, please forgive me
and allow me to pour you another one.

561
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:47,478
I will stay loyal to you
and will always be at your service, sir.

562
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,981
Cheers to Chairman Do!

563
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,357
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

564
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,238
By the way…

565
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,409
is Professor Park doing a good job?

566
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,036
Actually,

567
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,038
he's giving me a headache.

568
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:06,998
Gosh.

569
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,291
I knew it.

570
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:12,670
Why did he volunteer to run Doldam?

571
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,964
By the way,

572
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:19,093
when do you plan to announce
the construction of Mirae Hospital?

573
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,888
Because of what you told us,

574
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,682
I already got my wife to buy some land.

575
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:27,185
But you're not giving us any updates.

576
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,979
The word has already spread

577
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,272
among realtors,

578
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,400
so the land in the area
is already worth 30 percent more.

579
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:38,196
You've already earned that much money.

580
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,490
I didn't invest all that money
just to earn 30 percent more.

581
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:43,576
You of all people should know that.

582
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:45,703
Is that so?

583
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,081
Anyway,

584
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,959
let's push ahead and get it done.

585
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:55,087
We are totally counting on you.

586
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,839
Of course.

587
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:00,384
You all did so much
to make sure I could return…

588
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,095
so I should repay you, of course.

589
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,515
Don't worry.
I'll get the project going soon.

590
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,935
If Mr. Song were in charge,

591
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:13,397
Doldam Hospital would be gone by now,
and we'd be commencing construction.

592
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,482
Pardon?

593
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,400
Me?

594
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,196
-What do you say?
-Pardon?

595
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,782
Would you like to be in charge?
Are you interested?

596
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,702
My gosh. Of course, sir.

597
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,538
If you'd like me to be in charge,
I'd gladly take it on.

598
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:32,375
Anyway,

599
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,086
Professor Park can be a bit inflexible.

600
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,713
You know, he's a smart guy,

601
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,174
but he's too unrealistic.

602
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:45,263
I've dealt with him a few times myself,
and it's so frustrating to work with him.

603
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,640
And he's very stubborn on top of that.

604
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,893
You have a guest.

605
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,523
I'm sorry I'm late.

606
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,157
My gosh, President Park!

607
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:06,867
Come on in.

608
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,245
Join us.

609
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,999
Sit here. You're not late at all.

610
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,345
COFFEE SHOP

611
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:29,765
Gosh, it's cold.

612
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,767
Hey, let's just take a taxi.

613
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,603
Hey, it's 40 minutes away by car.

614
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,896
Let's just take the bus.

615
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,357
Hey, Do-il.

616
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:43,487
Where were you all day?
You didn't even answer my calls.

617
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,989
I was busy.

618
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:50,870
Yes. I'm getting on the city bus now,
so I should be there in 30 to 40 minutes.

619
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:52,038
The city bus?

620
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,497
Where are you now?

621
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,291
Let's talk when I get there.

622
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,461
-My gosh.
-Oh.

623
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,212
Gosh.

624
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:01,839
Please go ahead.

625
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,215
-Thank you.
-No problem.

626
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,885
-Be careful.
-Thank you.

627
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,053
-This way.
-Excuse me.

628
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,389
-Yes?
-Does this go to Doldam Hospital?

629
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,309
Yes, this bus will take you there.

630
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:16,312
See? I told you we don't have to transfer.
Thank you.

631
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,688
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

632
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:25,154
-Have you gotten a hold of Doctor Kim?
-He finally answered his phone just now.

633
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,614
Where was he all day?

634
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:27,740
He won't tell me.

635
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,576
He said he'll be here soon, so let's wait.

636
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,345
Traitor.

637
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,060
You're a pushover with no backbone.

638
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,818
What? What's your problem?

639
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,992
You're the traitor, not me.

640
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,747
You're being ridiculously brazen,
Mr. Jang.

641
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,417
How dare you call me a traitor?

642
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,961
Do you only care about the patients?

643
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:23,045
What about us?

644
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,590
Don't your co-workers
matter to you at all?

645
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,676
What are you talking about?

646
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,595
-When did I ever say that?
-How could it be so easy for you

647
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,098
to suggest shutting down the hospital?

648
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:38,018
Those people are trying to change
everything about our hospital.

649
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,563
-Should we just let them go for it?
-Okay, fine.

650
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,898
Let's say this hospital shuts down.

651
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,943
Doctor Kim, Doctor Nam, and you

652
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,237
could always get another job elsewhere.

653
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,031
All hospitals are short on medical staff.

654
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,491
You'll get many job offers.

655
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:55,494
But… what about us?

656
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,749
Everyone in the admin office including me
as well as all the cleaning staff.

657
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:05,004
There are almost 20 employees
who aren't doctors or nurses.

658
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:09,383
And most of them are breadwinners.

659
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,012
If the hospital shuts down,
what's going to happen to them?

660
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,182
Unlike you people,
our positions aren't permanent.

661
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,434
It's very hard for us to get jobs.

662
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,853
Do you want all of us
to end up on the streets?

663
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:25,107
You're overreacting, Mr. Jang.

664
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:28,319
She doesn't want Doldam to shut down.

665
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:29,528
You see,

666
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,031
I'd love to live like the two of you.

667
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,032
Be all graceful

668
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:35,284
and speak out for the greater good

669
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:36,827
and protect my pride and ego.

670
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,455
I'd really love a life like that!

671
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,541
But until the day I die…

672
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,627
I mean, as for the rest of us,

673
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,922
we simply can't live like that. Why not?

674
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,509
Because we're easily replaceable.

675
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,469
It doesn't have to be me.

676
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,888
Anyone can come along, replace me,

677
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:57,598
and do my job!

678
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,977
And that is why all I can do is smile

679
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,480
even when I'm called a pushover
with no backbone.

680
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:08,067
I have no choice but to bow down
even when you call me a traitor!

681
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:14,907
I must survive.

682
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,577
I must put up with all of it to survive.

683
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,915
So, please, Ms. Oh…

684
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,834
don't say…

685
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,295
the hospital should shut down.

686
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,424
Mr. Jang.

687
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,051
Wait, just a second.

688
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,971
He's overly sensitive right now.

689
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:41,141
He knows you didn't mean it.

690
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,606
Mr. Jang.

691
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,233
Water…

692
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,526
-Get me some water.
-Okay.

693
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:56,532
Here you go.

694
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:05,124
-Are you all right, Mr. Jang?
-I'm fine. Give me a moment.

695
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:06,083
Gosh, no!

696
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,751
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

697
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,595
What did I…

698
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:21,056
say to her just now?

699
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,433
Pardon me?

700
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,604
I'm such a fool.

701
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:35,112
My heart is about to explode.

702
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:36,947
I can't believe I yelled at her.

703
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:17,529
So, please, Ms. Oh…

704
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:19,740
don't say…

705
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:22,284
the hospital should shut down.

706
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,706
-Oh, Nurse Um.
-Yes?

707
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,542
-It's snowing outside.
-It's snowing?

708
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,386
It's snowing.

709
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:41,679
Oh, it really is.

710
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:44,932
It's so pretty.

711
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,983
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

712
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,446
It's snowing.

713
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,864
-Wow.
-My gosh.

714
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:06,954
I'd love some hot soup and soju right now.

715
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:11,667
I want to take a hot bath
and just go to bed.

716
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,169
I hope there are no traffic accidents.

717
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:18,424
You guys should get going.
I should sleep here tonight.

718
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:21,385
Oh, no drinking, please.

719
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:24,138
We might have an emergency. Okay?

720
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,932
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

721
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,816
The weather forecast was right for once.

722
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,777
It said it was likely to snow later today,

723
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:41,280
so I brought an umbrella.

724
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,281
Hi, honey.

725
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,741
I'm sorry.

726
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:46,076
Mom kept chatting away, so I got held up.

727
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:46,994
Sorry.

728
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,996
Has Hyung-sik had dinner yet?

729
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,123
Good.

730
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,460
It's snowing now.

731
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,713
Should we just keep him at home tomorrow?

732
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,215
I know.

733
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:02,050
-All right.
-Hey.

734
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,386
-How about a snow fight?
-We could go skiing too.

735
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,597
-We really could, you know. We should go.
-Okay.

736
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:18,734
What's that?

737
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:20,486
Help me.

738
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:18,585
Carpal tunnel syndrome?

739
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:20,337
Yes.

740
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,923
Doctor Kim's wrist must be acting up.

741
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,717
That's why he didn't come in today.

742
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,011
He needs surgery immediately,

743
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,682
and once he gets it,
he can't work for three to four weeks.

744
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:33,934
Yes.

745
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:38,063
Yes.

746
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:40,941
Right.

747
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:43,318
Yes.

748
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,154
Yes, got it.

749
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,157
I'll figure out the surgery schedule
and keep you updated.

750
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:52,035
Bye.

751
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:09,720
My goodness.

752
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:11,972
Why are you out here?

753
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,266
Everyone's having a great time.

754
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:17,269
I have to get back to the hospital.
I need to do some work.

755
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:20,272
Come on. Why work so hard?

756
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:22,774
Just take it easy and slack off a little.

757
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:25,068
Try to delegate as much as you can.

758
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:27,696
If you work too hard,
your staff will be stressed out.

759
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:31,366
If I go back in now to say goodbye,
I'll only ruin the mood,

760
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:35,037
so please put in a good word for me.

761
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,124
In life,

762
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,960
it's important to go with the flow.

763
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:46,506
We can see which way the tide is turning,
so don't waste your energy.

764
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:49,885
Are you eyeing my position?

765
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,097
Look, President Park.

766
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:57,476
I'm not that ambitious.

767
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,562
My life motto is, "Lie low and go far."

768
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,230
I'd rather be safe and last long

769
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:04,650
by joining the mainstream,
not the outsiders.

770
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,026
And…

771
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,487
I don't even want to burp

772
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,238
in Doldam Hospital's direction.

773
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:11,949
So, please.

774
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:15,243
Don't drag me into your plans.

775
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:17,496
Just do as the chairman says, okay?

776
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,039
I'll be off then.

777
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:25,087
Learn to bow down when you need to,

778
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,672
or nothing will go your way.

779
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,011
-That stubborn man.
-Where did he go?

780
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:35,973
Gosh, why did I come here today?

781
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,557
Hey, where are you?

782
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,518
Let's have another drink.

783
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:41,103
-I'm here!
-Good.

784
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:42,187
-Yes.
-Let me pour you one.

785
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,271
-Drink up.
-Yes.

786
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,148
It's been great.

787
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,319
-Try this.
- It's good.

788
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,160
Park Min-gook.

789
00:49:58,286 --> 00:49:59,955
What on earth is he thinking?

790
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:56,720
BUS TERMINAL

791
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:58,889
VISITING HOURS, DOLDAM HOSPITAL

792
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:02,642
This is Doldam Hospital's ER.

793
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,068
Doctor Kim?

794
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:14,613
What?

795
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,782
Why are you back?

796
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,743
We couldn't let you be the only cool one.

797
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:23,997
She said we shouldn't let you
be on standby all by yourself

798
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,041
and dragged me back here.

799
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:28,585
Gosh, cut it out.

800
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,880
Here, everyone stays at the hospital

801
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:33,256
when it rains or snows.

802
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,716
Everyone does that?

803
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,844
Most of the time.
Unless they have other pressing issues.

804
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,971
Who made that rule?

805
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:40,889
Doctor Kim?

806
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:43,308
He started it, indeed.

807
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:44,935
And we followed suit.

808
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:48,522
Gosh, that's crazy.
So you voluntarily work overtime?

809
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:53,276
Hey, who'd do this if they were forced to?
The youngsters wouldn't, even for money.

810
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,362
Work-life balance is important nowadays.

811
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,531
Even I'd rather go home early
than get paid extra.

812
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,241
See? This is what they say.

813
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,578
-Isn't it exhausting though?
-I've been doing this for three years,

814
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,580
so I suppose it's doable.

815
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:06,873
And no complaints?

816
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:07,999
Complaints?

817
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:11,878
Other than being away

818
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,839
from my wife and kid…

819
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:17,300
Dealing with patients
can be easier at times.

820
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:19,928
How is that possible?

821
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,304
I wonder too.

822
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,223
I guess this place…

823
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,559
made me like that.

824
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,936
With that said,

825
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:30,981
may I order some jokbal, fried chicken,
and noodles?

826
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:32,566
Sure, by all means.

827
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:33,483
I'm hungry too.

828
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:34,651
Let's eat first.

829
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:36,111
Okay, I'll order then.

830
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:51,835
GS Seo Woo-jin speaking.

831
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,966
SURGERY, FAMILY MEDICINE

832
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,599
A bus rolled over.

833
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:08,018
Doctor Kim called me.

834
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:11,229
The accident took place

835
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:13,315
just 10 minutes away from our hospital.

836
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:14,733
Doctor Kim…

837
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:18,486
was also on the bus when it happened.

838
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:20,864
What?

839
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:26,077
What did you just say?
Doctor Kim was in an accident?

840
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,830
And? Is he all right?

841
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,832
-Is he badly injured?
- Hold on.

842
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:32,709
Hello, Doctor Kim.

843
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:35,086
Everyone is here.

844
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:37,672
Okay, hold on.

845
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:42,886
Hello. This is Doctor Kim.

846
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:45,472
My gosh, what happened?

847
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:46,765
A bus rolled over?

848
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:48,558
Why were you on the bus to begin with?

849
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:50,852
What's your status? Are you okay?

850
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:53,230
Who's there now?

851
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:54,481
Everyone's here.

852
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,942
All EM, GS, and CS doctors.

853
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:59,110
All the nurses are on standby as well.

854
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,446
I see.

855
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:02,781
Thank you.

856
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:04,991
What's the situation like?

857
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:18,630
Including the driver…

858
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:22,467
I see about 12 passengers.

859
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:27,806
What should we do?
First, Seo Woo-jin and Cha Eun-jae.

860
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,182
-Yes, sir.
-Yes.

861
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,517
I want the two of you

862
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:33,395
to come here at once.

863
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:35,272
Come as quickly as you can.

864
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:38,525
Don't forget to bring the emergency kits.

865
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,860
-Yes, sir.
-I'll go bring the kits.

866
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:42,153
Get the keys and

867
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,655
-meet me in the parking lot.
-Okay.

868
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:48,535
Gosh.

869
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:06,094
A pregnant woman who seems to be due soon
isn't doing so well.

870
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:07,887
Please get ready to receive her.

871
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,597
-But there's no OB-GYN--
-Hey.

872
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:12,642
Let's contact OB-GYNs in the area.

873
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:17,647
Nurse Um, please contact Jungil Hospital
as well as Joongang Gynecology Clinic.

874
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:19,024
And just in case,

875
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:21,484
have the NICU ready as well.

876
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:22,610
Got it.

877
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,612
Doctor Jung.

878
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:26,072
Yes, sir.

879
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,365
As of this moment,

880
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:31,161
you're in charge of our trauma center.

881
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:32,537
Sorry?

882
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:34,956
What? Me?

883
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:36,416
You can do it, right?

884
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,923
I can do it, sir. Don't worry.

885
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,216
Okay.

886
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,104
Right now, I'm seeing

887
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:01,191
two other passengers with severe injuries.

888
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:02,400
Okay.

889
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,527
We'll wait for them, fully prepared.

890
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,821
All right. You all heard that, right?

891
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:07,739
-Yes.
-Yes.

892
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:10,200
Over 12 patients will be here soon.

893
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:13,703
Including the pregnant lady,
we have three confirmed trauma patients.

894
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:16,915
Prepare the beds closest to the entrance
and make sure we have enough warm saline,

895
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:18,833
elastic bandage, and dressing sets.
Let's move.

896
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,293
-Yes, Doctor.
-Yes, Doctor.

897
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,962
And Doctor Nam.

898
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,757
Yes, I know. I'll have the OR ready.

899
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,716
Nurse Um.

900
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,676
Please call Doctor Sim.

901
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:29,928
Sure.

902
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:32,347
Hello, I'm calling from Doldam's ER.

903
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:33,681
Doctor Kim.

904
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,351
Are you all right?

905
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:38,520
Are you okay, Doctor Kim?

906
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:40,105
I'm…

907
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:41,689
I'm okay.

908
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:49,906
As soon as the paramedics arrive,

909
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:52,951
I'll sort things out here and head over.

910
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:54,369
All right?

911
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,204
Okay.

912
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,164
Then we'll see you here.

913
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,146
What's the matter?

914
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:22,105
I'm not sure.

915
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:31,531
Gosh.

916
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:34,075
I think a bus rolled over.

917
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:42,876
The road is jammed.

918
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:47,589
I'll meet you there.

919
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:48,882
What?

920
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,800
Hey, Woo-jin. Wait!

921
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,135
Hey! Gosh.

922
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:53,761
Darn it.

923
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:14,449
-I need more dressing sets.
-Sure.

924
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,718
Are you all right, sir?

925
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:45,396
-Over here.
-Get the driver first.

926
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,315
-Go in.
-Are you all right?

927
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:48,608
Hey, go in!

928
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,735
One, two, three.

929
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:53,488
Those of you who can move,

930
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:55,114
-please head towards me.
-We've got you.

931
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,991
-Watch your step.
-Be careful.

932
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,701
Please be careful. Watch your step.

933
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,495
If you're able to move,

934
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:01,871
please head towards me.

935
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:04,082
Please watch your step.

936
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:09,212
Paramedic. Paramedic!

937
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,715
I'm Doctor Kim from Doldam Hospital.

938
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:15,760
I need some blankets and a backboard. Now!

939
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:18,930
This pregnant lady here
is critically injured.

940
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:21,724
Okay. We'll clear a path behind you.

941
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:24,185
-Okay.
-Bring me a hammer, cutters,

942
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,520
and blankets. Now!

943
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,522
-Stay back.
-What's going on?

944
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,899
-Sir, you can't be here.
-I'm a doctor.

945
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:33,152
I'm the president of Doldam Hospital.
Brief me on the trauma patients.

946
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:34,445
We got the driver out just now,

947
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,823
and we've begun rescuing the passengers.

948
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,701
There was a doctor on the bus.

949
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:41,828
He's been sorting the injured for us.

950
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:44,581
-A doctor?
-Yes.

951
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:49,919
Hey, it's me.

952
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:53,881
Sir, a bus rolled over near the hospital.

953
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:55,174
Yes, I know.

954
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:56,718
I'm at the scene now.

955
00:59:57,885 --> 00:59:58,845
But the thing is,

956
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:00,680
Doctor Kim was on the bus.

957
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:17,905
Are you a doctor?

958
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:19,616
Yes.

959
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:22,493
I'm a doctor, so put your worries to rest.

960
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:24,787
Please save…

961
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:26,706
my baby.

962
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:30,752
Yes, I promise you that I will.
You shouldn't talk.

963
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:33,296
-You must save your energy.
-But my baby…

964
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:34,797
My baby.

965
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:36,299
Please save…

966
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:42,347
Ma'am… Ma'am?

967
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,015
Ma'am, please stay with me.

968
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:46,100
-Ma'am!
-Doctor Kim!

969
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:48,227
The situation is looking bad.

970
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:03,743
-Yes, this is Woo-jin.
-Where are you now?

971
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:05,328
I'm on my way.

972
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:08,122
Hurry. Hurry up!

973
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:09,415
Okay!

974
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:30,311
Her heart stopped beating!

975
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:40,738
Where are the cutters?
She's gone into cardiac arrest. Hurry!

976
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:55,253
Sir?

977
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:58,381
I thought I managed to escape.

978
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:12,145
Sir?

979
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:14,647
I thought…

980
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:18,568
I managed to completely escape from it.

981
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,835
I'm here, Doctor Kim.

982
01:02:58,316 --> 01:02:59,650
But it turns out…

983
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:04,572
I haven't escaped from it…

984
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:06,741
at all.

985
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:06,801
If we don't take the baby out,
both of them could die.

986
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:08,678
We got a call
from a sexual assault victim.

987
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,180
Doctor Yoon, are you inside?

988
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:12,974
What do you think I'd prefer?

989
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:15,101
A-reum!

990
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:16,102
Lift the bus!

991
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:19,146
If we move him now,
he might have a cardiac arrest!

992
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,482
They're both alive.

993
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:24,151
And I'll make sure I save both of them.

994
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,152
Do you understand?

995
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:28,656
-Doctor Kim. You're okay, right?
-Sponge stick.

996
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:31,325
He'll perform surgery in that condition?

997
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:32,326
Doctor Kim.
