1
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,065
This is the aorta.

2
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,944
-It seems weak, so pull it gently.
-Yes, sir.

3
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,133
Teacher Kim, his SBP dropped to 60s.

4
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,051
His cerebral oximetry
is dropping below 40.

5
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,970
I'll increase it and start
transfusing blood.

6
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,055
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,806
I'm very sorry, Teacher Kim.

8
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,600
It's okay. Stay calm.

9
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,643
Okay.

10
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,103
Prolene number four.

11
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,043
Dr. Kang, we have an emergency.

12
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,669
You need to come take a look at this.

13
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,798
I think it's ulcer perforation.

14
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,257
Ulcer perforation?

15
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,469
Who told you to notify that way?

16
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,305
-Where did you get your training?
-I'm sorry.

17
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,140
The patient is a 34-year-old male

18
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,309
and had intermittent abdominal pain
for a few months.

19
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:43,812
He came in complaining
abdominal pain this morning.

20
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,897
He has no special medical history.
According to ROS--

21
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,482
Are you doing a presentation or what?

22
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,442
So what's his condition at this moment?

23
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,653
He's showing abdominal rigidity

24
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,113
and severe tenderness.

25
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:56,449
I did a CT scan as I couldn't
find out the cause in the X-ray.

26
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:58,910
It's here.

27
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,915
Hello? What happened?

28
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,417
It is ulcer perforation.
He needs an operation right now.

29
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,628
How are things going there?
Did they start cannulation?

30
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,505
Not yet.

31
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,842
I will operate on the patient
with perforation. You stay there.

32
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,802
I can't finish the whole procedure

33
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,554
within 20 minutes without you.

34
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:21,391
It's already been delayed by 10 minutes
with the damaged aorta.

35
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,643
It can no longer be delayed.

36
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,728
But this patient can't wait until then.

37
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,064
If something goes wrong,
it may lead to sepsis.

38
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,483
They are still working
on vessel dissection here.

39
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,278
It'll take about
1 hour and 10 minutes until they have

40
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,863
the heart-lung machine connected.

41
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,282
Including the time delayed,

42
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,409
it will take about 1 hour and 20 minutes.

43
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,703
-What do you mean?
-Within that time,

44
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,414
we can operate on the patient
with ulcer perforation.

45
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,623
If we work together.

46
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,751
Laparoscopy or open?

47
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,088
If we find the perforation quickly,
it will be easier with laparoscopy.

48
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,425
But if not, we will have to cut
the abdomen open.

49
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,635
We don't have time to take a risk.

50
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,598
-Okay. You will be cutting it open.
-Okay.

51
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:03,933
-Ms. Eom.
-Yes.

52
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,477
Is Dr. Yang on standby today?

53
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,062
Yes, he's in the company house.

54
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,189
Call him. We have an emergency operation.

55
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,232
Yes, Dr. Do.

56
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,483
-Dr. Woo.
-Yes.

57
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,360
Move the patient
to the operating room immediately.

58
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,570
Yes, Dr. Do.

59
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,532
-This is operating room.
-Just listen to me.

60
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,285
We have an emergency patient
with ulcer perforation

61
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,494
and I'm operating on him.

62
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,122
Don't tell Teacher Kim.

63
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,917
I will be back before he has
the heart-lung machine connected.

64
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,421
Just keep me updated on your progress
every 10 minutes.

65
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,964
Okay.

66
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,217
I will do that.

67
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,364
Can we start?

68
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,324
Yes, please.

69
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,160
Scalpel.

70
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,464
Pad.

71
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,882
Bovie.

72
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,054
Kelly.

73
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,643
Scalpel.

74
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,145
Retractor.

75
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,149
Irrigation.

76
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,654
Keep it coming.

77
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,243
Dr. Nam.

78
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:46,786
Give him heparin.

79
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,246
Injecting heparin.

80
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,041
MS. JEONG:
THEY STARTED CANNULATION

81
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,460
They started cannulation.

82
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,422
Do you see it?

83
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,049
I think it's around the lesser curvature.

84
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,592
LESSER CURVATURE: CURVATURE OF STOMACH

85
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,677
Bovie.

86
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,390
Prolene number four.

87
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,071
Cut.

88
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,457
Scalpel. Pass me cannula.

89
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,032
Dr. Yun, clamp on.

90
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,701
Suture.

91
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,126
Cut.

92
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,714
-Connect the suction line.
-Irrigation.

93
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,384
Keep at irrigation.

94
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,266
That's it. Clamp off.

95
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,400
Let's do the inferior vena cava.

96
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:42,777
Yes, sir.

97
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:50,660
He's fast.

98
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,751
Dr. Shim.

99
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,255
What do you think? Is it going well?

100
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,633
So far, he's abiding
by the standard procedure.

101
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,594
He's really fast, though.

102
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,471
It's been only 80 minutes,

103
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,890
but he is already working
on the inferior vena cava.

104
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,934
He will do risky things

105
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,145
to shorten his surgical time.

106
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,981
Don't miss it when he does.

107
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,357
I understand, sir.

108
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,703
I found it. Suture.

109
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:49,844
Cut.

110
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,020
-Cut.
-Cutting.

111
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,317
-Cut.
-Cutting.

112
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,985
-Cut.
-Cutting.

113
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,786
-Cut.
-Cutting.

114
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,871
Cut.

115
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,042
STARTED CANNULATION OF SUPERIOR VEIN CAVA

116
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,251
Dr. Kang,

117
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,962
Teacher Kim just finished
the cannulation of inferior vena cava.

118
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,048
He's starting the cannulation of
superior vena cava.

119
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,592
They'll catch up to us at this rate.

120
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,635
Cut.

121
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,263
Cut.

122
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,525
Cut.

123
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,529
Okay, all done.

124
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,656
Apply irrigation for ten minutes
and finish up.

125
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,074
Close him up in ten minutes.

126
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,242
Irrigation.

127
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:57,912
Pad.

128
00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,914
Hemovac, please.

129
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,503
Doctor. She says you have to
come back in ten minutes.

130
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,630
-Suture.
-Should I use a stapler?

131
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,631
Yes.

132
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:12,385
Maintain tension by making
fine subcutaneous stitches.

133
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,011
Use a stapler to stitch up.

134
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,770
-Cut.
-Cut.

135
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,943
Doctor, you have to come right now.

136
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,280
-Cut.
-Cutting.

137
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,990
Stapler.

138
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,376
Okay.

139
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,712
Dr. Woo. Please finish him up
and dress him.

140
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:48,713
Yes, Dr. Kang.

141
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,256
Take him to the ICU when you finish.

142
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,507
Call us if anything happens.

143
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,883
Yes, Dr. Do.

144
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,233
-Is the heart-lung machine ready?
-Yes, it is.

145
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,776
Pump on.

146
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,396
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

147
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,731
Pump flow down.

148
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,859
Cross-clamp.

149
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,656
Pump flow up.

150
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,255
Turn off the artificial heart.

151
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,887
We will now take out the artificial heart.

152
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,556
Are you ready, Dr. Kang and Dr. Do?

153
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,599
Yes, Teacher Kim.

154
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,059
Changing positions.

155
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,026
Removing the batteries, the TET,
and the controller.

156
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,569
Scalpel.

157
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,326
Bovie.

158
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,707
Dr. Do looks

159
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,085
very good on screen, President Do.

160
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,468
-Army retractor.
-One more, please.

161
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,781
Do you need coffee?

162
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,033
Would you like something to drink
or some snacks?

163
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,327
Where's the restroom?

164
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,998
Go straight and turn left
in the middle of the hall

165
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,000
and turn right from there.

166
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,334
Thank you.

167
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,351
DOCTOR'S OFFICE, TEACHER KIM,
CHIEF OF GENERAL SURGERY

168
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,542
You really made up your mind, didn't you?

169
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,586
Dr. Bu Yong-ju.

170
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,302
The batteries have been removed.

171
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,596
The controller has also been removed.

172
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,890
Finally, I will pull out the TET.

173
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,774
This is good.

174
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,236
They finished two minutes faster
than we expected.

175
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,115
Good job, both of you.

176
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:28,993
Metzenbaum.

177
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:30,870
From now on,

178
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,997
we'll be going non-stop.

179
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,932
This is quite amazing.

180
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,328
Isn't it magnificent?

181
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,288
I'm not a doctor myself
so I don't know very well,

182
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:17,666
but what I do know is that

183
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,376
what they're doing is amazing.

184
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,254
What's your role at this hospital?

185
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:26,592
I'm the manager of this hospital,
Jang Gi-tae.

186
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,801
MANAGER JANG GI-TAE

187
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,346
If you're the manager,

188
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,307
you must know everything
about this hospital.

189
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,438
It's a bit embarrassing for me to say,

190
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,190
but you could say

191
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,859
that I'm the one who pulls the strings
behind the scene.

192
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,780
I see.

193
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,170
The connective unit, please.

194
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,463
Long forceps.

195
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,055
Prolene number four, please.

196
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,909
The artificial heart, please.

197
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,762
How's the pump flow?

198
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,055
It's 5.8 liters.

199
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,474
I will remove the air
from the artificial heart.

200
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,101
Increase the volume, please.

201
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,148
Turn on the artificial heart.

202
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,788
All right.

203
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,956
How is this possible?

204
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,794
What? Did you find a fault?

205
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,587
No, it's not that.

206
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,716
Every part of the operation
was done by the standard procedure.

207
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,844
There is something abnormal about this.

208
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,263
What's abnormal about it? What is it?

209
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,765
It was

210
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,601
so quick.

211
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:23,727
It was quick?

212
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,064
If the adhesion is too severe like that,

213
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:30,192
it takes at least three to four hours
until pump on.

214
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,819
However, it took him

215
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:35,614
only four hours and five minutes
to change the heart.

216
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:39,493
-This is just--
-Is that all? Is there anything else?

217
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,787
There is one other thing.

218
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,372
What is it? Tell me.

219
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,166
It was...

220
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,420
too perfect.

221
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,360
I knew it.

222
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,321
You've still got it.

223
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,540
Dr. Yun.

224
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,710
Touch it.

225
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,962
Me?

226
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,616
This is the first artificial heart

227
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,493
you've ever changed.

228
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,952
It took another two hours

229
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,329
to control bleeding and to stitch him up.

230
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,290
The entire operation was

231
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,919
finished in 6 hours and 2 minutes.

232
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,257
It took 6 hours and 2 minutes.

233
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,220
Everyone, great job.

234
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,013
-Great job.
-Great job.

235
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,306
Great job.

236
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:10,852
Here.

237
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,647
Great job, Dr. Nam.

238
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:19,820
Great job.

239
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,760
That's how Teacher Kim

240
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,762
and we

241
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,975
created yet another miracle.

242
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:25,427
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

243
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,763
You're here.

244
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,807
-How's my father?
-He's resting inside.

245
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,435
It looked like the operation went well.

246
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,770
One of his veins

247
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,230
was touched during the operation.

248
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:41,526
We'll have to wait and see
how he recovers.

249
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:47,616
He's doing very well.

250
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,744
His blood pressure, CVP,
ABGA, and VBGA are all stable.

251
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,162
Okay.

252
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,040
What about the patient
with ulcer perforation?

253
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,667
Dr. Kang just checked in on him.

254
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,127
It looks like the operation went well.

255
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:02,964
Make sure you check in often
until the chairman wakes up.

256
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,008
If anything happens,

257
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:06,927
call me right away.

258
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,386
I'll stay by his side.

259
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,681
I'll take turns with Dr. Yun,
so don't worry about it.

260
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:15,393
-Thanks.
-Sure.

261
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,728
Of course.

262
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,315
How is my father doing?

263
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,484
He's doing well so far.

264
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,986
All of his vitals are stable.

265
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,155
It'll take

266
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,283
about 6 to 12 hours for him to wake up.

267
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,495
It'll be either late tonight
or tomorrow morning.

268
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,955
It looked like

269
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,749
you touched an aorta by mistake.

270
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,126
President Do.

271
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,796
You seem to be clueless
since you specialize in internal medicine.

272
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,882
Sometimes, we touch an aorta
during a surgery

273
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,677
if there is an adhesion in veins.

274
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:52,013
You even brought a heart surgeon with you.

275
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,099
Didn't he tell you about that?

276
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,184
The moment the aorta popped,

277
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,312
the oxygen saturation
of his brain dropped below 40.

278
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:02,524
It did drop, but it was around 38.

279
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,902
Then it went right up.

280
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:09,739
What if something goes wrong
because of that?

281
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:14,119
I doubt anything will go wrong
because of that, President Do.

282
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,829
I surely hope so.

283
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,998
Especially if you don't want any trouble.

284
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:20,584
Why?

285
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,878
You should go and pray on it.

286
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,338
Pray that he won't wake up.

287
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,508
What are you talking about?

288
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,468
I am worried about the chairman.

289
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,930
You surely are.

290
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,145
Excuse me.

291
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,154
Please do not misunderstand.

292
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,823
-I was honestly worried about--
-I know.

293
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,117
Anyway, thanks for today.

294
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,079
Call me as soon as he wakes up.

295
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,789
I'll be at a hotel nearby.

296
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,249
Won't you go in?

297
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,544
I don't want to see

298
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,713
my dad like that.

299
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,261
Call me when he wakes up.

300
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,038
Chairman Shin.

301
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:43,166
The operation went well.

302
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,836
I made

303
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,258
a mistake in the middle.

304
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,430
But nothing went wrong
because Teacher Kim covered for me.

305
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,101
As long as you don't give up,

306
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:03,019
you'll be up in no time.

307
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,398
Okay?

308
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:18,702
-When he was unconscious...
-Did you see him?

309
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,551
-Doctor.
-Doctor!

310
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,720
-Doctor, are you okay?
-Aren't you tired?

311
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:39,639
-I'll make a visit soon!
-May I take a picture?

312
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,349
-Sir!
-Doctor!

313
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,642
-I respect you!
-Can you wait?

314
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,270
Everyone, calm down.
Teacher Kim just finished

315
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,230
a very difficult operation.

316
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:50,400
I do apologize that he can't
make any time for you all today.

317
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:53,069
Please do return to your seats.
Thank you for understanding.

318
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,238
-Doctor!
-Please open the door!

319
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,365
Okay, I will let you see him.

320
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,908
Please return to your seats.

321
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,544
Yes?

322
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:13,465
Teacher Kim.

323
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,925
I'm so sorry to intrude.

324
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:17,677
What is it?

325
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,847
First of all, I'd like to congratulate you

326
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,098
for a successful operation.

327
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:25,268
It was such a touching live operation.

328
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,979
Teacher Kim, you truly are good.

329
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:29,314
Right?

330
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,150
What's the occasion?

331
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,236
Oh, well. It's...

332
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,864
There is someone here

333
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,158
who wants to interview you

334
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,577
about this special
artificial heart operation.

335
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,870
No, thanks.

336
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:47,374
Don't say that. Could you do this
for the publicity of

337
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,459
of Doldam Hospital and yourself?

338
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:52,295
No, I'm not talking to any reporter.

339
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,547
Hello.

340
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,967
I'm sorry a mere reporter
like me came to bother you.

341
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,388
Mr. Oh, you said you'll walk in
when I give you the sign.

342
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,639
You can't do this.

343
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,936
It's been a while, Dr. Bu.

344
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,400
I haven't seen you since
Jang Hyeon-ju's incident, right?

345
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:32,794
What's wrong?

346
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:36,005
I think it's infection.
He has a 38 degrees fever.

347
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:37,715
Ms. Cho.

348
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:40,218
Check his vital signs

349
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:41,261
and give him propacetamol.

350
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,470
Yes, Dr. Yun.

351
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:46,099
Go eat something. I will stay here.

352
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,267
I'm okay.

353
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,936
I heard you skipped breakfast.

354
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,229
You should go eat something.

355
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:53,356
You will be working at night, too.

356
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,526
Thank you.

357
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,249
Did you ask for me?

358
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,878
What's the difference
between chest PA and chest AP?

359
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,547
They are taken in different positions.

360
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,300
PA is taken in a standing position
and AP is taken in a lying position.

361
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:23,636
What should you do with the patient
with ulcer perforation, then?

362
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,263
In a standing position.

363
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,098
Then is it PA or AP?

364
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,725
Of course, it is PA.

365
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,187
Is this PA or AP?

366
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:36,983
What?

367
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,903
This is AP.

368
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:42,572
And you reported to me
that there was no free air.

369
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:44,908
I'm sorry.

370
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,786
I made a mistake giving an order.

371
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,204
I told you to be better, not sorry.

372
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,462
-I told you to be better.
-I'm sorry.

373
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:01,424
-I'll be better from now on.
-Forget it. Just go.

374
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,651
Don't you think you went too far?

375
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,195
-What?
-I know she made a mistake,

376
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,280
but you were way too harsh.

377
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,407
It's not that Dr. Woo made
a wrong diagnosis or something.

378
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,409
She notified you of the ulcer perforation,

379
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,204
and had the patient undergo
an operation before it was too late.

380
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,413
Mr. Park.

381
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:36,459
You are just picking on
everything she does.

382
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,211
You are not just
pointing out her mistakes.

383
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,089
You keep insulting her character.

384
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,468
I'm saying this because it makes me
very uncomfortable to watch.

385
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,137
-Mr. Park.
-Excuse me, Mr. Park.

386
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:51,140
Mind your own business.

387
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,101
What happened just now
was between doctors.

388
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,854
It's not for a nurse like you
to intervene.

389
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,480
This is my area.

390
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,443
I'm sorry, Dr. Do.

391
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,362
I will talk to him.

392
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:07,949
We have patients here. Can we stop now?

393
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:19,335
-You were wrong on this one.
-Ms. Oh.

394
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,838
I know you don't like the way he works,

395
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:24,048
but you can't complain about it like that.

396
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,259
You get what I'm trying to say, right?

397
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,706
Hi.

398
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,291
President Do.

399
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,044
Hello.

400
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:10,762
Manager Jang.

401
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,972
Get him out of my office.

402
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,265
Pardon?

403
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,476
Did I make you feel uncomfortable?

404
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,646
Yes, you did.

405
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:20,939
Why?

406
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:25,234
Do I remind you of some bad memories?

407
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,237
Do you two know each other?

408
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,365
I'd say yes,

409
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:34,077
but we are not friends or something.

410
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,290
I don't even know

411
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:44,253
what President Do said to incite you.

412
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:48,049
I'm not talking to a journalist like you
for even a second,

413
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,175
so get out of my office now.

414
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,468
Dr. Bu Yong-ju.

415
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:53,012
This is your problem.

416
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,640
You treat journalists like trash

417
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,350
as if they'd do anything for money.

418
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,769
It is very offensive.

419
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,562
You are trash.

420
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:07,443
I'm not worse than you
who killed a patient

421
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,529
by having your junior doctors
perform a surgery for you.

422
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,448
At least I didn't kill a person.

423
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,368
There is more than one person

424
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,121
who suffered

425
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,750
and turned their backs on the world
because of your ridiculous reports.

426
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:26,004
So I'm telling you to
reveal the truth with evidence

427
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,214
instead of avoiding me.

428
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,508
If you keep shying away from it,

429
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,511
it will just breed more misunderstandings.

430
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,471
Why would I

431
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:38,307
explain myself with evidence
to a scum like you?

432
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,559
People want to

433
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,769
know the truth.

434
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,314
The truth?

435
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:53,781
So...

436
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,784
If you find out the truth,

437
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:01,122
do you have the courage
to tell it to the world?

438
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:08,963
He is

439
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,300
Dr. Ahn Wu-yeol,
thoracic surgeon at Geosan Medical Center.

440
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:16,012
It seems he was very impressed
by the operation.

441
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,181
He praised you a lot.

442
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,809
It was Teacher Kim who did a good job.

443
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,520
It is true that he is good,

444
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:28,149
but he couldn't have done it
without a good first assistant.

445
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,194
I guess you saw I made a mistake.

446
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,279
It was delayed

447
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,157
by more than 10 minutes
because of my mistake.

448
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,243
You are very modest.

449
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,705
She is a talented doctor
I've supported since she was young.

450
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,415
She is my friend's daughter,

451
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,460
but I feel like she's my daughter.

452
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,463
I'll take this moment

453
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,882
as the end of our relationship.

454
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:57,720
We recently had a conflict.

455
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,307
Are you still upset with it?

456
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,936
No, that's not it.

457
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:08,815
I just scolded you once
as a senior and a father.

458
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,192
You can't treat me like this
because of that.

459
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,653
I've put a lot of efforts
into making you a decent doctor.

460
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:16,280
Young kids are all like that these days.

461
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,700
It is just our generation
who tried everything

462
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:23,037
to humbly beg pardon
and pacify their seniors.

463
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:27,500
But young people these days
break off contact instead.

464
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,336
I'm sorry.

465
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:33,005
I should have given it more thought.

466
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,927
Anyway, I'm pleased to meet you, Dr. Yun.

467
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,180
I want to talk to you about the operation

468
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,723
when we get a chance.

469
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,853
Well, actually, you are single, right?

470
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:52,024
In fact, Dr. Yun is also single.

471
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,694
She's always busy working at the hospital.

472
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,195
Just like you.

473
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:59,740
I think you two would

474
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,450
make a cute couple.

475
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:02,910
Don't you think, President Do?

476
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,830
Spare some time to come visit me.

477
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,917
Let's have dinner together with Dr. Ahn.

478
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,342
Excuse me.

479
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,721
Dr. Yun, what are you doing?
Teacher Kim is looking for you.

480
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,014
Teacher Kim?

481
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:25,099
You should hurry. It seems to be urgent.

482
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,352
Okay. Please excuse me.

483
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,533
Where is Teacher Kim? Is he in the office?

484
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:44,952
He's in the staff room.

485
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,788
In the staff room?

486
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:58,925
What's going on?

487
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:02,887
You didn't have lunch yet, right?

488
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,932
You said Teacher Kim wants to see me.

489
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,476
What do you want to eat?
Jajangmyeon or pizza?

490
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,811
It is all we can order for delivery.

491
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,110
Next time you are in such a situation,

492
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,321
just leave the place without hesitation.

493
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:23,324
You don't have to listen to the nonsense.

494
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,703
Do you want me to hang up
a sign on your back?

495
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,873
Yun Seo-jeong is taken.

496
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,417
Do not touch her. Like this.

497
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,629
If the same thing happens again,

498
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,258
I will go tell President Do everything.

499
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,970
I'll tell him you have a boyfriend.

500
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,055
That I am that boyfriend.

501
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:47,890
I will say that.

502
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,393
Don't be ridiculous.

503
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,436
Why? Do you think I won't do that?

504
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,646
Do you want me to tell him now?

505
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,898
Pizza.

506
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:01,487
I want to eat pizza. I'm starving.

507
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,951
I knew it.

508
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,411
You must be hungry.

509
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,455
Let's talk about that again
after eating lunch.

510
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,556
What do you want to drink?

511
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,433
Anything.

512
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,686
Do you want coke or sprite?

513
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,105
Anything.

514
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:41,193
That has to be
the most difficult answer to work with.

515
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,386
I can't order pizza like this.

516
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,450
Excuse me, Mr. Park.

517
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:31,452
Yes?

518
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:35,289
About your taking my side earlier...

519
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:39,168
I do appreciate it,

520
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,756
but I hope you won't do that again.

521
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,218
I have much to learn,

522
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,471
and I still make a lot of mistakes.

523
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:55,184
Getting corrected even in such a way

524
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,395
is a big help for me.

525
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,355
Getting corrected and
getting looked down upon

526
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,065
are two different things.

527
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,484
Either way,

528
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:06,404
I think it's something
I have to cope with.

529
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,573
-That being said--
-But still, I don't think

530
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,201
it's right for you to be mistreated.

531
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,538
That's the way

532
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,748
I was taught here.

533
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:20,459
No matter how young, I was respected.

534
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,712
I was scolded when I made a big mistake,

535
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,006
but I was never
looked down upon as a person.

536
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,219
People will do it more
if you just let them.

537
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,263
They think it's okay.

538
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:37,101
I didn't say that to Dr. Do
to take your side.

539
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:42,189
If I saw any other person
being treated like that at this hospital,

540
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,151
I would have done the same.

541
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,549
This is the emergency room.

542
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,176
Ms. Oh. It's me.

543
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:13,095
I need you in the president's office.
It's an emergency.

544
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:16,891
Reporter Oh?

545
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,434
What about him?

546
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:21,812
He's blackmailing me saying
he'll expose Teacher Kim of his past.

547
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,440
Starting with how he got
kicked out of Geosan Medical Center,

548
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,151
he went on about
a woman named Jang Hyeon-ju.

549
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:33,491
Why did you take that reporter
to Teacher Kim's office?

550
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:34,909
I didn't know this would happen.

551
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,036
All I wanted was
publicity for our hospital

552
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,121
by letting the word out
on the success of the operation.

553
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,749
I only did it
for our hospital's recognition--

554
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,459
Chairman Shin hasn't even woken up yet.

555
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:46,170
Why did you get ahead of yourself?

556
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:49,340
That's a bit harsh, Ms. Oh.

557
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:50,925
How is that getting ahead of myself?

558
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,557
President Yeo, why would you leave
in the middle of a conversation?

559
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,559
I forgot that I need to go down to Sokcho.

560
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:06,690
I'm sorry. I'll have to leave early.

561
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,484
Why would you go to Sokcho
at a time like this?

562
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,487
Gosh, you're so gullible.

563
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:16,909
My goodness.

564
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,161
I'm not doing this for my own good.

565
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,913
I'm doing everything for the hospital.

566
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,540
Gosh.

567
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:35,761
That Jang Hyeon-ju

568
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,890
really follows Teacher Kim
wherever he goes.

569
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,478
It wasn't even his on own will
to make others operate on her.

570
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,939
Why do you think he's not even
trying to justify himself?

571
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,817
Bu Yong-ju.
That's the kind of a man he is.

572
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,028
He's unfriendly and stubborn as a rock.

573
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,949
I think he feels somewhat responsible

574
00:42:57,074 --> 00:43:00,619
for the death of Jang Hyeon-ju.

575
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,289
Even so, it's not something
that should be buried.

576
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,499
What President Do and the main hospital

577
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:08,961
did to Jang Hyeon-ju
and some of the patients there

578
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,922
and how they put all the blame
on Teacher Kim.

579
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,301
Isn't it about time
we put the matter in its true light?

580
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:16,802
It won't be easy.

581
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:20,848
It's highly unlikely that they left
any evidence of what they did.

582
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,516
But still, I can't understand

583
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:26,812
why Teacher Kim is keeping quiet about it.

584
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,023
Moreover,

585
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,734
it involved the death
of his favorite pupil.

586
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:35,988
Rather than mourning the deceased,

587
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:40,242
he made an inevitable choice
to save some child's life.

588
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:43,203
Let's just say that's the case.

589
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,415
Some child?

590
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,626
Who's that?

591
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,254
That's as much as I can say.

592
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:56,175
I made a promise to Teacher Kim
that I'll take it to my grave.

593
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:21,700
-Let's take a CT scan.
-Yes, Doctor.

594
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,035
Sir.

595
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:26,246
We'll go take a CT scan shortly.
Please sit tight.

596
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:29,500
Are you busy?

597
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,128
He's experiencing right flank pain.

598
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:36,131
There's hematuria and he's waiting
for his turn on the abdomen CT scan.

599
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:38,258
It looks like an ureter stone.

600
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,344
I think so, too.

601
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:44,223
That ulcer perforation patient
in the morning...

602
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:45,849
I heard you performed the operation.

603
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:50,312
I'm sorry. They said it could
develop into a sepsis.

604
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,981
I made the decision
without your permission.

605
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:55,234
-Great job.
-Okay.

606
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:58,570
What?

607
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:01,365
Forget it if you didn't hear.

608
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,160
-Please continue.
-Yes, Teacher Kim.

609
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,523
You found this in Teacher Kim's room?

610
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:37,484
I think that's what Bu Yong-ju
wanted to do

611
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:39,403
at Doldam Hospital.

612
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,989
Bu Yong-ju, you swine.

613
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:44,575
Some malicious dream you've been dreaming.

614
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,703
I can't believe he's been
plotting such nonsense.

615
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:49,788
It's not impossible, so to speak.

616
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:53,125
If this operation finishes successfully,

617
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,502
Chairman Shin will completely have

618
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,464
Bu Yong-ju's back.

619
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:01,592
That won't happen.

620
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,344
It's bad news for Bu Yong-ju,

621
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,430
but it looks like

622
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,641
fortune is still on my side.

623
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,648
He's not waking up.

624
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:19,943
BP, CVP, ABGA, and VBGA.

625
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,737
Everything is stable.

626
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,741
How long has it been since the operation?

627
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,493
It's been nine hours.

628
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,453
We should wait and see

629
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:31,246
until the 12-hour mark.

630
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,625
Patients of old age

631
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,503
tend to take longer to wake up.

632
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,254
I understand.

633
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:51,558
What are you talking about?

634
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,144
What do you mean? He's not awake?

635
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:56,313
Do you know what time it is?

636
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,025
DIRECTOR SHIN

637
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,069
Yes, Director Shin.

638
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:05,113
As soon as I got the report
saying he's yet to awake,

639
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:06,990
I'm on my way to Doldam Hospital.

640
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:08,784
I'll have to go there

641
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:11,787
and get a grasp of the situation.

642
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,540
Yes. I understand.

643
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,428
Dr. Nam.

644
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,013
Where are we on propofol and pentalene?

645
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,808
I stopped the injection
after the 12-hour mark.

646
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,518
Just in case.

647
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:38,355
Every indicator was
in the normal range all night.

648
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:40,732
There was almost no bleeding,
so we started giving him heparin.

649
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,402
He hasn't had any crisis.

650
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,654
Why is he not waking up?

651
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,619
-Teacher Kim.
-Yes?

652
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,955
Chairman Shin's guardian is outside.

653
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,582
I'll go.

654
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:59,084
No, you should keep by his side.

655
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:01,962
Let's go.

656
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,843
Page Mr. Gu.

657
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:16,727
What happened?

658
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,854
Why hasn't my father woken up yet?

659
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:22,024
You said it'll take 6 to 12 hours at most
for him to wake up.

660
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,234
It is 10 a.m. now.

661
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,695
19 hours have passed
since his surgery ended.

662
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:30,282
It rarely happens,
but it's not impossible.

663
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:33,827
We have to wait at least
for two or three days.

664
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,579
Why are you going back on your word?

665
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:39,333
You said 12 hours.
Why did that become 2 to 3 days?

666
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,003
In most cases,
patients wake up in 12 hours,

667
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:44,755
but when they don't,

668
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:49,051
we need to check their condition
for between 48 and 72 hours.

669
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:50,427
That's what I meant.

670
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,054
All you do is check his condition?

671
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:56,099
You should be doing everything you can.
You'll just check on him?

672
00:48:56,308 --> 00:49:00,103
I did everything I could do
during the surgery.

673
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,147
The surgery went well,

674
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:05,984
and we minimized the hours
of putting him under anesthesia.

675
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:08,528
In this situation, all we can do is

676
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:11,239
wait for the patient to wake up.

677
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:12,991
There's nothing else we can do.

678
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,534
That's not true.

679
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,837
The fact that he hasn't woken up yet means

680
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:28,840
that there may be a problem in his brain.

681
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,884
You should take a CT scan immediately.

682
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,719
I am his doctor.

683
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:36,556
Therefore, I'm the one who decides
whether to take a CT scan.

684
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,683
How dare you?

685
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,393
What do you mean by that?

686
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,770
Are you trying to stall for time
or something?

687
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:46,650
Can't you see what are connected
to his body?

688
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:50,070
Four infusion pumps,

689
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:53,824
two tubes from the artificial heart,
and four chest tubes.

690
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:56,326
In total, there are ten tubes
connected to his body.

691
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,578
What if something goes wrong
while we take a CT scan

692
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,205
with all the tubes connected to him?

693
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:02,290
Would you take responsibility?

694
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:04,793
-This is your biggest problem.
-What?

695
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,336
You rate yourself too highly.

696
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,506
You never admit what you did wrong.

697
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:13,510
I'm sure all you thought of was
a perfect surgery.

698
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:16,847
You finished such a difficult surgery
in six hours and two minutes.

699
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,891
It's something you can draw
attention with. But!

700
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,270
I guess you didn't consider
the possibility

701
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,480
that Chairman Shin would not wake up.

702
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:28,024
So you are flustered

703
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:31,319
and you can't accept the reality.
Am I right?

704
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:35,991
Stop beating around the bush.
Make it short.

705
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,617
What's your point?

706
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,327
I've been curious

707
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,497
why you pushed ahead
with such a risky surgery

708
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:46,042
even though he has terminal lung cancer.

709
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:51,047
Did you take such a big risk
just for this?

710
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,217
Just for this?

711
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:03,643
This is a mere shabby branch hospital,

712
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:05,729
and you are working with

713
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,940
an anesthesiologist who is going
through a medical litigation,

714
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:11,485
a fellow who has been kicked out
from the main hospital,

715
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:14,446
an ER doctor who had PTSD in the past,

716
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:16,239
and the staff members
of a countryside hospital

717
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,408
who haven't even worked
in a general hospital.

718
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,995
What did you dream of
with such poor team members?

719
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,122
A trauma center?

720
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,417
Was that what you wanted
from Chairman Shin

721
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:28,585
in return for his surgery?

722
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,003
A trauma center?

723
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:31,880
Is that why you operated on him

724
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:34,758
even though he has terminal lung cancer?

725
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:50,732
THE BIZARRE CASE OF SURGERY FRAUD
AT A COUNTRYSIDE HOSPITAL

726
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:59,241
THE GENIUS SURGEON BU YONG-JU
PUSHED AHEAD WITH A SURGERY,

727
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,205
AND CAUSED THE CHAIRMAN
TO FALL INTO A COMA

728
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:11,294
As of this moment,

729
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,839
you are disqualified from
your position as his doctor.

730
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:17,926
-Dr. Shim.
-Yes, President Do.

731
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:20,178
You're in charge of Chairman Shin
as of today.

732
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,306
Take a CT scan immediately.

733
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,058
Yes, President Do.

734
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:26,852
If the result shows

735
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,145
that he has cerebral infarction,

736
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:31,481
you will not only go through
a medical litigation

737
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:33,900
but also lose your doctor's license.

738
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:38,446
-What are you waiting for, Dr. Shim?
-Yes, President Do.

739
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,869
Could you please move aside?

740
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:48,623
Please let me go in.

741
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,333
Did you even wash your hands?

742
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,427
Are you really going in there

743
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,430
dressed like that?

744
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,473
In the ICU?

745
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,938
-Mr. Gu.
-Yes?

746
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,193
From now on,

747
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,031
don't let anyone enter the ICU
without my permission.

748
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:22,908
Especially

749
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:26,202
this one and that one

750
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:27,954
shouldn't go in there.

751
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,416
Don't let anyone go through this door.

752
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:32,626
Yes, Teacher Kim.

753
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,669
What are you doing?

754
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,131
I'm protecting my patient as his doctor.

755
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:39,883
-What?
-Are you really

756
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:43,303
going to let him die?

757
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,314
Here.

758
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:55,941
Can you read this?

759
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:56,900
POWER OF ATTORNEY

760
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:59,486
This is the letter Chairman Shin
wrote himself

761
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:02,280
before the surgery.

762
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:04,574
The full decision-making authority

763
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,910
in every possible situation
that might happen after the surgery

764
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,453
has been given to me.

765
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:13,458
I have been given the full authority.

766
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,543
That's what this letter is about.

767
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:24,511
I am the president of the main hospital.

768
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,097
How dare a mere surgeon
at the branch hospital

769
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,057
try to stop me with a piece of paper?

770
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,809
How dare you?

771
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,645
I'm sure he had it notarized.

772
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:36,731
I guess that means

773
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,402
it has a legal effect.

774
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:41,861
Am I right, Manager Ju?

775
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:46,032
The corporation lawyer
has notarized the letter.

776
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:47,659
I was there, too.

777
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:48,952
You were there, too?

778
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,746
The fact that it has a legal effect

779
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:54,666
means that it carries
legal binding force, I guess.

780
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,336
So stop interfering my work and get lost.

781
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,137
Do you not understand what I said?

782
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:08,972
I said, get lost.

783
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:29,909
As soon as Chairman Shin
regains his consciousness,

784
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:31,786
we will get in touch.

785
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:44,841
You.

786
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:47,927
You should have stopped him
when he was doing this.

787
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,263
Were you helping him instead?

788
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:52,807
He trusts Teacher Kim
more than anyone else.

789
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,517
So do I.

790
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,189
If things go wrong for him,

791
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,316
you will be finished, too.

792

THE FOUNDATION PLAN OF
TRAUMA CENTER AT DOLDAM HOSPITAL

793
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:49,781
The era of rampant facts.

794
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:06,256
The world where what powerful people say
is considered as a fact

795
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:10,343
while powerless people's words are
considered as a wild rumor.

796
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:20,145
Hello.

797
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:22,897
Hello.

798
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:36,995
-What brings you here again?
-I just

799
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,289
came here to have udon.

800
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:41,749
Can I have a bowl of udon?

801
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:44,878
With their own opinions and lies

802
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,754
that distort the truth,

803
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:50,717
people insist their opinions
are the facts in this world.

If you find out the truth,

do you have the courage
to tell it to the world?

811
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,303
Hello?

812
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,388
It's me. Oh Seong-jae.

813
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,309
What if

814
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:45,313
I say that I have the courage
to tell the truth to the world?

815
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:49,108
Will you tell me the truth?

816
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:51,861
The truth is

817
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:54,113
always rooted on facts.

818
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,075
Can you tell me the truth?

819
00:58:58,284 --> 00:58:59,911
Dr. Bu Yong-ju.

820
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,790
But not all the facts are

821
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:06,209
always right.
