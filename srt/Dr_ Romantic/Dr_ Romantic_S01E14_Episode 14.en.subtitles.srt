1
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:23,189
Dr. Kang, are you all right?

2
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:25,900
Doctors are humans, too.

3
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,569
We can get MERS, too.

4
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,447
If we're unlucky, we can die from it.
You know that?

5
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:31,781
Dr. Kang!

6
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,122
Mr. Gu.

7
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,293
Bring me N95 masks and gowns.

8
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,213
-I will go in.
-You can't do that, Teacher Kim.

9
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,549
You are the control tower
of this hospital.

10
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,092
Please think it all through once again.

11
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,094
I will go in.

12
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,892
I will go in there.

13
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,687
I will go in the emergency room.

14
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:04,647
Please let me.

15
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,357
What?

16
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:09,402
The doctor they need right now

17
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,488
is me.

18
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,491
I will

19
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,785
go in there.

20
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,829
Please let me.

21
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,998
Dr. Kang.

22
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,042
Hold yourself together, Dr. Kang.

23
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,419
His vitals are 100 over 70, and pulse 120.

24
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,254
But his temperature is 39.8 degrees.

25
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,048
Gosh.

26
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,967
How could he have been working
in this condition?

27
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,220
What should we do, Ms. Oh?

28
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,139
TEACHER KIM

29
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,140
What is his temperature?

30
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:41,684
Dr. Yun.

31
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,856
Tell me about his vital signs
and temperature again.

32
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,776
They are 100 over 70,
pulse 120, and 39.8 degrees.

33
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,715
Dr. Yun.

34
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,470
Inject 200cc of normal saline per hour

35
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,888
and give him fever reducers.

36
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,140
Would that be enough?

37
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,391
It's just syncope.

38
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,684
SYNCOPE: FAINTING

39
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,727
I think it's because he's very dehydrated.

40
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,772
Let's let him rest
and hydrate him for now.

41
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,235
He will feel better
after getting some sleep.

42
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,739
Where is the patient
with acute appendicitis?

43
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:37,866
She's over there.

44
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:43,037
By the way, Dr. Yun is not supposed
to be here, is she?

45
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,124
If the patients are confirmed
to have MERS,

46
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,376
she will be excluded
from Chairman Shin's operation.

47
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,253
Really?

48
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,381
That's too bad.
She worked so hard for that.

49
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,592
Please lie on your back for me.

50
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,385
Let me press your abdomen.

51
00:02:58,928 --> 00:02:59,888
If something goes wrong,

52
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:03,308
you might regret this decision later on.

53
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,853
Are you okay with that?

54
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,481
I didn't care.

55
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,317
At least in that moment.

56
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,277
I will go in.

57
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,157
I wanted to be with him.

58
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,494
I wanted to stay with him.

59
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,039
In that moment.

60
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,659
-Please hurry.
-Okay.

61
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,584
Manager Jang.

62
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,711
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

63
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,090
Do we have suspected MERS cases?

64
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,633
They are just suspected MERS cases,

65
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,760
but the emergency room
has been shut down for now.

66
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,054
Then why aren't you wearing
a protection suit yet?

67
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,138
Well...

68
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:25,723
It's not here yet.

69
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,309
Excuse me.

70
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,727
Excuse me.

71
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,479
Is anyone in there?

72
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,607
Excuse me.

73
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,609
Hello, sir.

74
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,362
Who are you?

75
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,906
How are things in the emergency room?

76
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,492
The patient with appendicitis
is not looking good.

77
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,203
Her fever and physical condition
are getting worse.

78
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,999
It seems it's been advanced
to peritonitis.

79
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,959
When can we operate on her?

80
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:57,255
I'm not doing it without protection suits.

81
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,258
Where are protection suits?

82
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,592
Don't you have them yet?

83
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,760
Teacher Kim.

84
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,430
I just heard from
the public health center.

85
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,933
They will bring protection suits
in 30 minutes.

86
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,645
Dr. Song, did you hear that?
It will be here in 30 minutes.

87
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,856
Go prepare for the surgery now.

88
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,318
Am I finally going to see
Dr. Song performing a surgery?

89
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,821
You will finally perform a surgery
for the first time in our hospital.

90
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,365
-Congratulations.
-Enough.

91
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,619
Why did Dr. Kang have to be
in the emergency room?

92
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,664
I will go prepare for the surgery, then.

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,126
Dr. Yun.

94
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,421
Take care of the patient
for the next half hour.

95
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,882
As soon as we get protection suits,
Dr. Song will do the surgery.

96
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,050
Okay.

97
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,888
Get the patient propacetamol by IV

98
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,973
-and administer antibiotics.
-Yes, Doctor.

99
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,558
Dr. Yun, here.

100
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,976
Excuse me.

101
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,754
PATIENT ROOMS

102
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,557
Chairman Shin's condition has improved.

103
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:34,018
His fever dropped to normal

104
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,937
and his lungs sound good.

105
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,441
What's wrong?

106
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,277
Did you come up here by your own will

107
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,154
or did Dr. Yun call you up here?

108
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,700
What do you mean by that?

109
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,035
I'm curious how

110
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:55,164
Dr. Yun found out that Dr. Kang fainted.

111
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:59,043
They didn't call it in
to the second floor station.

112
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,132
Dr. Kang fainted in the emergency room.

113
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,636
I don't really know.

114
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,890
I'm only here because Dr. Yun paged me.

115
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:17,520
Are you saying that she called you first?

116
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,480
Yes. That's right.

117
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,066
I see.

118
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,163
Oh, my.

119
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:39,000
The busy man has finally showed up.

120
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,751
How are you feeling right now?

121
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,296
That cheerful female doctor

122
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,798
put me under this and that

123
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,342
and I feel much better now.

124
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,094
She's good at what she does.

125
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,263
She'll be my first assistant

126
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,099
when I operate on you.

127
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,142
Is that so?

128
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,228
Then why did someone replace her?

129
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,315
Did I upset her?

130
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:08,279
The truth is that we have a problem
in the hospital, Chairman Shin.

131
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:09,780
What?

132
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,285
Excuse me.

133
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:15,828
May I

134
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,581
go in there as well?

135
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,958
That can't be done.
Please sit tight and wait.

136
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,668
My children are still young.

137
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:25,880
The older one is only in middle school.

138
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:29,050
The people from the health center
will come and take measures.

139
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,343
Please be seated and wait.

140
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,636
Mr. Gu.

141
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,806
Please take a seat and wait.

142
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,773
Do you want this? You must be hungry.

143
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,483
Thank you.

144
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,170
I'm sorry, Su-jeong.

145
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,052
What are her vital signs?

146
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,637
It's around 90.

147
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,347
The body temperature is 35.8 degrees.

148
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,850
It's gotten much better since
the admission, but it's still low.

149
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,311
-Give the patient another blanket.
-Yes, Doctor.

150
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,418
Have the protection suits
still not arrived?

151
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,003
They said they would arrive in 30 minutes.

152
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,574
Excuse me.

153
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,310
You can't be doing this.

154
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,479
Let me go in there.

155
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,065
My children are in there.

156
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,108
Please move aside.

157
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,777
Calm down, sir.

158
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:54,862
Let go of me!

159
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,951
Please move aside.

160
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:04,747
Please let me be with my children.

161
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,624
You can't be doing this, ma'am.

162
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:07,958
There are rules to follow.

163
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:12,421
Please let me be with them.

164
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,259
Let go of me!

165
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,136
I don't want to die here.

166
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,138
I don't want to die here.

167
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,557
Let go of me!

168
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,642
Let go!

169
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,193
Sir.

170
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,071
Nobody's dying here.

171
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,948
Nothing has happened yet.

172
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,367
It hasn't even been confirmed
that the patients have MERS.

173
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,203
Please contain yourself.

174
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,956
And what if it really is MERS?

175
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,291
What are you going to do then?

176
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,960
Then you really shouldn't leave here.

177
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,754
If you run out of this room
without any clear solutions,

178
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,631
you'll put everyone else in danger.

179
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,467
Is that what you want to do?

180
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,766
If you make a scene one more time,

181
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,103
I'll tell your girlfriend
about what you did

182
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,147
the moment she wakes up.

183
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:16,235
You will be ashamed.

184
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:19,655
Dr. Yun.

185
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,074
This patient's blood pressure is dropping.

186
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,661
Su-jeong!

187
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,414
I see.

188
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:33,586
How long does it take
to make a definite diagnosis?

189
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,504
It'll take about 24 hours

190
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,132
before we can make
a preliminary diagnosis.

191
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,802
Tell me when that happens.

192
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,181
Then, I'll leave the hospital

193
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,517
or find a new hospital to be treated in.

194
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,229
Aren't you afraid, Chairman Shin?

195
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,983
Why would I be when I have you?

196
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,319
MERS is

197
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:02,072
not the kind of disease
a general surgeon like me can handle.

198
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,741
It's got a very high fatality rate.

199
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,370
If I was meant to die,

200
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,458
it would have already happened
20 years ago.

201
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,794
The fact that I'm still alive and well

202
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:20,508
must mean that I'm not
meant to die that easily.

203
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,432
MANAGER JANG:
THE PROTECTION SUITS ARE HERE

204
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:29,975
Go on.

205
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,520
-They must be looking for you.
-Yes.

206
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,744
Twenty years ago?

207
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:55,501
When are you going to tell Teacher Kim?

208
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,461
I will tell him after the operation.

209
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,423
Don't say a word until then.

210
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,761
-Do you understand?
-Yes, I understand.

211
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,435
I'm sorry. We got informed too late.

212
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,603
It's okay.

213
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,814
How many protection suits did you bring?

214
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,358
There were 20 of them
at our health center.

215
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,693
We brought them all.

216
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,820
Okay.

217
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,072
Dr. Song.

218
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:32,538
I don't even have an assistant.
How am I supposed to work alone?

219
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:35,374
With Dr. Do treating Chairman Shin,

220
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,210
-I can't operate by myself.
-Don't worry about that.

221
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,087
I'll be the assistant.

222
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,007
-You will?
-That's right.

223
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,679
EMERGENCY ROOM

224
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,400
Open the door, Mr. Park.

225
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:53,619
Dr. Nam.

226
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,329
How did the anesthesia go?

227
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,122
Okay. You can start.

228
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,669
Hey.

229
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,339
-Stop shaking.
-What are you talking about?

230
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,592
Scalpel.

231
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,145
Aren't you going to start?

232
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,778
There you go.

233
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,832
His fever went down a lot.

234
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:41,709
Yes.

235
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,420
Dr. Kang has been working too hard lately.

236
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,755
I guess so.

237
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,801
May I have your attention?

238
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,847
Employees from the public health center
have arrived.

239
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,224
Each one of you will be

240
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,977
taken back home soon.

241
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,645
Even after you go home,

242
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,356
you may not go outside until we have

243
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,734
a definite diagnosis of the symptom.

244
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,235
You will be monitored

245
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,197
by the public health center
until you are off quarantine.

246
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:57,367
We only have one vehicle
from the public health center,

247
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,535
so we will

248
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,496
first take home

249
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,498
the diabetic patient.

250
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:03,957
What about the kids?

251
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,127
We'll take care of this.
Will you stay out of it?

252
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,421
You always have to put kids first

253
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,923
in any emergency situation.

254
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,758
What on earth is this?

255
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,134
A diabetic patient is

256
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,678
the most vulnerable to MERS.

257
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,223
We will send
the diabetic patient home first,

258
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,600
then move on with the children.

259
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,227
I see.

260
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:25,979
In that case,

261
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:27,689
when will I go?

262
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,026
I think you will be

263
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,030
the last person to go home.

264
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,254
You sleep like a baby.

265
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,465
Dong-ju.

266
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:54,151
-Here.
-What?

267
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,446
-Are you disinfecting me?
-Put the mask on.

268
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,739
-Don't take it off.
-Okay.

269
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,453
Mr. Gu, what's going on?

270
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,754
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

271
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:16,465
Teacher Kim!

272
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,551
Teacher Kim!

273
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,220
Teacher Kim!

274
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,096
Teacher Kim!

275
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:24,806
Yes?

276
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,517
We finally have the diagnosis.

277
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,978
-What?
-It was...

278
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:32,856
It was...

279
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,485
It was not MERS!

280
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,363
We are clean, Teacher Kim!

281
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,951
Dr. Song!

282
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,494
Dr. Song!

283
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,164
It wasn't MERS!

284
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,210
We are clean!

285
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,840
Go, Doldam Hospital!

286
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,141
MERS CORONA VIRUS NOT FOUND: NEGATIVE

287
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,518
If it wasn't MERS,

288
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,562
what did that patient have?

289
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,659
Give me the blood test result.

290
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,122
The blood test result.

291
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,873
Oh, yes. Yes.

292
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,334
My gosh. Teacher Kim.

293
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,712
-Is the result out?
-Yes.

294
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,673
Their first diagnosis is negative.

295
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,008
Really?

296
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,343
Thank goodness!

297
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,308
That's a relief.

298
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,060
If it's not MERS, what was it?

299
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,187
That's what I'm trying to find out.

300
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,191
Why is his eosinophil level so high?

301
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,359
Pardon?

302
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,694
Eosinophil level?

303
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,446
Wait, that means...

304
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:14,249
Have you had any raw freshwater food
two to three months ago?

305
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,668
-Freshwater food?
-Yes.

306
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,797
No, we had no raw food.

307
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,384
We don't even eat sashimi.

308
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:26,762
Mom.

309
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,473
What about marinated crabs?

310
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:31,850
Is that cooked?

311
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,226
Marinated crabs?

312
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,104
Were they made with freshwater crabs?

313
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,731
Oh, right.

314
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:40,776
Your mother brought some
because you like those.

315
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,487
It was before
you went on your business trip.

316
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,030
She said those crabs were in season.

317
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,782
When was this?

318
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,076
It was right before my business trip.

319
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,578
It's been about two months.

320
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,954
Why?

321
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,582
Mr. Park, let's examine their sputum.

322
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:58,210
-Their sputum?
-I think they have paragonimiasis.

323
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,920
That's why the eosinophil level
was so high.

324
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,671
PARAGONIMIASIS:
FOOD-BORNE PARASITIC INFECTION

325
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:02,714
I'm an idiot.

326
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,132
Why didn't I catch that?

327
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,717
My gosh.

328
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,888
I can't believe

329
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,516
you made the decision to send her in.

330
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:17,229
If she was unlucky,
she could have missed the operation.

331
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:21,983
I couldn't stop her.

332
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,371
I see.

333
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,838
That's how

334
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:47,008
the MERS turmoil came to an end.

335
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:50,595
It was just a case of paragonimiasis

336
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,098
caused by unfermented marinated crabs.

337
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,142
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

338
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,226
And...

339
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,411
When did you wake up?

340
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:58,538
Just now.

341
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:00,749
Really?

342
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,722
Your fever is gone.

343
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,853
You look better, too.

344
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,649
Are you dizzy?
Or do you have any ear pains?

345
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,032
You had three cases of overworking.

346
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:37,327
Lack of sleep, lack of water,
and lack of nutrition.

347
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,038
Why were you so stubborn?

348
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,457
I can't believe you lived here
for two months.

349
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:47,796
It was you, right?

350
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,256
What was?

351
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,549
You were with me this whole time.

352
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,303
You held my hand.

353
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,975
You must be hungry. I'll get some food.

354
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,145
Right?

355
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,773
You must have dreamt it. No.

356
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,487
-No?
-No.

357
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,530
I don't think so.

358
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,865
Are you sure?

359
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,451
I think so.

360
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:23,748
Really?

361
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,544
What are you doing?

362
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,798
I am checking to see

363
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,550
if you are lying or not.

364
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,887
Look, you just avoided eye contact.

365
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,597
I didn't.

366
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,356
Oh, right.

367
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,943
It was paragonimiasis, not MERS.

368
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,945
I see.

369
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:58,199
Yes. It was because of
the unfermented marinated crab.

370
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,703
So it was paragonimiasis.

371
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,248
It's funny, right?

372
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,625
Yes, it is.

373
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:16,176
Fine. It was me. I was by your side.

374
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,470
Right?

375
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,056
You also held my hand.

376
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:25,727
I was checking if you had fever.

377
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,563
Do you know how much you were burning up?

378
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,148
It went up to 39.8 degrees.

379
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,858
It went as high up as--

380
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,867
What is this?

381
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:42,994
Hey.

382
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,872
I'm dizzy.

383
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,793
Let me stay like this for a while.

384
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:52,170
If you're dizzy, you should eat.

385
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,179
You should eat...

386
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:03,306
I...

387
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,601
lost all my power to resist him.

388
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,820
Darn paragonimiasis.

389
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,288
Ms. Woo?

390
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:12,584
Hello. I'm Woo Yeon-hwa,
and I'll be working as a pay doctor here.

391
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,711
I look forward to working with you.

392
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,881
What's going on, President Yeo?

393
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,133
She used to be a resident
at Gangwon University Hospital.

394
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,137
But I thought your nationality
was Chinese.

395
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,764
I'm an international student.

396
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:26,890
An international student?

397
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,893
You must come from a wealthy background.

398
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,145
My mother is Korean.

399
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:33,313
I see.

400
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:36,649
Then why were you admitted here
looking like a homeless?

401
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,778
I was a medical resident who fled.

402
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,947
You should have told us so.

403
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:46,993
Back then, I didn't want to be
a doctor ever again.

404
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,329
It was too exhausting for me.

405
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:54,000
Why did you change
your mind all of a sudden?

406
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,337
Because of all of you.

407
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,799
When I saw the staff
working at this hospital,

408
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,676
I thought to myself

409
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,262
that I want to become a real doctor.

410
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,806
This is good news.

411
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,725
A familiar face will be joining us.

412
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:11,976
Isn't that right, Teacher Kim?

413
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,646
So, what's your specialty?

414
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,105
It's GS.

415
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,357
GS: GENERAL SURGERY

416
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,359
She even studied general surgery.

417
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:20,735
This is good.

418
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,489
Even foreigners apply for general surgery.

419
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,158
The domestic students
should learn a thing or two.

420
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,494
They all go to dermatology
or plastic surgery for money.

421
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:32,747
They almost never apply
for general or cardiothoracic surgery

422
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,542
This isn't right. Korea is supposed
to be a medical powerhouse.

423
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,835
My goodness.

424
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:37,919
Look.

425
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:42,298
You have a fair point, but it is not
the appropriate time for that.

426
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:43,675
Is that right?

427
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:45,552
I'm sorry.

428
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:49,848
I'll consider myself an intern
and try my absolute best.

429
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,891
I'm looking forward to working with you.

430
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,606
You were a resident?

431
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,233
I'm here as a pay doctor,

432
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:03,069
but think of me as an intern
and boss me around.

433
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:04,445
Is that so?

434
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,657
I like your mindset.

435
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,742
How strong are you?

436
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,870
I'm pretty determined.

437
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,164
You're even determined?

438
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,336
Hello, Doctor.

439
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,338
Hello, Yeon-hwa.

440
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:25,341
She used to be a resident
at Gangwon University Hospital.

441
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,427
On top of that, she was a GS.

442
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,888
Is that right? General surgery?

443
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,057
-Yes.
-This is good news.

444
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,810
Starting today,

445
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,563
I'll give you all kinds
of valuable advice.

446
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:39,898
Yeon-hwa...

447
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,066
Can I call you by your name?

448
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,694
Of course.
You can call me whatever you like.

449
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:45,778
Okay.

450
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:49,032
I'll take good care of you, Yeon-hwa.

451
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,284
-Okay.
-Be careful, Yeon-hwa.

452
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:54,913
Seo-jeong's also known as Crazy Whale.

453
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,041
-You little...
-What? It's true.

454
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,752
Dong-ju. Do you want some pizza?

455
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,795
Where did that come from?

456
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,297
I got it last night.

457
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,132
I just heated it. It's hot.

458
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:09,177
Eat all you want.

459
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,054
From now on, snacks are on me.

460
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,722
I'm serious. 100 percent.

461
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,140
Thank you, Dr. Jeong.

462
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:16,100
Do you want some, Manager Jang?

463
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,269
I'll pass. I'm on a diet.

464
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,104
Come eat, Yeon-hwa.

465
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,316
We should eat while we can or--

466
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,568
We have traffic accident patients.
All are seriously injured.

467
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,362
See that?

468
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,072
This is what happens.

469
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,573
They'll be here in three minutes.

470
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:31,908
Three minutes.

471
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,707
Take your time and unpack your things.

472
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,334
-Okay.
-Until later.

473
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,548
It's good to see you again, Yeon-hwa.

474
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:49,258
Me too.

475
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,554
It's a TA patient.

476
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,973
She's a 35-year-old female driver.

477
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,225
It looks like she smashed her head
into the steering wheel.

478
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,102
Her blood pressure is normal,
but she's vomiting.

479
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,979
She's experiencing a severe headache
and dizziness.

480
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,105
What about her vital signs?

481
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,148
It's 100 over 65, and pulse 120.

482
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,358
It could be hemorrhage.

483
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,485
Execute drops of maxolon,
then I'll do a brain CT on her.

484
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,278
-Yes, Doctor.
-One, two, three.

485
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:13,408
The glass window broke
and got into her skin.

486
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,994
I'll take a look at your arm. Stop crying.

487
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,080
Are you experiencing any other pain?

488
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,165
No. Please get it out.

489
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,335
Pieces of glass could still be in there.
You need to get X-rayed.

490
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,796
-Mr. Park. X-ray scan, please.
-Yes, Doctor.

491
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,509
-What's the status?
-He's experiencing shoulder pain.

492
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,554
-It hurts!
-It's dislocated.

493
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:37,682
Sir, your shoulder seems to be dislocated.
We have to X-ray you.

494
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:38,808
-Get on it, Ms. Eom.
-Okay.

495
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,393
-Please get us a wheelchair.
-Okay.

496
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,116
It's you again.
Please go wait on that bed.

497
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:00,121
Teacher Kim...

498
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,040
Teacher Kim...

499
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,542
My goodness.

500
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,085
Sir.

501
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:07,336
Mr. Gu.

502
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:18,765
Is it a cardiac arrest?

503
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,100
This patient has a pacemaker.

504
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,935
PACEMAKER: ELECTRICAL DEVICE IN HEART

505
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,647
How are his vital signs?

506
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,192
Systolic 60 and 40 beats per minute
with no spontaneous breathing.

507
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,485
What should we do?

508
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,697
Please page Teacher Kim.
I'll start with intubation.

509
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:35,948
Let's move the patient.

510
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,583
What are you still doing
with the Ambu bag?

511
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,418
Get him on the ventilator.

512
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,630
I was about to do that.

513
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:53,966
Ms. Oh.

514
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,094
Mix dopamine with dobutamine

515
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,470
and execute drops of 10cc per hour.

516
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:59,430
Get Isoket ready

517
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,432
and use it when
his blood pressure increases.

518
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,392
Insert a Foley catheter
and check his urine.

519
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,310
Yes, Doctor.

520
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,740
This is the ABGA report.

521
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:21,994
I think you should see the patient.

522
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:24,497
Okay.

523
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,583
This is the ABGA report.

524
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,710
It's a respiratory acidosis.

525
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,837
I'll do echocardiography.

526
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,770
It's DCMP
and ejection fraction is very low.

527
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,523
It's 25 to 30 percent at best.

528
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,484
You said you have done
an ECMO operation, right?

529
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:56,362
-Yes, I have.
-Not you. Hey!

530
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,322
I'm asking you, In-beom.

531
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,075
Yes, I have.

532
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,869
Okay. You'll be the surgeon.

533
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,415
Seo-jeong, you'll be the assistant
and page Dr. Nam.

534
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,000
Ask for the ECMO machine as well.

535
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,251
Yes, Doctor.

536
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,015
What are you doing?

537
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,809
Will you help me?

538
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,436
With what?

539
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,565
What is this?

540
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:36,444
I want to give a Christmas present
to someone whom

541
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,487
I can't give you the name of.

542
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,199
Which one looks better?

543
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:43,367
Christmas gifts?

544
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,952
Isn't it romantic?

545
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,371
Exchanging Christmas gifts

546
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,123
and warm hugs?

547
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:50,833
And...

548
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:58,716
I'm sorry.

549
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,094
If you have

550
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:04,722
a secret crush on someone,

551
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:07,683
why don't you make a move
with a Christmas gift?

552
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,520
No, I'm okay.

553
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,984
Do you think so?

554
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:28,996
Is this better?

555
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,333
This one looks nice.

556
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,923
-Proceed.
-Needle, please.

557
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:51,602
Guide wire.

558
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,276
Scalpel.

559
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,285
Gauze.

560
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,913
Pass me the smallest dilator.

561
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,514
The next one.

562
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,867
I will put in the cannulas.

563
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,501
Are you sure this is the one?

564
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,883
-Sorry?
-I'm asking, is this the correct one?

565
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:09,764
It seems Dr. Do got confused for a moment.

566
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,099
Infusion line has a red label.

567
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,392
I see.

568
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:17,480
I must have gotten confused
because I was focusing.

569
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,735
Stop it.

570
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,322
Dr. Yun, switch places with Dr. Do.

571
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:30,117
-Ms. Oh, assist the operation.
-Yes, Doctor.

572
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,453
Dr. Do.

573
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,414
Follow me.

574
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:47,802
Answer me.

575
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,595
What's the difference between

576
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:51,764
veno-venous and veno-arterial in ECMO?

577
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:54,975
Veno-venous is used
for respiratory failure

578
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,853
while veno-arterial is used
when there is also heart failure.

579
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,939
-What was the operation for?
-It was for veno-arterial.

580
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:02,691
Why do we pull the drain line
to right atrium?

581
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,318
Because when the ECMO flow increases,

582
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,654
there is a possibility of IVC collapse.

583
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:07,780
Why does it matter?

584
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,408
There might not be enough
returning blood to the drain.

585
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,410
You know it that well!

586
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,288
How could you make such a mistake
with cannulas?

587
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,542
You probably thought

588
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:22,962
anyone that knows the technique can do it.

589
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,756
But you clearly overlooked one thing.

590
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,217
ECMO is

591
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,928
not just about inserting cannulas

592
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:32,930
but also about physiology.

593
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,061
You may

594
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:42,148
deceive me with your words,

595
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,361
but you can't deceive me with your hands.

596
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:49,155
A surgeon's hands never lie

597
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:53,951
about his experiences and efforts.

598
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:00,541
You

599
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:04,211
lied about something
that you'd never actually done.

600
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,756
And you attempted
to slip a trick over on me.

601
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,800
I won't ask you

602
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,971
why you had to do all those things.

603
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:16,557
But

604
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,643
do not degrade yourself

605
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,938
by making yourself expendable.

606
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,850
Are you coming from the airport?

607
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,353
Of course I am.
Chairman Shin is in the hospital.

608
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,021
Where is he now?

609
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,814
How is he doing?

610
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:08,192
He's not in this hospital at the moment.

611
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,652
I heard he was hospitalized.

612
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:13,322
He's at Doldam Hospital,
which is a branch in Jeongseon.

613
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:16,742
In fact, that's why
I wanted to meet with you.

614
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,588
What?

615
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:31,840
Is something wrong?

616
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,553
This is what I was concerned
about in the first place.

617
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,221
Don't try to scare me.

618
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,014
Just get to the point.

619
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,562
It seems your artificial heart
has a mechanical problem.

620
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,401
For this situation,

621
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:53,320
we should replace your artificial heart
instead of changing batteries.

622
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:57,700
But this is not an easy operation.

623
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,453
Are you kidding me?

624
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:02,746
How could you let him

625
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,665
have such a risky operation
in a small hospital?

626
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,542
I tried to persuade him,

627
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,253
but he didn't listen to me.

628
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,256
That's why I asked you to come all the way

629
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:13,507
to persuade him.

630
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,635
I know

631
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:18,887
how stubborn he can be.

632
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:22,141
No one can reason him
out of his obstinacy.

633
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,184
So

634
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:27,396
who is his doctor? Is he good?

635
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:29,064
He is Teacher Kim.

636
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,608
Teacher Kim?

637
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,403
I'm not sure if you remember him or not.

638
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,780
He used to work at Geosan Medical Center

639
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,741
under the name, Bu Yong-ju.

640
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,160
Bu Yong-ju?

641
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,581
Are you talking about that lunatic?

642
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,461
What's wrong?

643
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:52,004
Are you getting cold feet?

644
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:54,632
We have to remove your artificial heart

645
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:57,801
and replace it with a new one.

646
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,762
That's a very rare case.

647
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:05,100
We don't even have exact numbers
for the success rate.

648
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:08,604
It means there are only few cases
for the operation.

649
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,856
You should be honored, then.

650
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:13,025
I'm giving you

651
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:16,111
a chance to perform such a rare operation.

652
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,822
Are you not feeling confident?

653
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,492
If it's not that, you should do this.

654
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:23,702
May I ask

655
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:26,747
why you have

656
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,457
absolute confidence in me?

657
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,334
I already gave you my answer.

658
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:35,756
I'm a patient who struggles to survive,

659
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:40,135
and you are a doctor who struggles
to save a person's life.

660
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,472
We are two men of tenacity.

661
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:48,435
That makes the chance
of me surviving go up.

662
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:50,687
Every doctor

663
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:54,358
tries his best to save
a patient's life all the time.

664
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,026
Do you think

665
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,570
they will do the same

666
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:00,989
when billions of money are at stake?

667
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:06,161
-Pardon?
-Cut the chatter. You're doing it.

668
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:09,873
If you're the one who operates on me,

669
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,918
I would at least have no regrets
even if I die.

670
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:23,178
We will do a CT scan on you
tomorrow morning.

671
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:25,514
And we will conduct the examination

672
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:27,683
that's been delayed
because of the MERS incident.

673
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:37,734
In nine days,

674
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,862
we will perform the operation
on Chairman Shin.

675
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:44,241
We will remove his artificial heart

676
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:48,328
and replace it with a new one.

677
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:51,582
-Dr. Kang.
-Yes.

678
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:54,168
You will be removing the batteries
in the abdominal region.

679
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,378
They were transplanted two years ago,

680
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:58,881
so they must be stuck tight
to the fibrous tissues.

681
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:00,966
Once you remove them,

682
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,759
I will begin to remove

683
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:05,762
-the main device right after. Okay?
-Okay.

684
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,514
-Dr. Yun.
-Yes.

685
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,684
You will be the first assistant
as originally planned.

686
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:12,186
It is all about speed.

687
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,438
Make sure to be well prepared.

688
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,106
Yes, Doctor.

689
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:21,111
Dr. Do.

690
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:25,032
You will be Dr. Kang's assistant, okay?

691
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:26,950
Yes, Doctor.

692
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,536
Before the operation,

693
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,206
we will simulate
the procedure three times.

694
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:36,752
I will let you know
as soon as the schedule is fixed.

695
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:39,338
So keep that in mind while you prepare.
That's all.

696
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:43,967
Are you all ready?

697
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,427
-Yes, Teacher Kim.
-Yes, Teacher Kim.

698
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:48,764
Scalpel.

699
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:55,103
Cut open his chest and insert a cannula.

700
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:58,440
Set up the heart-lung machine.
These must be done in three hours.

701
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:01,401
Make an incision
into the abdominal subcutaneous tissue

702
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:02,736
and remove the battery, the TET,

703
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:05,239
and the controller within 45 minutes.

704
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:09,660
Do we have 45 minutes
for both incision and removal?

705
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:11,912
No, it includes the closing the incision.

706
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,998
Don't forget that the patient
is 72 years old.

707
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,584
We need to reduce the surgery time
as much as possible.

708
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,710
I understand.

709
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,045
Change positions.

710
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,756
Remove the existing artificial heart
in two hours.

711
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:26,301
Install the new model in two hours.

712
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:30,889
Stop the bleeding in one hour
and close up the chest in one hour.

713
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:35,352
The total surgery time
is 9 hours and 45 minutes.

714
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,979
That's not good.

715
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:40,274
We have to do it in seven hours

716
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,776
to minimize the damage from the surgery.

717
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,570
First,

718
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:48,282
let's finish setting up
the heart-lung machine in two hours.

719
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:51,952
Let's finish replacing the hearts
30 minutes faster

720
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,537
for each process.

721
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,622
We still have 45 minutes to shorten.

722
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,667
Then, I'll finish my work in 30 minutes.

723
00:47:58,750 --> 00:47:59,960
From making an incision

724
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,421
to removing the battery, the TET,
and the controller,

725
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:03,422
I'll do it in 30 minutes.

726
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:04,756
Seal it up, too.

727
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:08,760
I'll give it a try.

728
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,179
That's not good enough.

729
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,348
-I'll pull it off.
-Okay.

730
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:18,020
We still need to shorten 30 minutes,
Teacher Kim.

731
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,314
Any good ideas?

732
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:23,066
The preparation of the surgery
is going well.

733
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:27,446
It seems that everyone thinks
it will be successful.

734
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,532
I think Chairman Shin believes so, too.

735
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,537
Unexpected changes can happen anytime.

736
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:37,539
By the way,

737
00:48:37,914 --> 00:48:40,167
how much longer do I have work here?

738
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,085
Until I say that it is enough.

739
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:45,672
Until then, swallow the pill.

740
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,382
I'll get in touch soon.

741
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,100
Do not degrade yourself

742
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:00,687
by making yourself expendable.

743
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:04,858
Thank you.

744
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:06,652
Wait.

745
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:09,946
This one is for me,
but the other one is...

746
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,448
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

747
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,117
not for me.

748
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:51,780
What am I doing?

749
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:59,079
Forget it.

750
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,672
Are you leaving now?

751
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:11,216
Yes. I'm a little tired.

752
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:12,843
I'm going home to rest.

753
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:16,304
I see.

754
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,225
I'll get going.

755
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,602
Dr. Yun.

756
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:26,189
There's another package for you.

757
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,275
What is it?

758
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,235
I'm not sure, but it seems to be

759
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:33,739
from someone who wants to spend
Christmas with you.

760
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:36,491
What is this?

761
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:41,621
It's all right.

762
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:18,867
Dong-ju.

763
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:20,952
Can I talk to you for a second?

764
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:31,421
You said she would like it.

765
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:33,423
Most women usually like it.

766
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:35,675
Maybe she's not one of them.

767
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,135
Does she like purses?

768
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,106
What's this?

769
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:53,109
It's my Christmas gift for you.

770
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:58,198
I heard this kind of gift
makes women happy.

771
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,117
Take it back.

772
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,125
Why?

773
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:11,711
Do you not like it?

774
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,839
I don't want to receive it.

775
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:16,049
Take it back.

776
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:26,560
What do you mean

777
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,647
you don't want to receive it?

778
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:34,776
I didn't imply anything by saying that.

779
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,196
I just don't want it.

780
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,954
Do you hate me that much?

781
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,084
As a man...

782
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:55,881
am I not good enough for you?

783
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,634
-It's not like that.
-Then what?

784
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:04,848
How do you

785
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:08,310
really feel about me?

786
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:17,569
I...

787
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:23,992
like you.

788
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:34,419
-Then, why?
-However,

789
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:38,006
the deeper my feelings grow,

790
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:42,010
the more I think of the accident
that happened five years ago.

791
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,556
And that's not right.

792
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:49,392
I shouldn't put the accident

793
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:53,813
before my feelings for you.

794
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:59,444
That's disrespectful to you,

795
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,281
and I feel bad for you.

796
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,410
So...

797
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,875
So, Dong-ju,

798
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,503
-we cannot--
-I wouldn't mind that.

799
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:20,423
There has been

800
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,303
only one thing that I wanted from you.

801
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:28,974
And I just heard

802
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:30,934
the answer I wanted to hear.

803
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:34,479
That's enough for me.

804
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:37,816
As long as you have feelings for me,

805
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:42,028
everything else doesn't matter.

806
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:50,662
So please...

807
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,710
Seo-jeong, please...

808
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:13,768
Can't we be together?

809
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:11,052
