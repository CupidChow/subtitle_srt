00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,552
SAFETY FIRST

3
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,062
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,029
I'm sorry. Please go around.

5
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:14,741
Woo-jin!

6
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,326
Go. I'm sorry.

7
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:17,619
Go.

8
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,131
Hello.

9
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,341
I'm Park Min-gook of Geosan Hospital.

10
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,386
The operation I'm about to perform live

11
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:20,682
is laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy.

12
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,268
This patient is a 56-year-old male.

13
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:26,980
Cancer cells of five centimeters
have been found on his pancreas' head.

14
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,065
In such cases,

15
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,861
we usually conduct an anastomosis
on the cells with a mini-laparotomy.

16
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:37,574
But today, I plan on showing you
a totally laparoscopic operation,

17
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,827
where the entire procedure
is conducted within the abdomen.

18
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,955
Let me introduce my surgical team.

19
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,415
-My gosh.
-Sorry.

20
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,375
Coming through. I'm sorry.

21
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,627
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:50,753
PA Heo Young-kyu.

23
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,255
Goodness, I'm sorry.

24
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,173
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,591
This is Dr. Lee Da-in.

26
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,593
Dr. Sim Hye-jin, anesthesiology.

27
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,013
All right then.
Let us begin the operation.

28
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:01,723
Scalpel.

29
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,230
Wait, please! Wait!

30
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,484
Darn it.

31
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:17,989
Give me my leg back.

32
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,365
What?

33
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,117
Give me my leg back!

34
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,161
Give me my leg.

35
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,621
What'd you do with it?

36
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,916
Now, the dissection of the porta hepatis.

37
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,250
TO CUT

38
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,503
We must be cautious of the variation
of the hepatic artery.

39
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,424
Also, dissecting the lymph node

40
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,176
is an important procedure.

41
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,303
-Suction.
-Suction.

42
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,222
Give me my leg back!

43
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,640
What'd you do with it?

44
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,726
-Give me my leg!
-Smells like ammonia.

45
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,229
Darn it, these flies.

46
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,730
Darn it! Get lost.

47
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,566
-Auditory and visual hallucinations.
-I'll kill you all!

48
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,360
Stop looking at me!

49
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,445
I'll kill you all!

50
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,614
And paranoia?

51
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,575
Once we dissect
the duodenum and the retroperitoneal,

52
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,577
the specimen will be removed en bloc.

53
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,745
IN A UNITED GROUP

54
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,875
Professor Park,
the pancreas is bleeding from the cut.

55
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:12,961
Bipolar bovie.

56
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,841
It doesn't look like massive bleeding.

57
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,510
EXCESSIVE BLEEDING

58
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,721
His BP is dropping.

59
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,563
It's 90 over 60, heart rate is 98.

60
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,987
-Bring more blood.
-Yes, ma'am.

61
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,451
-What's going on?
-Was that a wrong cut?

62
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,120
-He doesn't know the reason.
-Right.

63
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,746
Is there a problem?

64
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,206
Professor Park?

65
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,457
Professor Park.

66
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:21,988
Excuse me.

67
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,158
Excuse me, doctor.

68
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,245
I'm sorry,
but may I borrow your paper and pen?

69
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,040
Oh, sure.

70
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:33,958
Thank you.

71
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,797
Hey, are you a good runner?

72
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:41,799
Pardon?

73
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:45,970
Could you give this to the operating room?

74
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,305
As quick as possible.

75
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:05,490
Go away!

76
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,533
Don't mess with me, you jerks.

77
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:11,996
Hey.

78
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,290
Who said you can take a video of me?

79
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,544
Stop recording, you idiot!

80
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,883
-Let me go, you jerk.
-Sir.

81
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,052
Pull yourself together. What's your name?

82
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,345
Why are you in my room?

83
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,639
Get out. Get out of here!

84
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,890
And he's in confusion.

85
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,141
Give it to me.

86
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,852
Sympathetic nerve acceleration.

87
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,107
Severe jaundice.

88
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,151
And hepatomegaly?

89
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,237
I told you to stop touching me!

90
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,366
Stop messing with me. Come here!

91
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,659
Darn it.

92
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,660
Are you all right?

93
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,245
-Can you report him?
-Stop it!

94
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,204
Darn you!

95
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,123
Hurry up and call the police.

96
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,624
No, not them.

97
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,169
Call 911.

98
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,629
You have to call 911.

99
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:06,384
His BP is still dropping.
He might go into cardiac arrest.

100
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:17,186
Professor.
Someone told me to give this to you.

101
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,777
UNDER OPERATION

102
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,041
Dr. Sim.

103
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,877
Take a listen to the left lung.

104
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,551
Hypophonesis on the left lung.
And the PIP is rising.

105
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,219
There must be tension.

106
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,138
-Gas out.
-Yes, taking gas out.

107
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,141
Get the chest portable.

108
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,727
We have no time.
Get an angiocatheter ready.

109
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,621
Darn it, that was close.

110
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:18,915
What was that?

111
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,708
I'm relieved.

112
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,126
He got it, right?

113
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,591
Excuse me, coming through.

114
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:32,762
Unexpected tension pneumothorax
broke out in the operating room.

115
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,264
Thankfully,
it was detected and treated early on.

116
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,768
To find the reason for the pneumothorax,
we must conduct a laparotomy.

117
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,061
OPEN-ABDOMEN SURGERY

118
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,355
We do not have the setup to do so here,

119
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:45,316
so we'll conclude the demonstration here.

120
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,668
Did you bring the memo?

121
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:05,962
Hello.

122
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,964
I'm Cha Eun-jae, a CS fellow of Geosan.

123
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,966
How'd you know
it was tension pneumothorax?

124
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,593
Was it really pneumothorax?

125
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,805
Then is the patient alive?

126
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:16,722
Not that.

127
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,100
I just asked how you found out.

128
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,393
Right.

129
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,520
It wasn't me.

130
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,231
May I ask

131
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,857
who you are?

132
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:28,943
Have you ever

133
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,445
heard of Doldam Hospital?

134
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,448
I'm a guy who works there.

135
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,827
Doctor Kim.

136
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,617
SONG HYEON-CHEOL

137
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,162
Who? Who's looking for me?

138
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,997
He said his name is Doctor Kim.

139
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,624
He said you would know.

140
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,251
No, I can't. I'm busy.

141
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,712
I told him that already, butâ€¦

142
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,174
Yes, of course he's busy.

143
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,800
It's all right. I'll wait.

144
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,218
Tell him I'm in a meeting.

145
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,263
Say I've been in a meeting all day
without even eating.

146
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,266
Goodness, he didn't even eat?

147
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,934
It's all right with me.

148
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:47,772
Tell him to take his time
and give me a call when it's all over.

149
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,858
Tell him that I'll keep waiting here.

150
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,486
Tell him that
it might go on for a long time.

151
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,905
It's all right.

152
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,907
Don't mind me at all.

153
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,533
I'll just wait here.

154
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,119
Gosh, darn it. This is so annoying.

155
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,042
Does he want to die by my hands?

156
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,295
You jerks! Stop touching me!

157
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:15,216
You still can't bring him in here.

158
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,802
You should take his assault to the police,

159
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,345
-not the ER.
-You jerk.

160
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,263
Stop cursing.

161
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,265
Let me go, you jerks!

162
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,476
I'm sorry,

163
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,646
but there's nothing much we can do
for a guy who's drunk.

164
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:31,232
All we can do is put him on an IV
until he gets sober.

165
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:34,193
Our beds are full
with other emergency patients.

166
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:37,905
He's severely anxious, hallucinating,
and has sympathicotonia.

167
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,241
It seems like delirium tremens.

168
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,910
Are you a doctor or what?

169
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,078
Yes, I'm a GS.

170
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,830
GENERAL SURGEON

171
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,248
You're a GS?

172
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,999
SEO WOO-JIN

173
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,752
-Right. Oh, yes.
-Darn you!

174
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:52,753
Let me go!

175
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:56,424
He has jaundice and hepatomegaly,
so he may have alcoholic liver injury too.

176
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,301
-Check the LFT and the sonogram first.
-Yes, sir.

177
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,346
-How long have you been here?
-I'm a fourth-year resident.

178
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,598
Give him benzo before he has a seizure.

179
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,766
Darn you!

180
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,601
How dare you hold me down.

181
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,646
Give him four milliliters of lorazepam.

182
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,231
Hey.

183
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:13,858
Who is he?

184
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,401
I've never seen him before.

185
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,653
The new GS pay doctor.
He started last week.

186
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,488
His name is Seo Woo-jin.

187
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,491
Don't you remember
the Samjin Hospital case?

188
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:23,826
Right.

189
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,411
Right!

190
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,579
We have a patient!

191
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,790
Male, 65, chest pain.

192
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,959
-Vitals?
-200 over 100, 117 per minute.

193
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,671
He had chest pain for an hour,
and he also feels back pain now.

194
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,089
-His back hurts, too?
-Yes.

195
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,217
Sir, how are you feeling?
Is it as if your back is getting stabbed?

196
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,927
Dr. Yoon, he's having a seizure!

197
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:45,264
Give me his vitals!

198
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,474
Over here!

199
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,394
He just collapsed! Please!

200
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,938
He collapsed after a fight.

201
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,065
He can't even stand because of the pain.

202
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,192
Let me push it a bit.

203
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,736
Does this hurt more?

204
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,821
-We'll put him on that bed.
-Okay.

205
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,908
-You're killing me.
-Dr. Yoon, hurry!

206
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,201
Darn you, jerks!

207
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,661
Doctor, what about this patient?

208
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:08,829
Doctor, please help us.

209
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:09,955
What should we do?

210
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,791
Darn you! Let me go.

211
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,752
Can you call Dr. Lee Myung-hwan first?
Tell him to hurry.

212
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,131
Darn you!

213
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,385
Come on, it's not a lie.

214
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,095
I'm serious.

215
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:28,557
He wrote "pneumothorax," I ran,
and the patient lived.

216
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,060
Thankfully,
Professor Park was able to save face.

217
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,855
He looked absolutely charismatic
in real life.

218
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,857
He has a different presence.

219
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:41,487
How did he know he had pneumothorax
just by looking at the screen?

220
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,072
He did that.

221
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:46,325
The patient's BP was dropping,
and Professor Park had no idea.

222
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:49,912
He was about to lose the patient
in front of 100 people,

223
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,497
but he came and ended it.

224
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,582
Tension pneumothorax. What?

225
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,045
Hey, what are you doing?
That was my money.

226
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,767
Long time no see, Eun-jae.
Have you been well?

227
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,563
Mom, hang up. I'll call you back.

228
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:17,898
What brings you here?

229
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,441
Haven't you heard?

230
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,110
No, I haven't.

231
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,195
I started working here last week.

232
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,156
You went to work for Hyun-jun
as soon as you got licensed.

233
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,994
You followed him to make a fortune. Why?
Why are you here?

234
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,745
You really haven't heard?

235
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,831
No, I really haven't.

236
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,168
Then you should.

237
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:45,634
You didn't know?

238
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,762
He got branded as a whistleblower.

239
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,347
A whistleblower?

240
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:51,807
Woo-jin?

241
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:52,725
Yes.

242
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:53,642
GET LOST

243
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,813
I guess Hyun-jun did some shady stuff
while running his hospital.

244
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,358
He took bribes
from medical device companies,

245
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,110
performed excessive procedures,

246
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,654
and did some ghost surgeries, too.

247
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,655
HYPOCRITE

248
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,782
And Woo-jin reported it to the higher-ups.

249
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:09,909
CRAZY, INSANE

250
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:13,370
-Professor Kim will want you this week.
-Me? No, not me.

251
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,213
After that,

252
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:27,134
all of his colleagues
and everyone he knows boycotted him,

253
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,552
and they made a compact.

254
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,970
It was a huge issue.

255
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,432
They called him human garbage
who betrayed a fellow doctor.

256
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,436
He probably couldn't work
at any hospital after that.

257
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,732
Then how did he return here?

258
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:45,444
Mr. Song apparently brought him
for weekend and night shifts.

259
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,113
We never have enough people in GS.

260
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,366
I see.

261
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,787
Anyway, are you two still a bit iffy?

262
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,539
-What do you mean?
-Come on.

263
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,459
You two have been infamous
since med school.

264
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,378
You two bickered at every chanceâ€¦

265
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,214
What are you looking at?

266
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,465
Shut up!

267
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:07,967
Who knows?

268
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,302
It's you two again?

269
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,096
Anyone else?

270
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,889
Who wants to go to the conference?

271
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,147
-Move.
-No, you move.

272
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,148
Don't be ridiculous!

273
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,358
Do you want to die?

274
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,493
May I see the operation schedule?

275
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,165
SEO WOO-JIN

276
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,837
All five operations are for hemorrhoids?

277
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,339
Yes. That's the schedule for now.

278
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,759
Why? Don't want to do it?

279
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,261
Then don't.

280
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,140
We can manage the operating room
without you anyway.

281
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,769
No, I'm good at hemorrhoidectomies.

282
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,733
You were late again?

283
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,443
Yes, something came up.

284
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,903
I heard you worked as an escort
until recently.

285
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,200
Do you still do that?

286
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,745
Figures.

287
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:21,040
Pouring drinks must be way easier
than doing operations.

288
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,792
If you want, you might make more there.

289
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,005
Do you suddenly want to drink?

290
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,300
-What?
-Looking for a place

291
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,843
with hot girls and discounts?

292
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,304
If you want, I can pour you one, too.

293
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,433
Listen to this jerk.

294
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,728
Don't be brazen.
You didn't do anything great.

295
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,563
I may not have done anything great,

296
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,608
but I didn't do anything wrong either.

297
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:48,901
Because of you,

298
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,321
Hyun-jun closed his hospital
and is about to be homeless.

299
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,116
His house was seized,
and his wife is divorcing him, too.

300
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,620
You ruined your senior's life,
and what now?

301
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,289
"I didn't do anything wrong either"?

302
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,166
Are you kidding me?

303
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,089
Let me know
whenever you need that discount.

304
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,635
Darn it, that jerk.

305
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,486
He got four milliliters of lorazepam?

306
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,571
Yes, I gave it to him as ordered.

307
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,281
Dr. Yoon.

308
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,283
Patient three is at 210 over 110, 120.

309
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,452
-What? Did you call for CS?
-I just did.

310
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,372
-Call again and say it's an emergency.
-Okay.

311
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,667
Doctor, my friend is still in pain.
Why won't you see him?

312
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,377
One second, please. One second.

313
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,713
No news on Dr. Lee yet?

314
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,800
This is the third time,
but he won't pick up.

315
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,718
This is driving me insane.

316
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,347
If someone in the middle won't pick up,
you need to call someone up higher.

317
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,143
Who are you?

318
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,187
DOCTOR KIM

319
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,230
Hey, fourth year.

320
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,483
Give the DT patient
four more milliliters of lorazepam.

321
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,778
Get an EKG for the thoracic patient,
as well as an echo.

322
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,322
And get a sonogram for patient 5.

323
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,367
Who in the world is that?

324
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,411
Nurse Ahn, get the FAST. Now.

325
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:25,789
Hey, fourth year.

326
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,667
Hurry up and get moving.

327
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:29,668
The lorazepam.

328
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,421
Yes, sir.

329
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,923
Chief, you need to come down to the ER.

330
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,843
Yes, it's an emergency.

331
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,438
Going down to the ER?

332
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:55,068
Some crazy guy came to my ER
and is on a rampage.

333
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,237
Some crazy guy?

334
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,655
His name is Bu Yong-ju.

335
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,159
He showed off and got kicked out,
thinking that he's a genius.

336
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,246
Where's the patient?

337
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,706
He went in to take a CT scan.

338
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,667
-You said he had an aortic dissection.
-He had chest pain.

339
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,503
Other than the T-wave inversion,
his EKG was clear.

340
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,464
I didn't see wall motion on the sonogram,

341
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,799
but there was a free flap
in the descending aorta.

342
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,636
I didn't see flaps on the ascending,
but his aorta was loose.

343
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,012
And his BP?

344
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,722
It was initially 210 over 110,

345
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,141
but it dropped to 150 over 80
after he got esmolol.

346
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,226
Esmolol?

347
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,895
I was going to give him labetalolâ€¦

348
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:32,439
butâ€¦

349
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,901
All right, softly.

350
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,363
It's all right.

351
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:41,865
Does that hurt?

352
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,034
I'll be gentle.

353
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,458
What are you doing in my ER?

354
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,711
It's negative on the FAST.

355
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,797
He looks fine on the sonogram,

356
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,549
but his condition isn't looking great.

357
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,511
It looks like bowel perforation,
so call the GS immediately.

358
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,929
Get out of there!

359
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:05,180
It took 30 minutes.

360
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,057
Goodness.

361
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,726
You came down very quickly.

362
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,855
Three emergency patients showed up,

363
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,440
but I didn't see anyone.

364
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,902
I thought you all went out
to take a dump in an emergency.

365
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:23,198
This is obviously
a violation of medical treatment law.

366
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,785
How dare a doctor of a branch
treat a patient in the head hospital.

367
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,080
I didn't treat anyone.

368
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,000
I just conducted some traffic control.

369
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:33,917
What?

370
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,211
Then what choice did I have?

371
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:40,799
A fourth-year resident was running around
with only two interns.

372
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,677
Should I just sit and watch as an adult?

373
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,179
Where in the world is Myung-hwan?

374
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:48,640
I'm right here.

375
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:52,102
Myung-hwan, why weren't you in the ER?
Where have you been?

376
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,731
I'm sorry.
My stomach was upset after lunch.

377
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,360
See? I was right.

378
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,362
He was pooping. He went to poop.

379
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:05,615
Il-joong.

380
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,618
Stay focused, okay?

381
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,663
With a DT, aortic dissection,
and a bowel perforation case,

382
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,248
you had three emergency patients.

383
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:14,666
Goodness,

384
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,835
this so-called specialist

385
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,672
was busy pooping
and wouldn't even show up.

386
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:25,052
Hey, then you should have come down
and stayed at your post.

387
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,721
Does this situation make any sense?

388
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,683
Goodness, you're frustrating.

389
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:33,977
Goodness.

390
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,188
This is frustrating.

391
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,399
Hey, fourth year.

392
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,484
Yes?

393
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,445
Great work.

394
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,948
Oh, yes. Goodbye.

395
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:02,923
Doctor Kim!

396
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:08,637
Hello. I'm Cha Eun-jae,
second-year CS fellow at Geosan Hospital.

397
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:13,266
I'm the Cha Eun-jae who ran
with your memo during the live surgery.

398
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,268
Oh, the runner.

399
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,062
And?

400
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,564
I wanted to ask you something.

401
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:20,565
What is it?

402
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:23,819
How did you know it was pneumothorax?

403
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:29,324
How did you know that by seeing the screen
when the surgeon in charge had no idea?

404
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:34,329
I wanted to know your logic
behind reaching that conclusion at once.

405
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,333
Didn't the ER just call you?

406
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,794
Yes, I was just there.

407
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:43,213
-Did you hear it's a dissection case?
-Yes, I did.

408
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:47,676
Then you must have heard the patient had
a failing ascending aorta as well.

409
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,593
Yes.

410
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:54,433
That means
you know he needs emergency surgery.

411
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,851
You have time to stand here?

412
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,270
I know he's in the CT room right now.

413
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,105
Then you need to do the next part.

414
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,775
Call anesthesiology, get an OR,
and prepare for an OP.

415
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,113
Logic, my foot.

416
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,116
You haven't even done your job.

417
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,952
What kind of complete garbage is this?

418
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,505
What? Complete garbage?

419
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,832
Wait, isn't that oil?

420
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,294
There's an oil leakage.

421
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,339
The bus might catch on fire!
Hurry up and come on out!

422
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:08,465
Hurry!

423
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,594
Goodness.

424
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:20,101
The bus might catch on fire!
Hurry up and come on out!

425
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,980
-Hurry up and come out.
-Hurry up!

426
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,147
You have to come out!

427
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,009
Perfect.

428
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,155
Long time no see.

429
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:40,742
It's you, isn't it?

430
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,452
The guy from Doldam Hospitalâ€¦

431
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:46,122
I'm Head Administrator Jang Gi-tae.
It has been a while, sir.

432
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,167
-Yes, Mr. Jang.
-Yes.

433
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,962
Right.

434
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,426
-Are things the same at Doldam?
-Of course.

435
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,928
Thanks to the foundation,

436
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,848
we've been upgrading
our operation equipment and even the ICU.

437
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,310
I heard the young doctors all quit.

438
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:11,147
It's not that they quit.
They all had unavoidable reasons.

439
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:14,776
The entire world already knows
that Bu Yong-ju is quirky.

440
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,153
-Pardon?
-He looks down on everyone,

441
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,738
thinking he's the best.

442
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,825
There's no young person who can stand him.

443
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,535
Isn't that so?

444
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:24,703
Goodness, sir.

445
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,871
That's far from the case.

446
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,707
Dr. Kang Dong-ju was drafted

447
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,710
to fulfill his mandatory service
on an island.

448
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:35,463
Dr. Yun Seo-jeong is in San Diego
on an exchange program.

449
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,509
As you know, Dr. Do In-beom
returned to Geosan Hospital.

450
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,554
GEOSAN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

451
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,098
Anyhow, I'm sorry for everything.

452
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:49,811
You're called a trauma center,
but you don't even have specialists.

453
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,189
How can you run a hospital like that?

454
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:56,526
Doctor Kim has been doing
100 people's jobs,

455
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,445
so we've been holding out until now.

456
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,114
I see.

457
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,508
Hey, Mr. Jang. You're here.

458
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,969
Gosh, look at you.

459
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,804
Look at this shirt.

460
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:25,930
I got dressed up.

461
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,808
What about Doctor Kim?
He's not here with you?

462
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,478
He went to Seoul
to visit the head hospital.

463
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,729
Is something going on?

464
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,022
Yes, there was.

465
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:37,484
Do you know who I ran into
while I was in the bathroom?

466
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,527
Who did you run into?

467
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,364
It was that man.

468
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:49,579
Goodness.

469
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,333
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

470
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,419
-Chairman Do, you're here.
-Yes.

471
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,757
-Hello.
-Congratulations.

472
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,930
What's with you?
Why are you doing this at our hospital?

473
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,681
No, what's with you?

474
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:12,101
Why do you keep avoiding me
like a slippery loach?

475
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,396
I never avoided you.

476
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,397
Hey.

477
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,818
We were supposed to meet at 10 a.m.
What time is it?

478
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,903
It's 3 p.m.

479
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:24,781
Uncross your legs.

480
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,993
I'm the head of this center.

481
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:32,580
Do you have any idea how busy
the head of the head hospital is?

482
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:37,377
How can you cause so much trouble
because our meeting was pushed back?

483
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,879
The chief of EM is about to lose it.

484
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:45,093
Guys who are bad at their job
tend to lose it the fastest.

485
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,011
Please. Okay?

486
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,557
Please hold your horses.

487
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,601
This is your head hospital,
not Doldam Hospital.

488
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,186
Yes, so?

489
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,313
What happened to my request?

490
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,398
What request?

491
00:30:58,481 --> 00:30:59,399
Hey.

492
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:03,319
I've been asking you for a month
to send us a general surgeon.

493
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,239
We don't have any extra surgeons.

494
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,909
There aren't enough of them here either.

495
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:11,744
Are you sure?

496
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,496
Yes, I'm really sure.

497
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:17,041
And there's no one
who wants to work in the sticks.

498
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,919
And if they go, they won't last under you.

499
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,588
Kids these days are different.

500
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:25,091
They'll go on social media
and talk about how you're a fogey,

501
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:26,593
and you'll be doxxed, too.

502
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:30,263
So, what are you saying?
Are you sure you have no one at all?

503
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,057
Let's do this instead.

504
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:37,061
I'll give you a position here.
You can quit and come here.

505
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,231
There's no more hope for Doldam Hospital.

506
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,775
Those young doctors have left,

507
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,069
and he's the new chairman
of the foundation.

508
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,240
What are you talking about?
Who's the new what?

509
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,493
You really have no idea
who the new chairman is?

510
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,373
Thank you for coming.

511
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,756
I get to see you all again
three years after leaving my post

512
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,342
as the president of Geosan Hospital.

513
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,929
I've been away from my office for a while

514
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,723
due to a few misunderstandings.

515
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,808
But thanks to these directors

516
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,645
who gave me their support and trust,

517
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:21,898
I got to take the chairmanship
of our foundation.

518
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,359
The chairman of the foundation?

519
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:28,196
I'll do my best

520
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:32,450
to not distort or damage
the previous chairman's will.

521
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,536
Please do give me
your support and cooperation.

522
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:36,913
Thank you.

523
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,085
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

524
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:43,836
Congratulations.

525
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,963
-Congrats.
-Thanks.

526
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:52,887
Do Yun-wan.

527
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,974
That man came back
as the foundation's chairman.

528
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,353
He just finished his inauguration speech.

529
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,981
The board of directors welcomed him.

530
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,191
How did it go in Seoul?

531
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,694
Did you find anyone to bring with you?

532
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,028
I don't care what you do.

533
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:12,657
You have to, you must, at any cost,
bring us another general surgeon.

534
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,411
Do you understand, Doctor Kim?

535
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,122
Doctor Kim?

536
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,499
Doctor Kim?

537
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,676
GEOSAN CHAIRMAN SHIN MYEONG-HO

538
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,641
Do Yun-wan won't give up.

539
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:44,147
He's one tenacious man.

540
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:47,608
I'm sorry,

541
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,820
but I won't disappear that easily.

542
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,614
That's how the world is.

543
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:56,826
People talk of justice and uprooting evil,

544
00:33:56,993 --> 00:34:00,204
lifting up their candlesticks
as if they'll change the world now.

545
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,957
But all of that
only lasts for a moment.

546
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,169
If they can't find a way to make a living,

547
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:10,673
they'll soon turn their backs
to curse and throw stones at you.

548
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,008
That's human nature.

549
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,554
It seems like they're all on your side,

550
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:18,973
but no.

551
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:20,683
The world

552
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,518
and peopleâ€¦

553
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,480
don't change that easily.

554
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,691
I'll end up coming back.

555
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:31,569
Just you wait.

556
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,912
Professor Park, you can't let this pass.

557
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,663
This is about our dignity.

558
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,249
This isn't the first time
Woo-jin caused trouble.

559
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:51,214
What do you mean? Please elaborate.

560
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:55,718
We value the dignity of doctors
as much as we value their skills.

561
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:58,304
Is there any trouble
with my dignity as a doctor?

562
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:00,723
I heard you're working part-time
at an odd place.

563
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:04,727
You said it yourself.

564
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,230
That you pour drinks and get tipped.

565
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:11,484
You even tried to solicit us by saying
you'd hook us up with a good place.

566
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,321
There's been a misunderstanding.

567
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,074
There's no need to beat around the bush.

568
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,159
Find another hospital.

569
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,452
You got me hereâ€¦

570
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,039
because you needed a helping hand.

571
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:30,670
You don't have enough surgeons,
but you have piles of surgeries.

572
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,380
You pretended to show me kindness

573
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:36,134
by giving me odd shifts
and all the unpleasant surgeries.

574
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,969
That's why you called me here.

575
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:41,931
So use me in that way.
Stop making excuses about dignity.

576
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,642
Mr. Song may have called you here
for thatâ€¦

577
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:47,728
but not me.

578
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:50,439
You have no dignity as a doctor,

579
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,024
no respect for your seniors,

580
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,985
and you can't work in a team.

581
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,946
A cheapie like you who's only after money

582
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,323
can't work with me.

583
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:01,576
Is thisâ€¦

584
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,787
because of the whistleblowing?

585
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,539
Pack your things and leave today.

586
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,374
I'll let Mr. Song know.

587
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,007
You can look after the emergency patient

588
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:17,967
who's in the OR now.

589
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,821
What? "Complete garbage"?

590
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,617
We've never even met before.

591
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,554
ALPRAZOLAM

592
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,301
What?

593
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,011
You're first today?

594
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,471
Yes, professor.

595
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,181
There's no one else?

596
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,642
No. I'm on duty tonight.

597
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,018
You better stay focused.

598
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,937
If you doze off again,

599
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,314
you'll be banned from my OR for life,
got it?

600
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:56,482
Yes, sir.

601
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,109
Let's begin. Scalpel.

602
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,411
-Left hemicolectomy.
-Will you perform a colostomy?

603
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,496
-No, end-to-end.
-Got it.

604
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,248
Bovie.

605
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,212
Right angle.

606
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,593
Suture.

607
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,521
Cut.

608
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:44,572
We got all the vessels
but can't seem to stop the bleeding.

609
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,829
The diaphragm's torn.

610
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,414
SEPARATES ABDOMEN AND CHEST

611
00:38:58,627 --> 00:38:59,670
Dr. Sim.

612
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,506
I'll have CS join in for the diaphragm.

613
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,052
Just patch it up yourself.
It'll only take more time.

614
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:07,219
It's bleeding.

615
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,096
Call the CS doctor on duty.

616
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,151
Cha Eun-jae.

617
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,194
Hey.

618
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:24,445
Dozing off again?

619
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,280
No, sir.

620
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:30,993
Blow.

621
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,207
Stay awake.

622
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,753
OR 6 is asking for Dr. Cha.

623
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,713
Put them on speaker.

624
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,006
Yes, go ahead.

625
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,592
This is GS fellow Seo Woo-jin.

626
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,136
A 48-year-old male is in surgery

627
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,555
for a large bowel rupture
caused by a blunt injury,

628
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:54,058
but I just found a diaphragm tear.

629
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,476
Can we combine now?

630
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,603
-How are his vitals?
-He's stable.

631
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,064
The CT scan only showed a rib fracture.

632
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,357
Hold on.

633
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,652
Eun-jae. You go.

634
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,571
-Pardon me?
-Stop the bleeding and wrap it up.

635
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,157
I'll finish up here.

636
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:13,744
Hurry up and go.

637
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,247
Okay.

638
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,629
This is insane.

639
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,735
ALPRAZOLAM

640
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,549
Did GS decide not to touch diaphragm?

641
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,217
There's a bit of bleeding.

642
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,392
It ruptured due to the increased pressure
on the abdomen.

643
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,602
FORCE EXERTED ON ORGAN

644
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,105
Can't the GS take care of things
like this?

645
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,608
I'd still prefer to have
the CS do the job.

646
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,026
For the patient's sake.

647
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:29,945
Suture, please.

648
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,155
Scissors.

649
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:43,459
Cut.

650
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:45,961
Cut.

651
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:00,351
What's wrong?

652
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,020
What do you mean?

653
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,064
Cut.

654
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:06,982
Cut.

655
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,079
Hold it properly. It's shaking.

656
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,967
Gosh. Bloodâ€¦

657
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:34,927
Suction.

658
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:43,477
It's not helping.

659
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:45,396
-Tab.
-Tab. Give me a tab.

660
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,614
My gosh.

661
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,909
It's not re-bleeding.
I think it's a pooled clot.

662
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,035
CLUMP OF BLOOD

663
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:07,710
I'm sorry,

664
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,921
but I need to step out for a minuteâ€¦

665
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,506
-My gosh.
-Dr. Cha.

666
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,303
Cha Eun-jae!

667
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:39,950
Goodness.

668
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,831
Let's begin your dissection training.

669
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:49,084
First, we'll show our respect

670
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,837
to those who generously donated
their cadavers

671
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,839
for the development of medicine.

672
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,016
All right.

673
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:07,227
We'll start by removing the sheet.

674
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,239
Attention.

675
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:23,952
What you've learned in class
will be put to the test today.

676
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:27,623
Let's look at the lower leg muscles first.

677
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:30,584
Split into groups of three
and take a leg each.

678
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:35,297
All right. Make the incision
along the inguinal ligament.

679
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:36,382
After that,

680
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:40,094
a lateral incision above the knee
then a vertical one in the middle.

681
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:42,596
After that, open up both sides.

682
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,766
If you get stuck,

683
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:49,353
observe the TA and follow what he does.

684
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:52,523
All right. Begin.

685
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,037
Gosh.

686
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,062
I'm sorry.

687
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:34,898
-Hey!
-Eun-jae, are you okay?

688
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,234
-What happened?
-What's going on?

689
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:38,610
Eun-jae!

690
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:40,362
Eun-jae!

691
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:41,947
Eun-jae!

692
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,497
Hey, are you all right?

693
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,134
Oh, my.

694
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:31,431
What's up with this rain? It's pouring.

695
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:32,933
Is summer back or what?

696
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,898
Do you need a job?

697
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:44,820
Do I know you?

698
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:50,993
Have you heard of Doldam Hospital?

699
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:53,704
It's a small hospital in Jeongseon.

700
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:57,791
They happen to be
looking for a general surgeon.

701
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,543
Would you be interested?

702
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:03,088
Do you know me?

703
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:04,172
Well, I just know

704
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:09,553
that you're a doctor
who got fired from his job today.

705
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,389
Then do you know why I got fired?

706
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:13,974
Well, all I know is thatâ€¦

707
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:19,980
you're an outcast who's being shunned
for being a whistleblower.

708
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,693
And you're offering me a job?

709
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,322
-Why?
-Why not?

710
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,575
I need a general surgeon

711
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:33,744
because we're so behind
our surgery schedule.

712
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:37,915
I'm offering you a job to feign generosity

713
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:41,293
so that I can dump
all the dirty work on you.

714
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:42,377
That's my reason.

715
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,924

716
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,719
DOLDAM HOSPITAL, DOCTOR KIM

717
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:54,973
Oh, dear.

718
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:57,684
I wonder when it'll stop raining.

719
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,103
Gosh, it's cold.

720
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,135
Are you awake?

721
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:33,804
Get up already.

722
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:46,942
Professor.

723
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,444
You see,

724
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:50,904
I've been sleep-deprived

725
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,824
because of all the reading
and the ICU rounds, soâ€¦

726
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:54,950
ALPRAZOLAM

727
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,704
How long have you been taking this?

728
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,497
I don't take this, professor.

729
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,915
I only took calming pills.

730
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:02,916
Eun-jae.

731
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:06,086
Do you want to lose your license?

732
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:13,719
I'm sorry.

733
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,096
I took it because of my nausea.

734
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:17,389
What kind of nausea?

735
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:22,185
Whenever I'm in an operating room,
I hyperventilate and feel nauseated.

736
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:28,942
I just wanted to stabilize my heart rate.
I didn't expect that to happen. Sorry.

737
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:29,943
Gosh.

738
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:33,822
Hey, do you even hear yourself?

739
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:35,574
You're a cardiac surgeon,

740
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:38,201
yet you can't control your nerves
and had to take these?

741
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:41,580
It was my first time taking it.
Please believe me, professor.

742
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,876
This is why I don't like hiring girls.

743
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:51,339
Why are you looking at me like that?

744
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:56,053
My anxiety is a personal issue
that only I have.

745
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:58,513
It has nothing to do with my gender.

746
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:01,183
So? Are you saying you did nothing wrong?

747
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,772
No, professor. I'm sorry.

748
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:10,609
For your punishment,
there are only two options.

749
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:12,778
Either a suspension orâ€¦

750
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:16,615
No, please don't.
Please don't suspend me, professor.

751
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,867
Then I'll have to transfer you.

752
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:19,785
Sorry?

753
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:21,495
Transfer me?

754
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:22,954
To where?

755
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,624
Doldam Hospital in Jeongseon.

756
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:27,667
Doldamâ€¦

757
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:29,628
Doldam Hospital?

758
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:32,631
You haven't even done your job.

759
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,592
What kind of complete garbage is this?

760
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,638
Professor, could there be another option?

761
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:41,807
I'd rather take a pay cut.

762
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,226
I'll work all the night shifts
during the holidays.

763
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:45,352
Could you help me out?

764
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:46,853
Sorry, I can't.

765
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,022
Choose one of the two.

766
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,691
A suspension
or a transfer to Doldam Hospital.

767
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:53,235
The choice is yours.

768
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,240
Gosh.

769
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,409
I'm so doomed.

770
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,382
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

771
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,350

00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:10,812
Let's do this.

00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:35,503
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

OPERATING ROOM

780
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,950
EMERGENCY ROOM

781
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:10,121
When will the construction end?

782
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:14,542
We've been getting complaints
from the wards all morning.

783
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:18,129
They said it'll be done today,

784
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:19,631
so let's hang in there.

785
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:26,179
No!

786
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:28,640
I can't take this anymore.

787
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,272
Excuse me.

788
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:36,982
NO SMOKING

789
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:40,568
Excuse me.

790
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:41,945
Mr. Jang!

791
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,826
Ms. Oh, what's the matter?

792
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:50,912
This was supposed to end last week.
Why isn't it over yet?

793
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,706
Sorry? What did you say?

794
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:55,500
Look at you

795
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:58,086
leisurely reading your book
with these in your ears.

796
00:54:58,169 --> 00:55:02,090
What is the matter with you?
It's autumn. The season of romance.

797
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:03,258
Winter has begun.

798
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:04,467
Romance, my foot.

799
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:07,762
Ms. Oh, why are you so cranky today?

800
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:11,891
Why is construction still ongoing?
It should've ended last week!

801
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,894
They've been drilling the walls
for over a week.

802
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:19,024
If all the nurses
get migraines and fall ill,

803
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,443
will it be considered
an occupational illness?

804
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:24,237
Don't complain to me.

805
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:25,947
Take it up with Doctor Kim.

806
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:28,408
Why him?

807
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:29,534
He kept complaining

808
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:32,454
that it was getting in the way
of his treatments and surgeries

809
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:34,748
and demanded that we put it on hold.

810
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,374
That's why it got so delayed.

811
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:38,793
Don't put the blame on him.

812
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:42,088
I'm just explaining
why we couldn't complete it on time.

813
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:43,381
No wonder

814
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:46,468
young doctors don't want to work here.

815
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,470
The hospital is a mess,

816
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:50,388
and there's all this construction noise.

817
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:54,476
And the head administrator
slacks off all the time!

818
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:55,852
Gosh, Ms. Oh.

819
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:58,938
You call it slacking off?
I'm just enjoying romance.

820
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:00,440
Gosh.

821
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:03,276
Do Yun-wan is back as the chairman.

822
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:06,529
How could you be talking about romance?

823
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:11,159
Ms. Oh.
Two TA patients will arrive in five.

824
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,160
Okay.

825
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:14,871
There's a patient coming in,
so Daddy has to go.

826
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,790
I'll call you back, sweetheart.

827
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,084
Oh, right.

828
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,921
Mr. Jang.
Can you hold on to this for me?

829
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:24,339
Don't eat it.

830
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:38,436
Ms. Oh, let's go.

831
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,730
Dr. Bae? Dr. Bae!

832
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:47,821
Is that Moon-jung?

833
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:52,033
Dr. Bae, give me that.

834
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:52,951
Sorry?

835
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:54,202
Oh, this.

836
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,496
Hold on to this for me.

837
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,753
Finish the construction quickly, please!

838
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:04,879
How long did they take?

839
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:07,674
-Two minutes and 54 seconds.
-Okay.

840
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:10,343
Excuse me.

841
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:12,429
How can I help you?

842
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,520
What condition are they in?

843
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:23,857
They're both TA victims.
One has a nearly amputated left leg.

844
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,108
-Okay.
-And the other one,

845
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:28,194
who was stuck behind the wheel,
has abdominal pain.

846
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:31,030
Dr. Bae and Nurse Park,
you two handle the amputation.

847
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,616
Dr. Jeong and Ms. Oh,

848
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,119
let's treat the one with abdominal pain,
okay?

849
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:37,203
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

850
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:49,382
He was in a traffic accident!

851
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,217
His left leg is nearly amputated.

852
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,344
BP, 100 over 70, heart rate, 130.

853
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:56,431
I think he lost a lot of blood.
There was a lot at the scene.

854
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:57,515
Number two.

855
00:57:58,391 --> 00:57:59,559
Another TA victim!

856
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:03,062
He was stuck behind the wheel,
and he has severe abdominal pain.

857
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,772
-His BP is 80 over 40.
-Number two.

858
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:08,193
Both were stuck inside the car.
It took 40 minutes to get them out.

859
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:10,403
-Over here.
-Bring him over here.

860
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:11,988
Get ready.

861
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:13,698
Get me some saline.

862
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:15,617
Sir, what is your name?

863
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:18,161
Let's do a CBC and an ABO grouping.

864
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:20,413
Check both lines while sampling the blood.

865
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,248
Let's do an ABGA and FAST.

866
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,334
We'll do an ABGA and FAST as well.

867
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:26,753
-We'll need a sonogram, too.
-Got it.

868
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:29,047
-Dr. Jeong, let's open this.
-Yes, sir.

869
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,409
My, that is so cool.

870
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:03,289
Dr. Yoon A-reum?

871
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,959
Eun-jae, I'm surprised to see you here.

872
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:07,835
What are you doing here?

873
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:10,630
I heard they're looking for young doctors.

874
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:14,717
Don't tell me you're here
because you want to work here.

875
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:17,220
I am. I want to work here.

876
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,723
Oh, didn't he come with you?

877
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:22,225
Who?

878
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:24,269
The troublemaker at Samjin Hospital.

879
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:26,729
Dr. Seo Woo-jin.

880
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:29,649
Seo Woo-jin?

881
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:31,985
Why isn't this working?

882
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:33,403
-I'll clean this up.
-Thanks.

883
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:39,659
Take this.

884
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,619
This one. Take it.

885
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,830
This one. Here you go. Take it.

886
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:45,540
You're awful at this game.

887
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:47,083
Gosh.

888
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:02,932
Woo-jin.

889
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:05,935
Even if you hide like this,
we can still find you.

890
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,520
Look up. Look at me.

891
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:11,524
What's wrong with your phone?
Hey. Why didn't you pick up?

892
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,151
It really upsets me.

893
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:14,152
Answer me.

894
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:17,071
You owe us so much money, you punk!

895
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:19,574
Does it hurt? Oh, no.

896
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:22,410
Does it hurt? It hurts me to hurt you.

897
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:23,870
Goodness.

898
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:29,459
Get up.

899
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:35,423
You piece ofâ€¦

900
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:38,426
Hey, Woo-jin.

901
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:40,345
Woo-jin.

902
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:41,971
You littleâ€¦

903
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:45,683
Boss. Let's not waste our energy.

904
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,394
Let's just take a kidney and end this.

905
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:50,980
Get him up.

906
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:53,858
Woo-jin, come on.

907
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:55,360
Get up!

908
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:57,862
Let's go. Get up already!

909
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:04,160
Hey!

910
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,496
-You punk!
-Hey!

911
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:07,413
Hey!

912
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:13,836
Stop right there!

913
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:14,921
Hey!

914
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:21,386
You rat!

915
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,315
-Cut.
-Cut.

916
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:44,158
-Cut.
-Cut.

917
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:58,840
I don't hear any construction noise today.

918
01:01:58,923 --> 01:01:59,757
Yes.

919
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:02,510
-They finished everything an hour ago.
-I see.

920
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:03,428
Does that mean

921
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:06,597
we can work in a state-of-the-art OR
starting tomorrow?

922
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:08,808
Yes, I think so.

923
01:02:10,935 --> 01:02:12,019
-Cut.
-Cut.

924
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:14,439
Okay, we're all done.

925
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:17,984
I'll have Dr. Bae finish up the rest.

926
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:19,485
Yes, sir.

927
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:21,738
Good work, everyone.

928
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:33,291
He looks exhausted.

929
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:34,876
No wonder he's exhausted.

930
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:38,755
He's been covering for three doctors
all by himself for two months.

931
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:42,675
He performed 18 operations
for GS and CS this week alone.

932
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:44,510
-Cut.
-Cut.

933
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:19,796
Nice.

934
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:27,303
No news from the GS
who's supposed to be coming, right?

935
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:29,013
No, he's not here yet.

936
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:30,556
He'll come, right?

937
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,809
I'm not sure. I hope he comes.

938
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:34,852
-Cut.
-Cut.

939
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,243
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

940
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:10,680
The surgery is taking a while.

941
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:12,139
Drink this while you wait.

942
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:14,725
No, thank you.

943
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:16,394
Thank you.

944
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:21,065
Call the admin office
whenever you need anything.

945
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:24,318
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

946
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:28,447
Aren't you hungry?

947
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:33,035
On my way here,
I saw a 24-hour hangover soup place.

948
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:35,079
Shall we eat after the interview?

949
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:38,332
No. I don't like eating meat in soups.

950
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:39,834
I see.

951
01:04:43,337 --> 01:04:44,171
My gosh.

952
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:46,340
Hello, Doctor Kim!

953
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:54,390
Helloâ€¦

954
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:17,914
You asked me if I needed a job.

955
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:19,874
The thing isâ€¦

956
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:22,835
I need money.

957
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:30,843
How much can you offer me?

958
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:33,679
You need moneyâ€¦

959
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:37,183
and that's why you'll work in the OR?

960
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:41,062
That's what it sounds like to me.
Am I right?

961
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:43,272
Yes.

962
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,029
So, if I offer you an enticing amountâ€¦

963
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:52,782
you'll gladly sell yourself?

964
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,492
If you need me, yes.

965
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,036
How much are you willing to pay?

966
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:40,037
Who's here?

967
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:41,288
It's the minister!

968
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:42,748
-Vitals?
-Oxygen saturation?

969
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,083
Just find a pulse.

970
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,710
I'd like to recommend him.

971
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:46,919
What do you think?

972
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,588
What? What are you doing?

973
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:50,715
Get away from me.

974
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:54,427
I bet you still don't know
who brought you to this hospital.

975
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,763
Are you saying
we can do anything to save him?

976
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,265
We must save him.

977
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:01,934
The success rate is low.

978
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:03,436
-BP is dropping.
-Doctor Kim.

979
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:05,688
Is this surgery going to fail?
