1
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,112
A 97 percent success rate of
all operations.

2
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,744
The one and only surgeon
with triple board.

3
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:38,580
His touches bring even
the near dead back to life.

4
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,457
Excuse me, Doctor.

5
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,167
Even the wealthiest people

6
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,793
line up with bags of money

7
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,545
to receive his treatments.

8
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,756
He's the legendary surgeon.

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,386
After he made a name for himself,

10
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,180
he disappeared all of a sudden

11
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,682
and nobody knew of his whereabouts.

12
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,478
That's him, right?

13
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,271
I don't know.

14
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,984
I know I'm right.

15
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,446
-I don't know what you're--
-Teacher Kim's true identity.

16
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,364
He's Dr. Bu Yong-ju.

17
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,200
Isn't he?

18
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,701
Tell me I'm right.

19
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,412
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:23,083
But I simply can't give you
an answer on that matter.

21
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,627
You still have
my letter of resignation, right?

22
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:33,301
-Are you looking for this?
-If Teacher Kim turns out to be

23
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,845
Dr. Bu Yong-ju,

24
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,347
you can shred it.

25
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,932
Does that mean

26
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,476
you'll stay at Doldam Hospital?

27
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,647
Can I assume
that you want to stay, Dr. Kang?

28
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,942
Only if Teacher Kim really is
Dr. Bu Yong-ju.

29
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,204
I wasn't expecting you so early,
President Do.

30
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,414
Did everything go well with Chairman Shin?

31
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:09,671
Is there something wrong?

32
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,049
Did something happen in Jeongseon?

33
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,011
What is it? Did Chairman Shin
give you some bad news?

34
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,888
-It's him.
-Pardon?

35
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:20,932
Bu Yong-ju.

36
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,017
He's back.

37
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,271
He's at Doldam Hospital.

38
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,275
He's been working there.

39
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,653
Times when climbing up
the ladder is all that matters.

40
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,238
Suction!

41
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:38,783
The bleeding won't stop.

42
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,785
-Did you not hear me?
-Okay.

43
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:44,038
People turn their backs on
conscience and even human lives.

44
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,958
Such things aren't taken into calculation.

45
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,629
Bring the defibrillator. Hurry!

46
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:53,965
Charge 360J.

47
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:55,884
Clear.

48
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,762
-Charge 360J.
-Again.

49
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:00,805
Clear.

50
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,435
Doctor.

51
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,020
She's gone.

52
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,479
Darn it.

53
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,822
They justify the sacrifice of others

54
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:21,159
by saying it couldn't be helped.

55
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,328
How could you?

56
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,884
The powerless people

57
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,803
don't want to act against
the will of powerful people.

58
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:44,599
They neglect the truth
with their eyes closed.

59
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,106
All of those people

60
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:56,069
formed a group of vested interests
and are ruling over the world.

61
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,950
Shouldn't we do something about this?

62
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,993
How can Chairman Shin
make a decision like that

63
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,162
when the board decision is coming up?

64
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,875
That operation should not happen
no matter what.

65
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,589
Dr. Kang is down there, right?

66
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,424
What?

67
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,386
Just tell me now.

68
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:23,763
That's him, right?

69
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,974
Dr. Bu Yong-ju.

70
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,352
Right?

71
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,527
I can't say anything.

72
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,112
Seriously, I didn't say anything.

73
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,656
No, you didn't.

74
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,414
You should use Kang Dong-ju.

75
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,749
If he wants to come back here,

76
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,502
he will need to do something.

77
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,587
Don't you think?

78
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:00,842
Yes, sir.

79
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,552
I understand.

80
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:30,932
-What?
-What?

81
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,266
-Orderly?
-Orderly?

82
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,310
Yes, orderly.

83
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:36,521
Are you really going to do that?

84
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,732
I have no choice.
I can't go to another hospital.

85
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,443
I made a mistake,

86
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,113
so I should make up for it.

87
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,699
With patience, endurance,
backbone, and indomitability.

88
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,910
Did you talk to Teacher Kim?

89
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,870
Of course I did.

90
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,541
-Will you do that?
-Yes.

91
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,459
Whatever it is that I have to do,

92
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,670
I'm willing to do it.

93
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,673
-Are you?
-Of course.

94
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:08,177
I will make sure to control
my condition no matter what.

95
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,345
What did he say?

96
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:10,972
He said...

97
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,098
Okay.

98
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,434
You may go now.

99
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:17,895
Unbelievable.

100
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,565
I know. That's too harsh.

101
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:23,901
Teacher Kim is being too harsh to her,
don't you think?

102
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:27,113
I know, right? He is very kind to us.

103
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,532
Maybe I'm on his blacklist.

104
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,075
Are you sure you will be okay?

105
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,785
I should be okay.

106
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,001
Will I be okay?

107
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,669
I've made the right decision, right?

108
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,422
Please say yes.

109
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:46,716
Gosh.

110
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,634
There you are.

111
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,804
I have good news.

112
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,348
The thing is, Dr. Kang Dong-ju,

113
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,602
who passed the board exam
with the highest score in the country,

114
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,563
has decided to stay at Doldam Hospital

115
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,772
after many complications.

116
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,735
It wasn't easy,
but he made a bold decision.

117
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:09,530
Please welcome him with a big hand.

118
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,416
Why is everyone so quiet?

119
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,752
Could anyone explain?

120
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,712
I have to get back to work.

121
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,302
What's wrong with Dr. Yun?

122
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,054
Is something wrong?

123
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,515
Can't you tell just by looking at her?

124
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:39,644
Did Teacher Kim really kick her out?

125
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:40,645
Is that it?

126
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,439
He made an even worse decision.

127
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,816
What is worse than kicking her out?

128
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,652
What would that be?

129
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,035
An orderly?

130
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,579
Are you really going to do that?

131
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,416
There's no reason I can't do it.
I work for the hospital anyway.

132
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,001
I see.

133
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,004
Does that mean I can give you
orders from now on?

134
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,840
Don't even try to boss me around.

135
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,885
What's the matter?
I'm doing it for the hospital.

136
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,722
Why did you suddenly
change your mind, by the way?

137
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:18,933
You said you would quit.

138
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,310
You wanted to go to a better hospital.

139
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,896
Why do you want to stay here
rubbing salt into my wound?

140
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,523
Why is that?

141
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,525
Teacher Kim.

142
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,528
I need to learn more about him.

143
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,950
Excuse me. Don't you remember?

144
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:39,745
Just a few hours ago,
you lashed out at Teacher Kim

145
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,707
in a fit of rage questioning his manner.

146
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,960
You were going to throw up
your job at this lousy hospital.

147
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,878
And now,

148
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:52,008
you want to learn more about him?

149
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,926
Did you just say that?

150
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,637
I was going to quit because
I didn't know who Teacher Kim was.

151
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,392
I heard he is Dr. Bu Yong-ju.

152
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,477
He's the only person in the country

153
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,439
with the triple board and a success rate
of 97 percent in operation.

154
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:09,275
He is a living legend
in the surgeon world.

155
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,569
How did you know that?

156
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,905
I knew it.

157
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:19,076
Everyone knows that Teacher Kim
is Dr. Bu Yong-ju.

158
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,163
You knew it but pretended
not to know the whole time.

159
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,749
So what are you going to do?

160
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,626
It's obvious.

161
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:30,338
I will stay here
and learn from him for a while.

162
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,632
Teacher Kim is not easy to deal with.

163
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,635
He has the most ferocious temper ever.

164
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,928
He's not someone you can just push around.

165
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,849
You said you missed me.

166
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:48,814
If I leave the hospital like this,
I will never be able

167
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,900
to find out why you missed me.

168
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,656
That's another reason.

169
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:03,454
We are in a hospital.
No romance allowed, okay?

170
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,794
Can't we do romance?

171
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,799
You are being ridiculous.

172
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,635
If you have time for romance,
just go take a nap.

173
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,345
Or go eat something.

174
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,347
We can do that together.

175
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,433
We can take a nap
or eat something together.

176
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:29,021
That's romance. What else is?

177
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,618
It's your fault.

178
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,290
What's wrong? Are you okay?

179
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,336
I died because of you.

180
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,755
It's your fault.

181
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,841
I died because of you.

182
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,217
It's your fault.

183
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,511
You killed me.

184
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,477
It's okay. I will get that.

185
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,146
NURSES

186
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,191
The emergency room at Doldam Hospital.

187
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:17,945
How many?

188
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,286
A truck smashed into people
riding bicycles.

189
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,997
It seems to be drowsy driving.
Three people are killed already.

190
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,206
It was a scene of devastation.

191
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,958
It's on the internet already.

192
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:34,170
There are reporters outside the hospital.

193
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,922
They are trying to film everything here.

194
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,551
Prepare warm saline, C-line, E-tube,
and Foley catheters in the hybrid room.

195
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:41,927
Pad splint and fluid, too.

196
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,345
Okay.

197
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,890
There are seven patients here and
four more are on the way.

198
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,017
One of the patients has died
on route to the hospital.

199
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,018
Two have slight wounds.

200
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,438
The other one has hemopneumothorax
in left side with spleen injury.

201
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,565
Lung sounds are diminishing
on the left side.

202
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,859
What about thoracic hemorrhage?

203
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,861
It's about 1,000cc on the left side.

204
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,780
I will put in a chest tube
and move him to the operating room.

205
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,241
Okay. I will begin
the operation immediately.

206
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,243
Can I assist you in the operation?

207
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,331
I'd like to watch your operation.

208
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,708
Didn't you say you would quit?

209
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,918
That's what I heard.

210
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,420
I guess you haven't heard of it.

211
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,340
I decided to stay at Doldam Hospital.

212
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,509
Can I assist you in the operation then?

213
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,889
I need someone to call Dr. Nam.

214
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,767
Someone called me already
and I have just arrived.

215
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,186
It's hemoperitoneum.
Go prepare for an operation.

216
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,854
Of course I will.

217
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,816
Orderly. Just in case,

218
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,319
call Dr. Yang at Jeongil Hospital.

219
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,612
Yes, Doctor.

220
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:42,738
He's in cardiac arrest.

221
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,849
What are you doing, Dr. Kang?

222
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,518
Aren't you putting in a chest tube?

223
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,520
Yes, I'll do that.

224
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:16,981
We have a patient.

225
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,109
What's the problem?

226
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,152
He hurt his right knee and pelvis.

227
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,487
His blood pressure is 90 over 50.

228
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,991
-Does your stomach hurt?
-My pelvis hurts.

229
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,492
Mr. Park.

230
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:46,760
Doctor!

231
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,055
EMERGENCY ROOM

232
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,854
Excuse me, make way, please.

233
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,747
Did I

234
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,665
do this?

235
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,587
How could this be?

236
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,967
No way.

237
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,469
Did I really...

238
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,024
Are you okay?

239
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,359
Are you okay?

240
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,069
We're ready.

241
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,490
Step aside.

242
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,325
Clear!

243
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,503
Let's see.

244
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,588
One more time. Charge 200J.

245
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,006
We're ready.

246
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,010
Ready, clear!

247
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,179
Nothing.

248
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,893
We have four more patients, Teacher Kim.

249
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:18,978
Two have minor injuries,

250
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,480
and one fractured his collarbone,
but his vitals are stable.

251
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,732
The other one has pelvis pain.

252
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,901
It looks like
he fractured his pelvic bone.

253
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,284
Teacher Kim.

254
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,830
Teacher Kim.

255
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,897
Time of death...

256
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,360
is 3:26 p.m.

257
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:20,831
What's his case?

258
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,667
He has pelvis pain.
I think his pelvic bone is fractured.

259
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:24,877
Give me some sheets.

260
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,349
Hey, you.

261
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:41,685
It's you, right?

262
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,520
You're the driver.

263
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,023
You are.

264
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,108
Why are you here?

265
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,237
How dare you be here?

266
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,197
You jerk!

267
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,782
Sir, please.

268
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,241
-Calm down.
-You jerk!

269
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,367
You're not even a human.

270
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,911
You're just a murderer.

271
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,537
-Sir.
-Let go of me!

272
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,914
Just let go of me!

273
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,875
-Calm down!
-Catch that murderer!

274
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,543
-Let go of me!
-Who is he?

275
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,170
He's the driver.

276
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,340
He hit his chest on the steering wheel,
but it's nothing serious.

277
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,008
I told them over and over

278
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,427
not to bring the driver and
the victim to the same hospital.

279
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,304
Check his vital signs

280
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,015
-and take an X-ray.
-Yes, Teacher Kim.

281
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,934
To the X-ray room.

282
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,228
Officers.

283
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,395
This is the murderer.

284
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,107
He's the guy who killed all of my friends.

285
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,900
Sir, how do you feel?

286
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:33,112
You don't need to treat someone like him.

287
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,073
Just let him die!

288
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,492
I think I hit my chest.

289
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,828
But I can't remember clearly.

290
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,329
Don't you remember?

291
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:46,125
You killed so many people.
Why don't you remember?

292
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,002
How dare you call yourself a human being?

293
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,170
Lie him down.

294
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,756
Be careful.

295
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,550
What were his vitals?

296
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,593
They were 100 over 70 at first,
and pulse rate 95.

297
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:57,803
What about now?

298
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,347
They are 80 over 40, and pulse rate 120.

299
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,392
This is a murderer.

300
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,602
Do not revive him!

301
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,688
Please get him out of here.

302
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,940
Let go of me. I'm hurt!

303
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,108
That jerk killed my friends!

304
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,110
I'm going to sue you all!

305
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,156
The patient with fractured pelvic bone
is at the X-ray room now.

306
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,994
-What does this look like?
-Pardon?

307
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,666
His cardiac sound is dropping.

308
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,169
His jugular veins are swelling
and his blood pressure is dropping.

309
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,212
That's Beck's triad.

310
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,006
BECKS TRIAD: 3 SIGNS
FOR ACUTE CARDIAC TAMPONADE

311
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,507
Could it be cardiac tamponade?

312
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,759
CARDIAC TAMPONADE: FLUID AROUND THE HEART
CAUSING COMPRESSION

313
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:42,014
But cardiac tamponade is
rarely caused by a blunt injury.

314
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,350
Yes, it is rare.

315
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:49,688
There is only one thousandth
of a percent of this case.

316
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,983
But does a doctor rule out such a case

317
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,527
just because it's rarely seen?

318
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,863
I'm sorry.

319
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,115
I didn't think far enough.

320
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,117
I expected you to not think that far.

321
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,577
You're just an orderly.

322
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,290
Get him ready for a surgery.

323
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,710
And find out if someone got
a hold of Dr. Yang or not.

324
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,337
An orderly

325
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,381
will perform only the tasks
right for an orderly.

326
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,221
Yes, Teacher Kim.

327
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,979
Kang Dong-ju, you idiot!

328
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,148
You are doomed.

329
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,026
Hello? This is Kang Dong-ju.

330
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:39,571
-Where are you?
-At Doldam Hospital. Where else?

331
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,531
It's a Saturday afternoon.
Are you still at work?

332
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,824
Exactly.

333
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,953
This hospital is so lousy
that it keeps around

334
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,121
someone who was
on a night shift last night

335
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,998
until late afternoon today.

336
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,126
We need to meet. When are you free?

337
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,505
I'm sorry. I got a surgery now.

338
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,464
What?

339
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:01,635
Sir, did you know this, too?

340
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:04,972
There is a very famous surgeon
here at Doldam Hospital.

341
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,933
Did you...

342
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,601
meet him?

343
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:12,729
Of course. That's why I want to thank you.

344
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,357
Thank me? What do you mean?

345
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,194
You led me to a great teacher.

346
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:20,821
I'll return

347
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:24,116
after learning everything from him. Bye.

348
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,452
-What about the surgery?
-We're ready.

349
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,002
What?

350
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:36,878
A teacher?

351
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,716
Darn it!

352
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,928
Pardon? Me?

353
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,722
Why not?

354
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,682
What about you?

355
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,103
Sir, Dr. Yang just got here.

356
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,938
The patient will be
anesthetized in five minutes.

357
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,398
This is a cardiac tamponade case.

358
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,066
I'll take his heart.

359
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,484
You take care of the hemoperitoneum.

360
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,320
Yes, Teacher Kim.

361
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:02,738
Hey.

362
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,198
Don't fall asleep.

363
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,996
Don't fall asleep, okay?

364
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,022
Let's begin.

365
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,648
Let's begin.

366
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,692
-Scalpel.
-Scalpel.

367
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,741
C.S.C?

368
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,077
What does this mean?

369
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,038
They were members of
Cancer Survivors Club, C.S.C.

370
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,791
Does that mean all of the members here

371
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,375
have a history of cancer?

372
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,585
That's correct.

373
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,921
What about the one in the surgery room?

374
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:04,299
Do you know if he has a history of cancer?

375
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,009
I'm not sure.

376
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:07,677
It was his liver.

377
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,555
Liver cancer.

378
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,474
He even went through chemotherapy

379
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,143
and he finally got better.

380
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,064
Liver cancer?

381
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,315
Long forceps.

382
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,651
Scalpel.

383
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:26,863
Metzenbaum.

384
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:31,827
Suction.

385
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,664
Everything is good so far.

386
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,582
Retractor.

387
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:42,212
Pad.

388
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,548
Pass me more.

389
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:47,509
Sternal saw.

390
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,523
Spreader.

391
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,612
Scalpel.

392
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:11,408
Suction.

393
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,002
That's the point of bleeding.

394
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,588
Thankfully, none of
his major vessels are damaged.

395
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,339
Let's stitch him up.

396
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,382
Suture.

397
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,108
-Cut.
-Cutting.

398
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,238
Focus.

399
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:51,990
Yes, Teacher Kim.

400
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:58,747
Pick up the phone.

401
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,373
-Teacher Kim.
-Yes?

402
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:02,459
There's Mr. Jang at the door.

403
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,629
It's an emergency. Hurry.

404
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,383
-Cut.
-Cutting.

405
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:13,929
You're going to make me
come in there, aren't you?

406
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,684
Why don't you pick up the phone?

407
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:23,021
You know I don't do that
during operations.

408
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:25,232
It's an emergency.

409
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:28,485
The patient in the other room
has a history of liver cancer.

410
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,363
-So what? Cut.
-Cutting.

411
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,823
Dr. Kang was kicked out of
Geosan Medical Center

412
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,743
after operating on a liver cancer patient.

413
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:47,003
What's this?

414
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:48,964
It's bleeding.

415
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,757
-Where is the bleeding coming from?
-Is it...

416
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,427
ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma?

417
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:57,722
Wake up, Dr. Kang.
You have to stop the bleeding.

418
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,768
Suction.

419
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,315
There's bleeding in thoracic cavity, too.

420
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,526
It could result in DIC.

421
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:12,612
DIC:
DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION

422
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,616
Suction. Bovie.

423
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,035
The patient died from excessive bleeding
during an operation.

424
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,719
What's going on, Dr. Kang?

425
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,971
You're in the middle of operation.

426
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,639
I can't.

427
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,518
-I can't stop the bleeding.
-The bleeding won't stop.

428
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,229
Get it together, Dr. Kang.

429
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,816
You're the only one who can
save this patient.

430
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:55,989
Dr. Kang!

431
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,952
Get yourself together, Kang Dong-ju.

432
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,128
Listen to me carefully.

433
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,547
That patient lying down there

434
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,050
made a full recovery
from liver cancer five years ago.

435
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,969
I think there's been a recurrence.

436
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,764
It's ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma.

437
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,432
He's bleeding too much.

438
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,726
And there's even bleeding
from the thoracic cavity.

439
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:28,021
I think DIC is taking place.

440
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:30,523
Dr. Nam. How is the bleeding?

441
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,776
It can be under observation
for a little longer.

442
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,069
Okay.

443
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,863
Dr. Kang. Are you listening?

444
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,618
You're calling the shots
on that operation.

445
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,788
If your decision is to give up
and call it done,

446
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,539
nobody's going to blame you.

447
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,958
But if you do so,

448
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,752
you'll look back on that moment

449
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,879
for the rest of your life.

450
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,176
I'm sorry.

451
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,930
I don't feel confident enough
to save this patient.

452
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:03,932
Dr. Kang.

453
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,394
Do you know what's worse
than death on the operating table?

454
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:11,523
It's the regret you get

455
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:15,402
thinking you might have been able to
save the patient by not giving up.

456
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,737
That thought will haunt you
for the rest of your life.

457
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:24,661
If there's something worse
than failure, it's regret.

458
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:25,662
What do you say?

459
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:32,585
I'm sorry. I really can't.

460
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,012
You really can't do it?

461
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,141
I'm sorry.

462
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,685
I'm sorry.

463
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:55,692
Close it up, then.

464
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,154
Teacher Kim.

465
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,781
If you don't think you can do it,

466
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,659
close him up before
making him suffer even more.

467
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,705
Like I said, you're the one
calling the shots.

468
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:09,914
Do as you wish.

469
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,755
Hang up now.

470
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,258
Cut.

471
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,721
Hello? Hello? Teacher Kim.

472
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,640
How can you hang up like that?

473
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:33,563
Cut.

474
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,234
Come on. Don't be like that.

475
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,573
Mr. Park. Switch with me.

476
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,287
Dr. Kang.

477
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,666
I've been through
harder operations than this

478
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,709
with Teacher Kim.

479
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,756
There were patients who died on us,

480
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,841
but they tend to hang in there longer

481
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:04,886
if we don't give up until the end.

482
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,807
The patient's not
in the worst condition yet.

483
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,185
He's still hanging in there.
What should we do, Dr. Kang?

484
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,728
Do we give up now?

485
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,821
This is your operation.

486
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,073
We will follow your order.

487
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,000
Suction.

488
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,023
Are you going to close him up?

489
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,608
-Or...
-No.

490
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,778
Let's start the left hemihepatectomy.

491
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,780
LEFT HEPATECTOMY: LEFT LIVER RESECTION

492
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,701
We have plenty of blood left. Don't worry.

493
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,745
Dr. Kang. Let's try everything we can do.

494
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,788
Suction.

495
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:15,623
Suction.

496
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,003
Hemostatic.

497
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,050
Vascular clamps.

498
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,429
Suture.

499
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:45,695
Dr. Kang is back on the operation.

500
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,197
Do you think Dr. Kang can--

501
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,033
-Cut.
-Cutting.

502
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,872
The heart operation is done.

503
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,415
You should finish up.

504
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,459
I know you're just an orderly,
but you can do it, right?

505
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:02,003
What? Yes, of course.

506
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,632
Don't leave a needle in there.

507
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:07,550
Of course.

508
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,179
Where are you going?

509
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,432
Teacher Kim.

510
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,267
Put pressure on there.

511
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:20,980
Nice timing.

512
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,943
Are you still struggling
with the bleeding?

513
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,069
I was on it.

514
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,947
It's not too late
for me to step in if you want.

515
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,114
I'm on it.

516
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:31,866
Bovie.

517
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:33,534
Pad.

518
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,209
Irrigation.

519
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,212
Suction.

520
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,841
Tying the left hepatic artery
and the portal vein.

521
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,343
Hemostatic.

522
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:54,722
Suture.

523
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:07,735
Cut.

524
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,368
Commencing lobectomy.

525
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,786
Bovie.

526
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,789
The bleeding is starting again.

527
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,502
There's nothing wrong with
the tied blood vessels.

528
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:25,670
What about the hepatic vein?

529
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,422
I'm going to commence
resection and ligation.

530
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:30,216
Stopping the inflow is enough to
stop the bleeding. Isn't it?

531
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,384
No.

532
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,762
There could be a case of back flow
from the veins.

533
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:35,847
What do you do then?

534
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,891
You have to block the hepatic vein first.

535
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,145
-Right.
-Hemostatic.

536
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:45,898
Hold on to that.

537
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:47,817
Suture.

538
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,069
Suction.

539
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,369
Cut.

540
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,122
Irrigation.

541
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,168
Suction.

542
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,170
Pad.

543
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,887
I think I can control the bleeding.

544
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:21,934
How does it look, Dr. Nam?

545
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,436
Vitals are 90 over 50.

546
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,563
Heart rate is becoming more stable.

547
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:27,857
Okay.

548
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:33,863
What are you waiting for?

549
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,365
You need to do recession.

550
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:37,992
Okay.

551
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,046
-I'll be there soon.
-Okay.

552
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,214
How did it go?

553
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:56,177
It was such a touching moment.

554
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,263
I guess Dr. Kang did well.

555
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,140
It was incredible.

556
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:04,519
Him and Teacher Kim stopping
the patient from bleeding was

557
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,145
like a scene from a movie.

558
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:08,898
I knew he had to be good
when I heard he was

559
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,358
the top of his class.

560
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,110
Right?

561
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,177
What?

562
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:39,887
Jeongseon?

563
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,347
Tonight, sir?

564
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:42,598
Yes.

565
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,600
Aren't you friends with Dong-ju?

566
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,103
We'll go and have a drink with him.

567
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:49,480
-Make him come out.
-But sir.

568
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,107
It's finally my day off today.

569
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,569
I promised my family
that we'd go to an aquarium together.

570
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:55,945
So what?

571
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,614
I guess I'll have to push it back.

572
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,659
I'll come along. Let me call my wife.

573
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,077
May I join you?

574
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,165
Do you want to come?

575
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,083
Are you friends with Dong-ju as well?

576
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:12,044
-We went to school together.
-Really?

577
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:14,839
That's great. The more, the merrier.

578
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:17,967
-I'll see you in 30 minutes.
-Yes, Doctor.

579
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:20,887
Hey, this is between
doctors in your department.

580
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,389
Stop dragging me into this.

581
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,392
Don't you think
he's overstepping his authority?

582
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:30,021
I thought that Crazy Whale is
also at that hospital.

583
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,564
You wanted to meet her.

584
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,317
Seo-jeong. You're right.

585
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,490
Hello, I am Lee Jun-hui,
a reporter of SBN.

586
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:45,244
Could you tell us about the accident
and the patients in detail?

587
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:48,873
The staff at Doldam Hospital are--

588
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:52,335
Could you first tell us the number
of the deceased and injured?

589
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,337
I am getting to it.

590
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:57,715
The staff at Doldam Hospital are

591
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,092
made up of very excellent doctors.

592
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:03,095
Our new surgeon is
a very talented young man

593
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:07,266
who passed his board exam
with the highest score.

594
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,392
He is a great addition...

595
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,537
What were you going to do

596
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,748
if I had given up?

597
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,130
What if I really gave up

598
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:42,093
-and stitched him back up?
-Nothing.

599
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,178
I wasn't going to do anything.

600
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:45,930
Nothing?

601
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:49,392
It's not my responsibility
that you gave up and killed him.

602
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:53,229
You're the one who will live your life

603
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,690
filled with guilt and regrets.

604
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,233
Excuse me.

605
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,320
I really don't get it.

606
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:05,324
May I ask you why you wanted to keep me

607
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,451
in this hospital?

608
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:11,080
-Why would I want to keep you?
-Then why did you say that?

609
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,207
Unless you change,

610
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,711
nothing will change. Understand?

611
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,380
You knew I'd figure it out
once I heard that.

612
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:23,134
You knew I wouldn't leave
once I figured it out, too.

613
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,761
Didn't you expect that?

614
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,513
Is that why

615
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,016
you've been acting like a fool?

616
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:31,809
A fool?

617
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,020
Hey.

618
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,856
Why didn't you run a CT scan on him?

619
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,941
If you had done that,

620
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,485
you would've been able to notice
the ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma.

621
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,364
I thought he may die if I didn't hurry--

622
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:48,034
Even so, how could you not check
his medical history

623
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,118
before the surgery?

624
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,453
His stomach was swelling up.

625
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:53,289
I thought he would go into
a cardiac arrest if I didn't hurry.

626
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:57,293
I did make a mistake
by not checking his history.

627
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,211
But it was an emergency.

628
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:02,298
I thought stopping his bleeding
was the most important thing to do.

629
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,342
That's what I do.

630
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,260
That's not your style.

631
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:10,181
Hey, I thought you were
a man of principle.

632
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:11,974
Principles

633
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:15,644
never change under any circumstances.

634
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:19,732
Changing your words
according to people and circumstances

635
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,984
can't be a principle.
It's merely an excuse.

636
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,153
I was just being flexible.

637
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,532
Are you sure you didn't go out of your way

638
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,159
and almost ended up killing a patient?

639
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,705
You're making too many assumptions
for a single mistake.

640
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,624
Stop making excuses.

641
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,418
Your single mistake almost killed someone.

642
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,671
It's up to you

643
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,590
to stay or leave. Do what you'd like.

644
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:49,178
However, if you are
expecting something from me,

645
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:50,805
you should stop dreaming.

646
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,265
To a guy

647
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,227
who bends his principles
according to the situation,

648
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,937
I have nothing else to give

649
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,981
other than ignoring, mocking,
despising, and swearing at you.

650
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,025
See?

651
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,278
I told you about his temper.

652
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,697
I told you he wasn't going to be easy.

653
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:57,788
But you know what?

654
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,002
I kind of envy you.

655
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:08,299
You did something I've been wanting to do

656
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,385
for the last five years.

657
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,889
You did a combined operation
with Teacher Kim.

658
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,393
It wasn't a combined operation.
He took over.

659
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,145
Also, he made sure

660
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,522
you knew about your mistakes.

661
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,941
He didn't make sure. He just degraded me.

662
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,612
I wish I could be degraded like that.

663
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:34,492
It's better to be degraded

664
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,495
than to be ignored.

665
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:41,874
I am sure

666
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,959
that he has a personality disorder.

667
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:46,629
Either that, or he's a sadist
who enjoys torturing others.

668
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,090
Or it might be because of
his hurtful history.

669
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,012
There must be a reason

670
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,724
when such a great doctor
casts away his name

671
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:03,812
and stays here in hiding.
Don't you think so?

672
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,005
You idiot.

673
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,551
Who told you to perform that operation?

674
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,386
You jerk, answer me.

675
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:36,554
Who is it?

676
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:39,181
-Who told you to do that?
-Doctor, please.

677
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,892
-Let go of me!
-Doctor.

678
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,394
-Get him.
-Let go!

679
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,145
Okay, I'll calm down. Let go.

680
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,522
You idiot!

681
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:48,691
-Doctor, please.
-I'll get you.

682
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:49,858
Doctor.

683
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,820
Let go!

684
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,738
Let go of me!

685
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:57,324
Let go. Was it you?

686
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,743
Did you let him

687
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,620
perform that operation?

688
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:02,955
What are you talking about?

689
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:04,873
You killed the patient.

690
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:09,712
-What?
-You are the one

691
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,463
who was in that operation room

692
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:12,923
and operated on her.

693
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,301
That's what the record will say.

694
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:16,844
Our staff members

695
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,305
will testify the same way, too.

696
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,598
Dr. Bu.

697
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,726
Among the people
who know about that surgery,

698
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,437
no one will take your side.

699
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,364
This is why

700
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,868
you should have been tamed

701
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:44,121
while we still liked you.

702
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,124
How dare you lift your head
and bark at us?

703
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,793
Who do you think made you who you are?

704
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:52,588
You should

705
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,506
kneel down and apologize.

706
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,593
-If so, I can--
-Jang Hyeon-ju.

707
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,473
All she wanted to do was

708
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,391
hold a scalpel in an operation room

709
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,811
while listening to Madonna's music.

710
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,522
Jang Hyeon-ju,
a third-year at her medical school.

711
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,735
If you treated her with medicine

712
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,738
in Internal Medicine Department,

713
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:21,116
she would have lived her dream.

714
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:27,039
She wasn't supposed to die
because of someone like you.

715
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,963
You are the one

716
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:38,050
who has to kneel down
and apologize to her mom.

717
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,598
You can no longer
work at Geosan Medical Center.

718
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,768
Not just this hospital,
no other hospital in Korea.

719
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,854
No hospital will hire you.

720
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,107
I'll make sure

721
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,984
that you're thrown out of the industry!

722
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:58,612
I will!

723
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:01,949
I will!

724
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,774
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

725
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,651
I think we're here.

726
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:39,862
Is this Doldam Hospital?

727
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:42,781
It really looks lousy.

728
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:45,033
-Call him.
-Pardon?

729
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:48,495
-I said, call Dong-ju.
-Okay.

730
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,132
Should I wake him up?

731
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,968
He was on call last night
and carried out a surgery today.

732
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:04,178
He must be exhausted.

733
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,223
He needs to get some sleep. Let him be.

734
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,308
Yes, Ms. Oh.

735
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,937
-He's not answering.
-Really?

736
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,856
-Is it turned off?
-No. He's just not answering it.

737
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:16,982
The person you have dialed...

738
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:19,735
It's Saturday afternoon.
Could he be in the hospital?

739
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:22,196
He must be. He said he was
going to do a surgery.

740
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,114
Then, I guess he's still in a surgery.

741
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,073
Hey.

742
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,326
Think before you speak.

743
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:30,662
Do you think it's possible to do
a major surgery in that hospital?

744
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,623
I think it's impossible.

745
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,875
I'll go in and find him.

746
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,001
Would you?

747
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:46,762
I'll go help him.

748
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,269
Are you hurt?

749
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:57,314
I could've been.
How could you be so careless?

750
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:02,569
-Are you a pianist?
-I'm a doctor.

751
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:04,988
Are you a surgeon?

752
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,577
Aren't you going to apologize?

753
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,496
You said you're not hurt.

754
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,248
I could have been.

755
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,542
Then you should be more careful.

756
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,967
What's wrong? Did something happen?

757
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:26,593
It was nothing.

758
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:28,887
-What a jerk.
-Jerk?

759
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:31,723
In-beom, wait up.

760
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:48,699
President Do, it's me.

761
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:51,410
I'm at Jeongseon right now.

762
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:53,245
Bu Yong-ju is here.

763
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,789
I just saw him.

764
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:01,169
That little rat.

765
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,422
That little rat.

766
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,382
He even changed his name

767
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,593
to hide in such a place like this.

768
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:22,983
Mr. Jang.

769
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,819
You're tired, aren't you?

770
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,654
Why wouldn't you be?

771
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:30,824
Please drink this for your fatigue.

772
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:33,535
I'm good.

773
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:36,038
-I don't like it.
-I see.

774
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,291
You have a visitor.

775
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:41,918
Maybe because it's surrounded
by mountains, it's very dry here.

776
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,003
That's true.

777
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,713
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

778
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,175
-In-su.
-Dong-ju.

779
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:49,885
Dong-ju!

780
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:53,180
What are you doing here?

781
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,599
Obviously, I'm here to see you.

782
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:58,393
It hasn't even been a week since you left.

783
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:00,687
It feels like a year passed.

784
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:02,648
Are you really here to see me?

785
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,775
Of course, I am.

786
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,110
In-beom is here, too.

787
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:09,738
Do In-beom is here?

788
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:15,827
What brings you here?

789
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,748
I didn't know you were here.

790
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,667
I asked you why you're here.

791
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:25,045
I'm here to see...

792
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,214
Dong-ju.

793
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:28,924
I adore him.

794
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:31,802
Then why did you send him
to a hospital in the countryside?

795
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:33,595
You should have helped him
stay at your hospital.

796
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,347
You know how President Do

797
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,349
shifts responsibility to other doctors.

798
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:39,226
Hey.

799
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:44,398
Are you still living like that?

800
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,150
What's wrong with you?

801
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,945
I'm the chief surgeon now.

802
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,030
I have a high social status.

803
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:54,074
Don't look down on me.

804
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,702
If you have a high social status,

805
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:59,663
why were you crouching
in the back seat to hide yourself?

806
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,123
It was because of my back pain.

807
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,751
I crouched because my back hurt.

808
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,212
Weren't you just afraid to see me
because of what you did?

809
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:10,090
Please be careful of what you say.

810
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,844
I'm not the person you used to know.

811
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:16,388
I'm the chief of General Surgery
of Geosan Medical Center.

812
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:17,848
Exactly!

813
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:23,019
What is such a person like you doing here?

814
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,856
Why did you really come here?

815
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:29,109
I have no idea why he came
all the way here with us.

816
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,111
He just said we could have
a drink with you.

817
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,612
No. I can't leave right now.

818
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,906
I have to monitor the patient
I operated on until he wakes up.

819
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,074
Hey.

820
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:39,578
Still, you should at least show your face.
Dr. Song is here, too.

821
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:43,498
Yes, Kang Dong-ju speaking.

822
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:45,959
Yes. Okay. I'll be there shortly.

823
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,253
I should go now.
We have patients in the emergency room.

824
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:50,338
You're a surgeon.
Why would you go to the emergency room?

825
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:53,300
We're short-staffed here.
A surgeon is no exception.

826
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:55,969
-Please say hello to Dr. Song.
-Dong-ju.

827
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:58,013
Dong-ju!

828
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,098
This is driving me crazy.

829
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,100
What should I do?

830
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,854
-The number you are calling...
-Why isn't In-beom picking up?

831
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:07,773
Where on earth is he?

832
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,450
Dr. Yun?

833
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:20,702
She must have gone for bed sheets.

834
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:21,828
Bed sheets?

835
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:25,499
Does a doctor do that in this hospital?

836
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:29,336
She's in a situation.

837
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:34,925
This isn't right.

838
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,470
I'm an ER doctor and a cardiac surgeon.

839
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:41,765
Why am I folding bed sheets?

840
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:46,269
I have no choice. I'm an orderly.

841
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:59,115
HOUSEKEEPING ROOM

842
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:23,014
What's wrong? What is it?

843
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,891
You startled me.

844
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:29,104
Who are you? Why are you standing there?

845
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:33,191
I just... I'm lost.

846
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:35,151
Excuse me?

847
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:41,825
Someone found her unconscious
and called the paramedics.

848
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:44,744
Her pupil reflex and breathing are weak.

849
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,371
Let's intubate her for now.

850
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:48,248
Set up IV lines and give her
normal saline.

851
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:49,499
Prepare for a brain CT scan.

852
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:50,584
Hold on a second.

853
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:02,345
Give her some food.

854
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:05,515
Excuse me?

855
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,392
I said, she needs to eat.

856
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:09,978
What are you talking about?

857
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:12,105
Trust me, Dr. Kang.

858
00:53:12,188 --> 00:53:13,273
What she needs is food.

859
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:18,820
Go through the fire exit over there.
It leads to the lobby.

860
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:21,656
Go right from there, not to the left.

861
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:25,118
-I see.
-Okay, then.

862
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:29,956
Gosh. I can't use this one.

863
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,917
I should take this to the laundry room.

864
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:35,670
Excuse me.

865
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,047
Yes?

866
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:41,217
Do you know someone called Crazy Whale?

867
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:51,937
Here's food.

868
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:54,064
Wake up and eat, please.

869
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:56,942
I think we should set up IV lines.

870
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:11,498
Slow down.
You'll get sick if you eat too fast.

871
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,458
Eat slowly and chew well.

872
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:18,421
Some homeless people
around the casino who starved for days

873
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,256
get transferred here.

874
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:23,009
I see.

875
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:34,562
Drink it.

876
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:50,996
Take your time.

877
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:05,260
If you need anything,
please tell Mr. Park.

878
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:08,930
Hello, I'm Park Eun-tak.

879
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:24,946
-Ms. Woo.
-Yes?

880
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,865
Do you know where Ms. Yun is?

881
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:29,117
-She's in the linen room.
-Thank you.

882
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:35,540
How do you know Crazy Whale?

883
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,876
I've heard so much about her

884
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:40,837
that she was a legendary doctor
at Geosan Medical Center.

885
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,631
I think I heard that
she's working at Doldam Hospital.

886
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:45,091
I'd like to meet her.

887
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:47,761
Do you know her?

888
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,055
Yes.

889
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:51,973
I know her.

890
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:56,102
That's me.

891
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:00,690
I see. You are her.

892
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:03,276
You are

893
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,028
the Crazy Whale.

894
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:08,323
Who are you, by the way?

895
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:11,993
I don't suppose you have come
a long way just to see Crazy Whale.

896
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,161
What brought you here?

897
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,290
Hey, In-beom.

898
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:25,757
What are you doing here?

899
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:29,928
I just got lost
looking around the hospital.

900
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:32,305
Do you know him?

901
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:34,808
-Who is he?
-He was my colleague.

902
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,936
We went to college and worked
as surgeons together.

903
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:41,314
Unlike me, he is a son of
the privileged at Geosan Medical Center.

904
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:43,233
A son of the privileged?

905
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:45,360
How is President Do doing?

906
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:46,903
Is he doing well

907
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:48,446
after kicking me out to Doldam hospital?

908
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,115
What are you talking about?

909
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:51,825
Explain it in language I can understand.

910
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,244
President Do of Geosan Medical Center

911
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:56,621
is his father.

912
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:06,965
Why aren't you answering me?

913
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,800
What's the reason you are here?

914
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:14,931
I heard you'll perform
the operation on the chairman.

915
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,894
What? Who?

916
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:22,689
Chairman Shin Myeong-ho.
The big shot of casino.

917
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:25,442
He is the foundation chairman
of Geosan Medical Center.

918
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,668
We have not much time left
until the renewal of the presidency.

919
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:48,089
The chairman has the final say.

920
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:51,384
And you will be operating on him.

921
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:53,470
Do you think
President Do will let it slide?

922
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:57,015
You'd better back off now.

923
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:01,144
Otherwise, it will backfire on you.

924
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:03,396
President Do will do anything

925
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,024
to stop you from operating on him.

926
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,775
You know he will do that.

927
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,962
I can't believe this.

928
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:30,507
Damn it!

929
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:41,893
