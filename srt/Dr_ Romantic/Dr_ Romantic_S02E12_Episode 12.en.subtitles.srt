1
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:44,753
Hand it over.

2
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,673
No.

3
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,592
I'll hold on to this.

4
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,053
So you know who the surgeon is?

5
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,097
Tell him to come here
and explain to the patient.

6
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,682
Hey, Woo-jin.

7
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,810
I will wait until tomorrow evening.

8
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,897
I'll do that much, as his fellow doctor.

9
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,192
Do you know who the surgeon is?

10
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:13,615
-Do I have to know who it is?
-I think you should know.

11
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,200
Who is it?

12
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:17,786
Cha Eun-jae.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,876
Who?

14
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,712
The doctor who cut off his bile duct is

15
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,633
Doctor Cha's older brother of all people.

16
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,056
What brings you here?

17
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,516
I heard you're unwell.

18
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,019
I heard the rumors and got worried,

19
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,437
so I ran over at once.

20
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,608
I heard you have CTS. Is it true?

21
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,027
Who said that?

22
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,029
I played golf with Chairman Do yesterday.

23
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,907
Gosh, that man is amazing.

24
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,076
He knows everything about you.

25
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,746
If he were your fan,
he'd be considered a stalker.

26
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,833
Maybe he likes you.

27
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,670
Hey. Stop talking nonsense,

28
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,505
and tell me why you're here.

29
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,007
Nothing to drink for me?

30
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,848
You'll find a water purifier
filled with water right outside.

31
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,934
You're so harsh on me.

32
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,603
You should treat me better.

33
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,564
I'm here to take your side, come on.

34
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:29,858
Will you just leave?

35
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,277
Have you heard of Mirae Hospital?

36
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:36,781
I heard the land prices are
fluctuating around here because of it.

37
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,244
-What are you talking about?
-I knew it.

38
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,746
I knew you'd have no idea.

39
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,126
Where do you think that Mirae Hospital

40
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,420
will be established?

41
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:55,592
Exactly. Right here,
where Doldam Hospital is.

42
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,177
They'll build it here.

43
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,349
They're going to demolish this place
and build Mirae Hospital instead.

44
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,227
It's a place for the top five percent.

45
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,146
A special restorative hospital which meets

46
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,982
the needs of those who have money
and are looking for a healthier life.

47
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,444
Once they go through a two-week program,

48
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,863
they'll leave looking
five, ten years younger.

49
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,489
That's what it'll be like.

50
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,743
And Park Min-gook is here
to prepare the ground for that hospital.

51
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:27,332
I'm sure he's already begun
to weed them out.

52
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,292
Weed out? Weed out what?

53
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:35,173
He's poking around and looking for

54
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:38,259
people at Doldam Hospital
that he can take to Mirae Hospital.

55
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,638
And he's removing anyone
who won't listen to him.

56
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,227
It's your turn to make a decision.

57
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,605
Will you tell the patient
and blow up the case

58
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,440
even though you now know who it is?

59
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,861
Or will you cover it up as I suggested?

60
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,534
You have until tomorrow evening.

61
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:16,923
People always pay for
having a hasty sense of justice.

62
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,385
A kid who excelled in the OR

63
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,262
was banned from operations

64
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,682
for almost a year
because of his sense of justice.

65
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:29,060
He just got to hold a scalpel again,

66
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,813
so don't you think it's brutal

67
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,525
to take away his opportunity to come back
because of that sense of justice?

68
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:40,488
-Who's taking away whose opportunity?
-Don't be like that.

69
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:43,908
You know what the industry is like.

70
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,870
So, stop egging him on.

71
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:51,457
His life is already tough enough.

72
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,044
Stop forcing him to have a conscience,
responsibility, or a sense of justice…

73
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,007
as a doctor.

74
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,885
What you're doing is bullying him.

75
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,222
Do you understand, Ms. Oh?

76
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,821
They came back in again.

77
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,283
Let's see. What's his condition like?

78
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,618
I'm so jealous you can worry over that.

79
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,457
Let's inject the drug three more times.

80
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:45,970
Yes, Mr. Do.

81
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,807
Yes, I just told him everything
you told me to say.

82
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,518
Something like that.

83
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,564
He and Park are probably
going to get into a huge fight.

84
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,275
Okay, great job.

85
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,903
Let's go play golf again next weekend.

86
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,405
Yes.

87
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:35,978
AN ERROR OF EXCHANGE OF EQUIVALENTS

88
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,107
It's not that difficult.

89
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,027
They're willing to pay that much
because you're that capable.

90
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:49,367
I can negotiate with them
to help you receive a 50 percent raise.

91
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,664
I can get paid 1.5 times as much?

92
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,208
This doesn't apply to me.

93
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,585
I'm still a resident. Please excuse me.

94
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:07,677
They will pay you more on top of that
according to your duties and position.

95
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,220
Really?

96
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:14,183
I've been giving it some serious thought.

97
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:18,729
It's been three years since
I moved away from my wife and daughter.

98
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,275
I want to return to the main hospital,
but there's no opening.

99
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,276
Forget it.

100
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,445
Don't try this here. Go somewhere else.

101
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,571
Nurse Um.

102
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:30,366
My focus is still on learning
instead of making money.

103
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,578
I mean, they're willing to
pay us that much more.

104
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:37,290
Nothing is free in this world,
and your life won't get upgraded for free.

105
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,834
If you take a lot,
you'll end up paying a lot.

106
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,878
That's what Ms. Oh said.

107
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:43,671
Nurse Um!

108
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,465
Please excuse me.

109
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,551
Is it possible

110
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:52,597
to get half of my salary
as a lump sum like a deposit?

111
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,599
Goodness, no. Never mind.

112
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,895
But is it possible?

113
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,440
Actually, my wife has been saying
she wants to move

114
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,774
for our daughter's education.

115
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,235
Of course. Just make your decision.

116
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,195
Really?

117
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,863
I'll figure everything out.

118
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,449
Doctor Jeong.

119
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,118
-Doctor Jeong?
-Yes.

120
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,912
Doctor Bae. Did you call me?

121
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,080
What are you thinking about
so passionately?

122
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,248
Nothing much.

123
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,628
I always end up with a lot on my mind
whenever I talk to my wife on the phone.

124
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,004
Why? What is it?

125
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,799
I mean, the ER is way too slow today.

126
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,552
-We don't have any emergency patients.
-Doctor Bae,

127
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,012
you didn't know?

128
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,265
They're turning down patients who are

129
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,850
headed to Doldam right now.

130
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:43,105
I'm sorry. Our ORs are full.
Please take them to another ER.

131
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,359
Wait, aren't the ORs all empty?

132
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,611
President Park is going to operate

133
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,489
only on patients booked in advance.

134
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,074
For a while…

135
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,410
No, I'm sure we won't have
any emergency trauma patients

136
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,287
from this moment on.

137
00:08:58,829 --> 00:08:59,664
What?

138
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,793
This is Doldam Hospital's ER.

139
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:07,129
Gosh, I'm sorry,
but we cannot take any more patients.

140
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,756
Please go to another hospital.

141
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:14,470
At this rate, Doldam Hospital
may remove the ER altogether.

142
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:19,016
So they're turning away patients?

143
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,059
Yes, Doctor Kim.

144
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,602
And this.

145
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,813
DOCTOR AGENCY, CEO IM HYUN-JUN

146
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,399
He was in my class, but I don't know him.

147
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,484
It looks like he's close to Doctor Yang.

148
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,487
Anyway, I think he's at Doldam Hospital.

149
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:35,700
He's that doctor who ran Samjin Hospital
where Doctor Seo worked.

150
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,708
So? Is anyone taking the bait?

151
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,460
For now, just Jeong In-su of EM.

152
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,545
EM: EMERGENCY MEDICINE

153
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:48,504
Anyone else?

154
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,841
Everyone always shows resistance
when I first make them the offer.

155
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:56,554
I have to meet them, talk to them,
and keep adjusting the terms.

156
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,931
That's how I move things forward.

157
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,225
This little weasel.

158
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,645
How's Woo-jin doing?

159
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,689
It looks like Woo-jin will

160
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,191
ruin another doctor's life again.

161
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,444
Again? Who is it this time?

162
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:15,656
This girl named Cha Eun-jae,
who's hitting it off with him or whatever.

163
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,492
But apparently it's her older brother.

164
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,384
Aren't you busy?

165
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,554
I am.

166
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,890
Then why are you sitting around?

167
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,061
Just because. I have something on my mind.

168
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,396
Why? Is something not working out?

169
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,277
-You said your brother is a doctor.
-Yes.

170
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,238
He's also a GS like you,

171
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,742
and he became the vice president
of a famous hospital in Seoul.

172
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,994
He's pretty proud of himself now.

173
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,833
Are you two close?

174
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,252
I'm not sure.

175
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,881
I wouldn't say we're close
because we always bicker with one another,

176
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,384
but I also wouldn't say we're on bad terms

177
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:19,178
because we do look after each other.

178
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,763
You know, like any old siblings.

179
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,810
Anyway, why do you ask?

180
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,111
You know, Eun-jae…

181
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,654
One second.

182
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,033
Hey, Mom.

183
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,787
Yes. I have some time to spare.

184
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,831
Why? What is it?

185
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,593
What? You're going to come here?

186
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,183
There's no way out of this.

187
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,519
Aren't you going to help him?

188
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,314
Not yet.

189
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,317
Wait. If you aren't going to do anything,

190
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,778
why do you keep making me spy on them?

191
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,655
Spy?

192
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,617
At the very least, I need to know
what's going on.

193
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,164
I'm asking out of curiosity.

194
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,875
Why do you let this go on?

195
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,464
I know you are more than capable
of turning the tables around.

196
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,593
You can even win against President Park
and everything.

197
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,636
You're supposed to use

198
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,223
your hidden weapon at the final moment.

199
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,058
What if you lose the right timing?

200
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,187
You might end up losing someone, Doctor.

201
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,948
The hospital is very unsettling, Nurse Um.

202
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,367
I can't focus on work.

203
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,953
Let's not follow them blindly, Nurse Joo.

204
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,956
It's because there is
a weird rumor about Doctor Kim too.

205
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,543
A weird rumor?

206
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:16,921
What's the rumor?

207
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,510
Tell me.

208
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,262
What's the weird rumor?

209
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,099
That Doctor Kim didn't collapse

210
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:32,353
because he got hurt,
but because of a chronic illness.

211
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,317
And?

212
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:42,279
He even dropped his scalpel
because his fingers wouldn't move.

213
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,200
I heard that's why he decided not to take
any trauma patients.

214
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,577
The rumor spread between the scrubs.

215
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,497
What else?

216
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,958
It's about Doctor Nam…

217
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,292
That's enough, Nurse Joo.

218
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,962
-You don't have to listen to her.
-Tell me.

219
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,421
What about Doctor Nam?

220
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,090
I heard that he was fired.

221
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:05,052
-And that's why he can't come anymore.
-Nurse Joo, you don't have to share that.

222
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,887
These are all absurd rumors.

223
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,265
She's asking me.

224
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:15,771
Goodness.

225
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,898
You were all here.

226
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,403
Were you having an emergency meeting?

227
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,281
Yes, it was about our duties in the ER.

228
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,700
We were about to wrap up.

229
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:31,579
All right. I've heard your suggestions.
You may go back to your stations.

230
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,373
Yes. All right. Let's get back to work.

231
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,837
Keep up the good work. Keep it up.

232
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,936
But Ms. Oh and Nurse Park
are very worried.

233
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,188
They're concerned we might burden him.

234
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,695
What if it's because of us?

235
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,031
What if that's why he's straining himself?

236
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,454
Is everything all right, Ms. Oh?

237
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,709
Of course, everything is fine.

238
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,047
Please excuse me.

239
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,591
You know what?

240
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,391
You aren't my burden. You're my strength.

241
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,771
You, Do-il, Nurse Park,

242
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,442
and everyone at Doldam Hospital.

243
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,663
I'm just saying, in case you've forgotten.

244
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,089
You know that, don't you?

245
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,718
Yes, I do.

246
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,765
Okay then.

247
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,974
Hello, Mr. Ko. It's me, Doctor Kim.

248
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,354
That's why I called.

249
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,108
I have a favor to ask.

250
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,116
Goodness.

251
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,285
Ms. Oh.

252
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,203
Are you leaving already?

253
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:19,872
Yes.

254
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,000
I don't think we'll have
any emergency patients

255
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:27,337
-or patients that need operations.
-Really? Do you want to leave together?

256
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,757
Let's grab a drink at Once in a While--

257
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,883
No, it's okay.

258
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,802
I need you to take care of

259
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,180
this man.

260
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,556
DOCTOR AGENCY, CEO IM HYUN-JUN

261
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,349
Who's this?

262
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,018
A recruiter.

263
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,646
He's trying to lure our employees out

264
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,940
by promising them a raise.

265
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:50,861
What? How can he do
something like that at our hospital?

266
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,280
So stop getting distracted,

267
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,949
and keep people like him out. Okay?

268
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,117
Don't be so harsh.

269
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,370
I've been busy escorting our VIP.

270
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:04,833
Ms. Oh, sometimes you look down
on the administrative work we do--

271
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,460
That again!

272
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:10,380
This isn't the time to divide our duties
between administrative and medical!

273
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,925
You already know what the situation is.

274
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:16,845
Well, it's because
you always look down on me.

275
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,973
I'm not looking down on you.

276
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,143
It's because I'm disappointed.

277
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,105
Disappointed? In me?

278
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,106
Yes.

279
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:32,361
We should be helping each other out,
but you keep dividing us.

280
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,905
It's disappointing.
It's heartbreaking and sad.

281
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:38,534
Well, there's no need
to be disappointed or sad.

282
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,576
Fine.

283
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:44,289
Even between families and married couples,
each person has their own story.

284
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:48,377
Of course, we all have our stories
as colleagues at work.

285
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,087
However,

286
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,673
we're still

287
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,926
people on the same boat called Doldam.

288
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,138
Isn't that so?

289
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:02,933
Please

290
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,811
don't speak to me with such eyes.

291
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,189
If you look at me like that,

292
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,524
my heart will race…

293
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,109
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

294
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,946
I ask of you, Mr. Jang.

295
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,490
WE PROVIDE HEART-TO-HEART TREATMENTS

296
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,206
You mysteriously charming woman.

297
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,961
DOCTOR AGENCY, CEO IM HYUN-JUN

298
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,092
TREATMENT ROOM 1

299
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,227
Hey, are you going somewhere?

300
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,770
Yes, I'm leaving.

301
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,231
I suddenly have to meet someone,
so I'm leaving an hour early.

302
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:54,067
I won't be too far away,
so call me if we get an emergency patient.

303
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,529
Hey, can you give me
five minutes before you leave?

304
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,490
-I have something important to say to you.
-Later.

305
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,784
I really can't be late today. Sorry.

306
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,708
Have you been eating
flour-based foods again?

307
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,295
No. Not that often.

308
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,632
Only on the days when I have
surgery until late at night,

309
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:02,219
when I get way too hungry,
which doesn't happen very often,

310
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,930
-I sometimes eat cup noodles.
-Cup noodles?

311
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,432
Goodness.

312
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,686
Eun-jae, you can't do that.

313
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,980
I told you to stay away from instant food.

314
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:18,568
You'll lose your firm skin
and end up with wrinkles overnight.

315
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,738
All right, I'll be careful, Ms. Jung.

316
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,576
Anyway, what brings you all the way here?

317
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,746
You didn't say anything this morning.

318
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,374
Did you fight with Dad?

319
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,583
Watch it!

320
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,961
Don't be so vulgar. I don't fight.

321
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,130
So you really came here to see me?

322
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:40,716
That too.

323
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,010
Actually,

324
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,221
I got a call from Eun-ho.

325
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,222
From Eun-ho?

326
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,975
Why? Is he getting married again?

327
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,436
He has a favor to ask of you.

328
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,688
Did the sun rise in the west today?

329
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:58,317
I can't believe my perfect brother
is asking for my help.

330
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,568
What is it?

331
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,278
Does he want to recruit me or something?

332
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:07,200
I heard there's someone named
Seo Woo-jin at your hospital.

333
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:08,994
What?

334
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,403
Do you do this for fun?

335
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,743
This time, it's Eun-jae's brother.

336
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,038
First, you betray your senior,

337
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,290
then you mess with a colleague's family?

338
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:01,505
This is none of your business.
Mind your own business and be on your way.

339
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,508
You shouldn't live like that, Woo-jin.

340
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,767
It's not like you had an unfortunate life
because of other people.

341
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,105
You can't ruin other people's lives
and push them into misfortune

342
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,983
just because you lived an awful life
thanks to those parents of yours.

343
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,071
Who ruined whose life?

344
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,364
You ruined me.

345
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:32,202
You ruined my life. You ruined my family!

346
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,040
Figures.

347
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:42,170
I'm an idiot for trusting you.
I have no one else to blame.

348
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,883
That's why I'm holding out
with everything I can do.

349
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,095
But…

350
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,183
my father, who worked so hard

351
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,311
to support me his entire life
to make me into a doctor,

352
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:03,233
invested the rest of his severance pay
and the tiny apartment he had…

353
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,694
all into my hospital.

354
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,115
Darn it.

355
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:12,993
He lost all that too.

356
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:15,620
All because of you.

357
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,832
All because you wreaked havoc
to patronize me, you jerk!

358
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,167
Why didn't you do a better job?

359
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:25,088
If your father's fortune was at stake,
you should've been more responsible.

360
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,216
You shouldn't have taken bribes
or abused the procedures!

361
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,342
If I didn't do that,

362
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,429
how could I have made enough
to pay off my debt?

363
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,139
-Do you know any other way?
-Of all things,

364
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,599
how could you have ghost surgeons?

365
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:40,604
And that was a medical equipment salesman.
How could you let him into the OR?

366
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,981
It was just that once, you jerk!
It was that once!

367
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:43,940
Don't be absurd.

368
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,110
I know you did it at least seven times.
And one of the children

369
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:48,737
almost died…

370
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,907
because of excessive bleeding!

371
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,119
-Have you forgotten?
-You wanted to make money!

372
00:24:57,787 --> 00:25:00,540
You told me you wanted to
get your revenge on the world with money.

373
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,834
Yes, but who said
I wanted to break the law?

374
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,586
That's what everyone else does!

375
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,465
The whole world makes money like that
and enjoys their fortune.

376
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,550
Why do you pretend like you're a saint?

377
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,552
Why am I not allowed to do that? Why not?

378
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:13,637
Because it was you!

379
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:20,685
You were the only one…

380
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,107
I considered like a brother in pre-med.

381
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,823
Did you think I quit my job
as a fellow at a university hospital…

382
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,498
only because of money?

383
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:44,960
Hyun-jun.

384
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,129
But still…

385
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,260
why couldn't you let it slide just once?

386
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:58,598
Why couldn't you let it slide
that one time?

387
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,301
Darn it!

388
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,625
MALE CHANGING ROOM

389
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,323
Mother, did you meet Eun-jae?

390
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,742
Yes, I just met her
and told her everything.

391
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,577
What did she say?

392
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:43,703
What can she say?

393
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,331
You're her brother. She has to help.

394
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:50,460
It seems like Doctor Seo
is a close colleague of hers.

395
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,337
She said she'll talk to him.

396
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,380
I'm sorry.

397
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,049
I thought about calling her myself,

398
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,510
but I figured it would be better
to have you talk to her,

399
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:01,221
-so I had to ask you for a favor.
-A favor?

400
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,098
Don't say that. We're family.

401
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:09,938
And you know how much Eun-jae
loves her family too.

402
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:16,319
Gosh, another surgeon buried his mistake.

403
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:19,656
How shameless and immoral.

404
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:23,493
That surgery was actually done by Eun-ho.

405
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:26,162
We shouldn't cover for a doctor like him.

406
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:30,166
Can't you cover up a mistake like that
as fellow doctors?

407
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,335
Of all people, this is your brother.

408
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,546
You said your brother is a doctor.

409
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:37,757
Please have a talk with Mr. Seo.

410
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,093
We'll compensate him handsomely.

411
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,469
He's your brother.

412
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,903
WE PROVIDE HEART-TO-HEART TREATMENTS

413
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,906
You came back early.

414
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,909
Yes. Things ended pretty quickly.

415
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:49,162
What about you? Why are you still here?

416
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,080
Why haven't you left?

417
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,458
Just because.

418
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,592
Hey.

419
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:09,057
You said you had something to tell me
just as I was leaving, right?

420
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,769
You said it was important…

421
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,105
and you needed only five minutes.

422
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,319
What

423
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,363
were you going to say?

424
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,998
What was it? Tell me.

425
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,001
Later.

426
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,588
Let's talk later, Eun-jae.

427
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:47,303
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

428
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,995
This is really absurd.

429
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:15,540
You devoted years to Doldam Hospital.

430
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:20,503
How can they kick you out
with a piece of paper?

431
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,631
All they gave you was this notice.

432
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,092
You haven't told Doctor Kim, have you?

433
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,136
I couldn't.

434
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,471
Good.

435
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,433
Don't bother him with this for a while.

436
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,435
Doctor Sim is around,

437
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,729
so she'll be able to manage for a while.

438
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,109
Don't bother me with what?

439
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,038
Doctor Kim.

440
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,001
TERMINATION OF CONTRACT

441
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,002
He

442
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,297
sent it to him through Doctor Yang.

443
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:08,509
He has no respect, manners, or courtesy!

444
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:12,305
This isn't how people should
do business with other people.

445
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:17,769
Doctor Kim.

446
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,521
You're right.

447
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,441
It's not how you do business with people.

448
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:24,943
But, Doctor Kim…

449
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,153
If he really wants to fire you,

450
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,781
tell him to come and see you,
then have him tell you in person.

451
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:33,993
If he's firing a fellow doctor who devoted
30 years of his life to medicine,

452
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,955
he needs to show that much courtesy.

453
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,706
Don't you think so, Ms. Oh?

454
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,542
Yes, I agree with you.

455
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,169
It's the president's decision.

456
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,588
Doldam Hospital is an organization.

457
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:48,466
If the man in charge of personnel affairs
made such a decision,

458
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:49,759
we can't help it.

459
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,310
Let's not make excuses
and say we can't help it, Do-il.

460
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:03,856
It's not that you can't help it,
you just can't be bothered.

461
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:08,695
You're sick of dealing with guys who have
no manners, courtesy, or common sense.

462
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:13,783
You think it's disgusting, cheap, tiring,
and you've had enough of this.

463
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,537
That's why you want to avoid them

464
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,665
by saying you can't help it as an excuse.
Isn't that right?

465
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,084
Doctor Kim.

466
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,670
Do you know

467
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:29,674
how many patients were turned down
over half a day today?

468
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,427
Four TA patients,

469
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,221
two fracture patients,
one suicide patient.

470
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:36,514
SUICIDE PATIENT

471
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,891
And one seizure patient. A total of eight.

472
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:41,686
One of them…

473
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,731
passed away from excessive bleeding

474
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,358
during the transfer to another hospital.

475
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,526
And the other one

476
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:51,863
couldn't be treated on time,
so that patient is still unconscious.

477
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:56,492
These things happen the moment
we say we can't help it.

478
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,412
The more we turn our faces away
and turn a blind eye to this,

479
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:01,914
the more this vicious cycle
will repeat itself.

480
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,045
I get that you're sick and tired of this.

481
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,213
It's tough for me too.

482
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:13,342
And wanting to quit working here
because they're disgusting and cheap?

483
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,094
I get that too.

484
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:16,763
I feel that way too.

485
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,016
But this isn't right.

486
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:26,105
If you really want to end this fight,
be yourself and do it your way.

487
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,608
Not with this piece of paper.

488
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,903
This isn't right, Doctor Nam.

489
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:51,089
TERMINATION OF CONTRACT

490
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,177
WE HOPE TO SEE YOU HEALTHY

491
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,303
What are you doing here?

492
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:02,266
We never know when a patient will come,
so I'm getting ready.

493
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:06,062
We won't be taking
emergency trauma patients for a while.

494
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,484
How long has it been
since you came to work for Doldam?

495
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,529
Well, just over a month now. Why?

496
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,367
But you still have
no idea what this hospital is like.

497
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,369
What do you mean?

498
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:26,040
Well, tomorrow is Friday.

499
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,643
Do you think that Friday will come again?

500
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,232
Of course.

501
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:52,775
This is Doldam Hospital.

502
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,657
HERRING PARADISE

503
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,251
Hello.

504
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,461
Boss.

505
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:24,974
It's been a while, sir.

506
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,644
I met you through Woo-jin a while back.

507
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,481
I'm Im Hyun-jun from Samjin Hospital.

508
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,110
Oh, right.

509
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,700
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

510
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,346
RESTRICTED AREA: OPERATING ROOM

511
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,765
There are no patients at this hospital.

512
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,601
It's pancreatic head cancer.

513
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,604
We'll have to perform a laparoscopy.

514
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,314
It'd be better to just open him up.

515
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:17,401
Hey, Professor Park is the master
of the laparoscopic Whipple procedure.

516
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,486
Did you know that?

517
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,323
Professor Park equals laparoscopy.

518
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,367
It's like a formula, so memorize it.

519
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,868
So what will Professor Park do?

520
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:27,745
A laparoscopy.

521
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,289
We'll open up the patient.

522
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,627
When the patient came in a month ago,

523
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,671
the cancer that started
in the head of the pancreas

524
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,465
had only spread to parts
of the duodenum and stomach.

525
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:40,967
But in just a month,

526
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,011
it spread to his biliary tract
and transverse colon.

527
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,347
So we have no choice but to open him up.

528
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,015
Will we do a PPPD?

529
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:48,975
Yes, of course.

530
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,603
Doctor Yang, I'd like you to remove
the metastasized colon.

531
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,021
Sure, no problem.

532
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,648
Then what can I do?

533
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,533
I'll have to hear your answer first.

534
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,707
So, this wasn't about me scrubbing in.

535
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,002
Did you ask me here to hear my answer?

536
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,253
Doctor Seo.

537
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:20,256
I'm giving you this opportunity
because I think you're a great surgeon.

538
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,049
If you wish to assist me…

539
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,845
you must prove your dignity
as a doctor first.

540
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,806
Does covering up for fellow doctors…

541
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:31,767
dignify us as doctors?

542
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:34,562
Doctor Seo.

543
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,069
Didn't you swear the oath
when graduating med school?

544
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,865
"I will do everything in my power…

545
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:50,119
to uphold the honor and dignified
tradition of the medical profession.

546
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,415
My fellow doctors
are my brothers and sisters."

547
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,793
Just stay true to that oath.

548
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,672
There was another line though.

549
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:05,968
"I will perform my duties
upon my conscience and dignity.

550
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,136
I will…

551
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,765
put my patients' health first
under any circumstances."

552
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,562
Is that your answer?

553
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:21,484
I asked you…

554
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,237
if that is your answer.

555
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:31,702
You said he has until this evening,
so let him think about it until then.

556
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:36,082
I'll monitor the patient
and confirm the surgery by the evening.

557
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,166
Does that sound good?

558
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,089
Doctor Seo?

559
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,518
MOM

560
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:01,107
That's strange. Why isn't she picking up?

561
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,609
Is she with a patient?

562
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,696
Hasn't she talked to him about it?

563
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,493
Why are you ignoring the call?

564
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,789
Isn't it your mom?

565
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,793
Are you two on the outs or something?

566
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,212
Who are you?

567
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,547
I'm Kang Ik-joon.

568
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,924
We met yesterday, remember?

569
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:28,634
What's your name?

570
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,096
Oh, Cha Eun-jae.

571
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:33,848
Your name is Eun-jae.

572
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,517
Call me Doctor Cha Eun-jae.

573
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,685
Or just Doctor Cha.

574
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,479
Will you be participating in my surgery?

575
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,939
No.

576
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:44,191
I'm a cardiac surgeon.

577
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,068
I mend hearts and lungs.

578
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,237
You can fix hearts?

579
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:52,199
Then can you also fix how someone feels?

580
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,246
-What?
-Perhaps you can fix my feelings?

581
00:40:57,329 --> 00:41:00,416
I think they've been
out of whack for years.

582
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,792
Sir.

583
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:05,129
Go back to your room before I lose it.

584
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,131
Should we date?

585
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,470
You're totally my type.

586
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,638
I'm rich.

587
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,640
Gosh, why you little--

588
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,309
Oh, you got a text.

589
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,108
It's so peaceful here today.

590
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:27,610
Right?

591
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:29,570
Yes, tell me about it.

592
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:32,740
I'm wondering if it's okay
to be this quiet.

593
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:34,617
Don't!

594
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,411
I heard we can't say that here in the ER.

595
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,331
It'll bring in emergency patients.
It's considered a jinx here.

596
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,458
But the situation has changed.

597
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:45,044
-Right, Nurse Um?
-Yes, you're right.

598
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,282
What is this?

599
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:16,867
Gosh, no way.

600
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,285
Is this a prank?

601
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:22,248
What are you all doing?
Didn't you get a text about the patient?

602
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,375
-Doctor Kim.
-Yes.

603
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,417
What's this about?

604
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,544
What do you think?

605
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,504
We're expecting an emergency patient.

606
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:30,422
What do you mean? "An emergency patient"?

607
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,924
Don't be so alarmed.

608
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,801
You kept refusing to accept patients,

609
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:37,304
-so I set up a separate hotline.
-What?

610
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,847
-Nurse Um.
-Yes, sir.

611
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,141
The paramedics will call this number.

612
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:43,686
I'd like you to be in charge
of taking the calls.

613
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,604
-Sure, got it.
-Eun-jae!

614
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:48,190
-Yes, I'm here.
-Hey, an MI patient

615
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,568
had a cardiac arrest on the way,
so get ready.

616
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:54,029
We may need surgery,
so call Anesthesiology.

617
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:55,614
Got it, sir.

618
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:58,951
Doctor Kim, a patient with abdominal pain
will arrive in five minutes.

619
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,536
Where is Doctor Jeong?

620
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:03,664
-Doctor Jeong!
-Yes! I'm here, sir.

621
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,499
A patient with abdominal pain
is coming in.

622
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,417
Get ready. Quick.

623
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,918
Okay. Doctor Yoon.

624
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:08,877
Yes.

625
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:12,881
Nurse Um. You should
call Doctor Seo in advance, just in case.

626
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,008
Got it.

627
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,558
-Ms. Oh.
-Yes, Doctor Kim.

628
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:25,603
Call Doctor Nam
and tell him to come right away.

629
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,438
Will do.

630
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:36,905
Doctor Nam, this is Oh Myeong-sim.

631
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,742
Doctor Kim wants you here.

632
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,880
The patient is here!

633
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:56,425
Here, one, two, three!

634
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,719
Doctor Yoon, please do CPR.

635
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,346
Connect the monitor and check the rate.

636
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,018
The monitor has been connected.

637
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,770
Here's our report, the EKG, and the CD.

638
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:08,771
Thank you.

639
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:10,981
Pause. Let's check the rhythm.

640
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,070
V-fib.

641
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:17,696
VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION

642
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:18,864
Charge to 200 joules.

643
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,200
Clear!

644
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,202
Shock!

645
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:26,664
-Back to CPR.
-I'll take over.

646
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:29,416
-Let's intubate the patient!
-Incoming!

647
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,459
This way!

648
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,132
Let's move the patient.

649
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,634
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

650
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,435
What? This is…

651
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,603
What happened?

652
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,398
He and his mates were using an air gun
to get dust off their clothes.

653
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:55,025
They sprayed air into his anus
while goofing around,

654
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,403
and his abdomen suddenly swelled up.

655
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,071
He's also experiencing severe pain.

656
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:00,280
An air gun?

657
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,782
Well, you know.

658
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:05,911
It's a gun that instantly
shoots out high-pressure air.

659
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:09,039
I'm sure it wasn't made to be used on…

660
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,207
What's wrong with…

661
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:14,169
It was caused by an air gun,
fired into his anus.

662
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:20,926
Let's check his heart rhythm.

663
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,019
ROSC.

664
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:32,813
It's back.

665
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,243
-The patient's heart is beating again.
-Good.

666
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,329
When he arrived at the other hospital,

667
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:52,875
the left main was almost totally blocked,
but they managed to unclog it.

668
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,837
However, his LAD and LCX
are almost completely clogged as well.

669
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,758
Right. His blood vessels are thin,
and they're heavily calcified.

670
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,260
What do you think?

671
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:04,928
Can you do this?

672
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,638
Yes, I… Sorry?

673
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,016
Me?

674
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,685
You want me to lead this surgery?

675
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:14,772
Well, do you expect me to do it?

676
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,818
Right, I should do it.

677
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:23,030
I'll assist you throughout the surgery.

678
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,199
You will assist me?

679
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:27,451
You don't want that?

680
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:31,455
It's not that. I'm honored.

681
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,794
Don't chuckle, or I'll grow fond of you.
You'd better go get ready.

682
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,922
Yes, sir. I'm on it.

683
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,510
-Doctor Kim.
-Yes?

684
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,386
It's abdominal swelling due to an air gun.

685
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,181
He has pneumoperitoneum,
so a sonogram is useless.

686
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:50,808
But I'm sure he has a bowel perforation.

687
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:54,353
We should operate on him as soon as
the OP lab test and CT scan are done.

688
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:57,231
I have to tend to the CS patient first.

689
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,733
Ms. Oh. Ms. Oh?

690
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:01,693
Yes, Doctor Kim.

691
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:02,653
There you are.

692
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:06,240
Tend to the bowel perforation patient
with Nurse Park.

693
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,783
-Sure, I'll get ready.
-Okay.

694
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:09,284
Nurse Park. To OR two, please.

695
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,662
-It's a bowel perforation patient.
-Got it.

696
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,872
-I'll go get ready.
-Yes, hurry.

697
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:15,958
Ms. Oh.

698
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,086
Where is Doctor Nam?

699
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,089
He'll be here. Don't worry.

700
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:55,080
MOM

701
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:15,017
The person you're trying to reach
is unavailable. Please leave a message

702
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,685
after the tone.

703
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,607
You won't let me into the OR?

704
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:22,649
What do you mean?

705
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:26,570
The patient had a cardiac arrest,
and he's not doing well.

706
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:29,448
But you'll perform a CABG?
And you'll lead the surgery?

707
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:31,617
Yes. Is there a problem with that?

708
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:33,827
Most importantly, I don't trust you.

709
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:38,832
Up until recently, you used to run out
of the OR due to your anxiety issues.

710
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,542
I don't do that anymore.

711
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:43,462
The patient is in poor condition.
What if he dies during the surgery

712
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:45,255
because you insisted on operating on him?

713
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,007
We both know what will happen next.

714
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:50,510
We'll be blamed for medical malpractice
and end up getting sued.

715
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,347
Why must I take such a huge risk?

716
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:57,017
Still, he's dying.
You won't let me in, knowing that?

717
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,436
That's right. I won't.
I don't want to be responsible.

718
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:01,104
I don't know if we can save him, okay?

719
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,193
Then I'll take that patient.

720
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:10,906
Doctor Nam.

721
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:13,575
I was going to take
the bowel perforation patient,

722
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:17,245
but I'll take over if you're scared
to take on the MI patient.

723
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,665
I heard they terminated your contract.

724
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:23,418
I don't think that's any of your business.

725
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,172
You're disrespecting my privacy
as if it's no big deal,

726
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:29,466
which is very rude and discourteous.

727
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:31,176
Frankly, I find it extremely obnoxious.

728
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,470
What can I do though?

729
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:37,307
A friend of mine keeps on pushing me,
saying it's not time to give up yet.

730
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,310
I'll take on the MI patient.

731
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,646
Don't worry. Let's go in, Doctor Cha.

732
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,409
Hey, Doctor Sim.

733
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:59,955
For your information,
that friend he was talking about…

734
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,416
is me.

735
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:08,296
Oh, and the contract termination letter…

736
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,007
I tore it to pieces.

737
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,384
I'm telling you

738
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:15,220
so you can let President Park know.

739
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,278
You've never performed a CABG, right?

740
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:34,197
Right, I've only assisted before.

741
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:36,742
You need to focus.

742
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,285
And just do your best, okay?

743
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:40,537
Yes, sir.

744
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,372
May I begin?

745
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:43,915
Yes, get started.

746
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,461
This patient has
double-vessel coronary artery disease.

747
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:50,255
We'll begin
the coronary artery bypass surgery.

748
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,049
Scalpel.

749
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,142
We'll begin the surgery. Scalpel.

750
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:10,358
Bovie.

751
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:12,694
Sternal saw.

752
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,291
Sternal retractor.

753
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,675
What about the graft? What will you use?

754
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,219
I'll use the ITA.

755
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:38,220
Okay.

756
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:42,349
-Army-Navy retractor.
-Forceps and harmonic scalpel.

757
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,528
Make sure you leave enough soft tissue
so you can secure the vessel later.

758
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,530
Got it.

759
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,366
Let me locate the injury first.
Kelly forceps.

760
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,286
Bovie.

761
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,165
Shall I pour water now?

762
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:09,251
Yes. Saline, please.

763
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:13,880
Once more, please.

764
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:21,263
Here. The rectum is perforated.

765
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,014
Suction.

766
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,143
You were right, Doctor Sim.

767
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:31,523
You said Doctor Seo dazzles most brightly
when he's in the OR.

768
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:35,360
Do I?

769
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:39,239
It's probably because you're confident
in your skills,

770
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:42,033
and you just do what you believe in.

771
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,832
I believe the same goes for people.

772
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:51,751
When you believe something's right
and put that into action…

773
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,713
you dazzle.

774
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:57,883
Ms. Oh.

775
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:00,135
Just do what you believe is right.

776
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,513
That won't get you kicked out of the OR.

777
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,390
At least not here…

778
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,475
at Doldam Hospital.

779
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,494
-What do I do?
-What's wrong?

780
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:28,038
The graft is damaged.

781
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:31,458
It's okay. Calm down.

782
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,542
Don't get flustered.

783
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,378
The patient is still stable.

784
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:37,505
Eun-jae.

785
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,049
Take a deep breath.

786
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:44,387
Now, think about what needs to be done.

787
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:47,390
Okay. Well…

788
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:51,353
What else can you use?

789
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:52,938
-As a graft?
-Yes.

790
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:55,232
Well, there's the gastroepiploic artery.

791
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:56,566
That's right.

792
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:59,778
Then I'll open the diaphragm
and take a graft from the GEA.

793
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,571
-Okay.
-Scalpel.

794
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,410
-Suction.
-Forceps and harmonic scalpel.

795
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:20,799
One vessel loop.

796
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:22,384
-Right angle forceps.
-Okay.

797
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:27,555
How do you feel?

798
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:30,558
Don't your hands feel light
now that you're confident?

799
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,020
One more vessel loop, please.

800
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:42,362
This is why your own will is important
to you as an operating surgeon.

801
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:45,282
When wanting to do it

802
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,200
gives you assurance that you can do it,

803
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:50,662
the surgery's success rate goes up.

804
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,544
Instrument tie, please.

805
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:05,135
-Cut.
-Cut.

806
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:11,182
There are no leaks this time.

807
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:13,560
Don't check with me all the time.

808
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,688
You're leading this surgery,
so do what you think is right.

809
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,565
All right, keep going.

810
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:23,194
-Then I'll open the pericardium now.
-Yes.

811
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,821
-Metzenbaum scissors.
-Forceps.

812
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:41,087
Sutures.

813
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,366
-Cut.
-Cut.

814
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:12,410
Sutures.

815
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,706
OPERATING ROOM 1, OPERATING ROOM 2

816
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,378
Wait! Doctor Seo.

817
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,756
A visitor is waiting for you
in the staff lounge.

818
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:44,317
Ms. Oh.

819
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,156
I warned you not to egg on Doctor Seo.

820
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,283
I thought I got my message across.

821
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:53,743
Yes, you did.

822
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:55,995
That's why I gave you my answer.

823
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:59,165
What you're worried about

824
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:01,835
will never happen at this hospital.

825
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,879
Can you folks take responsibility
for Seo Woo-jin's future?

826
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:09,467
What about you?

827
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:13,596
Do you think you can
take responsibility for his future?

828
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:15,432
What did you say?

829
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:19,644
All of us have been sued
by a patient or two.

830
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:24,149
But we've never refused patients
because of the fear of being sued.

831
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:27,527
You refused to operate due to that risk.

832
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:31,531
Do you think Doctor Seo
will find your advice helpful?

833
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:33,450
I doubt it.

834
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,538
You people…

835
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:42,167
Do you know how annoying you are?

836
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,209
My gosh.

837
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:44,836
In fact, we do.

838
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:48,673
But Doctor Kim calls it

839
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:51,092
"being show-offs."

840
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:00,518
-Hi, Ms. Oh.
-Did the surgery go well?

841
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:01,436
Yes.

842
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:02,896
What about your patient?

843
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:05,607
The surgery went very well.

844
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,567
His skills are improving by the day.

845
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:09,903
But his style is different from yours.

846
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,532
What? Even his operations
are good-looking?

847
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:18,411
Where's Doctor Cha?

848
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:23,666
She's congratulating herself
for leading her first surgery.

849
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:40,475
Thank you for hanging in there.

850
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,102
Thank you.

851
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:12,090
Mom, what are you doing here?

852
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:15,260
Hey, Eun-jae.
The surgery must've ended just now.

853
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:18,805
I'm having a chat with Doctor Seo.

854
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:23,685
Doctor Seo, can you step out for a minute?

855
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:27,272
Eun-jae.

856
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:28,815
What are you doing?

857
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,900
We were talking.

858
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,528
Please. Leave the room.

859
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:37,782
Wait, I'm not done talking yet.

860
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:39,576
Good day, ma'am.

861
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:43,705
Wait, Doctor Seo!

862
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:45,123
Enough, Mom.

863
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:49,627
Hey, what about your brother?
He keeps calling me because he's worried.

864
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:53,339
Tell him to sort it out himself
if he's that worried.

865
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:56,676
He's old enough. Why is he hiding
behind your back like a little kid?

866
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:59,220
Eun-jae, you're out of line.

867
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:00,638
Mom, please.

868
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:02,515
I work here.

869
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:03,641
I know that.

870
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:06,811
That's why I came here
to politely ask him in person.

871
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:09,480
Mom, do you think this is polite?

872
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:10,648
What?

873
01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:13,568
Mom, this is wrong.

874
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:17,113
If Eun-ho made a mistake,
he should pay for it.

875
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:20,783
Why should you talk to Woo-jin about it?

876
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:24,370
Also, who told you that you could
talk to him without asking me first?

877
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:25,830
Eun-jae.

878
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:28,041
You've always had your way
with everything.

879
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,208
Was that not enough for you?

880
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:30,835
My gosh, what?

881
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:33,212
What makes you think I've had my way
with everything?

882
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,422
You didn't know?

883
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:37,216
I didn't want to go to med school.

884
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:41,012
-What?
-But you said I had to.

885
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,181
You said it was your dream.

886
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:46,768
So I studied hard without complaining
and got in.

887
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,979
I really didn't want to become a surgeon,

888
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:51,814
but you told me I had to.

889
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:56,319
You wanted me to get into CS at all costs,
so I did.

890
01:00:57,862 --> 01:01:00,323
Because of my anxiety issues, I threw up

891
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,159
and ran out of the OR so many times.

892
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:06,537
I tried taking so many medications
just to hold out.

893
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:08,623
You have no idea.

894
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:14,128
I dozed off and dropped to the floor
over and over

895
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:15,963
and got kicked for that so many times!

896
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,007
You haven't got a clue,

897
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:22,887
because you weren't the one who carried me
out of the OR when I fainted.

898
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,431
Gosh, what is wrong with you?

899
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:28,893
It's not ladylike to yell at your mother.

900
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:33,564
This is why I told you
to stay away from wheat and instant foods.

901
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:36,317
Gosh, look how irritable you've become.

902
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:38,695
Mom, please!

903
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:40,405
This isn't good.

904
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:43,324
Even just one more day here will ruin you.

905
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:47,078
After sorting things out with Doctor Seo,
I'm going to find you another job.

906
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:49,080
This is not how I raised you.

907
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:51,624
How did you turn out like this?

908
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:54,168
My gosh.

909
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:56,003
Look at those eyes.

910
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:59,507
How dare you glare at me like that?

911
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,968
I can't believe this. My goodness.

912
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:07,181
This is why your own will is important
to you as an operating surgeon.

913
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,935
You need to apologize to me right now!

914
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:14,355
When wanting to do it gives you assurance
that you can do it,

915
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:16,274
the surgery's success rate goes up.

916
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:18,192
Eun-jae!

917
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:21,487
Tell Eun-ho to sort out his own mess.

918
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:23,614
What?

919
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:26,325
Do not ask me…

920
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:30,163
or Woo-jin for any favors.

921
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,415
You're leading this surgery.

922
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,752
This is my life.

923
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:38,171
And this is where I work!

924
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:39,839
Do what you think is right.

925
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,049
Stop humiliating me.

926
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:45,720
And never visit me again
for something like this, Mom.

927
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:06,908
EMERGENCY ROOM

928
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:10,578
Are you all right?

929
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:15,750
I'm sorry, Woo-jin.

930
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:22,965
What do I do?

931
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,844
I'm too embarrassed to even look at you.

932
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:21,566
EMERGENCY ROOM

933
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:29,240
So?

934
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:32,785
-What's your answer?
-Tell the doctor…

935
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:35,872
to come here and explain
what happened to his patient.

936
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:37,373
He should visit the patient,

937
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:40,042
admit to his mistake,
and apologize to him.

938
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:54,974
The surgeon who operated
on your gallbladder is on his way here.

939
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:58,185
He'll officially apologize when he's here,

940
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:03,024
but I thought
I should give you a heads-up.

941
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:11,157
I'd like to…
apologize once again on his behalf.

942
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:13,659
I'm sorry.

943
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:21,459
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

944
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:31,344
Did you tell him?

945
01:05:31,969 --> 01:05:33,304
Yes. What about you?

946
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:35,890
Yes, me too.

947
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,477
What did Professor Park say?

948
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:42,313
I'm banned from the OR for the time being.

949
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:45,399
I see.

950
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:50,529
You don't seem worried though.

951
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:53,532
I know.

952
01:05:54,158 --> 01:05:55,284
I wonder why.

953
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:27,984
Oh, well.

954
01:06:55,052 --> 01:06:57,930
I'm curious about something, sir.

955
01:06:58,723 --> 01:06:59,682
About what?

956
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:03,269
Why keep putting them
up against each other?

957
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,981
Let's be honest. With your order alone,

958
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:09,525
Doldam can be bulldozed right away.

959
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:12,111
Why do you keep fueling the fire?

960
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:14,030
I have to go.

961
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,115
We'll talk again another time.

962
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:24,498
Still no word from Chairman Shin?

963
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:29,003
No, sir. I contacted him three times
and said that you wish to speak with him.

964
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:30,838
I'll try contacting him again, sir.

965
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,431
What could the reason be?

966
01:07:58,032 --> 01:08:00,576
It's been a while, Doctor Kim.

967
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:06,665
TOWED VEHICLE STORAGE

968
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:11,587
You found out today
that your car was towed?

969
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,590
I've been so busy and preoccupied.

970
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:18,677
It's been one thing after another
since that day.

971
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:21,055
On top of that, my mom came by yesterday.

972
01:08:22,473 --> 01:08:23,974
This will cost quite a bit.

973
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:28,062
My mom cut off my credit card,
so I'm broke now.

974
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:31,690
Wait here. I'll go settle this.

975
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,818
TOWED VEHICLE STORAGE

976
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,640
I owe this much for a towed car?

977
01:09:04,723 --> 01:09:08,894
You should've picked it up sooner.
You owe more because it's been a few days.

978
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:11,647
Gosh.

979
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:16,986
CLAIM YOUR VEHICLE HERE

980
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:21,282
Can you believe this?

981
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:25,119
They dragged my car away
and charged me a fortune.

982
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:27,079
How much do I owe in total?

983
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:28,789
Gosh.

984
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:31,750
Woo-jin.

985
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:36,589
Where did he go?

986
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:40,384
Woo-jin!

987
01:09:42,386 --> 01:09:43,429
Woo-jin.

988
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:47,308
Hey, where are you?

989
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:49,310
Woo-jin!

990
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,146
Woo-jin!
