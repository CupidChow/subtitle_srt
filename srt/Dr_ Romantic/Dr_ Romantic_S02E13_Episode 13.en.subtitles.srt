1
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,629
These are the people I've been talking to.

2
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:51,968
I'm almost done with the top five,
and the others are under negotiation.

3
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,888
I'm sure most of them will cross over.

4
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,892
Let's add one more person to the list.

5
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,651
Can you do this?

6
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,652
Wellâ€¦

7
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,572
Why is that old man
so obsessed with that hospital?

8
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,283
It's not the hospital. It's that guy.

9
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,661
Doctor Kim.

10
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:21,790
Mr. Do has been

11
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,667
requesting to see Chairman Shin.

12
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,629
It looks like he's pushing ahead
with the project

13
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,173
with a pretty big construction company.

14
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,759
And it seems like

15
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,929
the board members
are supporting his project.

16
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:41,976
Wouldn't it be better to do something now
before he gets this on the agenda?

17
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,440
Why do you keep hesitating?

18
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:51,569
I don't have a huge reason.
It's only because of people.

19
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:58,159
We can't run a hospital
just because we have a building.

20
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:03,665
In the end, we need good doctors
and medical staff for it to run smoothly.

21
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,751
Aren't doctors Kang Dong-ju
and Yun Seo-jeong

22
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,212
returning next year?

23
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,298
And you have a new OS doctor

24
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,092
and two fellows as well.

25
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:19,430
That's true, but we still need a leader
who is more experienced.

26
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,516
You're here.

27
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,436
Why would we need another leader here?

28
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,747
Do you think you've won?

29
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,339
Doctor Park.

30
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:59,345
Do you use your scalpel to win?

31
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,311
Isn't it a bit troubling
for a doctor to be like that?

32
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,858
Something about that guy is

33
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,235
provoking Professor Park in some way.

34
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,448
And now, it's a fight over their pride.

35
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,660
Is Doctor Kim that amazing?

36
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,578
Hey.

37
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:27,040
Even Woo-jin is getting cheeky
because he has him on his side.

38
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,501
There's nothing much I can do
for my old fogey.

39
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,545
So?

40
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,633
Can you get rid of him?

41
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,054
SEO WOO-JIN

42
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,654
What are you doing, man?
Greet your brothers when you see them.

43
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:01,449
I don't need him to greet me.
Let's go somewhere and talk, Woo-jin.

44
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,912
Do you want to make a scene

45
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:07,497
or go quietly?

46
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,228
CLAIM YOUR VEHICLE HERE

47
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,816
Can you believe this?

48
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,695
They dragged my car away
and charged me a fortune.

49
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,989
How much do I owe in total?

50
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,282
Gosh.

51
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,285
Woo-jin.

52
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,123
Where did he go?

53
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,668
Woo-jin!

54
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:55,962
Woo-jin!

55
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,047
Woo-jin!

56
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:15,064
DEFENSE MECHANISM

57
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,275
11 HOURS AGO

58
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:21,738
It's healing well.

59
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,616
Think about who sutured that.
I'm sure it's healing well.

60
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:28,578
I'm all done.

61
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,373
Let's take out the stitches
in three to four days.

62
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,083
Sure, Doc.

63
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,169
How's your wrist?

64
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,463
-It's fine.
-What about your elbow?

65
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,089
Gosh, that's fine too.

66
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,259
When will you schedule your surgery
for the CTS?

67
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,471
That's something for OS to look into.

68
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,223
Am I not allowed to know when it is?

69
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,309
I mean, I'm still your doctor.

70
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,313
My doctor?

71
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,942
Until I take your stitches out,
yes, I am your doctor.

72
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,196
Have you been bored?

73
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,366
It's not that I'm bored.
I'm worried as your doctor.

74
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,661
How long will you stay away from the OR?

75
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,916
Please leave that matter to me.

76
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,585
That's between Professor Park and me.

77
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,507
When you have enough time,

78
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,260
you should go study
as many cases as you can, Doctor.

79
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,389
A surgeon's scalpel should be

80
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,808
kept sharp even when he takes time off.

81
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,643
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

82
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,688
Please excuse me.

83
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,107
Sure.

84
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,249
Do you have the schedule
for the Whipple procedure?

85
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,500
Oh, actually,

86
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,045
Professor Sim hasn't confirmed it.

87
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,134
Should I start worrying about
booking operations too?

88
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,345
No, sir. I'll sort it out right away.

89
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,307
Where's Professor Sim?

90
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,976
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

91
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,688
What's the problem, Professor Sim?

92
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,652
Why haven't you scheduled
Kang Ik-joon's surgery yet?

93
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,364
I already told the patient
we'll be doing his surgery within the day.

94
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,367
-Something is troubling me.
-What's troubling you?

95
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,121
The OP lab results looked fine,
but the EKG looked a bit odd.

96
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:41,002
-What about the EKG?
-It looked like he has WPW syndrome.

97
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,295
WPW?

98
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:43,963
WPW?

99
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:47,842
Let's consult Internal Medicine first
before we operate on him.

100
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,475
-Ask Internal Medicine for cooperation.
-Yes, sir.

101
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,102
TREATMENT ROOM 3

102
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,317
Yes, Professor Na. This is Yang Ho-jun.

103
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:09,113
I'm sure you know
how important this surgery is for me.

104
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,406
Of course I do.

105
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,160
That's why I suggest we be extra careful.

106
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:26,964
Gosh, I'm late.

107
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:30,885
My gosh, I completely overslept.
I'm totally impossible.

108
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:35,515
I set up two alarms, but I never
heard them and slept through both.

109
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,309
Have you ever operated
on a patient with WPW syndrome?

110
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,353
Yes, just once.

111
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,355
We consulted with Cardiology,

112
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:45,483
conducted an EP study, and performed
an ablation before the surgery.

113
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,860
Why? Was someone
diagnosed with WPW syndrome?

114
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,570
It's Professor Park's VIP.

115
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,531
I think he has that.

116
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,449
Should we date?

117
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,417
Goodness, I got a call.
Let's talk again later.

118
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,460
Hey, wait.

119
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,714
What?

120
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,551
Do I have sleep in my eyes again?

121
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,303
Have a great day today.

122
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,058
My gosh. I'm busy right now. Come on.

123
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:25,106
You too, Woo-jin. Have a great day.

124
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:39,745
Nurse Park.

125
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,339
-Who are we getting?
-We have a patient!

126
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,849
Into the hybrid room, hurry!

127
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:06,063
-What are his vitals?
-100 over 70, 140 bpm.

128
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,316
Let's move the patient. One, two, three.

129
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,530
Establish both lines, do an OP lab test,
and request two packs of RBC.

130
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,657
-Got it.
-Is he all right other than his leg?

131
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,118
Yes, his leg was severed
by a machine in the factory.

132
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:22,204
His co-workers tied up his leg
right after the incident.

133
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:26,125
-So he didn't bleed as much.
-Okay, we won't undo his belt.

134
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,628
I'm sorry.

135
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,046
I ran a little late.

136
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,552
-Give me gauze with Betadine and dry pads.
-Yes, sir.

137
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,398
What should I do with his severed leg?

138
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,779
-Nurse Park, please take the stump.
-Okay, I'll take it.

139
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:55,696
Cool it off first.

140
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,783
Don't let the cross-section get dry.
Use gauze soaked in saline.

141
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,077
-Yes, sir.
-I'll do it with you, Nurse Park.

142
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,338
-What are his vitals?
-100 over 60, 135 bpm.

143
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,507
Shoot in five ml of morphine.

144
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:20,680
Sir, hangâ€¦
Hang in there. I'll give it to you now.

145
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,515
Hang in there just a little longer.

146
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,560
Doctor Bae.

147
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,770
How is he doing?

148
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,856
He's a thigh amputation patient.
He needs surgery immediately.

149
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,192
Mr. Heo, does he work at a factory?

150
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,403
-Yes.
-Did you get a hold of his guardian?

151
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,738
-His guardian is on the way.
-Okay.

152
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,574
CS. We're going in as a combined surgery.

153
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,326
CS COMBINE: COOPERATIVE PROCEDURE WITH CS

154
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,327
Doctor Bae.

155
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:47,456
Call Anesthesiology
and please get ready for the surgery.

156
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,374
Yes, sir.

157
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,793
Then we'll fix his bones first
in a supine position,

158
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,087
then conduct the CS in a prone position.

159
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,297
Ms. Oh, please take his X-ray.

160
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,007
-Yes, sir.
-Sir.

161
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,093
Let me take a look at your wound.

162
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,971
Ms. Oh, please get forceps
and some gauze ready.

163
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,106
Cover it with gauze.

164
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:22,700
What is it?

165
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:27,747
Well, I'm not a cardiologist,
so it's tough to decide on the OP risk.

166
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,831
So what?

167
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,543
-What should we do?
-You should probably run more tests

168
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,336
before you go ahead with the surgery.

169
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,590
Since we don't have the equipment,
he should go to the main hospital.

170
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:41,635
He's a patient who came all the way here
and waited for me to perform his surgery.

171
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,764
Don't you think it'd be a bit awkward
to send him back to the main hospital?

172
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,390
Right, it's a bit awkward.

173
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,225
Then what should we do?

174
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,269
Wellâ€¦

175
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:54,148
This is a young patient
who has been fine without any symptoms.

176
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,860
Since the patient is young,
his cancer is progressing quickly

177
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,320
and very aggressively.

178
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,407
It reached his biliary tract
and transverse colon in just a month.

179
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,621
It looks like both sides come with a risk.

180
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,289
Yes, you're right.

181
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,501
Let's do this.

182
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:20,132
He'll be tested at the main hospital
after we operate on him.

183
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,552
-What do you think?
-Pardon?

184
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,814
As soon as you give us an answer,

185
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:38,275
we'll discuss it with Anesthesiology
and go ahead with the surgery.

186
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,235
You may go.

187
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,369
-What is it?
-It's an acute appendicitis patient.

188
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:52,540
-He needs surgery now. What should I do?
-Hey! Why are you asking him?

189
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:55,292
We're already busy enough here
with the VIP's surgery.

190
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,712
Go talk to your chief surgeon,
Doctor Kim or whatever.

191
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:02,258
There's an amputee, so he'll be
conducting a combined surgery with OS.

192
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,052
If you lift my surgery ban, I'll do it.

193
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,222
Doctor Yang, go down and get it done.

194
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,933
-Me?
-It's a quick surgery.

195
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,560
Go do it.

196
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:14,812
Right, yes.

197
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,689
I'll call Anesthesiology.

198
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,616
What are you talking about?

199
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,243
Why can't I use OR one?

200
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:32,079
President Park told us
to leave OR one empty

201
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,290
because of the VIP's surgery.

202
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,376
Even if the president wanted that,
this is still an operating room.

203
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:40,296
I'm opening this as an anesthesiologist.
What is this nonsense?

204
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,714
I understand that too.

205
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,593
But it was the president's order.
You can do it in OR two.

206
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:49,138
This is a thigh amputee,
which requires precision in the surgery!

207
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,057
We need the equipment in OR one!

208
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,475
Don't you get it?

209
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,935
I do get it.

210
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,397
But I can't help you.
It was the president's order.

211
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,565
Just do it in OR two.

212
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,151
I'm going to use OR two, Mr. Heo.

213
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:07,781
The VIP patient's surgery will be delayed
because he needs to be tested again.

214
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,950
-Butâ€¦
-Appendicitis patient incoming.

215
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,368
Go to OR two, please.

216
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,334
I don't care if he's the president.

217
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,711
The anesthesiology department
has the authority

218
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,338
to open and close ORs.

219
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,549
This is obviously an act of arrogation.
Do you understand?

220
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,848
What? That's what Professor Sim said?

221
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,058
What should I do?

222
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,268
Should I notify President Park?

223
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,311
Gosh, darn it.

224
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,854
RESTRICTED AREA: OPERATING ROOM

225
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,231
Let's talk after the appendectomy.

226
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:45,069
We don't have to tell him right now. Okay?

227
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:53,869
What?
The patient refuses to be operated on?

228
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,537
Why?

229
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,624
I think he's concerned about
the cost of the operation.

230
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,002
The cost of the operation?

231
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:08,258
I heard my leg may not be 100 percent
okay again even if I get the surgery.

232
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,844
You expect me to get the expensive surgery

233
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,888
without a guarantee
that I'll be perfectly fine?

234
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,809
If it's processed as an industrial
accident, you won't have to pay as much.

235
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,228
Even if that gets processed,

236
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,773
I'll have to pay quite a lot
out of my own pocket.

237
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,653
I don't have that kind of money.

238
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:31,824
Nurse Park.

239
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,576
No one is here from the factory?

240
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,913
No.
There's no one here from the factory yet.

241
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,087
How has no one shown up yet

242
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,465
when someone's wounded that badly?

243
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,977
Excuse me, I'm looking for Lee Dong-woo.

244
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:06,358
-Are you Mr. Lee's guardian?
-Yes, he's my husband.

245
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,068
Where is he?

246
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,155
I heard he hurt his leg.

247
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,615
Is he badly wounded?

248
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,335
What are we going to do?

249
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,714
My gosh, no!

250
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,680
-No.
-Seung-ae.

251
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,307
Oh, no.

252
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,064
I told you to be careful.

253
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,109
I told you to always be careful!

254
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,444
What are you going to do now?

255
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:36,573
Whatâ€¦ What are we going to do now?

256
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,701
Honey, what are we going to do?
What about our family?

257
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,411
What are you going to do?

258
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,622
-Oh, no.
-Iâ€¦

259
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,584
I was careless, that's why.

260
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,047
How can something like this happen?

261
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:02,808
Oh, no.

262
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:07,146
Honey, what are we going to do?

263
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,065
What now?

264
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,406
Why is my mom crying?

265
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:26,373
Your dad got badly wounded,
so she seems a bit shocked.

266
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,251
Why don't we go out for a bit?

267
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,087
I have a delicious lollipop.

268
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,173
Why is my mom crying?

269
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:51,648
Ma'am, you won't find a way out of this
by crying your heart out.

270
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,359
Sir. You need to have an operation now.

271
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,070
An operation?

272
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:58,614
An operation?

273
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,659
Then will his leg be saved?

274
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,328
What are you saying?

275
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:10,167
Even if they stitch it back together,
it won't be 100 percent recovered.

276
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,963
How much you're able to recover
depends on how determined you are.

277
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:20,385
If the surgery goes wrong, by any chance,
and my leg necrotizes,

278
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,805
I heard I'll have to
amputate my leg again.

279
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,183
That means I'll need another surgery.

280
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,144
I'm sorry,

281
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,563
but I can't get such a surgery.

282
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:37,486
I don't have millions of won I can spend
on a surgery that has no guarantee.

283
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,739
And I can't pay it all back
after I throw in all of that money.

284
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:45,452
So you're going to
give up on your leg because of money?

285
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,454
Oh, no.

286
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:48,622
I can't help it.

287
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,749
This is my life.

288
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,336
I'll just consider myself unlucky.

289
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:56,922
What can I do?

290
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,262
Hey, man.

291
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,807
Your son can hear you outside.

292
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:12,604
How can you say that as a father?
You're only blaming your fate and luck.

293
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,315
Do you think anyone will pity you?

294
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:19,236
The world doesn't care about someone
who's willing to give up that easily.

295
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,946
No, it's not just the world.

296
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:24,866
Your son will also see that,
remember that, learn that from you,

297
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,119
and always blame his fate and luck.

298
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,496
He'll say that the world is what it is.

299
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:33,083
If he loses a leg and doesn't have money,
he'll say there's nothing he can do.

300
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,670
He'll remember you as a father
who gave up on himself that easily!

301
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,846
Stop shouting at my dad.

302
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:49,474
He's wounded right now.
Why are you getting angry at him?

303
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:53,937
Stop crying.

304
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,905
Your son is much better than you.

305
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,077
Jun-young, come here.

306
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,746
Come here.

307
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,463
What are we going to do?

308
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:30,932
I'm sorry.

309
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,809
It's all my fault.

310
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:38,899
I'm sorry.

311
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,484
I'm sorry.

312
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:45,697
I'm sorry.

313
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,950
I'm sorry.

314
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,118
I'm sorryâ€¦

315
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,251
To what extentâ€¦

316
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,880
should we treat our patients?

317
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,638
I'm sorry.

318
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,476
How farâ€¦

319
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:19,189
should we look into their wounds?

320
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,543
RESTRICTED AREA: OPERATING ROOM

321
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,640
This is a thigh amputee.

322
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,602
Doctor Kim will come in later
for the vascular surgery.

323
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,271
May I begin?

324
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:00,856
Yes, you may begin.

325
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,443
-Check the tourniquet time, please.
-Yes, sir.

326
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,487
I'll fix the bones with plates first.

327
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:08,947
FIXING BONES: SECURING BONES

328
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,574
Let's begin with a bone reduction.

329
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,075
REDUCTION: SETTING BROKEN BONES

330
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,535
Self-retaining retractors.

331
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,290
One more.

332
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,793
Bone holding clamps, please.

333
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,253
CLAMPS THAT HOLD DOWN BONES

334
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,680
OR1, OR2

335
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,519
-What now?
-Another patient who needs surgery.

336
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:43,064
-Again? What's this case?
-Acute appendicitis.

337
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:46,443
Why is it another acute appendicitis?
I just got out of an appendectomy.

338
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:49,654
I said it's an acute appendicitis patient
because we have an appendicitis patient.

339
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,449
If you ask me why,
I can't give you an answer for that.

340
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:55,243
It's not like I went out to pick them up.

341
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:02,167
There's always a day like this one.
I'll get ready.

342
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,588
Hey.

343
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:10,550
Why am I working on appendicitis patients
while my head is blowing up thinking about

344
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:14,095
-the VIP's Whipple procedure?
-I don't think you should be asking me.

345
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,807
Darn it, that littleâ€¦

346
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:20,435
Goodness.

347
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,441
Yes. Doctor Yang, it's the president.

348
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,401
Please put him on speakerphone.

349
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,490
Yes, Professor Park. This is Yang Ho-jun.

350
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:36,785
Are you still waiting for an answer
from Internal Medicine regarding Mr. Kang?

351
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:40,163
Oh, well, I'm still in the OR.

352
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,415
Why is the appendectomy taking forever?

353
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:46,503
Well, we had two appendicitis patients
in a row.

354
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,505
I'm operating on the second patient.

355
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,800
He can't help it.

356
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:55,262
You tied up Doctor Seo's hands.

357
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,559
It sounds like he's quite angry.

358
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:05,272
He has been killing me lately.
He's been really harsh.

359
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,363
Professor Na, it's me.

360
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,783
Please hand your answer directly to me,

361
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,410
not through Ho-jun.

362
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:19,661
Right now.

363
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,626
Hello?

364
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,461
This is Seo Woo-jin.

365
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,131
We received another trauma patient.

366
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:35,260
He fell off a ladder.
It looks like a blunt abdominal injury.

367
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,179
He needs an emergency operation
right after the CT scan.

368
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,640
Should I hand it over to Doctor Yang,

369
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,018
or will you do it this time?

370
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,651
All right, sir.
I'll toss the patient to Doctor Yang.

371
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:04,664
Doctor Seo, you are pretty persistent.

372
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,000
Me?

373
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:11,504
You continuously provoke
President Park on purpose.

374
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,633
I have no other choice.

375
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,053
We have trauma patients piling up,
and I can't sit around forever.

376
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:21,681
-This is my way of protesting.
-Little strokes fell great oaks.

377
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,643
-Is it something like that?
-Let's strike him until he falls down.

378
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,102
It's something like that.

379
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,229
Doctor Yoon.

380
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:29,648
Yes?

381
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,320
Please take a CT scan
of the abdominal injury patient

382
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,322
and get ready to do an emergency operation

383
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,449
-I'll notify OR two.
-Yes, Doctor.

384
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,327
Doctor Seo, it's for you.

385
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,287
It's the president.

386
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,248
Take it.

387
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:52,754
Yes, this is Seo Woo-jin.

388
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,423
It's only until the VIP's surgery is over.

389
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:58,385
Until then, you're in charge
of emergency trauma patients.

390
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,970
Do not bother my teammates anymore.

391
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:03,848
Do you understand?

392
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,607
No way.

393
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,445
I'll get ready for the surgery.

394
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:24,619
Goodness, he has changed a lot.

395
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,706
He's never smiled that much before.
Isn't that right, Ms. Oh?

396
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,375
He's getting used to Doldam Hospital.

397
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,474
C-arm, please.

398
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:51,771
Turn on the C-arm.

399
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,861
Okay. The reduction looks great.

400
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,447
Six hole plate, please.

401
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,870
Guide, please.

402
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:12,959
Drill.

403
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:19,507
Turn on the C-arm. Shoot.

404
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,641
Excuse me, Doctor.

405
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,268
I have something to say.

406
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,186
Yes?

407
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,314
Actually, I'm out of the medication.

408
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:35,940
The medication?

409
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,442
Oh, you know.

410
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,861
The pills you gave me for nausea.

411
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,362
Oh, right. And?

412
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,783
If you give me the prescription, I'll--

413
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,951
You don't need a prescription.

414
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,912
It was a pancreatic enzyme.

415
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,039
What?

416
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,502
"Pancreatic enzyme"?

417
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,005
Digestive medicine?

418
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:00,715
Yes.

419
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,720
I'm sorry, Doctor.

420
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:10,934
Then the drug I've been taking
before going into the OR wasâ€¦

421
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,603
digestive medicine?

422
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,233
That's right. It was digestive medicine.

423
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,322
I'm sorry.

424
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:28,535
I get oddly hungry
whenever I come into the OR.

425
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,330
I'm hungry.

426
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:41,005
But still, how could you give me
digestive medicine?

427
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,137
Have a seat.

428
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:58,356
I discussed your case
with a neurosurgeon I know.

429
00:30:58,481 --> 00:30:59,440
And he thought

430
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:03,611
you were getting nauseated not because
of the operation but because of pressure.

431
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:07,824
He said the pressure to do well
becomes maximized in confined spaces

432
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:11,619
like operating rooms,
and that it seemed like your body

433
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,955
was reacting to that pressure immediately.

434
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,000
Eun-jae.

435
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:22,046
There's no need to feel pressured anymore.

436
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:27,552
You've been doing well to this day,
and you'll keep doing well too.

437
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,429
Don't you think?

438
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,027
What are you doing here?

439
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:47,822
Eun-jae.

440
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,242
It was a pancreatic enzyme.

441
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,202
What was?

442
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,664
The medicine for nausea
that Doctor Kim gave me.

443
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,251
It was digestive medicine.

444
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,464
I knew it was weird.

445
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,093
Whenever I was in the OR,
I always felt like I was starving.

446
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,972
I'm normally not the type to binge eat
in the middle of the night.

447
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,724
But

448
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,226
he gave me digestive medicine.

449
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,230
What am I going to do now?

450
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,442
What do you mean?
Keep doing what you've been doing.

451
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:29,113
I don't think the digestive medicine
was what you trusted anyway.

452
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,490
What do you mean?

453
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:36,204
You need to find the answer by yourself.

454
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:46,381
Depth gauge.

455
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,804
The 36 mm locking screw, please.

456
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:13,825
The placebo effect wasn't caused
by the digestive medicine?

457
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:17,996
Then what could it be?

458
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,291
What are you doing? Are you on break?

459
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,712
Go away, kid.

460
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,089
I got these macarons from Seoul.

461
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,926
Do you want some?
I've been put on a fast, so I can't eat.

462
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,888
I have a lot on my mind,
so stop bothering me.

463
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,113
Sir.

464
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,532
I'm here.

465
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:55,700
My goodness.

466
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,079
-We had loads of emergency patients.
-Professor Na left his answer there.

467
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,124
Take that down to Professor Sim,
have a discussion with her,

468
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,169
-and schedule the surgery within the day.
-Yes, sir.

469
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:09,672
REQUEST FOR CONSULTATION

470
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,052
Excuse me, sir.

471
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:17,055
Professor Sim is in another surgery.

472
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:21,809
Never mind.
I'll schedule it as soon as possible.

473
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,354
Did you leave OR one empty?

474
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,107
Wellâ€¦

475
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,486
We had a thigh amputee.

476
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,823
The surgery requires a lot of precision,
so they needed the equipment there.

477
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,912
Of course Mr. Heo and I stopped them,
but Doctor Kim just rushed inâ€¦

478
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,124
Do you fear
Doctor Bu Yong-ju more than me?

479
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,042
Pardon?

480
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:50,046
No, sir. Why would I do that?
It's not like that.

481
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:53,174
How much more will you disappoint me,
Doctor Yang?

482
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,511
I apologize.
I will fix everything immediately.

483
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,771
RESTRICTED AREA: OPERATING ROOM

484
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,440
Darn it.

485
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,411
What is it, Doctor Yang?

486
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,288
Can you come out for a second?

487
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,334
I have the answer from Internal Medicine.

488
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:32,797
Can't you see that I'm in surgery?

489
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,216
Could you please spare just five minutes?

490
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,427
Professor Park is absolutely furious.

491
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:42,098
I can't check everything in five anyway.
Wait until I'm done.

492
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,558
Professor.

493
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:58,406
I think there's more bleeding.

494
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:02,493
It looks like you patched up his vessels.
Do you think his spleen is ruptured?

495
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,744
I don't think so.

496
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,376
His diaphragm is ripped.

497
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,552
Doctor Seo.

498
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,641
Doctor Seo, are you about toâ€¦

499
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,270
What?

500
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,646
A torn diaphragm?

501
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:36,777
It's a patient with a blunt abdomen injury
and I'm on his large bowel rupture.

502
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,030
But we found a torn diaphragm
during the OP.

503
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,324
Can you come in right now, Doctor Cha?

504
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:42,992
Are you kidding me?

505
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,078
Why are you asking me
to work on that right now?

506
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:48,539
You're on speakerphone.
Everyone can hear you.

507
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,047
Excuse me, Doctor Seo.

508
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,799
What more do you want to see?

509
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,720
Will it make you happier to see me
collapsed on the floor of the OR?

510
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,640
Don't worry.
I'll carry you on my back and run again.

511
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,815
Where's your confidence?
You've already done a number of surgeries.

512
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:18,694
The penetrating injury patient in the ER
that you saved,

513
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,989
the artery bypass, and the patient
with an umbrella in his chest.

514
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:25,368
You did well on all those.
And yesterday, you worked on a CABG case.

515
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:29,956
Yet you're still afraid of something,
Doctor Cha?

516
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,627
This means what I trusted wasâ€¦

517
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:40,132
Doctor Runner here
gave an excellent emergency treatment.

518
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,093
Don't check with me all the time.

519
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:46,055
You're leading this surgery,
so do what you think is right.

520
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:57,733
Make your decision within five minutes.
I'll wait for you, Doctor Cha.

521
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,652
Please hang up.

522
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:09,954
Shouldn't you go?

523
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,873
It sounds like they need you right now.

524
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:24,010
Doctor Seo, it's been almost five minutes.

525
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,554
Stop the bleeding and close him up.

526
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:30,391
This never happened before.
Ms. Oh and I are agreeing on something.

527
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:35,271
Listen to Ms. Oh, Doctor Seo.
Wrap this up already.

528
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,442
Doctor Seo.

529
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:43,988
Suture, please.

530
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,868
Doctor Cha is here.

531
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:20,024
The rupture was caused
by the pressure in his abdomen.

532
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:24,362
I said this last time,
but can't a GS surgeon take care of this?

533
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,905
Yes, I certainly can.

534
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,074
What?

535
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,243
So don't be afraid, and just do it.

536
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:35,831
Even if you get a panic attack,
run out after throwing up, or pass outâ€¦

537
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,000
I'm here to back you up.

538
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:50,846
Suture, please.

539
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:06,821
Focus.

540
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,839
-Cut.
-Cut.

541
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,179
Cut.

542
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:33,889
Cut.

543
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,603
We have a hemorrhage.

544
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,775
-Is it a clot?
-No, there seems to be another origin.

545
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,152
Scissors.

546
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,666
It's a blunt injury, right?

547
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,626
He fell off and crashed onto a rail.

548
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,545
-On his chest wall?
-No.

549
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:07,882
Slightly left of his umbilicus,
so I'm sure he didn't fall on his chest.

550
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,301
No injury is detected
along the chest wall.

551
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:14,722
It's a blunt abdominal injury,
so it can't be an issue with his lungs.

552
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:20,436
The phrenic vessel.

553
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,396
BLOOD VESSELS THAT SUPPLY THE DIAPHRAGM

554
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:34,158
I found it.
It was the phrenic vessel. Suture, please.

555
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:35,576
Gauze, please.

556
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,011
-Cut.
-Cut.

557
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,983
-Doctor Kim.
-Yes.

558
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:10,528
-You can come in when you're ready.
-All right.

559
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,446
RESTRICTED AREA: OPERATING ROOM

560
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,198
Gosh, you scared me.

561
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,451
What are you doing here?

562
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:22,414
Pardon? Oh, I'm waiting for Professor Sim.

563
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,376
-Are you feeling under the weather?
-Sorry?

564
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:27,253
No.

565
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,046
I mean, I'm fine.

566
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,967
Ask Doctor Jeong at the ER to examine you.

567
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,594
You don't look very well.

568
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,479
Go on. Get going.

569
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,731
RESTRICTED AREA: OPERATING ROOM

570
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:58,701
-Cut.
-Cut.

571
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,538
You can finish up, Doctor Seo.

572
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,874
-Do you have a prior commitment?
-Yes.

573
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,544
I have to go to OR one.

574
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,214
-Good work.
-Thank you for your help.

575
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:14,758
Well done.

576
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,435
Let's finish up. Suture, please.

577
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:29,231
I'm sorry I'm late.

578
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:33,152
Why bother? You shouldn't have come at all
if you were going to be late.

579
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,487
I'm a cardiac surgeon. I should be here.

580
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:39,158
From now on, I'll attend
every single one of your operations.

581
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:42,202
My, you're brimming with enthusiasm.

582
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:43,370
I like that.

583
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:46,624
Eun-jae.

584
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,210
Will you be okay?

585
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:53,339
Yes, of course.
I already took care of an operation.

586
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:55,090
I'll be totally fine.

587
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,682
All right. Attention, everyone.

588
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:07,603
Despite his difficult situation,
this patient didn't give up

589
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:10,689
and decided to get an operation.

590
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:14,360
Let's do our best so he can walk again.

591
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:16,320
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

592
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:20,616
All right then.
We'll start with the artery.

593
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:21,742
Irrigation.

594
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,206
Sponge stick.

595
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,126
Suture.

596
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,308
-Cut.
-Cut.

597
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,894
-Cut.
-Cut.

598
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:24,346
REQUEST FOR CONSULTATION

599
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,473
RESTRICTED AREA: OPERATING ROOM

600
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,652
What brings you here? You didn't call.

601
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:41,697
No reason.

602
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:45,075
I was in the area
and thought I should stop by.

603
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:46,660
Please take a seat.

604
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:50,289
It's okay.
I don't want to take up your time.

605
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:53,208
I heard the second son
of Sejen Group's chairman is here.

606
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,920
Yes. That's correct.

607
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:02,801
-Has his surgery been booked yet?
-I'm discussing it with Anesthesiology.

608
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:07,306
Professor Park.

609
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:11,310
I suppose you like
to keep things to yourself.

610
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:15,731
Sir, I wasâ€¦

611
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,443
planning on telling you after the surgery.

612
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:27,576
I truly hope the surgery goes well.

613
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:31,663
I'm not sure if you know this,
but Sejen Group

614
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:35,375
has a very close relationship
with our foundation.

615
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,307
-Doctor Yoon.
-Yes.

616
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:52,351
What are you reading so intently?

617
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,062
I'm taking my medical board exam soon.
I'm cramming.

618
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,313
I see.

619
00:46:57,314 --> 00:47:00,734
I suppose you'll go back
to the main hospital if you pass the exam.

620
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:03,403
Not sure. I haven't thought about that.

621
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,780
You can't go anywhere.

622
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:07,616
-You're perfect for our hospital.
-You really think so?

623
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,660
Thank you.

624
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,329
-You like hearing that?
-What?

625
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:17,960
Here.

626
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,838
You must be tired. Drink this, ladies.

627
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:27,094
-What's all this, Mr. Jang?
-I haven't been attentive to the ER staff.

628
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:30,055
-Take a quick break and enjoy the drink.
-Thank you for this.

629
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:31,139
Thank you.

630
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:36,937
By the way, is everything okay these days?

631
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,022
What do you mean?

632
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,148
Well, you know.

633
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:43,360
Has anyone stopped by
to check up on you guys?

634
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:47,281
Or has anyone approached you
regarding a position elsewhere?

635
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:51,368
Oh, are you talking about Im Hyun-jun?

636
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,997
I saw him again earlier today.

637
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,499
You did? Where did you see him?

638
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,336
Well, Iâ€¦

639
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,090
-The thing isâ€¦
-My gosh.

640
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,175
Is that Doctor Jeong?

641
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,429
-I can't believe this.
-Okay.

642
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:14,308
He's even convinced Doctor Jeong already?

643
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,518
Darn it.

644
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,730
Here's the contract they gave me.

645
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:24,443
Please go over it,
and give me a signed copy by tomorrow.

646
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:33,035
You're getting everything you asked for,
so you should just sign it.

647
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:37,039
You know this is a rare opportunity.

648
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,000
Doctor Jeong.

649
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:41,793
Yes.

650
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,176
What are you doing here?

651
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,761
Well, I was justâ€¦

652
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:54,222
I stopped him to ask
where the restroom is.

653
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:56,600
Butâ€¦

654
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:57,517
RESTROOM

655
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:58,644
It's right here.

656
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,521
My, where did the time go?

657
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:03,690
Please excuse me.

658
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:08,779
Hey, you.

659
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,240
You didn't think I'd know who you are?

660
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:15,077
Your name is Im Hyun-jun.

661
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:19,081
You're a headhunter
that steals hospital staff.

662
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,751
You already know that much about me?

663
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,295
You really are impressive,
Mr. Jang Gi-tae.

664
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,505
What?

665
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,966
How do you know my name?

666
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,051
Come on. How could I not know your name?

667
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,887
You're like a legend in this industry.

668
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:35,722
"A legend"?

669
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,100
Me?

670
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,728
This hospital is running a deficit.

671
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:46,149
The only reason it can still operate
is all thanks to your management skills.

672
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:49,444
That's what everyone says.
You didn't know?

673
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,948
No, not at all.

674
00:49:56,118 --> 00:50:02,290
To be honest, it's a little embarrassing
to say this myselfâ€¦

675
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:06,169
but it's not entirely wrong.

676
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,384
Right, that being saidâ€¦

677
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,805
how about I connect you with a job
at a good hospital in Seoul?

678
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,851
Sorry? Me?

679
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:25,230
People will fight to hire you once they
find out that you're on the market.

680
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,233
You really think so?

681
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:34,197
Feel free to call me if you're interested.

682
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:35,824
CEO IM HYUN-JUN

683
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,952
I'll take good care of you.

684
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,881
OPERATING ROOM 1

685
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:04,227
Occupational accident benefits?
That will be hard.

686
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:10,525
But earlier, the doctor said that
the company will help us file a claim.

687
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,612
He's agreed to write a doctor's note.

688
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:16,615
Gosh, those things are useless.

689
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:22,329
Listen. Why don't you
just settle with the company?

690
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,122
Settle with the company?

691
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,083
What do you mean by that?

692
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:29,503
Oh, it means that the company
will compensate you

693
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,505
by using their own insurance package.

694
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:34,341
The government
deals with occupational accident claims,

695
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,802
but the company will take care of this.

696
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,554
At the end of the day,
it's the same thing.

697
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:43,433
Really? I've never heard
of such a case before.

698
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:46,478
Let's be realistic here.
We're not even the main contractor.

699
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:50,857
We're basically a subcontractor,
so it'll be hard for you to get benefits.

700
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:53,610
That's where the company insurance
comes in handy.

701
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:57,114
Like you said, there's always a solution.

702
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:02,244
It's not like the occupational benefits
will give you a bigger payout.

703
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:04,329
The hospital isn't a charity organization.

704
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:07,124
Expensive procedures
aren't even covered by insurance.

705
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:11,419
At the end of the day, what they do
is take money from poor people like us.

706
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:14,047
You understand what I'm saying, right?

707
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,137
-Doctor.
-Hello.

708
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,806
Is my husband out of surgery?

709
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,475
Yes, we moved him to the ICU just now.

710
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:28,603
The surgery went well,
so let's see how he recovers.

711
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:30,856
-Thank you. Thank you so much.
-Okay.

712
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:34,276
Is this gentleman from the factory?

713
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:36,153
-Yes.
-That's right.

714
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:38,613
I manage the factory.

715
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:41,158
Don't listen to him.
He's talking crazy nonsense.

716
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,035
-Pardon me?
-What?

717
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:49,249
As I explained to you before the surgery,
your husband suffered nerve damage,

718
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:51,918
so he may be left with a disability.

719
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:56,006
That's why you must file a claim
to get compensated

720
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:58,967
according to
the severity of his disability.

721
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:02,888
If you settle with the factory,
you won't receive such benefits.

722
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:07,559
We're a subcontractor of a subcontractor,
so it doesn't apply to us.

723
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:08,685
Goodness.

724
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:12,355
Look, what are you talking about?

725
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:15,442
Death and any injury or illness
that takes over three days to treat

726
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:18,778
can be compensated for under
the Industrial Accident Compensation Act.

727
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,947
That's the law.

728
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:24,492
You folks just don't want
to go that route, right?

729
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:27,454
Because the claim
will make your premium go up,

730
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,289
and your factory will lose points.

731
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,290
Isn't that the reason?

732
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,542
What the heck are you talking about?

733
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:36,463
Listen, that's not true at all.

734
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:41,384
You didn't seem to know much about this,
so I came to tell you your options.

735
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:46,306
If you persuade this clueless woman
to settle with the company and get caught,

736
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,225
you'll be fined 15 million won.

737
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:49,684
Are you aware of that?

738
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:53,438
If you folks can afford that,
just give the money to your injured worker

739
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:54,731
to cheer him up.

740
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:57,317
How dare you try to trick them like this?

741
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,861
What is this? You should be ashamed.

742
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,696
What is your problem?

743
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:06,201
How dare you say such a thing?
When did I try to trick them?

744
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:09,371
Then what? Should I say
that you were trying to dupe her?

745
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:11,665
What? "Dupe her"?

746
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:14,042
Look, Doctor.

747
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:17,170
How old are you?

748
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:19,547
How dare you talk to me like this?

749
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:21,007
A man got injured!

750
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,885
You need to at least do your duty
before explaining

751
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,680
the company's circumstances.

752
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:28,139
What the heck is this?

753
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:31,810
I'm sure you're also a father
and the breadwinner of your family.

754
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:36,731
If you don't feel pity,
then at least pretend you're sorry.

755
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:41,987
Also, why the heck did you ask me my age?

756
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:47,075
You want to know my age?
I was born on November 3, 1964.

757
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:50,287
Gosh, I can't believe I'm saying this.

758
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:53,707
Good grief.

759
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:02,382
My goodness.

760
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,620
MILK

761
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,125
Drink it. It's yours.

762
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:38,960
You must be hungry.

763
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:44,591
I'm sorry I yelled earlier.

764
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,928
I was just worried about your dad.

765
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:51,765
I was frustrated
that he was refusing surgery.

766
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:53,516
Wellâ€¦

767
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:59,606
My mom also yells at him sometimes.
She says he frustrates her.

768
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:02,233
I see.

769
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:06,946
Mister, by the wayâ€¦

770
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:08,782
Yes?

771
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,534
Would you say you're a good surgeon?

772
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:14,162
Yes.

773
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:19,000
I'd say I amâ€¦

774
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:21,544
a great surgeon.

775
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:26,508
All right then.

776
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,356
I guess you were hungry.

777
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:09,217
If you notice someone,
you need to say hello.

778
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,556
We don't exactly
have that kind of relationship.

779
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:16,641
How's your wrist?

780
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:18,685
I heard it's pretty bad.

781
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:24,899
We're definitely not close enough
for you to ask about such things.

782
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:28,528
Do you and President Park get along?

783
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:34,284
He's actually
more close-minded than I thought.

784
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:38,538
He frustrates me sometimes.
I'm wondering if you're having any issues.

785
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:43,751
Does he know
that you talk about him behind his back?

786
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,547
About the VIP patientâ€¦

787
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:51,926
The foundation considers him
a very important client.

788
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,472
Pay more attention to him
as the chief of GS.

789
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:59,767
President Park will take good care of him.
He's his patient, after all.

790
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:04,397
Principled and inflexible people like him

791
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:08,359
mess up big time when they make a mistake.

792
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:12,655
You're talking
as if you want him to mess up.

793
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:17,035
No, why would I want that?
I'm just concerned. That's all.

794
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:22,373
I'll see you around.

795
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:24,375
Oh, right.

796
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:28,505
Give Ms. Jooâ€¦

797
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:30,924
my regards.

798
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:36,012
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

799
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,538
Here's the internist's answer.

800
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:08,127
As you can see,
the internist recommends additional tests

801
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,754
after the surgery.

802
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:13,258
Isn't Doctor Na a pulmonologist,
not a cardiologist?

803
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,300
Pardon me?

804
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:16,719
Right, yes.

805
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:19,931
It's still part of Internal Medicine.

806
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:25,770
Can you please just book the surgery?

807
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:29,023
You know that trouble happens
when you ignore a bad gut feeling.

808
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:32,819
You know that Professor Park
has been sensitive lately.

809
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,195
I sure do.

810
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:38,116
He's lost his cool,
which is very unlike him.

811
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:42,078
He's so anxious that he won't even listen.

812
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:43,580
Yes, exactly.

813
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:47,750
He's killing me.
I'm so stressed out these days.

814
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:50,378
Help me out, please.

815
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,298
Please schedule the surgery.

816
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:58,136
What if it were Doctor Seo
standing there right now, and not you?

817
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:02,807
-Sorry?
-He'd advise me against doing the surgery.

818
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,395
-Professor Sim.
-What do you say?

819
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:11,482
Shall I tell Professor Park myself?
Or would you prefer to do it yourself?

820
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:12,734
Tell him what?

821
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:17,113
That I oppose this surgery.
I keep getting a bad feeling about it.

822
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,617
PRESIDENT PARK MIN-GOOK

823
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:21,659
So?

824
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:24,579
She still hasn't scheduled the surgery?

825
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:28,291
Well, Professor Sim is being stubborn.

826
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:32,211
What the heck did you do all day?

827
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:33,588
I'm sorry, sir.

828
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:37,634
I kept you around for your wits,
not your skills. But you're useless now.

829
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:42,305
You can't even persuade Anesthesiology.
How could you ruin my plans like this?

830
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:45,224
I apologize, sir. I'm really sorry.

831
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,273
Go talk to the patient right now.

832
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:54,901
Let him know that the surgery
has been moved to tomorrow.

833
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:56,611
And I don't care what it takes.

834
01:00:57,945 --> 01:01:00,198
Make sure it gets scheduled tomorrow.

835
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:01,616
Got it?

836
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,535
Yes, sir. I'll make sure it's done.

837
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:13,378
What an idiot.

838
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:25,640
PARKING VIOLATION

839
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:28,142
-What is this?
-What's wrong? What is it?

840
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:31,771
Was your car towed?

841
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:33,356
I guess so.

842
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:34,482
What do I do?

843
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:40,780
Hey!

I completely forgot about it.

01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:50,998
Shall I come with you?

847
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:53,918
Oh, would you?

848
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:56,671
I'd be so grateful.

849
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:57,630
Buy me dinner.

850
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:00,466
-Yes, of course.
-It should include some meat.

851
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:01,426
Hey.

852
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:04,220
I told you I'm broke. My mom cut me off.

853
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:06,848
Hey! Wait up!

854
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,558
I want beef.

855
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:11,477
What? Beef? Don't do this to me.

856
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,730
I have a better idea.
How about fried chicken?

857
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:16,858
-I no longer eat fried chicken.
-Are you ill, my friend?

858
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:19,861
-Why won't you eat fried chicken?
-Let go of me.

859
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:23,531
How could you not eatâ€¦
Hey! Why won't you eat fried chicken?

860
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:27,243
How cute.

861
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:30,329
Right, Elizabeth?

862
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:35,835
You can't do that.
Why refuse fried chicken? Are you crazy?

863
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:39,130
Be honest with me.
Do you have money to get there?

864
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,674
-I don't either.
-Why you littleâ€¦

SEO WOO-JIN

866
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:56,063

01:02:58,149 --> 01:02:59,650
Can you get rid of him?

01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:04,947
I know the old man is just an excuse.

01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:10,787
That punkâ€¦ I keepâ€¦

872
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,832
seeing him laugh when he's at Doldam.

873
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:25,176
A jerk like himâ€¦

874
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,931
doesn't deserve to laugh, don't you think?

875
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,557
Right, Hyun-jun?

876
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:53,329
STAFF LOUNGE

877
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:46,507
I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

878
01:04:47,508 --> 01:04:48,759
Are you heading home?

879
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:52,138
Sleep in the staff room if you're tired.

880
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:55,558
The medical board exam is coming up soon.

881
01:04:58,019 --> 01:05:02,815
I just want to pass the exam.
I've been having nightmares about it.

882
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,358
What kind of nightmares?

883
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:06,986
Ones where everyone but me
passes the exam.

884
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:10,907
Wouldn't that be so horrible?

885
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:14,035
I'm surprised you worry about such things.

886
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:16,621
Everyone has worries.

887
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:20,499
The future is unpredictable for all of us.

888
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:24,003
Once you become an attending physicianâ€¦

889
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:26,130
will you go back to the main hospital?

890
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,967
Why does everyone ask me that?

891
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:32,762
-Who else asked you this question?
-Nurse Joo.

892
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:35,514
Wellâ€¦

893
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:39,810
Maybe that's how everyone
mentally prepares themselves

894
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:40,811
for a goodbye.

895
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:45,399
Everyone who's here
could leave at any time.

896
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:51,447
So you're trying to
mentally prepare yourself as well?

897
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:55,117
-Because I could leave at any time?
-Should Iâ€¦

898
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:57,828
prepare myself?

899
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:04,794
You always dodge my questions like this.

900
01:06:07,171 --> 01:06:10,383
Asking you not to leave
will make me seem obsessed.

901
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:15,137
But if I act all cool and don't say that,
I'll worry about you actually leaving.

902
01:06:16,263 --> 01:06:17,264
That's where I'm at.

903
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:23,604
Thenâ€¦

904
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:27,149
I'll give you my answer
after I pass the exam.

905
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:31,153
About whether I'll stay
or go back to the main hospital.

906
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,074
You always play hard to get.

907
01:06:35,866 --> 01:06:36,826
I know, right?

908
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:39,912
And for some reason,
it seems to only work on you.

909
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:51,340
Nurse Park, have you seen Doctor Seo?

910
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:54,635
No, I haven't.
Didn't you two leave together earlier?

911
01:06:55,594 --> 01:06:56,512
Yes, we did.

912
01:06:56,721 --> 01:07:00,307
But he suddenly disappeared.
And his phone is off.

913
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:03,686
Gosh, what's going on?

914
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:08,899
What do you think happened?

915
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:11,569
I'm not sure.

916
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:36,594
CONTRACT

917
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:39,263
What is this?

918
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:40,765
A contract, you fool.

919
01:07:49,273 --> 01:07:52,026
I'm still mad about what you did to me,

920
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:56,113
but I can't ruin
a skilled colleague's future.

921
01:07:57,531 --> 01:07:58,491
That's why

922
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:02,036
I reached out to the senior doctors
and lifted their boycott against you.

923
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:04,789
I brought you the best offer.
Just for you.

924
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,085
Aren't you touched?

925
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:11,504
What an amazing friend.

926
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:15,424
The salary they're offering
is twice the amount you make now.

927
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:19,929
With that money, you can clear your debt
and give Hyun-jun a fat commission

928
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:23,432
to make up
for all the trouble you caused him.

929
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:25,101
Right?

930
01:08:35,861 --> 01:08:38,531
Sign it while we're being nice.

931
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:48,874
Woo-jin.

932
01:08:50,918 --> 01:08:52,419
I heard there's a doctorâ€¦

933
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:54,880
called Doctor Kim at Doldam.

934
01:09:08,185 --> 01:09:10,354
THE ODDBALL PROJECT

935
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:19,947
What if something bad happened to him?

936
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:24,034
He's been gone for over an hour,
and his phone is still off.

937
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:26,412
Should we call the police?

938
01:09:33,043 --> 01:09:33,878
What?

939
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:53,647
Woo-jin, what happened?
You can't just disappear like that.

940
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:55,733
I was so worried about you.

941
01:10:01,488 --> 01:10:03,365
I need to talk to you, sir.

942
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:05,492
What's it about? Go ahead.

943
01:10:09,496 --> 01:10:10,414
I'm afraidâ€¦

944
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:14,710
I have to move to another hospital.

945
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:26,013
What?

946
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:30,851
You seeâ€¦

947
01:10:35,689 --> 01:10:37,816
I've gone through a lot to get here.

948
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,529
There were timesâ€¦

949
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:47,117
when life was so cruel to meâ€¦

950
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:54,792
that I just wanted to give up on it.

951
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:03,592
Butâ€¦

952
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:08,514
I'm glad I didn't give up.

953
01:11:13,143 --> 01:11:15,020
For the first time in my lifeâ€¦

954
01:11:18,315 --> 01:11:19,650
I complimented myselfâ€¦

955
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:24,655
for not giving up.

956
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:31,620
Because if I did, I wouldn't have met you.

957
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:37,835
Our time together was rather shortâ€¦

958
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,632
but thank you for everything, sir.

959
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:30,304
-Stop playing the victim, please.
-Did you sleep with him?

960
01:12:30,971 --> 01:12:32,222
We're allies, you know.

961
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:33,974
So please don't leave.

962
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:37,436
Woo-jin, take care of the first one.

963
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:40,814
-Aren't you going to scrub in?
-You're pushing for it so hard.

964
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:42,232
Can I ask you why?

965
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:45,152
This might be your only chance to survive.

966
01:12:45,235 --> 01:12:46,820
I think you have a guest.

967
01:12:46,904 --> 01:12:49,448
Think of it
as the last assignment I'm giving you.

968
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:55,120
I hope you learned at least one thing
during the time you spent with me.
