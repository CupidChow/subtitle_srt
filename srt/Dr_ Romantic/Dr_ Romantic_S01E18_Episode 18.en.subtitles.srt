1
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,531
Hello?

2
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,116
It's me. Oh Seong-jae.

3
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,118
What if

4
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,913
I say that I have the courage
to tell the truth to the world?

5
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,001
Will you tell me the truth?

6
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,673
Dr. Bu Yong-ju.

7
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,302
In our lives,

8
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,013
there are things you can only see

9
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,974
after the lapse of time.

10
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:03,396
Such as why such things happened to me,

11
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:08,818
why I met those people,

12
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,490
and why that coincidence even happened.

13
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,700
Okay.

14
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,253
Which department are you in?

15
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,054
Are you close to Dr. Bu Yong-ju?

16
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:40,183
There are moments
that I had no regard for.

17
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,060
You are the doctor.

18
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,687
Aren't you?

19
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,524
You are Dr. Bu Yong-ju.

20
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:51,694
And soon, they start to have
significance one by one.

21
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,907
Why do you keep prying
into Dr. Bu Yong-ju?

22
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,784
What is it you want to know?

23
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,452
I respect him.

24
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,580
I want to

25
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,749
learn from you.

26
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,417
I want to study hard

27
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,920
and become a good doctor
like Dr. Bu Yong-ju.

28
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:11,756
I want to carry out a collaborative
surgery with you some day.

29
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,259
It is my dream.

30
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,261
At some point,

31
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,930
it started making a path.

32
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,976
Could you tell me

33
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,145
the truth now?

34
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:29,065
What happened 14 years ago?

35
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,776
Why did Jang Hyeon-ju die like that?

36
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,194
And why did Dr. Bu Yong-ju

37
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,948
get kicked out of Geosan Medical Center
all of a sudden?

38
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,416
There's no such thing as the truth.

39
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,087
14 years ago, Bu Yong-ju was

40
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,008
a coward.

41
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,051
He stayed silent

42
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,348
and ran away.

43
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,811
That's all.

44
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,347
THE FOUNDATION PLAN OF
TRAUMA CENTER AT DOLDAM HOSPITAL

45
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,390
CHIEF OF GENERAL SURGERY, TEACHER KIM

46
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,313
Manager Jang, may I have a word?

47
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,025
I'll leave you two alone then.

48
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:57,904
What is it?

49
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:01,282
The person who gave President Do
Teacher Kim's document,

50
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,326
was it you?

51
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,452
Why do you think

52
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,454
I did that?

53
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,373
Dr. Song promoted you as a manager

54
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,750
as soon as he got here
from Geosan Medical Center, right?

55
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,835
Were you not conciliated
back then already?

56
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,463
What an unfair accusation.

57
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,299
The promotion I got was
a rightful compensation

58
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,926
for my hard work.

59
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,010
Then why did you

60
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,346
go in Teacher Kim's room that day?

61
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,389
Which day?

62
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:25,848
When do you mean?

63
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,144
-Manager Jang.
-I heard from Dr. Yun that

64
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,814
you told her you were emptying
Teacher Kim's garbage can.

65
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,275
But don't you think that makes no sense?

66
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,734
Why doesn't that make sense?

67
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:40,571
Am I not allowed to empty a garbage can?

68
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,575
I know you, Jang Gi-tae.

69
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,994
You come from a wealthy background

70
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:49,122
and you don't even put the garbage
in the correct bins.

71
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,709
You don't even clean up after
eating ramen.

72
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,419
And you're saying a person like that

73
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,213
emptied a garbage can
that's in someone else's office?

74
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,550
Don't look away.

75
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,262
Look at my eyes and tell me.

76
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,431
Teacher Kim's document.

77
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,975
You handed it over, didn't you?

78
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,227
-No.
-You really didn't do it?

79
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,353
It wasn't me.

80
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:16,024
I, Jang Gi-tae, is absolutely
innocent on this one.

81
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,775
Then who was it?

82
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,320
Who gave that document to President Do?

83
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,030
Who?

84
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,282
I don't

85
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,409
know anything.

86
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:28,828
I don't

87
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,830
remember anything.

88
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,207
This is not a hearing.

89
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,169
I told you I'm only here for udon.

90
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,797
Please give me that udon.

91
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,178
THE BIZARRE CASE OF SURGERY FRAUD
AT A COUNTRYSIDE HOSPITAL

92
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,320
CASINO KINGPIN SHIN MYEONG-HO
RUMORED TO BE IN POOR HEALTH

93
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,199
SEND

94
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,499
CASINO KINGPIN SHIN MYEONG-HO
RUMORED TO BE IN POOR HEALTH

95
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,260
How is the chairman's condition?

96
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,137
Is there any pain response?

97
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,139
No, nothing yet.

98
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,017
He should awake by now.

99
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,398
It's been over 24 hours
since the time of operation.

100
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,609
The fact that he is still not awake

101
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,029
means that a cerebral problem
has developed.

102
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,781
In worst case scenario,

103
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,368
Doldam Hospital will have to be
closed down.

104
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,871
We can't keep treating patients

105
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,958
at a hospital that will eventually close.

106
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,377
Don't you think that's too extreme?

107
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,296
There's already a word

108
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,717
going around the stock market
on Chairman Shin.

109
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,053
CHAIRMAN SHIN BRAIN-DEAD
AFTER ARTIFICIAL HEART SURGERY

110
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,263
"Brain-dead"?

111
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,350
Who on earth is
spreading such a false rumor?

112
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,562
After all, people prefer

113
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,356
stimulating news over facts.

114
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:24,193
From now on, you should
think only about the chairman.

115
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,863
There's no more time to waste.

116
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,286
Doldam Hospital emergency room.

117
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,580
Where are you calling from?

118
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,750
Well, we don't...

119
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:40,960
Please hold.

120
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,212
Ms. Oh. A reporter is asking

121
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,340
if this is the place
where Chairman Shin underwent operation.

122
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,887
Hello. This is an emergency room.

123
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,473
We don't have much knowledge
over such matters.

124
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,892
We'd appreciate it if you could
contact the administrative office.

125
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,439
Doldam Hospital emergency room.

126
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,608
Excuse me for a moment.

127
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,235
Ms. Oh, I got a similar call.

128
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,987
A reporter is asking about Chairman Shin.

129
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,656
Hello. This is an emergency room.

130
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,159
We only answer calls
about emergency patients.

131
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,535
If you keep calling,

132
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,621
the people who really need
our attention might--

133
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,208
Well, I don't know. Stop calling.

134
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,550
What on earth is going on, Ms. Oh?

135
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:30,635
Ms. Oh.

136
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,429
I think a rumor has been spread.

137
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,805
A rumor?

138
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,768
CHAIRMAN SHIN BRAIN-DEAD
AFTER ARTIFICIAL HEART SURGERY

139
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,813
What rumor?

140
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,317
What are they all up about?
There's a rumor going around?

141
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,568
Apparently, there's a rumor

142
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,404
on social media
that Chairman Shin is brain-dead.

143
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,616
Where did you hear that nonsense?
It's nothing like that at all.

144
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,993
I said I can't disclose that information.

145
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,119
I'm hanging up.

146
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,706
What's going on all of a sudden?

147
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,958
How should I know?

148
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,751
I feel like I got bombed.

149
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,336
What's all the fuss about?

150
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,671
It's really not true.

151
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,216
-What's going on?
-It's nothing.

152
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,927
There's a rumor going around

153
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,804
on Chairman Shin's condition.

154
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,306
The reporters are on it
and calling us as we speak.

155
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,516
Don't worry.

156
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,768
I won't let any information get out.

157
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:31,946
President Do.

158
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,155
You're here.

159
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,825
-Is President Yeo at his office?
-He's...

160
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,035
Is President Yeo upstairs right now?

161
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,080
The president is currently out.

162
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,963
Yes, Manager Jang. What is it?

163
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,882
President Do of Geosan Medical Center
is here right now.

164
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:52,967
One moment, please.

165
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,180
It's me.

166
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,141
What makes you come down here unannounced?

167
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,226
I'm here to give you the last notice.

168
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,896
Doldam Hospital

169
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,733
will be closed soon.

170
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,364
In the board meeting that will
take place tomorrow,

171
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,907
we will come to the decision.

172
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,994
So stop stalling

173
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,205
and arrange the chairman
to be treated at the main hospital.

174
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,625
If you want a spot

175
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,169
at the sanatorium that will be
built on top of this,

176
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,838
you should do as you're told.

177
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:35,051
Now that I delivered the message,
I'll hang up.

178
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,638
I should go see the chairman
now that I'm here.

179
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,806
President Do.

180
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,142
Has the closing of Doldam Hospital
really been decided?

181
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,478
Does that mean I'm going back
to Geosan Medical Center? Yes?

182
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:46,854
I'm going back, right?

183
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,649
Teacher Kim.

184
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,739
What are you saying?

185
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,949
The closing of Doldam Hospital
has been decided?

186
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:02,078
President Do just came here and said so.

187
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,790
Everyone including Ms. Oh is panicking.

188
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,541
What should we do?

189
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,920
What happens to the staff?

190
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,134
It's time to come back.

191
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:21,389
By tomorrow, the decision will be
made to close this place.

192
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,725
As soon as the decision gets made,
we'll take appropriate measures.

193
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,143
Why

194
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,938
do you have to...

195
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:35,152
Why do you have to do this?

196
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,821
From the viewpoint of the board,

197
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,449
this is a worthless hospital
experiencing deficit every year.

198
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,077
We're worthless?

199
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,123
Chairman Shin will be transferred
to the main hospital today.

200
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,958
I want you to come with him

201
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,752
and look after him with us.

202
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:55,923
I'll make that happen,

203
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,010
so come back to Geosan Medical Center.

204
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,357
You're closing down the hospital?

205
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,152
What do you think you're doing right now?

206
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,487
You're neglecting my father

207
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,114
waving that notarized letter in your hand.

208
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,741
I can't just stand and watch
as the daughter.

209
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,743
I'll transfer my father

210
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,288
even if that means
I have to close you down.

211
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,376
Look, Ms. Director.

212
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,257
Do you know how many people

213
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,303
come here from all over the country
because of the casino you built?

214
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,973
8,500 people on average a day.

215
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:51,187
And then, we have over 30 to 40
traffic accident cases

216
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,938
coming into our emergency room every week.

217
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,691
Will you really shut this hospital down?

218
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,986
Where will those people go, then?

219
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:03,949
Do you want them to die
on the streets wandering around

220
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,786
looking for an emergency room?

221
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,498
I heard from President Do

222
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:14,001
that it's been running in a deficit
of one billion won every year.

223
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,922
This year, the deficit record
was 1.5 billion won.

224
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:22,051
We're talking about patients here.
Is that what you care about?

225
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,928
We at Geosan Foundation

226
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,015
have no more intention
of taking Doldam Hospital's deficit.

227
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,517
And that's the hospital

228
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:32,228
where your father received an operation.

229
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,395
And he hasn't

230
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,356
woken up.

231
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,732
It's 72 hours...

232
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,781
-Can't you even wait 48 hours?
-Wait 48 hours?

233
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,078
The longer the time goes,
the higher the chance of a brain death!

234
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,288
Who says he's brain-dead?

235
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:55,626
I'm his doctor, and I didn't say that.
Who says that?

236
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:00,965
Is it money

237
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:05,761
that you people are concerned about
right now?

238
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,098
Would it be better for him to die now?

239
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,475
Would it be better
for him to hold out a bit longer?

240
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,603
Which would make it easier
for me to inherit his assets?

241
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,771
What?

242
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,690
You must be insane.

243
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:18,816
If not,

244
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:23,237
just shut up and listen
to what I say as his doctor.

245
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,574
After I let your father live,

246
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:30,619
you can decide to close this place
or do whatever you'd like.

247
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,757
Are we really shutting down?

248
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,301
This is driving me insane.

249
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,469
-This is awful.
-What shall we do?

250
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,346
Are we really going out of business?

251
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,514
Should I look for another job?

252
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,516
Hey, be quiet. Hello.

253
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,523
Ms. Oh, what happened?
Are we really shutting down?

254
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,026
Nothing has been decided.

255
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:05,070
Just stay focused as always.

256
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,282
Ms. Oh, how can you work
under such a circumstance?

257
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,201
Like I said, I'm not hurt.

258
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,871
Darn it. Let me go home.

259
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:17,207
Sir, you just said
that your stomach hurts a lot.

260
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,043
You need to take a CT scan.

261
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,294
What happened?

262
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:24,048
He's been drinking a lot,
and he has stomach pain.

263
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,508
I asked him to take a CT scan,
but he won't.

264
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,719
I don't need to take it.

265
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:32,848
Why would you waste money
on a CT scan or whatever that is?

266
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,725
If I had the money,

267
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,936
I'd rather drink it away.

268
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,771
Sir, you're a patient.

269
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:42,566
-You need to listen to the doctor.
-I'm not a patient.

270
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,235
Move away. I'm going home.

271
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,655
-Sir.
-Move. Move away!

272
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,783
Move. I said, move!

273
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,535
What do we do? Should we go and grab him?

274
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,205
Leave him alone.

275
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:59,041
It's not like he's the only drunk we get.

276
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:06,590
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

277
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:20,688
What are you up to?

278
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,693
I was just resting.

279
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:26,944
I'll go back soon.

280
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,285
Are you okay?

281
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,249
Our hospital may close down.

282
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,211
How can I be okay?

283
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,177
What is this?

284
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,680
It's Teacher Kim's.

285
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,557
He's been

286
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,935
planning something big.

287
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,897
Did you know?

288
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:06,608
No.

289
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,318
I didn't.

290
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,320
THE FOUNDATION PLAN OF
TRAUMA CENTER AT DOLDAM HOSPITAL

291
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,198
I didn't know he had this on his mind.

292
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,701
He did.

293
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:20,956
What do we do now?

294
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,502
I don't know.

295
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,191
President Yeo.

296
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,818
Are you okay?

297
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,079
Well, there is no reason

298
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,791
for me to be okay or not to be okay.

299
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,668
I haven't got much power, either.

300
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,297
I'm just an old man in the back room.

301
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,591
But still,

302
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,843
I wanted to become an old man

303
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,387
who can take the side

304
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,557
with what's right and support them.

305
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,644
What are you talking about?

306
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,396
Just now,

307
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:32,444
I was informed that they will
shut down Doldam Hospital.

308
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,656
It was from President Do.

309
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,660
It's really weird.

310
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,123
We all know that President Do is wrong.

311
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,293
We all know that he is
doing something very wrong.

312
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,005
But why does he still

313
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,092
have such a strong power
in his high position?

314
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,896
Thanks for the udon.

315
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,954
Where have you been?

316
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,625
An ambulance and doctors will be here soon
to pick up Chairman Shin.

317
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,795
Oh, they should be here soon.

318
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,423
Who says?

319
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,593
Who do you think? President Do.

320
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,512
You should just give up now.

321
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,390
When tomorrow comes,

322
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,475
it'll be shut down anyway.

323
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,020
Do you still think

324
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:51,315
that Chairman Shin will
wake up from his coma?

325
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,568
No way. I doubt that.

326
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,028
Manager Jang.

327
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,404
Yes, Teacher Kim.

328
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:01,450
Can you get this garbage out of my sight?

329
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,952
-Garbage?
-One more thing.

330
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,413
Make sure none of those guys from Seoul

331
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:10,083
set a foot in this hospital.

332
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,211
-Did you just call me garbage?
-Hey.

333
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,214
You are garbage, aren't you?

334
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,008
You're a doctor

335
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,260
who doesn't want a patient to wake up.

336
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:23,180
I'm just saying that this is a done deal.

337
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:27,059
I feel bad about how you are
holding onto that hopeless man.

338
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,477
Whoever it may be,

339
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:33,148
don't you dare come anywhere near the ICU.

340
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:37,069
I'll take all of your names
and file a lawsuit.

341
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,948
-Understood?
-Yes.

342
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,082
Listen to me, Manager Jang.

343
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,750
Did you say yes?

344
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,127
You of all people can't say that.

345
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:58,006
You should take the right side.
Which side are you on?

346
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,759
Will it be Doldam or Geosan? Understand?

347
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,594
Oh, yes.

348
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,852
My goodness.

349
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,025
I am so furious.

350
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,195
We worked so hard to get so far.

351
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,616
Teacher Kim and all of us

352
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,788
worked so hard to get this far.

353
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,908
THE FOUNDATION PLAN OF
TRAUMA CENTER AT DOLDAM HOSPITAL

354
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,750
Let me check your pain response.

355
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,965
We can't give things up
just like this, right?

356
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,219
So...

357
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,763
please come around.

358
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,183
Please, Chairman Shin.

359
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,031
Ms. Eom, about that patient...

360
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,708
I'm not sure if we'd get paid on time.

361
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,877
I know. I even got a new house
around here.

362
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,306
-Ms. Eom.
-Yes?

363
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:54,599
Yes.

364
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:55,892
Aren't you answering the phone?

365
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,436
All we've been getting today
were reporters asking about the chairman.

366
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,272
What if it is for a patient?

367
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,196
This is the emergency room
of Doldam Hospital.

368
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,200
Okay.

369
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:16,079
A patient with glass stuck in his abdomen
is coming in five minutes.

370
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,837
Didn't you hear me?
A patient is coming in.

371
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,011
What is going on?

372
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,556
Why are you staring at me doing nothing?

373
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:38,643
I heard they will shut down
Doldam Hospital.

374
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,771
They are so distracted
that they can't do anything.

375
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:46,067
Is it true that they are shutting it down?

376
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,237
I want to hear it from you.

377
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:50,864
Please tell me.

378
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:04,628
That's what I want to ask you.

379
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:07,756
Did you choose

380
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:11,051
to leave Doldam Hospital already?

381
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,929
-That's not it.
-If it's not that,

382
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,347
why are you

383
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,391
standing here idly
as if the hospital is closed down?

384
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:20,769
Ms. Oh.

385
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:24,522
Why do you look so down?

386
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,569
I'm

387
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,156
not about to have the hospital shut down.

388
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,742
Just like yesterday,

389
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,745
I will be here

390
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,789
today and tomorrow,

391
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,084
waiting for the patients

392
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,543
who need my help.

393
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,049
That's my decision, Dong-ju.

394
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:53,176
-Doctor.
-So

395
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,053
just do your job as usual.

396
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,055
As we always did,

397
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,891
let's focus on the patients, Dong-ju.

398
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:08,858
We have an emergency patient.

399
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:12,946
He is a 37-year-old man
with glass embedded in his abdomen.

400
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:24,708
What happened?

401
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,669
He was changing
the fluorescent tube on a ladder,

402
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,671
and he fell down to the window.

403
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,631
It seems a piece of glass
sliced into his abdomen.

404
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,633
-Let's move him to the hybrid room.
-Okay.

405
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,392
-Ms. Eom.
-Yes? Okay.

406
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:49,107
Teacher Kim told us.

407
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,027
The strongest resistance in the world is

408
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,404
pushing on undaunted to finish your job

409
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,033
no matter what the circumstances are.

410
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,912
-Dr. Woo, cut his clothes open.
-Okay.

411
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,415
His vital signs are 110 over 70,
pulse 110.

412
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:06,958
Oh, no. Dr. Woo!

413
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,432
You are not supposed
to cut a duck-down parka.

414
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,769
I'm sorry. I didn't know that.

415
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:28,063
Give me the dressing set.
I will check his wound.

416
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,147
Okay.

417
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,273
I'm sorry.

418
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,359
Set up IV lines and execute a full drop.

419
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,694
Give him antibiotics
and do a CT scan on him.

420
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:35,945
Okay.

421
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,743
Teacher Kim

422
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,329
might have already known

423
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,998
that the weight of our worries and fears

424
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,753
could be lighter than a feather.

425
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,330
What's the matter?

426
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:30,834
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

427
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,768
Please come on in. I was waiting for you.

428
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,731
Manager Jang. It's good you are here.

429
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,524
Please show them the way.

430
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:04,117
What are you doing?
I told you to show them the way.

431
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:13,877
What do you think you are doing?

432
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,047
I was instructed not to let anyone
into the ICU

433
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,924
by Teacher Kim.

434
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,844
No one can get in there.

435
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,054
What? Gosh.

436
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,681
Step aside.

437
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,266
Get out of my way.

438
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,059
I can't move.

439
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,438
No, I won't move.

440
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,857
How dare you?

441
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,154
Look at you.

442
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,241
What?

443
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,204
I can't believe this.

444
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,216
Dr. Yun.

445
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,885
Did Chairman Shin come around?

446
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:04,969
Yes, sir.

447
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:08,097
Nearly alert. It seems to be GCS of 10T.

448
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,975
NEARLY ALERT: ALMOST AWAKE
GCS: GLASGOW COMA SCALE

449
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:19,818
Chairman Shin.

450
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,278
Can you hear me?

451
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,127
Chairman Shin.

452
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,421
If you hear my voice,

453
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,342
please move your finger.

454
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,506
Chairman Shin.

455
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,191
Teacher Kim.

456
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,286
Good job.

457
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:56,497
What are you talking about?

458
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,625
Are they shutting you out?

459
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,419
Teacher Kim told them

460
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:04,088
not to let anyone into
the Intensive Care Unit.

461
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:09,177
Even Manager Jang is with them
to block the way.

462
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,180
Are you talking to President Do?

463
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,223
Yes, President Do.

464
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,352
You promoted him to manager,
but he's just ungrateful.

465
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,979
He's such an encumbrance.

466
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,774
We have no time to waste.

467
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,735
Just push ahead. Do anything you can

468
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,071
to take Chairman Shin
out of the hospital. Now!

469
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,740
Okay. I will take care of it.

470
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,581
Let's stay calm.

471
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,710
You will go this way,
and you will go that way, okay?

472
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,212
Hold on.

473
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:47,215
Gosh.

474
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,801
I wasn't going to go this far.

475
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,438
Attack!

476
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:03,982
Stop them!

477
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:33,886
Move!

478
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:42,979
No!

479
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,216
What are you doing?

480
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,261
What do you think we're doing?
We're following orders.

481
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:18,014
We're making our way to Chairman Shin.

482
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,557
Are you some street thugs?

483
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,102
What do you think you're doing
at a hospital?

484
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,065
You shouldn't have told them
to stop us in the first place.

485
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:30,735
Do you think I want to do this?
I'm too old for this!

486
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:31,903
Shut it.

487
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,197
All of you.

488
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,658
-Get lost from this hospital.
-Gosh, you're stubborn.

489
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,661
I said, we have to take Chairman Shin
with us.

490
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,538
He's awake.

491
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,832
Exactly. Since he's awake, we should...

492
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,084
He's awake?

493
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,594
The chairman is awake.

494
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,388
So do shut your mouth

495
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:02,809
and get lost from this hospital. Okay?

496
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,646
He is?

497
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:09,690
The chairman...

498
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:12,985
woke up?

499
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,779
Yes, okay.

500
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,823
No, I'm on my way right now.

501
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,866
Father is awake.

502
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,202
He recognizes everyone
and is very conscious.

503
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,463
How's my father?

504
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,674
You should go in there.

505
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,930
Chairman Shin.

506
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,100
How are you feeling right now?

507
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,649
Did the surgery go well?

508
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:52,900
Of course.

509
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,778
It was a success, Chairman Shin.

510
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:56,946
Good work,

511
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,116
Teacher Kim.

512
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,379
All right.

513
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:18,843
Father.

514
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,306
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

515
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,851
-I'm all right.
-Dad.

516
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,771
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

517
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,026
Thanks, Dad.

518
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,118
It's okay.

519
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,958
It's okay.

520
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,002
It's okay.

521
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,255
Hello.

522
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,327
That cocky swine.

523
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,381
President Do.
What do you intend to do now?

524
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:40,299
The chairman is awake and...

525
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:57,608
Anyhow, the dispatched staff
will return by tomorrow.

526
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:00,403
-I will also go back to Seoul--
-No.

527
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,281
-Stay here for a little longer.
-Pardon?

528
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,534
My game isn't over yet.

529
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,328
So until Doldam Hospital closes down,

530
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,998
be prepared to completely
devote yourself to this hospital.

531
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,379
Devote myself?

532
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,804
I said I'm sorry, honey.

533
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:29,098
They said I was going back
to the main hospital tomorrow.

534
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,433
I even packed all my things.

535
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,935
Now they're saying the decision
has been changed.

536
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,813
I'm not happy about this either.

537
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:38,190
Do you think I want to... Hello?

538
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,318
Who am I talking to?

539
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,528
Oh, no.

540
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,363
Your wife must be really upset.

541
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,198
It's either one of the two.

542
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,202
Either I hand in my resignation
or I get divorced.

543
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:53,331
Why don't your wife and your baby
come down here and live with you?

544
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,207
My daughter just started walking

545
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,209
and my wife is already
looking into pre-schools.

546
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,462
I see. I guess she won't come.

547
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:00,546
In-su.

548
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,591
Let's go to Dr. Nam's bar after work.

549
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,468
I'll buy you a glass of beer.

550
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,303
-I'm in.
-I'm in.

551
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,306
Do they have good food there?

552
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,224
Dr. Nam's ramen is delicious.

553
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,643
Their signature dish is ramen?

554
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,313
There's beer, too.

555
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,196
What is it?

556
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:30,659
That patient with glass
penetrated through the abdomen.

557
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,662
The CT scan result came out.
Do you want to go look at it?

558
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,500
It's not a common case.

559
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,044
We could take a look at it together.

560
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,338
I'd like it more if you could be
my assistant.

561
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:43,631
What does that mean?

562
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,008
What do you mean?

563
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,136
Everyone here is suffering

564
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,680
because of my dad.

565
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,182
So what?

566
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,935
Aren't I not the target of hatred as well?

567
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,271
To be honest,

568
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:02,566
your dad can be an eyesore.

569
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:04,985
Even so,

570
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,822
that's not your fault.

571
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,409
If I were you,

572
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:14,286
I would be embarrassed by my dad.

573
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,164
-Are you criticizing him again?
-Forget it.

574
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,417
Are you going to be the assistant or not?

575
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:23,629
The patient is waiting. Make up your mind.

576
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,633
Gosh, forget it then.

577
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:29,760
Fine, I'll do it.

578
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,472
You have a thing
for shoving people around.

579
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:37,435
Next time, you're the assistant. Got it?

580
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,362
Punk.

581
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,950
Dr. Kang. Right on time.

582
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:56,370
You got a registered mail
from Geosan Medical Center.

583
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:57,621
Registered mail?

584
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,707
-For me?
-Yes.

585
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,629
OPERATION RECORD

586
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,925
DR. BU YONG-JU

587
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,513
"April 29th."

588
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,934
Who sent this?

589
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,060
I'm not sure.

590
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:23,772
I didn't check who sent it
since it's from the main hospital.

591
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,657
Did you send that thing I told you to?

592
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,950
Yes, President Do.

593
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,619
I sent the registered mail.

594
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,370
It should be delivered by today.

595
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,706
Okay. You can go now.

596
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,545
The scariest thing in the world

597
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,631
is the seed of doubt.

598
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,508
When you plant one,

599
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,427
it grows well by itself.

600
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,387
OPERATED ON APRIL 29, 2002
BY DR. BU YONG-JU

601
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:58,098
Mr. Kang Eun-yeong passed away.

602
00:41:58,724 --> 00:41:59,808
Father.

603
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,812
Father.

604
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:05,940
Honey.

605
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:18,494
OPERATED BY DR. BU YONG-JU

606
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,913
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

607
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,458
I'll come back shortly after.

608
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:28,879
The board won't be discussing
about this hospital for a while.

609
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:32,508
But it's only as long as
my father is here.

610
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,426
You do know that, right?

611
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,178
Yes.

612
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,264
Whatever you say.

613
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:41,058
To be honest,
I still don't approve of you.

614
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:42,851
But this time,

615
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,021
I'm really thankful.

616
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,190
I mean it.

617
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:52,736
Okay.

618
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,740
Not every rich person is blinded by
the inheritance.

619
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:59,785
I'm the type of rich person

620
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,121
who wants to live

621
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,039
under her father's shadow
as long as possible

622
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,874
to live comfortably.

623
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:09,587
So I hope my father will live a long life.

624
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:14,883
I'm going to Florida to see my children,

625
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,552
but I'll come back early next month.

626
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,096
Until then,

627
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:21,390
please take good care of my father.

628
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,309
Of course. Have a safe trip.

629
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,643
Good day.

630
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:29,023
Oh, right. I have something
to ask you about.

631
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,400
Please go ahead.

632
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:35,195
Why did you name yourself, Teacher Kim?

633
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,579
What is your name, Doctor?

634
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,414
My name?

635
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:51,503
I have a very common name.

636
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,797
It's Kim Somebody.

637
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,217
I see. Dr. Kim Somebody.

638
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,096
Dr. Kim Somebody! Are you busy now?

639
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:02,931
Why do you ask?

640
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:05,309
When you use the Billroth two
for a gastrectomy,

641
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:07,811
should you leave the front part
as a cul-de-sac?

642
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,271
CUL-DE-SAC: ENCLOSED TUBE

643
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:15,944
I'm just curious.

644
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:17,446
Hello.

645
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:19,948
Dr. Kim Somebody.

646
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,204
-Are you going home?
-What is it this time?

647
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,706
It's about the Roux-en-Y bypass.

648
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,667
If you connect the stomach
and the jejunum,

649
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,669
you leave the duodenum as it is, right?

650
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:36,840
It contains videos of the operations
you asked me about.

651
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,885
Both gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y bypass.

652
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,720
Did you perform those operations?

653
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,889
Why do you ask so many questions?

654
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,265
Just watch the videos.

655
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,685
Gosh. You are so talkative.

656
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,228
Get well soon.

657
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:54,108
Thank you. You are my teacher from now on.

658
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:23,846
This is

659
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:28,350
what my daughter gave me
before her surgery.

660
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:31,812
She said it's a gift for you.

661
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:41,238
STUDENT ID, JANG HYEON-JU

662
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,961
FOR TEACHER KIM

663
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,478
Dear Teacher Kim.

664
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:16,398
Teacher Kim, you must have been
annoyed by me so much.

665
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:19,943
But you answered all my questions
and taught me kindly.

666
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,653
Thank you for that.

667
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,655
In fact, when I first met you I knew

668
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:26,366
that you are Dr. Bu Yong-ju.

669
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,619
Excuse me.

670
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:33,415
Do you happen to know Dr. Bu Yong-ju?

671
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:37,544
I was so nervous to meet you.

672
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,421
That's why I asked that instead.

673
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,592
I will never forget the times I spent

674
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,302
with you in the hospital.

675
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:48,847
Thank you for operating on me.

676
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:52,893
After the surgery, I will visit you
when I get better.

677
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,230
I'm dreaming of the day

678
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,649
when I perform a surgery with you.

679
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,986
Sincerely, your student Jang Hyeon-ju.

680
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,356
I see.

681
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,609
Do you think she knows

682
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,571
that the name she gave you

683
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:48,532
changed your life?

684
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:51,952
I don't know.

685
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:09,595
FOR TEACHER KIM

686
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:24,318
The CT scan result shows that there isn't
serious damage in arteries.

687
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,653
It seems he has intestinal injuries.

688
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:30,532
Does it mean he'll be okay
after the surgery?

689
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:33,785
Dr. Kang.

690
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:35,996
Yes?

691
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,921
We can't be sure
before we begin the surgery.

692
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:48,925
There might be damaged artery
that we can't see now.

693
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,594
I see.

694
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:52,804
Let's take him
to the operating room first.

695
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:54,723
Okay.

696
00:48:58,935 --> 00:49:01,229
What's wrong?
Are you worried about something?

697
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,106
It's nothing.

698
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:05,275
We have a patient.

699
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:07,944
To the bed number four.

700
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:10,572
What's the problem?

701
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:12,866
He started to have acute chest pain
right before calling us.

702
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:13,909
Chest pain?

703
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:15,661
We administered
sublingual nitroglycerin twice,

704
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,162
but it didn't help to relieve the pain.

705
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:20,332
-What are his vital signs?
-It was 160 over 100, pulse 100.

706
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:22,751
Ms. Oh, please check
his vital signs again.

707
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,503
-Please take an EKG, Dr. Woo.
-Yes, Dr. Kang.

708
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:33,095
-His BP is 100 over 60 now.
-Pardon?

709
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:34,971
Why did it suddenly drop?

710
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:37,265
-Could you check his right arm?
-Yes, Dr. Yun.

711
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,767
I thought you went up to the ICU.

712
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,185
I did, then I came back down.

713
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,688
-Do we have the EKG result?
-Here it is.

714
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:47,275
It's certainly not STEMI.

715
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:50,529
BP is 160 over 100 for the right arm,
100 over 60 for the left.

716
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:51,738
What?

717
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,908
Sir, can you describe
your chest pain for me?

718
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:58,036
It feels like my back is being torn.

719
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:01,164
Could it be...

720
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:05,919
-Aortic dissection?
-Aortic dissection?

721
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:07,295
Please help us!

722
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,381
Please save my husband, Doctor.

723
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,049
-Oh, no.
-Goodness.

724
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:12,926
Where does it hurt?

725
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,970
He says his stomach is aching.

726
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:17,806
He even had blood in his stool.

727
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:19,391
I think I'm dying.

728
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:21,309
Help me.

729
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,856
He came here earlier,
but he refused examination

730
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:27,566
and self-discharged.

731
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:30,277
-He just left the hospital?
-He was completely drunk.

732
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:32,487
His BP is 90 over 60, pulse 130.

733
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,614
Did you say he had rectal bleeding?

734
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:38,452
He went to the bathroom
saying his stomach hurt.

735
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,704
He stayed in there too long,
so I checked on him.

736
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:43,415
He looked so pale sitting on the toilet.
He couldn't move at all.

737
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:46,126
I helped him get up, and I saw

738
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:49,087
so much blood in the toilet.
I can't believe this.

739
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:51,757
I am so worried.

740
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,968
-What should I do?
-My stomach hurts so much.

741
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,435
The wall motion seems fine.

742
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,604
I can't see the aortic root clearly.

743
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,068
It's aortic dissection.

744
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:14,237
-Is it?
-Yes. Right here.

745
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:19,117
It's hard to see the abdominal aorta.

746
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,453
I think it's Stanford type A.

747
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:23,163
STANFORD TYPE A: TYPE OF AORTIC DISSECTION

748
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:48,480
How are you feeling now?

749
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,023
I'm feeling good.

750
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,776
Maybe because I'm feeling good,

751
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:57,823
I think it's much easier to breathe now.

752
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,075
But

753
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:03,995
there are these tubes
connected to my body.

754
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:08,750
They're so annoying.
When can I remove all these?

755
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:11,753
Gosh. You are as impatient as ever.

756
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:16,383
I will get rid of all the tubes
including the chest tubes in two days.

757
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,554
Thank you for your effort.

758
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:22,764
Thank you.

759
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:25,225
Please don't say that.
I should be thanking you.

760
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:30,438
Our hospital could have been closed down
because of you.

761
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:31,439
What?

762
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,400
Really?

763
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:41,199
I guess I really am
an influential man. Right?

764
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:53,295
They want me at the emergency room.

765
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:55,046
Oh, sure. Go ahead.

766
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:56,298
Okay.

767
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:03,054
-What's going on?
-We have three emergency operations.

768
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,598
Three patients?

769
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:07,225
One of them has
an abdomen penetrating injury.

770
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:09,895
He has glass shatter in the wound,

771
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:11,396
but he isn't bleeding much.

772
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:15,108
I think the patient
with an aortic dissection is more urgent.

773
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:16,860
Do we have someone
with an aortic dissection?

774
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:19,237
-Do you have his CT scan?
-It just came out.

775
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,949
It's type A and it has already ascended.

776
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,702
-What's his blood pressure?
-Initially, 160 over 100 on the right

777
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:27,329
and 100 over 60 on the left.

778
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:28,455
After we injected esmolol,

779
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,665
his BP on the right side
dropped to 120 over 80.

780
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:32,709
-What about his EKG?
-We took a look.

781
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:35,295
-How's aortic valve regurgitation?
-A bit, but not much.

782
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:38,340
-What about the other patient?
-His CT scan is coming up.

783
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:42,135
-It's ischemic colitis.
-Ischemic colitis?

784
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:44,971
We have the CT scan
of the ischemic colitis patient.

785
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,729
This is bad.

786
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:55,941
I even see pneumatosis intestinalis.

787
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,859
PNEUMATOSIS INTESTINALIS:
GAS CYSTS IN THE BOWEL

788
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,195
We have to cut it out.

789
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:02,364
Yes. It seems so.

790
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:06,493
All three of them are emergency cases.
What should we do?

791
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:08,745
It's not like we can

792
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:12,123
send any one of them to another hospital.

793
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,417
Teacher Kim, let's start
with the aortic dissection case--

794
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:17,545
It'll take us a while to prepare fully
for the operation.

795
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:20,799
I believe we should begin
with the ischemic colitis patient.

796
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:23,218
The aortic dissection patient is
the most urgent case.

797
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:26,221
That patient came in first, too.

798
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:28,264
If we have to go by
the order which they came in,

799
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:29,849
we have to go
with the abdomen penetration.

800
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,559
The most urgent case is

801
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,561
the aortic dissection patient.
Isn't that right?

802
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:36,272
Why are you so hung up
over that case? You're a GS.

803
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,983
What's wrong with you?

804
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:06,469
Let me know if you need anything else.

805
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:07,971
Sure. Thank you.

806
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:16,604
Excuse me, may I ask you something?

807
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:19,858
-Yes?
-About 14 years ago,

808
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:24,070
didn't your son went on the rampage
in the ER of Geosan Medical Center?

809
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:25,989
Who are you?

810
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:28,116
Why do you

811
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:30,577
bring up something
that happened 14 years ago?

812
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:34,622
I've been gathering news
about this one guy.

813
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:39,794
Here.

814
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:43,089
REPORTER OH SEONG-JAE

815
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:46,885
But some of the puzzles
do not seem to line up.

816
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:51,181
I'm having a difficult time trying to make

817
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:52,724
all of the pieces match.

818
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:58,772
I know that your husband

819
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:01,566
went into the emergency room

820
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:04,444
and passed away within an hour.

821
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:09,365
It was a problem with his aorta, right?

822
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:14,996
Seo-jeong.

823
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:18,208
How long will it take for you
to prepare for the surgery?

824
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:21,002
It'll take me about 30 minutes
to get the pump ready.

825
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,087
Okay.

826
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:25,298
Until then, put a hold
on the aortic dissection patient.

827
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:28,093
Let's move the ischemic colitis patient
to the operating room.

828
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:29,719
-Yes, sir.
-Teacher Kim.

829
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:32,138
Dong-ju, you are a general surgeon.

830
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,849
You should focus only on your patients.

831
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:39,020
Seo-jeong and I will take care
of the cardiac patient.

832
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:46,152
Did you lose him like this back then?

833
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:54,619
That day,

834
00:56:57,705 --> 00:56:59,082
you were the surgeon

835
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:03,128
who did the operation on the VIP

836
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:09,134
who walked in after my father.

837
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,237
Don't be so nervous.

838
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,406
What I want to know is this.

839
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:34,325
I know that the damage was
very high at that time.

840
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,079
I heard it was around 200 million won.

841
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:41,624
I want to know
who helped you pay that back.

842
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:48,923
Can you tell me who that is?

843
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:53,761
Can you tell me?

844
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:55,513
Why did you

845
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:59,934
push my father's operation back?

846
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:01,853
Dong-ju.

847
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:03,771
Tell me the reason.

848
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:06,941
Who

849
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:08,818
was it?

850
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,032
Why can't you answer me?

851
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:20,455
Why did you push back
my father's operation?

852
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:23,124
Why?

853
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:50,693
