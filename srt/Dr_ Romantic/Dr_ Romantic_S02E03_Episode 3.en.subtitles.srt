1
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,543
THE AGE OF HATRED

2
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:44,836
The age of hatred.

3
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,796
GET LOST, ENEMIES OF DOCTORS

4
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,797
You didn't know?

5
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,842
He got branded as a whistleblower.

6
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,805
They draw a line just because I have
different thoughts from them.

7
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,266
I heard you worked as an escort
until recently.

8
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,809
They belittle me

9
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,519
and humiliate me.

10
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,564
There's no need to beat around the bush.
Find another hospital.

11
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,858
You have no dignity as a doctor.

12
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:09,277
A cheapie like you who's only after money

13
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,112
can't work with me.

14
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,239
They diminish me as they like.

15
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,951
You can look after the emergency patient

16
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:18,870
who's in the OR now.

17
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:25,168
Collective egoism and dichotomous thinking

18
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,213
turns anyone who isn't on your side
into an enemy.

19
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,423
A black-and-white world.

20
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,550
Cha Eun-jae.

21
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,469
Do you want to lose your license?

22
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,639
Our respect for one another disappeared.

23
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:40,016
This is why I don't like to hire girls.

24
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,853
The world is now full
of disrespect and hatred.

25
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,396
And that's when…

26
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,856
Gosh! What should we do?

27
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,400
Doctor Kim!

28
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,610
-Tell us!
-Doctor Kim!

29
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,529
-Please tell us!
-How's Minister Ryu now?

30
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,780
-How is he doing?
-Doctor Kim!

31
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,365
-Is he here?
-Tell us something!

32
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,658
-Please come out!
-Where is he?

33
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:57,784
-Say something!
-How is he?

34
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,244
-Excuse me!
-Doctor Kim!

35
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,996
There was a man who suddenly appeared.

36
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,877
Why don't you send her to me?

37
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,379
A CS who can't even go into the OR?

38
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,672
Why would you take her?

39
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,340
You should find a different doctor.

40
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,010
Darn you.

41
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:19,389
Dr. Seo has the worst reputation here.

42
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,683
But…

43
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,435
I need money.

44
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,020
I've never

45
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,982
put a price on a person in my life.

46
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,441
You said you needed a hand.

47
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,527
A doctor is who I'm looking for!

48
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,530
What do you mean by that?

49
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:36,489
It is your job

50
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,741
to find the answer.

51
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:57,302
UNDEFINED SETTING VALUE

52
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,272
Defense Minister Ryu Woong-il was involved

53
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,482
in a car accident on his way
to oversee a joint training

54
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:14,527
of the three military forces held
in Gangwon Province this morning.

55
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:18,281
His driver, Park, suddenly suffered
from a myocardial infarction,

56
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,325
then the car deviated from the road

57
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,785
-and fell off.
-The driver died at the scene,

58
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:26,873
and Minister Ryu and his secretary
were seriously injured.

59
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,042
He received his first operation

60
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,253
and was sent to the ICU of this hospital.

61
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:35,673
The hospital staff mentioned
that they are doing their best

62
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,927
to treat Minister Ryu's serious injury.

63
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,971
Minister Ryu's family
haven't arrived at the hospital yet.

64
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,266
The Ministry of National Defense said
as soon as Minister Ryu gets better,

65
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,853
they plan on moving him
to the Armed Forces Hospital in Seoul.

66
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,064
You don't have to worry.

67
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,399
Professor Park Min-gook is a surgeon

68
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,611
who's known in this industry
for having the best surgical skills.

69
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:59,614
Now that we're treating Minister Ryu,

70
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:02,325
I believe it's our duty to provide

71
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,077
the best surgeon that we have.

72
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,871
Thank you. Please do look after him.

73
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,966
-There wasn't a huge change.
-No.

74
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,634
We can continue to keep our eyes on him.

75
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,052
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

76
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,902
His blood pressure is at 90 over 60,

77
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,280
but his temperature went up to 38.9.

78
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,156
What about his urine?

79
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,950
Around 10 to 15 ml per hour.

80
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,203
Get him on propacetamol
and please get the chest portable.

81
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,122
And keep checking his IO and temperature.

82
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,790
-I'll get Doctor Kim.
-Yes, sir.

83
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,340
Seo Woo-jin?

84
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,343
You were here?

85
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,221
What brings you here?

86
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,765
I'll take over the treatment
for Minister Ryu as of now.

87
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,228
I'm sorry,

88
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:15,023
but I haven't heard anything.

89
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,276
It was just decided,
so you'll hear about it down there.

90
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:21,279
Let Dr. Yang take over,
and please move aside.

91
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,742
I cannot leave the patient's side

92
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,785
until the doctor in charge tells me to.

93
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:28,786
Hey.

94
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,996
Seo Woo-jin.

95
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,374
Dr. Seo. His blood pressure is dropping.

96
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,005
Didn't you hear Professor Park?

97
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,799
He's in charge of Minister Ryu now.

98
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,343
So move aside, okay?

99
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,679
I can't leave the patient's side
until the doctor in charge tells me to.

100
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,805
You're unbelievable.

101
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,558
Dr. Seo, the patient went into arrest!

102
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,358
Goodness.

103
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:06,074
This is obviously a declaration of war.

104
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,659
We need to come up with countermeasures.

105
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:12,330
Why don't we give a briefing
to the reporters regarding Minister Ryu?

106
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:15,500
That's how we can have them under control.

107
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,210
Okay, striking them first.

108
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,461
I'm all for that.

109
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:22,131
Before President Do…
I mean, before Chairman Do does something,

110
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,591
we can give an official statement

111
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:27,387
regarding Minister Ryu's operation
and his current status.

112
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,729
Yes, this is Doctor Kim.

113
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,245
I'll check his pulse.

114
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,123
He's in PEA.

115
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,874
PEA: PULSELESS ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY

116
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,422
I have the ABGA.

117
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,590
ABGA: ARTERIAL BLOOD GAS ANALYSIS

118
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,967
Metabolic acidosis?

119
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,136
METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: ACID IMBALANCE

120
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,596
Give me three bicarbonates.

121
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,598
BICARBONATE: AGENT THAT REGULATES PH

122
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,017
Not with the epinephrine. Another one.

123
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,020
I'm Park Min-gook, GS of Geosan.

124
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,689
I'm Minister Ryu's doctor as of now.

125
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,232
Carry out the order right now!

126
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,777
-Yes, sir.
-I'll put him on another IV line.

127
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,404
How long has it been?

128
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:27,822
Two minutes.

129
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,240
Ho-jun. Switch with him.

130
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,366
Okay, I'll switch.

131
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:33,369
I'll do it.

132
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,621
He said, it has been two minutes.

133
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:36,747
I'll do this!

134
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,251
Stop that and switch.

135
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,893
Stop it and switch hands with him.

136
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,444
What happened?

137
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:08,654
He went into PEA arrest.

138
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,073
Urine didn't come out due to hypovolemia,

139
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,867
and he had metabolic acidosis as well.

140
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,786
He's getting bicarbonate injections.
I gave the order just now.

141
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,998
I'll keep the place under control.

142
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:19,957
Please leave.

143
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,584
-Ms. Oh.
-Yes?

144
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,295
Get the stapler remover
and blade number ten.

145
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,463
Yes, sir.

146
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,633
Don't make this too complicated.

147
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:29,967
Move aside.

148
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,970
Can you take responsibility
if the worst happens to him?

149
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,097
Can you save him?

150
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,854
That should've been your first question.
Don't you think so, Dr. Park?

151
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,106
All ready, Doctor Kim.

152
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:48,653
Switch hands with him.

153
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,530
Oh, okay.

154
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,453
Iodine.

155
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,505
Remover.

156
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:13,427
Keep going!

157
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:15,429
Yes, sir.

158
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,110
Scalpel.

159
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,534
What is he trying to do?

160
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,786
Stop.

161
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,683
What is he doing right now?

162
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,435
Tell him to stop now. Right now!

163
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:05,896
Doctor Kim is doing his best
to save him right now.

164
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,148
Trust him.

165
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,233
He'll make sure he saves Minister Ryu.

166
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,423
He doesn't have enough volume.

167
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,717
Squeeze the RBC pack.

168
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,010
I'll do that.

169
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,113
Professor Park.

170
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,025
Hey, his pulse is back.

171
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,403
He got his pulse back, Doctor Kim.

172
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,254
Gosh, my legs.

173
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,808
Great work.

174
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:32,877
Professor Sim?

175
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:34,962
Who are you?

176
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,339
I'm Cha Eun-jae,
a second-year fellow of CS.

177
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,717
I was dispatched here as of yesterday.

178
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,177
Is this the staff room?

179
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,095
Yes.

180
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,224
What brings you here?

181
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,560
Whose pillow is that?

182
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,562
That's mine.

183
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,731
Can I use your bed?

184
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:54,774
Yes, of course.

185
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,570
Gosh, my back.

186
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,532
Things will be awfully tough
for a few days.

187
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,243
Aren't you going to sleep?

188
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,829
It's all right.
You can go ahead and sleep.

189
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,957
You should sleep while you can.
That's how you can survive.

190
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,259
Can you give that to me?

191
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,969
What? Sure.

192
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,269
Oh, hey. That's perfect.

193
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,959
Professor Park?

194
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,494
I'm all finished.

195
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,037
Keep your eye on him.

196
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,165
If his vitals look even a bit odd,
give me a call right away.

197
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,334
Yes, sir.

198
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,468
Great work, Dr. Seo.

199
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:47,928
You did well.

200
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,351
Great work, Dr. Seo.

201
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,187
I was just surprised and flustered.

202
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,107
You kept the patient with you

203
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,192
until Doctor Kim got here.

204
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,072
You did well.

205
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,828
I'll send Nurse Park over.

206
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,164
You shouldn't strain yourself.
Get some sleep if you can.

207
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,449
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

208
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,369
You really are amazing.

209
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,458
I was honestly touched.

210
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,256
That was probably the third time
I've seen an open heart massage.

211
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,217
Today was the first one that succeeded.

212
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,639
I got lucky.

213
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,560
And he isn't completely stable yet.

214
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,354
Why do you stay at a nameless hospital

215
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,815
with your skills and competence?

216
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,109
It's not nameless.

217
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,820
Didn't you see the sign out there
that says Doldam Hospital?

218
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,072
Is this like Schweitzer syndrome?

219
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,993
I can't explain this situation

220
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,703
if it isn't the case.

221
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,206
Why does the only doctor in Korea
who's triple-board certified

222
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,501
stay in a desolate hospital
like this one?

223
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,963
It's not like you get

224
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,923
any money or fame from doing this.

225
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,927
Because these patients need me.

226
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,724
Is that really the only reason?

227
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:42,102
Does a doctor need another reason

228
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,896
than his patients?

229
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,191
I've been curious about you…

230
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,985
for a long time.

231
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,613
I offered to come down here

232
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,115
because I wanted to meet you.

233
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,786
And now that I've met you,

234
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,288
I think you're one of the two.

235
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,625
You're either insane…

236
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,962
or an awful liar.

237
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,717
I don't believe anyone does a goodwill

238
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,552
without expecting a return.

239
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,722
I've never seen anything like that.

240
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,357
It's getting pretty late.

241
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,110
You should get to sleep.

I guess the rumors weren't that off.

246
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,879
We'll see after we take his mask off…

247
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,633
if he really is a monster

248
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,594
or if he's a snob pretending to be one.

I can't believe now snooty he is.

252
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:21,660
Guys who are a big success at his age
tend to have that symptom.

253
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,120
An inflated ego.

254
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,580
So annoying.

255
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,374
I want to smack his head
and tell him to behave.

256
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:30,002
Why did you get so tough?

257
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,296
No idea. Maybe it's menopause.

258
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,338
It's hot.

Are you ill?

320
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,934
A little. I must have caught a cold.

321
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,852
I have a sore throat,

322
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,313
and I'm coughing a little.

323
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,148
Am I feverish?

Hello.

00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,385
I'm GS Park Min-gook of Geosan Hospital.

334
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:39,222
As you are all aware,
Minister Ryu Woong-il of National Defense

335
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:42,100
got into a car accident
and was hospitalized here

336
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,185
at Doldam Hospital, a branch of Geosan.

337
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:48,231
His condition was so critical
that he couldn't be transferred to Seoul.

338
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:51,318
We conducted the first operation
here in this hospital,

339
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,653
but there was no improvement
to his condition

340
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:57,157
so we will conduct his second operation
this afternoon.

341
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:04,039
Will Dr. Bu Yong-ju operate on
the minister again this time?

342
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:07,250
MINISTER RYU TO RECEIVE SECOND OPERATION

344
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,714
Wait, what is he saying, Ms. Oh?

345
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,090
Ms. Oh!

346
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:17,135
There are reporters
and Professor Park out there--

347
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,511
She's already watching.

348
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,556
Right. I see.

349
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:25,310
But you're all just standing around.

350
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,821
Don't blame me for anything.

351
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:40,116
I'm just doing my job as I was told.

352
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,036
What's this all about?
Is it because he's a minister?

353
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:43,995
Of course.

354
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,915
If it weren't for the minister,
why would he make such a scene?

355
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:52,379
People from all walks of life
have their attention on this case.

356
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:56,508
There's no better chance than this
for someone who craves attention.

357
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,302
But don't you think it's wrong to steal

358
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,970
someone else's patient?

359
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:03,682
It's not like doctors are some thugs.

360
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,267
What's going on, Dr. Seo?

361
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,811
You've changed a little.

362
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,356
-What?
-You were never that type.

363
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,066
Keep your character, will you?

364
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,694
If you suddenly change too much
you'll only end up being confused.

365
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,406
Those up above will make the decisions,

366
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:24,160
and, Dr. Seo, you can just do your job.
All right?

367
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,378
Just let them go on.

368
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,881
What? You…
You want us to leave them alone?

369
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,717
We have to leave them alone.

370
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,927
They want to do all the hard work.

371
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,637
Why should we stop them?

372
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:46,433
I'm just glad I can get more rest
thanks to them.

373
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,393
By any chance,

374
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:50,562
are you avoiding this?

375
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,981
Let's say I'm observing the situation.

376
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,567
You can't just sit around observing!

377
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,116
Why do you keep overreacting?

378
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:07,203
Weren't you going to stick around
for just one week?

379
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,539
You said you'll reconsider in a week.

380
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,836
That's only if you change my mind.

381
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:15,920
But you are…

382
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,631
nowhere near the answer.

383
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,262
Are you going to let them handle
the minister?

384
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,222
Hey, don't worry about him.

385
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,892
They all studied a lot too.

386
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:31,853
There's someone over there
who trained at Hopkins too.

387
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:37,192
Hey, guys like them
won't put in the needles the wrong way.

388
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,321
-Doctor Kim.
-Yes?

389
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,405
I'm all done organizing.

390
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,073
Oh, okay.

391
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,118
Nurse Park, go get some sleep.

392
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:50,038
You probably didn't get to sleep
after staying up all night.

393
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,372
Goodness.

394
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,250
My goodness. I'll stretch out

395
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,253
and get a good sleep for once.

396
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,632
Hey.

397
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,717
If it's not an emergency,

398
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,511
don't wake me.

399
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,930
My gosh.

400
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,391
TREATMENT ROOM

401
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:16,815
What was that?

402
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,316
Why did he suddenly change?

403
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,276
Am I the only one who's flustered?

404
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,487
I completely understand how you feel.

405
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,823
If you do, then why did you stand around
doing nothing?

406
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,450
Because Dr. Kim made that decision.

407
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,120
If he makes a decision,

408
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,706
are we supposed to blindly follow

409
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,084
as if we have no opinions
or thoughts of our own?

410
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,879
It's not because we have
no other opinions or thoughts.

411
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,965
We follow because we respect his decision.

412
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,531
-Please explain.
-A comment, please.

413
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:07,657
Say a few words!

414
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,576
-Can we get a comment?
-Why the sudden change?

415
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,787
Why the sudden change in lead surgeons?

416
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:16,916
From what I know,
Dr. Bu Yong-ju put many lives at risk

417
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,919
by performing risky, reckless procedures.

418
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,548
Is that the reason?

419
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:26,384
At the moment, all I can say is that

420
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:30,722
we will do our very best to make sure
the second surgery is a success.

421
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:33,349
As for the surgical outcome,

422
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:37,395
we will hold a detailed briefing
after the surgery is over.

423
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,272
That'll be all.

424
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,275
-Wait.
-A few more comments, please!

425
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:45,278
DOCTOR PARK MIN-GOOK WILL PERFORM
MINISTER RYU'S SECOND SURGERY

426
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,447
Hi, Reporter Choi.

427
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:48,990
It's me.

428
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:51,618
Weren't the questions too direct?

429
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,706
No, of course not. Well done.

430
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,542
That's the media's role, you know.

431
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:03,046
You can't dig out the truth
with a dull knife.

432
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,382
Make some time to meet with me.

433
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,468
I'll take you to a nice place.

434
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:11,471
Sure. Of course.

435
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,058
Call me then. All right.

436
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:24,943
Professor Park?

437
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,198
What is this game you're playing?

438
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,909
You don't even work at this hospital.

439
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:36,746
Who said you could hold
a press conference here?

440
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:40,792
And who gave you the authority
to decide to lead the second surgery?

441
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:42,752
Who are you?

442
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:45,296
I'm Oh Myeong-sim, the head nurse.

443
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:49,968
This isn't something
a head nurse should meddle in.

444
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:52,845
Yes, I'm aware.

445
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,139
Usually, I'd stay out of things like this.

446
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,182
However,

447
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,394
what is happening right now

448
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:03,147
is just shitty, Professor Park.

449
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,857
-Look.
-Ms. Oh!

450
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,609
Calm down, please.

451
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,946
We're calling it a second surgery,

452
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:13,741
but you just need to sew him up
once the hemorrhaging stops, right?

453
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,494
Doctor Kim saved his life.

454
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,496
You're barely doing anything,

455
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:21,833
yet you'll take all the credit.
You'll tell everyone that you saved him.

456
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,710
-Am I wrong?
-Ms. Oh, please.

457
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,211
Tell me if I'm wrong!

458
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,963
You're right.

459
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,426
That's why I held the press conference.

460
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,012
Will you please excuse me now?

461
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:37,765
This way, sir.

462
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,436
-What a jerk!
-Calm down.

463
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,687
Please calm down, Ms. Oh.

464
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,690
-How dare he!
-Gosh, please. Enough.

465
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,734
Goodness, unbelievable.

466
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:51,654
-I'm speechless. My gosh.
-All right.

467
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,000
CHIEF OF GENERAL SURGERY, DOCTOR KIM

468
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,423
CHIEF OF GENERAL SURGERY, DOCTOR KIM

469
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:12,967
People of Doldam.

470
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:14,635
Those jerks

471
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,722
want an all-out war with us.

472
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:20,683
We will no longer tolerate this.

473
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,186
I get that they're from the main hospital,

474
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:26,856
but they belittle and mistreat us
just because they feel like it

475
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,983
without any valid reason or cause.

476
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,318
They do this to us all the time!

477
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:35,031
And now, those savages are even
intercepting one of our patients.

478
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,783
We absolutely won't let this slide.

479
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,036
You all know what Doldam stands for.

480
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:43,498
A hospital where anyone can visit
when in need of medical assistance.

481
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,625
We're open 24/7, 365 days a year.

482
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,503
I think Nurse Joo likes Nurse Park.

483
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:49,670
What?

484
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,547
-But he is…
-They say a rolling stone…

485
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,965
obviously married to his job.

486
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,717
It'll be hard to win his heart.

487
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,344
What are you talking about?

488
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,512
-Hush.
-I can no longer…

489
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,098
-Keep it down.
-tolerate their impudence.

490
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,141
As of this moment, they're not allowed

491
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,769
to view or access any of our patient files

492
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,854
including Minister Ryu's.

493
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:11,067
From the surgical reports
to basic patient charts,

494
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:15,113
we won't share any information with them.

495
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,030
No exceptions.

496
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:18,449
Do you all understand?

497
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,659
Yes, ma'am!

498
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,202
And I guess Nurse Um's love life

499
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,162
-isn't going so well.
-We won't surrender.

500
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,080
A fight, perhaps?

501
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,748
We'll stay strong and…

502
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,417
Her boyfriend must be ignoring her texts.

503
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,044
-Dr. Yoon.
-I trust that…

504
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:34,257
-Gosh, keep it down.
-you're all with me.

505
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,758
Dr. Jeong, Dr. Yoon.

506
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:36,801
-Yes, Ms. Oh.
-Yes.

507
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,719
You will join us, right?

508
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,471
Yes, of course. Sure thing.

509
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:42,640
Yes, me too.

510
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,976
This is not the time to laugh.

511
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:45,893
My apologies.

512
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,439
And Ms. Oh probably has low estrogen.

513
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:51,858
What?

514
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:55,987
So?

515
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,156
You still don't have the surgical reports?

516
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:02,201
I've put in several requests,
but they just keep saying no.

517
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,162
-No, you can't view them.
-No can do.

518
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,746
Sorry, but I can't help you with that.

519
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,873
Well…

520
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,792
They'll disobey the minister's doctor?

521
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,669
Oh, Minister Ryu's doctor?

522
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,045
You mean, Doctor Kim?

523
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,047
We only take orders from Doctor Kim.

524
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,383
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

525
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:20,928
Don't they know that Professor Park
is Minister Ryu's doctor now?

526
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,722
They know that, of course.

527
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,473
They're just in denial. That's all.

528
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:27,351
Do they all want to get fired or what?

529
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:31,147
The staff here are as rough
as the hospital itself.

530
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,069
Yes, Professor.

531
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,112
Oh, right.

532
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,949
Yes, I'll be there in five minutes. Okay.

533
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,492
Was that Professor Park?

534
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,328
He's headed to see Minister Ryu now.

535
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,954
Gosh, this is crazy.

536
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,789
Do you know anyone at this hospital?

537
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,167
Using your connections
would be the only solution.

538
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,836
How would I know anyone
at this darned hospital?

539
00:36:58,799 --> 00:36:59,967
Bae Moon-jung?

540
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,969
Dr. Yang Ho-jun?

541
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,157
Dr. Cha Eun-jae?

542
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:02,989
How's the patient doing?

543
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,742
His BP, heart rate,
and oxygen levels are all stable.

544
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,829
His temperature is a little high
but it's nothing to be alarmed by.

545
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,455
The brain CT scan looks fine too.

546
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,083
I have to check his follow-up lab results,

547
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:17,420
but I think he's stable enough
to go through the second surgery.

548
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,630
Let me know when the results are out.

549
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,008
By the way,

550
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:26,387
you've never taken over
another doctor's patient in the past.

551
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,308
We'll go ahead with the surgery
if all the results come back clean.

552
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,310
Book an OR and call me.

553
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,488
Professor.

554
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:45,573
Here, I have it.

555
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,955
SURGICAL REPORT
LEAD SURGEON, DOCTOR KIM

556
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,082
Do you know anyone in CS
at the main hospital?

557
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,083
CS?

558
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,336
Yes, I do. One person.

559
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,630
Then find out more about
Cha Eun-jae, a second-year fellow.

560
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,299
Cha Eun-jae?

561
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,259
About her personality

562
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:09,013
and why she was transferred here.

563
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,222
Okay, will do.

564
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:20,232
Hey, what? What's going on?

565
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:30,534
Sit down.

566
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,580
Hey, be my ally.

567
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:37,375
What?
Are you talking to yourself or what?

568
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,418
I said, be my ally. "Ally."

569
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,420
I can't hear you with that mask on.

570
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,548
Gosh.

571
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,263
Your face looks like an abstract painting.

572
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,723
This wasn't what I was going for.

573
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,016
Don't get cheeky with me.

574
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,018
Listen up, okay?

575
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,145
This is very important to us.

576
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,605
What's so important?

577
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,190
We might be able

578
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:04,068
to go back to the main hospital.

579
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,404
What do you mean?

580
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,492
Did you participate
in Minister Ryu's surgery?

581
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:14,328
Oh, yes, I did.

582
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,498
I've been tending to him
since he arrived at the ER.

583
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,834
I see. That's good.

584
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:23,129
The second surgery is booked
for this afternoon,

585
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,673
and I need someone
who participated in the first one.

586
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:26,882
Oh…

587
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,634
I see.

588
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,052
My answer is no.

589
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,847
Can you hear me out first?

590
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:36,934
This surgery is so important
to Prof. Park.

591
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:40,146
And we'll assist him
in that important surgery

592
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:44,358
on the condition that he has to take us
back to the main hospital.

593
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,068
-What do you think?
-Do it if you want to.

594
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,361
I'm not interested.

595
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:51,490
I'd obviously go in alone if I could.

596
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:54,910
As you know, I left halfway
through the surgery.

597
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,038
Fine.

598
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,416
I will forgive you for this ridiculousness

599
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,585
you did to my face, so--

600
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:03,711
Eun-jae, I said no.

601
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:04,712
I won't do it.

602
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,006
You're frustrating me so much.

603
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:09,341
This is a good opportunity for you.

604
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:13,179
Nothing bad will come out
of winning points with Professor Park.

605
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,805
I don't need to win points with him.

606
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,600
You said you need money.

607
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:20,769
Isn't the pay higher at the main hospital?

608
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:23,189
Let's go back together.

609
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,149
Come on. We have a shot at it.

610
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,527
Life must be so easy for you.

611
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,321
What are you talking about?

612
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:34,617
You think you can outsmart everyone
not knowing you're the biggest idiot.

613
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,620
Hey. What kind of idiot is this smart?

614
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:38,787
You didn't know?

615
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:41,790
There are so many idiots like you.

616
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:45,669
Nerdy idiots who like being in first place
but know nothing about life.

617
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:48,380
Those delusional idiots think
they're the smartest.

618
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:51,342
Enough, okay?
If you go on, I'll be really insulted.

619
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,344
Just think of it as advice
from a friend.

620
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:54,303
"Friend"?

621
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:56,931
Since when were we friends?

622
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:02,353
Since when did you care about me enough
to offer me such words of advice?

623
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:14,490
Go wash your face.
Your face looks hilarious.

624
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:22,915
Hello, Dr. Seo.

625
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:27,378
STAFF LOUNGE

626
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:29,838
My, he's so cool.

627
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,092
Woo-jin, stop right there!

628
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:35,094
Oh, Dr. Cha.

629
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,096
What happened to your face?

630
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,807
-Is that mold?
-No, it's not.

631
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,183
It's just atopic dermatitis.

632
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,311
Atopic dermatitis?

633
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,396
That sounds so cool.

634
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,944
Nurse Park.

635
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,245
I should get back to work.

636
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,711
Yes, I'll keep you updated.

637
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,969
Sir, we'll do an ultrasound.

638
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,817
Gosh, it looks like the capsule burst.

639
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,235
The entire abdominal cavity is…

640
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:37,239
Put him on a drip of 100 ml
of saline and 50 ml of pethidine.

641
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,365
Got it.

642
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,326
Hello, this is Jeong In-su.

643
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:43,787
About the spleen injury patient
who was admitted to the ICU yesterday.

644
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:47,082
Minister Ryu's secretary.
His vitals are suddenly fluctuating.

645
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,627
Dr. Seo just did an ultrasound and spotted

646
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,379
severe intra-abdominal hemorrhaging.

647
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:56,050
Yes, we'll get ready.
We're moving him to the OR now.

648
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,551
-Let's move him.
-Okay.

649
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,178
Sir, we have to transport you.

650
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,180
Hang in there, please.

651
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,765
Excuse me, what's wrong?

652
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:05,434
His condition suddenly worsened.

653
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:07,227
It looks like he needs surgery.

654
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:13,567
Sir.

655
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:16,737
Minister Ryu will be taken to the OR
in five minutes.

656
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,868
Two of you stay here.
The rest, go to the OR.

657
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,329
I'll go with the minister.

658
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:26,664
Understood, sir.

659
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,437
That jerk.

660
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,654
STAFF ROOM

661
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,873
Why do you keep following me?

662
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,042
I have nothing to say to you.

663
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:15,629
I was just on my way to get changed.
I have to put on my scrubs.

664
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:24,388
MALE CHANGING ROOM

665
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,321
Hey.

666
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:44,658
Must you really join the surgery?

667
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,995
Yes. I'm going in.

668
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,998
You asked me what Doctor Kim is like.

669
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:54,042
So? What do you think he's like?

670
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,170
I think…

671
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,839
he's a little scary.

672
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,216
Is that why you shrank away?
Because you're scared?

673
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,968
He's not "scary" in that sense.

674
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:03,886
Then how?

675
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,684
I feel like he may be the real deal.

676
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:12,811
That's what scares me.

677
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,274
Do you know what kind of people
scare me the most?

678
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,652
Those who don't need me.

679
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:23,822
As of this moment,
you're banned from my OR.

680
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,533
Those who jump to conclusions about me

681
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,786
when they don't even know me well.

682
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:31,622
Leaving your patient like that
is enough to disqualify you as a doctor.

683
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:35,417
Do you understand?
Get over it or just quit being a doctor!

684
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:39,505
So?

685
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,674
Are you saying Park Min-gook needs you?

686
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,887
He at least remembered my name.

687
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,775
Are you really not coming with me?

688
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:03,111
I'm asking because I need your help.

689
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:04,863
Will you help me?

690
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,661
PATIENT: RYU WOONG-IL

691
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:14,289
By the way,
will his family not be present?

692
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,584
His wife passed away,

693
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,462
and his children live in Jeju Island.

694
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:23,131
But the planes are grounded
because of the weather.

695
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:24,341
I see.

696
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,386
His secretary's family isn't here either.

697
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,101
His parents passed away when he was young.

698
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:35,644
He has one brother.

699
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:38,146
Could you not reach his brother?

700
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:43,402
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

701
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,961
PATIENT: LEE JOO-YOUNG

702
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,839
GUARDIAN: LEE DAE-YOUNG, BROTHER

703
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:06,008
MILITARY POLICE

704
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:13,473
Sir.

705
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:16,560
The minister's son and his wife
just arrived at Yangyang Airport.

706
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,395
They'll head over here right away.

707
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:19,980
Okay.

708
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:54,848
What do you mean?

709
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,809
They got their hands on the records?

710
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:00,729
I just got a text from the ICU nurse.

711
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:02,981
They have the chart and surgical records

712
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,858
as well as the anesthesia records.

713
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,152
Gosh, who gave them everything?

714
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,113
-Who on earth--
-I…

715
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,699
gave them the records.

716
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,117
What?

717
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,286
You did? Why?

718
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,246
Because I was told to.

719
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,456
By whom?

720
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:21,166
Doctor Kim.

721
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:25,295
Doctor Kim?

722
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,089
Yes.

723
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,423
Why on earth did you do that?

724
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:29,633
Do what?

725
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:33,303
The minister's chart and surgical reports.

726
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,764
You told Dr. Bae to hand it over to them.

727
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:38,600
Right, I did.

728
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:39,977
But why?

729
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,604
That man, Park Min-gook.

730
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:45,774
I've done some research,
and he's pretty good.

731
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:47,442
I figured

732
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:51,029
he'd do a fine job with the surgery, so--

733
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:51,947
So you are

734
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,116
surrendering like this?

735
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:55,826
What?

736
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,203
Right.

737
00:49:58,286 --> 00:50:01,039
Do Yun-wan obviously has more power

738
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,709
now that he's the chair of the foundation.

739
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:05,669
I know that, but…

740
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:10,007
I didn't think
you'd throw in the towel this easily.

741
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,508
You saved that patient.

742
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,594
How could you give up so easily?

743
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,471
I didn't save him by myself.

744
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:20,517
We saved him together, Ms. Oh.

745
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,893
Also,

746
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,022
I haven't given up.

747
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:26,398
Then what is this?

748
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:28,608
Why let them operate on him?

749
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:33,488
What's another word for "crisis"?

750
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:35,365
"Anger."

751
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:43,582
Gosh, you have such a fiery temper.

752
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:48,336
To turn this crisis into an opportunity,

753
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,798
we need to use what Do Yun-wan
never considered.

754
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:57,012
But he already knows everything
about you and our hospital.

755
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,890
He might even know things
that we don't know--

756
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:00,974
Hush.

757
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:06,063
No.

758
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:08,190
I don't think that's the case.

759
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:11,651
There are things that he doesn't know yet.

760
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,787
RESTRICTED AREA: OPERATING ROOM

761
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:34,800
I'm here, Professor.

762
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,303
Hey.

763
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:44,893
Did you already administer the anesthesia?
What would you like me to do?

764
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:47,521
Nothing.
There won't be much for you to do.

765
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,440
-Pardon?
-Dr. Cha.

766
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:52,692
Anxiety attacks in the OR?

767
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,403
I was told that you ran out of the OR

768
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:57,697
less than ten minutes
into the surgery last time.

769
00:51:59,074 --> 00:51:59,991
I'm sorry,

770
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,703
but we can't let something like that

771
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,789
happen during Professor Park's surgery.

772
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:07,082
It's simply unacceptable.

773
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:08,125
But…

774
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:12,754
I've been following up on his condition
since he arrived at the ER.

775
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,422
I'm sure I can be of help.

776
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:17,509
It's okay.
Someone else is joining us to help us out.

777
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,178
There he is.

778
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:23,598
Seo Woo-jin?

779
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:25,809
What is going on?

780
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,727
What do you think?

781
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,480
He betrayed you and joined us
so that he could snatch the opportunity.

782
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:34,901
This punk is a pro at stabbing others
in the back, you know.

783
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,240
The minister is under anesthesia now.

784
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:41,950
All right.

785
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:43,660
Okay, let's get ready.

786
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:44,619
Yes, sir.

787
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:02,804
But why me?

788
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:06,975
I know all they have to do is sew him up,

789
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:09,686
but they still need someone
who knows about the first surgery.

790
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:12,689
You're the only one who can do it,

791
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:13,940
so go help them.

792
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:15,859
I don't want to.

793
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:18,904
I wasn't asking your opinion.
Just do as I say.

794
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:24,451
Eun-jae will have to go in if you don't.

795
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:28,330
Do you want to see her throwing up
and running out of the OR again?

796
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:32,918
RESTRICTED AREA

797
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:52,020
RESTRICTED AREA: OPERATING ROOM

798
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:05,283
Do you think it'll be okay?

799
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,410
I have no idea either.

800
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,120
Doctor Kim always thinks

801
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:11,122
outside the box, you know.

802
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:14,501
But we'd at least be able to tell
which one of the two

803
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,711
will stay and which one will leave.

804
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:18,713
What if they both leave?

805
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:20,924
Or both of them might stay.

806
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:39,127
OPERATING ROOM 1

807
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,378

808
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:45,967
That scumbag.

809
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,892
All right. Let's begin.

810
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,397
Okay, let's begin the surgery.

811
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:00,482
Scalpel.

812
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:05,362
Scalpel.

813
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:16,706
"Friend"?

814
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,958
Since when were we friends?

815
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:24,130
Since when did you care about me enough
to offer me such words of advice?

816
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,967
To tell you the truth, back then…

817
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:36,476
TAXI

818
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:48,822
Darn it! I'm so late. Gosh!

819
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:06,464
Gosh, what do I do?

820
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,633
Why Prof. Jung's lecture of all classes?

821
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,594
Gosh, this is so crazy!

822
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:16,474
Diagnosing a malignant bone marrow…

823
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:20,979
What is this?

824
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:22,814
You're late for your first class?

825
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:24,399
I'm sorry.

826
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:28,236
You all know that I don't forgive
tardiness or absences, right?

827
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,071
What's your name?

828
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,698
I'm Seo Woo-jin, sir.

829
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:36,119
Let's see. Seo Woo-jin.

830
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:40,039
-You can sit here.
-You're getting three penalty points.

831
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,458
Don't be late.

832
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:43,126
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

833
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,723
Isn't Eun-jae really something?

834
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,391
She got all A pluses, again.

835
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:02,020
I heard she never eats dinner
because she doesn't want to waste time.

836
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:04,397
-Apparently, she never even poops.
-Stop.

837
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:08,151
-She was famous in high school too.
-She's obsessed with being the top.

838
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:09,402
Gosh, how obnoxious.

839
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,862
Why wouldn't she eat?

840
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:13,114
If I get put on probation, I'll be doomed.

Gosh.

846
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:03,039
All right. Someone…

847
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:05,708
got a perfect score on the test.

848
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:08,044

Seo Woo-jin.

My gosh!

851
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:15,260
Give him a big hand!

852
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:29,065
Here's your fritter.

853
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:30,400
Thank you.

854
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:41,160
Here are your tteokbokki and fritters.

855
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,501
I heard you excel on practical tests,

856
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:53,006
but you barely make the cut
when it comes to written exams.

857
00:59:57,885 --> 00:59:59,429
Let me know if you need anything else.

858
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:01,347
How about we become allies?

859
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:06,227
Help me do better on practical tests.

860
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,314
What will you do for me in return?

861
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:20,658
I'll share all my study materials
with you.

862
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:23,202
I have one for every course.

863

you won't fail a single class.

01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,561
that you were simply enduring it

877
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:33,189
instead of thriving,

878
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:36,567

No, don't hold it vertically like that.

884
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:10,893
-Keep it down and do it in one go.
-In one go?

885
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:13,521
Just do it.

886
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,817
-Gosh, I don't think I can do this!
-Geez.

887
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,862
It hurts more if you hesitate like that.

888
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:23,030
Okay.

01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,907
-Just stick it in, okay?
-Okay.

890
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,076
Muster the courage and stick it in.

891
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:27,994
Yes, just do it.

892
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,370
Muster the courage.

895
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:40,965
Does it hurt?

896
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:01,944
I'll sue all the doctors and the hospital
for medical malpractice.

897
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,571
Is that worthy of a lawsuit?

898
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:06,365
Did they try to coax you or something?

899
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,368
I know you want to go back.

900
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:13,539
I'll persuade Professor Park,
so promise that you'll keep quiet.

901
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,876
If you decided to side with Doctor Kim,
just stay on his side.

902
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,961
You obnoxious opportunist.

903
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:21,547
What about the CT scan?
You didn't check before coming in?

904
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:25,384
Did you deliberately send me there
to test me and see

905
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:27,720
what I'd do to Professor Park?

906
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,013
You told me to find an answer!

907
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:32,517
Damn it.
