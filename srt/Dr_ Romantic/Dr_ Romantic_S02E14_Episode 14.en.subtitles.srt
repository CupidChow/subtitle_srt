1
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,801
I need to talk to you, sir.

2
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,137
What's it about? Go ahead.

3
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,266
I'm afraid…

4
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,313
I have to move to another hospital.

5
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,443
I heard there's a doctor

6
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,737
called Doctor Kim at Doldam.

7
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:20,080
Just seal the paper quietly

8
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,582
unless you want us to cut off his hands.

9
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,959
Crushing the hands

10
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,836
of some rural hospital doctor?

11
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,255
For us,

12
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,758
it's a piece of cake.

13
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,070
There's a hospital in Seoul…

14
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,073
that offered to pay me twice as much.

15
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,910
It bothered me
that I had to pay you a million won

16
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,245
every single month,

17
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,580
and if I get paid twice as much,

18
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,333
I could probably pay off everything else.

19
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:07,544
That's why…

20
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,463
I decided to do it.

21
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,467
You already decided to do it?

22
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,303
I'll follow the progress

23
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,305
of the patient in the ICU.

24
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,185
Then I'll resign.

25
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,492
Hey, Woo-jin.

26
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,369
What's going on?

27
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,872
You suddenly disappeared
and had us worried,

28
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,041
then came back saying
you'll move to a different hospital.

29
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,127
Why is everything so random with you?

30
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,879
I'm tired. I need some rest.

31
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,719
Shouldn't you at least explain?

32
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,053
Didn't you hear me?

33
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:02,473
-I'm going to a hospital in Seoul.
-Where in Seoul?

34
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,101
You can't go anywhere because of Hyun-jun.

35
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,812
He lifted…

36
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,773
their boycott against me.

37
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:12,609
He did?

38
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,652
He can't forgive me for what I've done,

39
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,239
but he also doesn't want to ruin
his junior's life.

40
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,825
He went to the alumni associations

41
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,036
and brought the contract himself,

42
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,496
complete with double my current salary.

43
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:27,916
Isn't he something?

44
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:30,460
Tell me.

45
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:33,671
You're using money as an excuse.
I know you have another reason.

46
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:37,050
The whole world already knows
that I'm a guy in need of money.

47
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,010
Why should there be another reason?

48
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,221
You're being

49
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,431
really weird and awkward.

50
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:44,891
Do you know that?

51
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:48,519
Do you know what was…

52
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,148
the weirdest and most awkward for me

53
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,900
in my entire life?

54
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,195
It's this place, Doldam Hospital.

55
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,740
The people I met here.

56
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,078
The time I spent with them.

57
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,206
And…

58
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,256
It's time for me to wake up

59
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,757
and return to where I was.

60
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,344
That's the right thing to do for everyone.

61
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,838
I SOLEMNLY SWEAR TO DEDICATE MY LIFE
TO SERVING HUMANITY AS A DOCTOR

62
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,885
DOCTOR AGENCY, CEO IM HYUN-JUN

63
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,692
DOCTOR AGENCY, CEO IM HYUN-JUN

64
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,296
SELECTIVE DYSLEXIA

65
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:50,350
-Are you coming in now?
-What brings you here this early?

66
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:52,935
What do you think?

67
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:57,231
-I'm here to schedule the surgery.
-Haven't you told Professor Park yet?

68
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,526
-I won't open up the OR for him.
-Of course I did.

69
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,153
However,

70
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,947
he's going ahead with it.

71
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,325
Then find another anesthesiologist.

72
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,537
Don't you think you're a bit too much?

73
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,289
What?

74
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:15,792
Professor Sim.

75
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,213
Did you already forget what happened
three years ago?

76
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:25,551
Don't you remember who took your side
when you were about to be fired?

77
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,262
If you're thankful for
what Professor Park did,

78
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,098
you shouldn't do this to him.

79
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,225
I'm doing this for his sake.

80
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,769
I'm afraid he'll cause major trouble.
Don't you get it?

81
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,397
That's why you and I should help him

82
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,608
so that no matter what happens,
he finishes this surgery successfully.

83
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,944
That's what Professor Park wants the most.

84
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:45,738
That is…

85
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,616
how you repay someone,

86
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:50,785
Professor Sim.

87
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,710
Is his urine all right?

88
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:00,962
It was fine.

89
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,798
If his oxygen saturation changes,
let me know.

90
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:04,715
Yes, sir.

91
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,009
Sir.

92
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,679
The operation went well. Don't worry.

93
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,389
I'll check in often.

94
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,015
Okay.

95
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,021
Let's watch him until the afternoon.

96
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,065
If his BP is stable and his urine is fine,

97
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,235
-we'll move him to a regular ward.
-Yes, Doctor.

98
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:35,788
Doctor Seo.

99
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:37,999
May I ask you a question?

100
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,627
Do those creditors

101
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,506
have anything to do
with the decision you made yesterday?

102
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,013
Why do you ask?

103
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,181
Just because.

104
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,018
I just want to know.

105
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,772
I don't want to tell you.

106
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,109
Even if I do, nothing will change anyway.

107
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:12,867
STAFF ONLY, ICU

108
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,125
So what?

109
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,127
Is Woo-jin really leaving us?

110
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:24,420
Yes.

111
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,796
He's leaving.

112
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,132
That's too bad.

113
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,760
I thought he was getting settled in.

114
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,970
Do you think he did this

115
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,972
because he was threatened
by his creditors?

116
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,807
That's what I think too.

117
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,601
He doesn't seem like the type

118
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:42,104
to make such a decision
only because of money, Doctor Kim.

119
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,565
He'll be paid twice as much.

120
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,776
How can there be any other reason?

121
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,403
Money is the truth and life in this world.

122
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:50,905
Show me the money.

123
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,949
All that money.

124
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,951
That's just your opinion.

125
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,828
Let's just say it's my animal instinct.

126
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,413
My basic instinct.

127
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,626
-Do you still study English?
-I signed up to long-term classes.

128
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,044
I seem to have a knack for it.

129
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,713
Did you take care of the headhunter?

130
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:09,882
Well…

131
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,135
Somewhat, I guess.

132
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:17,974
Why can't you give us a clear answer?
Don't tell me he got to you.

133
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,101
Gosh. Watch your mouth,

134
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,060
Doctor Nam.

135
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,353
Figures.

136
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,606
He'd be the perfect target
because he's so gullible.

137
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,360
What? Did you just call me "gullible"?
What do you take me for?

138
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,499
What? Woo-jin is leaving too?
He's leaving to work in Seoul?

139
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,875
Who said that?

140
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,087
That recruiter is going around saying

141
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,716
that he hooked him up with a new hospital,
and that he signed the contract too.

142
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,551
He already signed everything?

143
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,178
How accurate is this information?

144
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,932
Did Doctor Seo really sign the contract?

145
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:01,559
Is he sure?

146
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,311
It's not just Doctor Seo.

147
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,771
He said a few more will be signing soon.

148
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,816
Come to think of it, it looked like

149
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,736
Doctor Jeong had been
meeting with him often.

150
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:15,656
Me?

151
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,366
My goodness.

152
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,076
No way.

153
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:22,204
I met him a few times
because we went to the same school.

154
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,166
I'm getting thirsty.

155
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,918
Did I catch a cold?

156
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,232
One rotten apple
does really spoil the barrel.

157
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,235
Can't we do something
about that recruiter or whatever?

158
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:54,820
We can.

159
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,866
I'll have a talk with him.

160
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:04,538
He was my senior in school,
and we were in a study group together.

161
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,790
You can all stay still.

162
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,087
Wow.

163
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,507
Do you know where he is?

164
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:15,883
MEN'S BATHROOM

165
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,929
Would you like some juice?

166
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,264
Right, sure.

167
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,061
Is your work

168
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:28,646
going smoothly?

169
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,107
Yes, I've been discussing it
with a few places.

170
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,024
I see.

171
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,278
I heard

172
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,322
a rumor that

173
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,701
you doubled Doctor Seo's salary.

174
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,285
What?

175
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,580
Of course, I'm not a doctor,

176
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,667
so I won't expect it to be doubled.

177
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,420
-But come on.
-Yes, sure.

178
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,089
I'll get you as much of a raise
as you deserve.

179
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,508
I'm discussing it with a few places,
so give me time.

180
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,051
You'll hear good news very soon.

181
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,346
Goodness.

182
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:03,723
Please make sure

183
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,726
you do a great job for me, Mr. Im.

184
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,936
Sure.

185
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:10,813
Okay.

189
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,537
SEO WOO-JIN

190
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,414
CONFIRMED

191
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,505
WPW syndrome tends to come
without any symptoms,

192
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,717
but if he develops atrial fibrillation,
he could even die suddenly.

193
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,637
Not everyone who has WPW syndrome
dies on the operating table.

194
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,265
On top of that, he's young,

195
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,226
and he has never shown any symptoms.

196
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,355
There isn't a huge possibility
that what you're worried about

197
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,607
will happen.

198
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,359
May I ask why you're trying so hard

199
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,237
to push ahead with this surgery?

200
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,282
Doctor Park.

201
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,201
Do you use your scalpel to win?

202
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,869
I truly hope

203
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,205
that the surgery goes well.

204
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,207
It's time you got off…

205
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:15,294
that bus.

206
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:18,923
Professor Park.

207
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,637
Obviously,

208
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,639
it's for the patient.

209
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:31,769
OR SCHEDULE

210
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:34,980
Please do not make me

211
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:36,899
regret this decision.

212
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,365
Right.

213
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,495
Why don't you let Doctor Seo
go in as your first assistant?

214
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,705
It's open surgery, not laparoscopy.

215
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,208
Doctor Yang isn't as good
at open surgery, is he?

216
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,586
I think Doctor Seo will be more helpful

217
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,171
with his operating skills.

218
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,757
Don't you know

219
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,551
what Professor Park thinks of him?

220
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,387
He's a troublemaker who never listens.

221
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,765
-How can he be in such an important--
-Since this surgery is important,

222
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:14,728
don't you think it's right
to put personal feelings aside,

223
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,021
Doctor Yang Ho-jun?

224
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,327
How's the patient you operated on?

225
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,832
He's showing good progress.
He'll be moved to a regular ward soon.

226
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,543
I'll keep my eye on him until tonight,

227
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,045
and I'll get packed up by tomorrow night.

228
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,298
By tomorrow night?

229
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,800
Yes.

230
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,932
What about your other patient?

231
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,269
The abdominal injury patient was
the last patient I operated on.

232
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,521
Why do you keep changing your story?

233
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,818
What about this?

234
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,070
You said you're my doctor

235
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,281
until you take the stitches out.

236
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,243
You'll need to take these out
before you leave.

237
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,579
And you.

238
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,166
You haven't made my diagnosis yet.

239
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:19,543
Pardon?

240
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,629
What do you want to know?

241
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,547
Your current condition.

242
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,675
It's not something GS should worry about.

243
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,511
But still, I'm your doctor right now.

244
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:33,557
It'll help me make a diagnosis
if you tell me your symptoms.

245
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,187
Doctor.

246
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,397
Back then, I was--

247
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,107
The symptom of my elbow is…

248
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,110
Yes.

249
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,199
What you saw back then is correct.

250
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,577
It's not just my elbow.

251
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:57,081
My wrist, the back of my neck,
and my shoulder blades hurt.

252
00:15:57,164 --> 00:16:01,919
And I get a little bit of a headache too.
After operating for about two hours,

253
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,130
my back, thighs, and even calves

254
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,968
swell up, hurt, get tight, and feel numb.

255
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,388
These symptoms are
usually caused because of aging,

256
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,014
and lack of exercise.

257
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,142
It could also be
because of overwork and stress.

258
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,396
Or it could be a mix of any of those.

259
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,313
Doctor Kim.

260
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:26,318
And there were around two instances
when the pain was almost irritating.

261
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,737
The level of pain was

262
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,699
about three or four on the NRS scale.

263
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,158
Internal Medicine-wise,

264
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,160
I have indigestion

265
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,037
and a bit of heartburn.

266
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,373
Now,

267
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,750
those are all the symptoms I have

268
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,168
which you need to know of.

269
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,671
If you want to find a lead,

270
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,215
you can find it there.

271
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,976
What? Can't you do it?

272
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,979
Doing this won't change anything.

273
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,565
I already signed the contract.

274
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,778
Think of it as your last assignment
from me.

275
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,743
You should have something in your heart

276
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,747
from the time you spent here with me.

277
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,248
Don't you think so?

278
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,879
You have until the end of this week.

279
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,631
I'll let you ask only two more questions.

280
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,301
So think carefully and ask.

281
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:35,596
You get…

282
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,849
only two chances.

283
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:43,729
That's all.

284
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,662
STAFF ROOM

285
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,713
PRESIDENT'S OFFICE

286
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,884
Hey, Hyun-jun. It's me.

287
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,344
Where are you?

288
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,681
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

289
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,475
He's not around the lobby.

290
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,185
He's not upstairs either.

291
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,978
And not around the restrooms.

292
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,480
Maybe he isn't here yet.

293
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,446
Hey.

294
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:35,739
Found him.

295
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:36,782
You did?

296
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:37,783
Where is he?

297
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,077
In a treatment room.

298
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,120
I'm hanging up.

299
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,498
What happened?

300
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,167
Did Woo-jin sign the contract?

301
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,085
Yes.

302
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,462
I got those guys to make him sign it
last night.

303
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,423
Then can you give me
a copy of the contract too?

304
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:56,635
-Why do you need that?
-I need it for something.

305
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,971
What are you doing?

306
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,598
Will you knock before you come in?

307
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,978
I need to talk to you.

308
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,781
TREATMENT ROOM 4

309
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,745
How did you threaten him?

310
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,874
-What do you mean?
-I'm talking about Woo-jin.

311
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:30,669
He's going to a different hospital
because of you, right?

312
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,338
You know there's no way
I can threaten him to do anything.

313
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,883
He's going because of money, that's all.

314
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:36,967
He's in need of money.

315
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,218
Exactly.

316
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,720
It's weird.

317
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:44,391
He's getting paid twice as much,
but he doesn't look thrilled,

318
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,435
as if he's leaving against his will.

319
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,478
It doesn't matter if he's like that.

320
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:52,566
-What does that have to do with you?
-To be honest, you were at fault

321
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,318
for using ghost surgeons.

322
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:56,778
Hey, Eun-jae.

323
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,114
But you acted as if you're the victim,

324
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:03,410
turning Woo-jin into the offender,
when he only wanted to right your wrong.

325
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,914
He was boycotted by the entire industry
and almost got kicked out as well.

326
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,749
So, what are you trying to say?

327
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,042
Yet Woo-jin

328
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,961
never said a bad word about you.

329
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,716
He never said you were at fault
or that he was falsely blamed.

330
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:21,762
I never saw him complain
or make an excuse for what happened.

331
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:24,806
What about you?

332
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,061
Why did you follow him down here
to continuously bully him?

333
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,314
He lost his entire career
because of a senior he trusted,

334
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:36,401
and he finally patched it up
and began to settle down here at Doldam.

335
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,654
Was it that dreadful to see that?

336
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,155
Were you that jealous?

337
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,157
Is that why you're shaking him around?

338
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,951
Are you crazy?

339
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,994
What are you doing right now?

340
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,543
Did you sleep with him?

341
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,259
My gosh. What did he just say?

342
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,052
He must be completely insane…

343
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,763
TREATMENT ROOM 4

344
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,139
Hold your horses.

345
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,517
If you go in right now,
it'll turn into a huge fight.

346
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,394
-Move aside.
-No, you can't go in.

347
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,312
Hey, stop him from going in!

348
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,355
No, Doctor Seo.

349
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,776
What did you just say?

350
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,112
It's not like you're his wife.

351
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:24,241
Why are you so worked up
over what happened to him?

352
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,994
Anyone can obviously see what's going on.

353
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,370
No?

354
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:32,207
That's enough, Ho-jun.
This is a tiny industry, Eun-jae.

355
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:37,629
Your reputation will be ruined at once
if you continue to hang out with Woo-jin.

356
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,464
Be careful.

357
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,894
TREATMENT ROOM 4

358
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,657
Are you insane?
How dare you hit your senior's head?

359
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,660
-You hit my head like that first!
-What?

360
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,120
It wasn't physical,

361
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,246
but it was the same.

362
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,414
No.

363
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,710
You resorted to cheap
and disgusting acts of violence,

364
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,962
worse than any physical abuse!

365
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:22,424
-You!
-Don't talk down to me like that, Yang!

366
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,177
What?

367
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:26,720
"Yang"?

368
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,180
Just "Yang"?

369
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,307
As of this hour, you are

370
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,934
not my senior or anything else.

371
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:36,938
Please stop annoying me
by using your position as a senior.

372
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,523
And…

373
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,778
you need to stop acting like the victim.

374
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,740
You two aren't even funny.

375
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,278
PROFESSOR PARK MIN-GOOK

376
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,867
PROFESSOR PARK MIN-GOOK

377
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,080
Yes, Professor Park.

378
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,165
I'm sorry,

379
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,709
but can you say that again?

380
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,712
PROFESSOR PARK MIN-GOOK

381
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:43,672
SPEAKERPHONE

382
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,465
Mr. Kang Ik-joon's Whipple procedure

383
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:47,884
will begin at two o'clock.

384
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,971
You'll be my first assistant.

385
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,685
Please don't answer him.

386
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,646
Why won't you answer me?
Aren't you going to come in?

387
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,441
Please don't answer him.

388
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:04,943
Yes, sir.

389
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:06,695
I'll be there.

390
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,364
Get ready and come to the monitoring room.

391
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,867
Before that, I have something to tell you.

392
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,786
-What is it?
-Actually,

393
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,248
there's a problem with my contract.

394
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,379
Your contract? What is this about?

395
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,423
Actually, I signed

396
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,592
a contract with Hyun-jun yesterday.

397
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,262
A hospital in Seoul
offered to pay me twice as much.

398
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,645
And the contract says

399
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,939
I can only stay here until today.

400
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,360
So I'm asking you to adjust that date.

401
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:48,904
How so?

402
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,575
Think of it
as your last assignment from me.

403
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,578
You have until the end of this week.

404
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,831
-To the end of this week.
-To the end of this week?

405
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,334
Shouldn't I stay and watch the progress

406
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,753
of the patient I will operate on today?

407
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:08,715
I'll have enough time to do that
if I stay until the end of the week.

408
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,467
I'll try to adjust the date.

409
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:11,468
Anything else?

410
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:15,013
I heard the patient has WPW syndrome.

411
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,141
We already consulted Internal Medicine.

412
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,311
Is there any problem?

413
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:25,482
Even the meticulous Professor Sim
reviewed everything.

414
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,734
There's nothing to worry about.

415
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,487
Yes, sir.

416
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,075
Then I'll get ready. See you in the OR.

417
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:50,257
Doctor Yang.

418
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,011
Is there anything else I should know?

419
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,557
Well…

420
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,214
Here. Take it.

421
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,507
I'm guessing it's yours.

422
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,514
Here.

423
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,480
-Who is it?
-Pardon?

424
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:49,858
Do Yun-wan?

425
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,652
Professor Park?

426
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,237
No, it's not like that.

427
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,406
I learned by hearsay

428
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:01,119
that there are great medical staff
here at Doldam Hospital.

429
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:02,329
In that case,

430
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,540
you should have come to me first.

431
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:08,293
I'm the oldest and the best surgeon

432
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:09,878
here at Doldam Hospital.

433
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,675
How can I mess with someone like you,
Doctor Bu Yong-ju?

434
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,182
You already have.

435
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,441
JEONG IN-SU, JOO YOUNG-MI…

436
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,865
I did a little digging on these hospitals,

437
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,329
and all of them have been caught
for conducting illegal medical practices.

438
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,456
They were often fined,

439
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,249
and the worst place was

440
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,418
shut down for a couple of months.

441
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,170
Yet they haven't quit conducting

442
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,089
the illegal medical practices.

443
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:58,218
If you're going to make money
for referring doctors to hospitals,

444
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:01,054
the least you can do is
find decent hospitals.

445
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,013
Oh, I know.

446
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:03,640
If these hospitals

447
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,684
went to you in need of doctors,

448
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,686
that already speaks for itself.

449
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:09,562
Give that to me.

450
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,399
You sellout!

451
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:14,901
You sold your family, your conscience,

452
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,986
and even your junior. What now?

453
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:20,323
Are you going to sell out
your fellow doctors?

454
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,159
I'm doing this to make a living too.

455
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,870
If I don't do this,
if I don't hold out like this,

456
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,664
there's no way I can survive.

457
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,666
No matter how poor, angry,

458
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,751
humiliated, and degraded you feel,

459
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,838
there's something you never compromise.

460
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,215
It's something called your conscience.

461
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:41,344
How much have you tried
to keep your conscience clear?

462
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,722
How much did you hold out?

463
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,766
You live your life however you like

464
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,560
according to your greed.

465
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,270
If something will bring you money,

466
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,856
you sell your conscience and whatever else

467
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,274
to take that dirty money.

468
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:56,234
I tried as much as I could too!

469
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:01,322
I tried my hardest to live
with a clear conscience.

470
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:04,033
But it didn't work, so what can I do?

471
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:05,994
It's unfair for me too!

472
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:14,085
Don't get conscience and greed confused.

473
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,130
That's why you always think

474
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,300
things are only unfair for you.

475
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,554
You poor thing.

476
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:42,822
Eun-jae.

477
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,574
Are you there?

478
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,287
Yes, why?

479
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:52,665
I'm sorry.

480
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:54,918
For what?

481
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:59,422
Because of me,
you heard something you didn't have to.

482
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,174
That wasn't your fault.

483
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:04,552
It's their problem for having

484
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,346
such a disgusting thought process.

485
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,601
Anyway, don't take my side from now on.

486
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,395
And don't step in to cover for me.

487
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:18,608
Okay?

488
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,361
I don't want to do that.

489
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,282
I don't want to hold myself back

490
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:27,826
from saying what I want,

491
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:31,162
and let things slide
and avoid people like them.

492
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:33,832
I don't want to do that.

493
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,755
I'm not going to live like that anymore.

494
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,135
Are you listening to me?

495
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,516
No, you need to listen to me, Eun-jae.

496
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,935
Stop going around dealing with
their nonsense because of me.

497
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,645
We're allies.

498
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,858
Don't allies take each other's side?

499
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,863
When things get tough for me,
I'm going to ask you to take my side.

500
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:08,032
If I need you,
I'm going to boss you around too.

501
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:11,286
Well, if you're going
to a different hospital

502
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,330
because you don't want me to do that,
I can't say anything to stop you.

503
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,373
But you know,

504
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,585
you won't find another ally like me.

505
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,297
I'm smart, witty,

506
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,799
and I recently broke away from my mom.

507
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:29,345
I don't even feel nauseated anymore,
and I'm an excellent surgeon too.

508
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,513
Cut to the chase.

509
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,474
So don't go.

510
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,522
You wanted us to stay here forever.

511
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,483
You said that first. Right?

512
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:49,616
Right?

513
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,659
What's your plan?

514
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:54,662
What if…

515
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,291
I really cross over the line?

516
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,460
What will you do?

517
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,059
No.

518
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:17,560
Never mind.

WOMEN'S CHANGING ROOM

520
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,700
Nurse Um, did Doctor Jeong step out?

521
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,954
I'm not sure.
I haven't seen him since earlier today.

522
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,997
-Can you try calling him?
-Sure.

523
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,123
I'll take this.

524
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,543
Hello, this is Doldam Hospital's ER.

525
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,671
Yes, that's right.

526
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,136
Sorry?

Is this yours?

Well…

535
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,142
Well, I…

536
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,026
The ER is calling.

CONTRACT

538
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,337
Yes, what's wrong with the patient?

WE HOPE TO SEE YOU HEALTHY

It's a 60-year-old male.

He collapsed
due to his end-stage lung cancer.

543
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,018
are bringing him here at the moment.

544
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:23,895
Okay.

545
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,022
But the thing is…

546
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:29,776
What is it?

547
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,404
It's Mr. Yeo.

548
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,241
What?

549
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:41,370
Incoming!

550
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,341
This way. Quick.

551
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,558
Let's move him. One, two, three!

552
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,019
I'll remove this.

553
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,189
-The blood glucose level?
-It was 75.

554
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:09,899
Now it's 72.

555
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,193
Give him D10W.

556
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,362
And two ampoules of thiamine on the side.

557
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,656
Check his blood sugar level
every 30 minutes.

558
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:17,990
We'll do an ABGA.

559
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:21,077
His oxygen saturation is at 92.
Should we give him oxygen?

560
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,497
Yes. The mask, at six liters per minute.

561
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,581
And do the full test,

562
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,542
including an electrolyte test.

563
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:32,797
What is your name?

564
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:34,715
Kang Ik-joon.

565
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,635
-What is this surgery for?
-Pancreatic cancer.

566
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:41,597
I'll administer your anesthesia now.
Relax and take a deep breath.

567
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,351
Give him oxygen.

568
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:47,895
This is oxygen.

569
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:55,820
We'll insert an A-line to monitor him.
Please give me what I need.

570
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:58,614
Make sure I can see the EKG monitor.

571
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:01,701
-I want to do the five-lead monitoring.
-Five leads?

572
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,620
-Isn't it normally three?
-I want five, please.

573
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,975
Will Doctor Seo be here?

574
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:26,893
Yes.

575
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,437
He'll be the first assistant.

576
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,195
May I begin, Doctor Sim?

577
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,572
Yes. Please get started.

578
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:43,451
This patient, Kang Ik-joon,
has pancreatic head cancer.

579
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,786
We'll now begin the Whipple procedure.

580
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,163
Scalpel.

581
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,081
Gauze.

582
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,669
Bovie.

583
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,256
Retractor.

584
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,386
What are you doing? The retractor!

585
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,096
Right, the retractor.

586
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,099
Get out if you can't stay focused!

587
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,560
-I'm sorry.
-Sponge stick, please.

588
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:18,069
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

589
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:48,724
You'll get the up-front payment tomorrow.
Don't even dream of running away.

590
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:49,725
See?

591
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,603
I told you it had something to do
with the loan sharks.

592
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,063
You were right.

593
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,483
So they're taking the up-front payment.

594
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,277
I know a few people who deal

595
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,570
with things like this professionally.

596
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,745
BAEKJANG DISTRIBUTION, LEE JANG-SIK

597
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,205
-Doctor Cha.
-Doctor Cha.

598
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,540
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

599
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,918
If you ever have a problem
or any difficulties while you're here,

600
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:19,588
please don't hesitate
to get in touch with me.

601
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,716
I might contact those thugs

602
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:24,176
and give them a chance to repay me.

603
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:25,803
What do you think?

604
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,389
Don't complicate things.

605
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,102
Why don't you let me handle it?

606
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:36,022
I'd appreciate that, Doctor Cha.

607
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,690
TREATMENT ROOM 1

608
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,783
All he does is study bones.

609
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,785
He can't "handle" it on his own.

610
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:06,802
Hello?

611
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:11,432
Hello, this is Cha Eun-jae,

612
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:14,352
number two at Doldam Hospital.

613
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:17,688
Right, yes.

614
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,106
So you remember me.

615
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:37,708
Yes.

616
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:38,959
I know.

617
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,545
If I get involved,

618
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,547
Dad will probably find out.

619
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:45,508
But you see…

620
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,179
if I turn a blind eye and hide again…

621
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,139
I'll really regret it.

622
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,644
See you later, Elizabeth.

623
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,604
You too, Jessie.

624
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,322
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

625
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,241
I don't see a mass.

626
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:11,992
And no hemorrhage.

627
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,120
I don't see any cerebral edema either.

628
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:15,746
Then the loss of consciousness

629
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,289
isn't related to the brain.

630
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,292
-I have the test results.
-Right, how does it look?

631
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:23,212
He has severe hyponatremia
as well as rhabdomyolysis.

632
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,673
Insert the Foley and do a urine test.

633
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,426
I'll take care of that.

634
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:29,969
Oh, okay.

635
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,638
What about three-percent NaCl?

636
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:35,141
It's very likely that he has hypovolemia,

637
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:38,102
so let's hydrate him
with normal saline first.

638
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,771
Check his electrolytes every two hours.

639
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:45,734
Sir, he's having a seizure!

640
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:46,735
SEIZURE: A CONVULSION

641
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:47,695
It's V-fib.

642
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:49,864
I'll do chest compressions.

643
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,699
-Doctor Jeong.
-What?

644
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:11,969
Don't tell me…

645
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:15,431
Did he sign a DNR?

646
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,308
DNR: DO-NOT-RESUCITATE ORDER

647
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,108
Doctor Kim.

648
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:33,282
What do we do, Doctor Kim?

649
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:37,912
Doctor Kim!

650
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:54,970
Doctor Kim!

651
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:12,571
Let's do chest compressions.

652
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,951
Nurse Um, bring the defibrillator.

653
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,077
Now!

654
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:35,886
Metzenbaum scissors.

655
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:40,766
The tie.

656
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,523
How's the patient doing?

657
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,983
So far, so good.

658
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,282
-Cut.
-Okay. Cut.

659
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,120
What? What's going on?

660
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,040
It's V-tach.

661
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,667
V-TACH: VENTRICULAR TACHYARDIA

662
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,502
I think it's A-fib with WPW.

663
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:14,216
-I still feel a pulse.
-What's his BP?

664
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,426
80 over 40.

665
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:17,636
Synchronized cardioversion, 150 joules.

666
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:18,846
Remove the drape!

667
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:26,478
200 joules.

668
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,408
-Charged.
-Step back!

669
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:41,577
Clear!

670
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,622
-Compression!
-Let me take over.

671
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:49,126
One milligram of epinephrine every three
minutes through the IV. Intubate him.

672
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,885
Hey, what are you doing? Do it properly!

673
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,136
Okay!

674
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,102
The Ambu bag.

675
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:26,080
One milligram of epinephrine
every three minutes.

676
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,247
The Ambu bag, please.

677
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,799
Checking his heart rhythm.

678
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,304
Charge to 200 joules. Hold this for me.

679
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,389
Okay.

680
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,684
-Charged.
-Step back!

681
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,520
Clear!

682
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:52,898
Compression.

683
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,196
Don't squeeze too fast!

684
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,240
-Only once every six seconds!
-Okay.

685
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,576
Let's check his heart rhythm.

686
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:50,748
Again, 200 joules.

687
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:53,041
Charged.

688
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,168
Step back.

689
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,170
Clear!

690
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,257
Compression.

691
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:05,888
-Give him 300 mg of amiodarone.
-Administering 300 mg of amiodarone.

692
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:17,816
Checking his rhythm.

693
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,070
Asystole.

694
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:23,989
ABSENCE OF VENTRICULAR CONTRACTIONS

695
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,013
Let me check his rhythm.

696
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,352
ROSC. He's back.

697
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:54,812
RETURN OF SPONTAENOUS CIRCULATION

698
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:12,723
I think…

699
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:14,933
we should just call it.

700
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,491
CURRENT TIME: 17:39

701
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:36,330
Patient Kang Ik-joon…

702
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:40,709
time of death,

703
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:42,294
5:39 p.m.

704
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:18,997
You scumbag.

705
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:41,329
ELEVATOR, OPERATING ROOM

706
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:45,709
WPW syndrome.

707
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:49,004
Are you sure you consulted an internist?

708
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:49,963
What do you mean?

709
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:53,133
Did Professor Sim voluntarily agree
to perform the surgery?

710
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,677
Didn't you just push ahead with it?

711
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:59,389
-That's what I'm asking.
-You won't be held responsible anyway.

712
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:02,142
This is your last day here, after all.

713
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:03,685
I was told I could stay

714
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,396
until the end of the week
if I scrubbed in.

715
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:12,402
Yes, but only if you had
a living patient to observe.

716
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,488
He died.

717
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:16,865
Right?

718
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,454
RESTRICTED AREA: OPERATING ROOM

719
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:59,074
At the moment, he's stable.

720
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:00,784
But…

721
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,120
But what?

722
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,330
It seems like

723
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:07,999
Mr. Yeo signed a DNR.

724
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,753
And Doctor Kim

725
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,005
went against it and revived him.

726
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:44,244
Hey.

727
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,079
Did you get my text?

728
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,543
That's what happened with Mr. Yeo.

729
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,714
Doctor Kim is quite distraught.

730
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,591
So is everyone else at Doldam.

731
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,295
I'm just curious.

732
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:38,131
Why did you follow me out that day?

733
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:40,383
I realized

734
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:43,887
you could've stayed at that hospital
because you've got the skills.

735
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:45,847
If you had stayed,

736
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:48,391
a stellar career would've been guaranteed.

737
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:53,230
I'm just wondering why you joined me.

738
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,900
Because you wanted to show everyone.

739
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,279
You said we should show the world…

740
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:04,908
that people like us…

741
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,745
could also live the good life.

742
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:11,039
That's what you said.

743
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:20,173
You see,

744
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,551
I really wanted to live a decent life.

745
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:27,931
My parents

746
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:29,975
and even my aunt…

747
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,980
probably thought that things…

748
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:41,319
would be much easier with me dead.

749
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:48,785
That's why I wanted to survive and thrive.

750
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:52,497
I wanted to show them…

751
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:57,252
that I actually deserve…

752
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:00,422
a decent life.

753
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:04,843
I wanted…

754
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:08,555
to show everyone

755
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,181
that I have what it takes…

756
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,226
to live a decent life.

757
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:18,064
That's why I liked you.

758
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,568
You said even a punk like me…

759
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:25,488
was worthy of something.

760
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:28,950
That's why.

761
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:40,754
You're helpless.

762
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,298
I wanted to help

763
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:44,674
lift the boycott on you…

764
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:47,844
but a jerk like you…

765
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:51,723
DOCTOR AGENCY

766
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:55,852
You need to rot more
at a lousy hospital like this.

767
00:55:56,936 --> 00:56:00,398
With that ill-tempered man, Doctor Kim,
this place is perfect for you.

768
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:01,691
Just remember…

769
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,194
that I'll be watching you.

770
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:05,945
So…

771
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,367
you better live a decent life.

772
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:12,744
Okay?

773
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:16,122
Show everyone that you can do it.

774
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:18,875
All right?

775
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:32,472
CONTRACT

776
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,488
Oh, Moon-jung.

777
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,240
SURGERY, FAMILY MEDICINE

778
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:33,283
Where is Doctor Seo?

779
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,201
He's still here.

780
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:37,162
In fact…

781
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,747
I've been keeping him here.

782
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,794
Doctor Seo. Are you leaving now?

783
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,171
Yes, I guess.

784
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:50,258
-Give it back already.
-What?

785
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:52,802
Right.

786
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:54,512
Okay.

787
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:58,558
By the way, I think you have a visitor.

788
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,244
Woo-jin.

789
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:26,544
Why are you here again?

790
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:29,714
You still have to harass me like this?

791
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,553
I'm sorry, Woo-jin.

792
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,141
I'm sorry… for harassing you,

793
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:43,353
beating you up,
and making you pay unreasonable interest.

794
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,940
I'm sorry about everything.

795
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:54,864
Well, I'm sorry too.

796
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:56,699
Happy now?

797
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,703
What is this about?

798
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,872
You paid back the principal in full

799
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:05,667
as well as all the interest…

800
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:10,964
so as for what's left…

801
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,509
We decided to just let it go.

802
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:17,679
-What?
-Anyway, don't ask questions.

803
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:20,098
This is where we part ways.

804
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,433
Well, goodbye.

805
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:25,103
This is it.

806
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:28,648
Let's go.

807
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,318
Let's never cross paths again.

808
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:34,070
Okay?

809
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:42,996
What just happened?

810
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:45,248
They're really leaving, just like that?

811
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:48,710
-They'll never come back?
-They won't, apparently.

812
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:07,186
I knew it.

813
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:10,231
Baekjang Distribution didn't let me down.

814
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:11,441
What did you say?

815
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:12,650
What?

816
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,902
Nothing. You don't need to know.

817
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:17,905
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

818
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:22,160
Hey, guys.

819
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:26,122
Did you tell him politely?

820
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:31,419
I'm asking you a question.

821
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:34,088
Why are you all quiet?

822
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,507
Did you tell Doctor Cha,

823
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:37,967
Doldam's number two,

824
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:40,637
and her friend, Doctor Seo,

825
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:43,765
that you'd never show up again?

826
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:45,058
Politely, like this.

827
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:47,852
Did you tell them or what?

828
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:48,936
Hey, look.

829
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:52,315
You guys are not the reason we're here.

830
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:53,900
Goodness.

831
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:57,695
Look at him with his pride.

832
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:58,905
-I know.
-All right.

833
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:00,490
Goodness, okay.

834
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:02,533
Don't worry. It's not like

835
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:05,119
I'll go around telling others about this.

836
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:07,830
So just chill and… What the heck?

837
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:12,919
Just don't ever

838
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:15,004
come this way again, okay?

839
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:17,799
Doldam Hospital and Jeongseon

840
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:20,176
are on our turf.

841
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:21,969
I hope I got…

842
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:24,722
my message across.

843
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:33,690
Hey, let's go.

844
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:38,569
All right.

845
01:01:38,986 --> 01:01:39,821
Get back safely.

846
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:41,823
We won't see you off.

847
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:44,409
Boss.

848
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:45,868
-Yes?
-Over there.

849
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:48,454
My gosh.

850
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:52,083
Guys, where are your manners?

851
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:54,335
Doldam Hospital's number two

852
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:56,421
is smiling at us.

853
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:00,967
All right, guys. Let's show our respect.

854
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,511
-Good night, Dr. Cha!
-Good night, Dr. Cha!

855
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:05,680
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

856
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,981
I'm Doldam's number two? Awesome.

857
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:38,296
To cheer you up.

858
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:42,175
I'm all right.

859
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:48,931
I totally understand
Doctor Kim's decision.

860
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:54,771
I do too.

861
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:56,814
But at the same time…

862
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,776
I can't quite say
it was the right decision.

863
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,445
I have never

864
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:06,491
questioned his decision, but…

865
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,745
This time, I'm just not sure.

866
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:16,959
Perhaps Doctor Kim

867
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:19,670
is feeling the same way, don't you think?

868
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:38,940
Doctor Kim.

869
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:41,692
You should get some rest.

870
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:42,985
I'll stay here.

871
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:45,571
I…

872
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,284
went against his wishes.

873
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:56,290
I'm sure…

874
01:03:57,959 --> 01:03:59,168
he'll understand.

875
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:01,963
What happened today

876
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:04,507
is probably something…

877
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:11,347
that I'll have to deal with
for the rest of my life.

878
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,087
SON

879
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:55,516
Hi, Yul.

880
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:58,936
Yes.

881
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:01,856
I was in surgery,

882
01:05:01,939 --> 01:05:03,608
so I couldn't answer your call.

883
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:08,362
What?

884
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:15,620
Of course.

885
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:17,830
Yes, I saved him.

886
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:25,171
Right.

887
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,177
What about you? How was the lesson?

888
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,032
CHAIRMAN DO YUN-WAN

889
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:01,832
Hello, Park Min-gook speaking.

890
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:05,336
I just heard the unfortunate news.

891
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,798
So he died on the operating table?

892
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:12,760
Are the chairman of Sejen and his wife

893
01:06:13,552 --> 01:06:14,512
aware of this?

894
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:16,847
They would've…

895
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,226
probably heard about it by now.

896
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:25,147
I made it clear to you

897
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:28,067
that they're very important clients
of ours.

898
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:30,444
How could you let this happen?

899
01:06:32,446 --> 01:06:34,865
I'll take responsibility
for everything that happens…

900
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:37,243
from now on.

901
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:39,620
Just stepping down or resigning…

902
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:42,248
won't do.

903
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:46,168
What do you mean by that, sir?

904
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:50,464
Listen to me carefully.

905
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:53,050
This might be

906
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:56,887
your only chance to survive.

907
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:21,245
Come in.

908
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:28,669
What's up? What do you need?

909
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:31,756
-The assignment you mentioned yesterday…
-Yes.

910
01:07:32,506 --> 01:07:33,340
I'll do it.

911
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:44,477
You can only ask two questions. That's it.

912
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,103
Do I get any hints?

913
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,064
What?

914
01:07:48,689 --> 01:07:50,149
Okay, fine.

915
01:07:53,652 --> 01:07:54,612
Oh, one more thing.

916
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,490
Gosh, what now?

917
01:07:58,032 --> 01:07:59,366
About the money I owe you…

918
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:02,578
Can I continue to pay you back

919
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:05,956
a million won a month for the time being?

920
01:08:06,373 --> 01:08:07,208
But why?

921
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:10,419
I heard a hospital in Seoul offered you
twice your current salary.

922
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:12,213
Did things not go well with them?

923
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:13,422
Well, kind of.

924
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:15,633
They decided against it.

925
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:18,219
I was told to rot here for a bit longer.

926
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:26,685
THE ODDBALL PROJECT

927
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:27,937
Take this.

928
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:29,313
What is this?

929
01:08:30,022 --> 01:08:31,899
You asked for a hint.

930
01:08:31,982 --> 01:08:33,359
THE ODDBALL PROJECT

931
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:36,779
This is a lot of reading for just a hint.

932
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:38,114
THE ODDBALL PROJECT

933
01:08:40,699 --> 01:08:41,992
THE ODDBALL PROJECT

934
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:43,994
Carefully read through everything,

935
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:46,038
and you'll find some hints.

936
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:51,418
There.

937
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:53,129
Now, you can only ask

938
01:08:54,088 --> 01:08:55,047
one more question.

939
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:56,132
Sorry?

940
01:08:56,715 --> 01:08:58,884
Gosh, you'll count this as a question?

941
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:00,761
You got a problem with that?

942
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:03,389
Then just give up.

943
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:06,267
THE ODDBALL PROJECT

944
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:20,781
Back then, I had absolutely no idea.

945
01:09:21,031 --> 01:09:22,616
THE ODDBALL PROJECT

946
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:24,034
About the meaning

947
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:26,370
behind the Oddball Project,

948
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:28,789
which Doctor Kim introduced me to.

949
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:45,222
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

950
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:49,518
Isn't that man…

951
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:52,730
Could he be…

952
01:09:55,482 --> 01:09:57,902
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

953
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:08,829
This place hasn't changed at all.

954
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:18,756
Did you take care of the headhunter?

955
01:10:18,839 --> 01:10:21,550
Don't tell me he got to you.

956
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:23,219
-Gosh, come on.
-Figures.

957
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:26,680
He'd be the perfect target
because he's so gullible.

958
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,682
What? Did you just call me "gullible"?

959
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:30,309
What do you take me for?

960
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:42,863
Feel free to call me if you're interested.

961
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:44,865
I'll take good care of you.

962
01:11:17,731 --> 01:11:19,733
I'm working on it, so give me some time.

963
01:11:35,082 --> 01:11:36,500
Great work, Mr. Jang.

964
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:39,336
But why are you asking me

965
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:40,796
to keep this a secret?

966
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:44,883
"Do not let your left hand know
what your right hand is doing."

967
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:48,679
That's just my fate as a lonely hero.

968
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:56,186
What's "gullible" in English?

969
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:57,479
Gosh, Doctor Nam.

970
01:11:57,604 --> 01:12:00,316
How would he know that?
What's "apple" in English?

971
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:01,859
-"Apple"? Goodness.
-What is it?

972
01:12:01,942 --> 01:12:04,069
It's "apple." Did you think
I'd say Steve Jobs?

973
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:05,029
My goodness.

974
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:07,156
Then what about "pineapple"?

975
01:12:07,614 --> 01:12:09,033
It's "pineapple," obviously.

976
01:12:28,552 --> 01:12:29,762
How's his brain?

977
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:31,513
You saw Doctor Do In-beom?

978
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:33,349
What brings you here?

979
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:35,559
Hey, please.

980
01:12:35,642 --> 01:12:36,643
Why? You can't see?

981
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:39,396
I guess your eyesight
isn't as good as your hands.

982
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:40,981
Their goal is to find a reason

983
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:42,649
to shut down Doldam at all costs.

984
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:45,402
It looks like they're even
going to desert Professor Sim.

985
01:12:45,819 --> 01:12:47,780
What did you just do, Doctor Seo?

986
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:51,867
I won't let anyone harm Doldam Hospital

987
01:12:52,576 --> 01:12:53,702
or Doctor Kim.

988
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:55,829
You punk! Do you have a death wish?

989
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:57,664
I won't let anyone mess with us.
