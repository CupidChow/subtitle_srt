1
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:23,231
You should do this.

2
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:24,733
May I ask

3
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:29,154
why you have absolute confidence in me?

4
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:32,699
I'm a patient who struggles to survive,

5
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:37,120
and you are a doctor
who tries to save a person's life.

6
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,663
Every doctor

7
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:42,167
tries his best to save
a patient's life all the time.

8
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,210
Do you think

9
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,504
they will do the same

10
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,757
when billions of money are at stake?

11
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,675
Pardon?

12
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,094
So who is his doctor?

13
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,554
Is he good?

14
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:57,515
I'm not sure if you remember him or not.

15
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,976
He used to work at Geosan Medical Center

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,020
under the name, Bu Yong-ju.

17
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,272
Bu Yong-ju?

18
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,610
Are you talking about that lunatic?

19
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,903
Yes,

20
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,613
that lunatic.

21
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:13,948
Times of subordination.

22
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,202
Rather than respecting one's
individuality and capability,

23
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,120
the world compares and standardizes people

24
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:22,165
to put them into fitting roles.

25
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,834
Dr. Bu Yong-ju. Answer my questions.

26
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:29,380
Have you ever had your younger colleagues
perform surgery for you?

27
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:34,844
It's been reported that the two
table deaths prior to the one of

28
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,430
Jang Hyeon-ju were caused
by such incidents.

29
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:38,848
Is that true?

30
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,977
I told them to do it?

31
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,066
I told them to perform those operations?

32
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,445
Why aren't you saying anything?

33
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,072
When have I ever

34
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:56,783
told you to perform operations for me?

35
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,993
Quiet down, Dr. Bu Yong-ju!

36
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,370
I ask the questions.

37
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,331
You only answer them.

38
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:09,420
The so-called elite organization

39
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:13,842
and the efficient rulers of
the organization own this world.

40
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,844
To know that

41
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,680
the things you accomplished here
at Geosan Medical Center

42
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,600
were based on such unlawful
and contemptible methods...

43
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,186
As an administrator,

44
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,689
I have to say it's a disgrace.

45
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,821
I'm sorry,

46
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:37,115
but you have to let someone else
perform the operation.

47
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,075
This patient is a candidate
for the next presidency.

48
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,495
Clear your schedule
so we can set a date for the operation.

49
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,706
There are patients

50
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,292
who wait up to three or four months

51
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,252
to be operated by me.

52
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,213
I'll operate in the order of

53
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,300
who's been waiting the longest.

54
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,891
MEDICAL RECORD

55
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:06,185
You're supercilious and free-wheeling.

56
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,980
Does being a well-known doctor
who makes a lot of money

57
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,774
make it okay to neglect the ethics

58
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,443
and morals as a doctor?

59
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,404
You were the ones
who put your hands together

60
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,489
and gladly appointed me.

61
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:22,785
We didn't know that you were
such an immoral and shameless being.

62
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:27,457
Were all these patients operated on
by using my name behind my back?

63
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,959
You're too busy and famous
of a doctor, Dr. Bu.

64
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,545
It couldn't be helped.

65
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,423
Every patient who comes to our hospital
wants to be treated by you.

66
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,759
Even so, how could you use my name

67
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,302
to deceive the patients?

68
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,806
If you're worried
about this getting leaked,

69
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:45,642
you shouldn't be.

70
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,186
The hospital will

71
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,938
have your back.

72
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,485
You idiot.

73
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:59,280
Who told you to perform that operation?

74
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,074
Who is it?

75
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:05,328
We can no longer keep
a lid on your past actions.

76
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,705
The doctor's union
and the hospital association

77
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,915
will be notified.

78
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,542
We will take measures

79
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,837
so you will no longer be able
to work as a doctor.

80
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,048
That is

81
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,425
the final decision of the board.

82
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:25,098
Loyalty for a clique
becomes the greatest virtue.

83
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,642
Capable men of principles

84
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,104
get abolished once they lose their value.

85
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,273
That is how strange this world has become.

86
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,191
MEMBERS OF COUNCIL

87
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,659
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

88
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,328
It's okay.

89
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,788
Take me to the hotel today.

90
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,666
-What about Chairman Shin?
-I'll see him tomorrow.

91
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,459
He's probably sleeping anyway.

92
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,046
Good morning.

93
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,714
Is it?

94
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,299
Good for you.

95
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,052
Are you not feeling well?

96
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:48,056
You seem to be
in a very good mood, Dr. Kang.

97
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:51,225
-Why is that?
-I'm just...

98
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,643
It's a good morning, that's all.

99
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,564
Hello, good morning.

100
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:58,900
You're here.

101
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,319
Hey.

102
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,378
It's so hot.

103
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,131
Why is it so hot in here. Aren't you?

104
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,718
The weather must have gotten warmer.
It is hot in here.

105
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,304
I have to go to the staff room.

106
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,973
I need to do something
in the emergency room.

107
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,894
-Okay.
-Okay, then.

108
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,444
-I'm going this way.
-Right.

109
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,118
It's hot in here?

110
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,830
What are they talking about?
It's negative two degrees outside.

111
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,751
We have a patient experiencing
abdominal pain.

112
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,754
Name of the patient is Hwang Gi-su.
He's a 45-year-old male.

113
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,923
He's not showing symptoms
of vomiting or diarrhea.

114
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,967
He just said his stomach hurts
and that he's cold.

115
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,302
His vital signs are 110 over 80,
pulse 120.

116
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,846
His temperature is 39.5 degrees.

117
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,222
Hold on.

118
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,642
You even checked
if he has a history of gallstones.

119
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,395
Yes, I asked him to check
if that's the case here,

120
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:20,189
but he said they didn't show up
in the checkup of earlier this year.

121
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,108
You checked thoroughly.

122
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,443
Good work.

123
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,534
I hear your stomach is aching.
When did that start?

124
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,786
A month ago.

125
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,164
The pain used to come and go.

126
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,500
Yesterday, it started to hurt a lot

127
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:43,421
and last night, my whole body was aching.

128
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,881
I was burning up.

129
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,216
Please raise your knees.

130
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,012
I'll feel your stomach.

131
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:54,307
-Does it hurt when I press here?
-Yes, it does.

132
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:55,725
How about

133
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,977
-here?
-That hurts the most.

134
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,937
Do you drink often?

135
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:03,357
I drink once or twice a week.

136
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,239
Have you recently experienced
a sour stomach?

137
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,574
I have.

138
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,286
I see. We'll have to run some tests first.

139
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,954
You might have an infection
in your stomach.

140
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,706
We'll have to do a CT scan.

141
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,208
Doctor.

142
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,878
Please make the pain go away first.

143
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,129
I will.

144
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,465
Please set up IV lines of tramadol.

145
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,926
Let's do an OP lab of amylase and lipase

146
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,386
-and then do an abdomen CT scan.
-Yes, Doctor.

147
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,680
I'll go to the CT Room.

148
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:46,943
You scared me.

149
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,320
-Did it work?
-What?

150
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,490
The necklace.

151
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,827
Well...

152
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,998
Congratulations, Dr. Kang.

153
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,459
I told you it'd work.

154
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,711
I don't want to flatter myself,

155
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,089
but I know these things very well.

156
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,340
I see.

157
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,301
Did you put the necklace on her yourself?

158
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:16,639
-Do I have to?
-Dear me.

159
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,808
That's basic.

160
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,102
What do you mean?

161
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,481
Why do you think men spend all that money

162
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,441
to buy presents for women?

163
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:31,237
There is a reason
behind the actions of these men.

164
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,824
A ring is to hold a woman's hand.

165
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,326
A necklace?

166
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,869
It is for a hug.

167
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:42,915
Like this.

168
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,042
Is that so?

169
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,338
Is Dr. Yun wearing the necklace today?

170
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,553
No, I don't think so.

171
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,846
Oh, no.

172
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,932
If she didn't wear the necklace
on purpose,

173
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,101
it means something.

174
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,728
Maybe, she didn't like the necklace

175
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,397
or the person who gave it to her.

176
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,858
I don't think that's the case.

177
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,444
You shouldn't let your guard down.

178
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,695
Dr. Kang.

179
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,072
Could you go check on
the patient in the third bed?

180
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,949
Okay.

181
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,497
What do you think you are doing now?

182
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,750
It's none of your concern.

183
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,461
I was just a little jealous,
so I messed around with him.

184
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,212
You were jealous?

185
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,299
-Why?
-My romance ended in failure

186
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,635
unlike his.

187
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,386
I should go, then.

188
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,938
Hello? What's up?

189
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,776
Are you wearing the necklace I gave you?

190
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,279
Why are you asking me that?

191
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,198
Aren't you?

192
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,909
I'm busy now. I'm on my rounds.

193
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,786
Just tell me

194
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,537
if you are wearing it or not.

195
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,582
Excuse me, Dr. Kang.

196
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,168
We are working now.

197
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,087
You shouldn't mix business with pleasure.

198
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,798
-I'm hanging up.
-Seo-jeong.

199
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,177
What was that?

200
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,221
Is she not wearing the necklace?

201
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,768
Good morning, Chairman...

202
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,856
Shin.

203
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,447
-His daughter?
-Yes.

204
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,242
Chairman Shin's daughter has just arrived.

205
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,953
Maybe you know her, too.

206
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:45,913
She used to

207
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,501
work at Geosan Medical Center
as the head of strategic management.

208
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:55,089
Stop being so stubborn
and leave the hospital.

209
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,675
You are being absurd.

210
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,010
I'm hospitalized here.

211
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,095
Why would I leave?

212
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,389
You should stay in a more decent hospital.

213
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,349
A hospital with better doctors.

214
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,934
Why did you come here?

215
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,603
Just go back to Florida
and take care of your children.

216
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,105
You are bothering me.

217
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,150
Who asked you to come here?

218
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,734
Was it President Do?

219
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:19,613
It is an artificial heart operation
we are talking about.

220
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,408
How could I let you
have such an important operation

221
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,452
in this lousy hospital?

222
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,037
Also, you are the chairman of
the foundation.

223
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:31,041
What will happen if the chairman
of Geosan Medical center

224
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,961
has an operation in such a small branch,
and something goes wrong?

225
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,005
Geosan Medical Center will lose face.

226
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,595
People will soon think
you have poor judgment.

227
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,015
Some will even say you are senile.

228
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,224
What?

229
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,310
Senile?

230
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:52,771
If you don't want to be called that,
come to Seoul with me.

231
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,815
I will take care
of the discharge procedures.

232
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,527
Excuse me.

233
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,324
He can't leave the hospital
without his doctor's permission.

234
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,034
What are you saying?

235
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,203
A patient is not supposed
to leave the hospital

236
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,955
without his doctor's permission.

237
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,957
I'm the director of this hospital.

238
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,918
I am higher in rank

239
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,045
than any of you.

240
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,214
Do you understand?

241
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,013
Bu Yong-ju?

242
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,269
What are you doing here?

243
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,941
What would a doctor do in a hospital?

244
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,609
I'm taking care of the patients.

245
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,612
You've already been kicked out
of the medical world.

246
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:45,074
How dare you pretend to be
a doctor in a doctor's gown?

247
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:50,287
I didn't do anything wrong
to be disqualified.

248
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,039
And you guys set me up

249
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,416
to be kicked out.

250
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:58,671
So did you cajole Chairman Shin

251
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,464
for your comeback?

252
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,679
I thought he was just
an old man with a lot of money.

253
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,182
I had no idea that he was
the chairman of the foundation.

254
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,686
Or that he was your father.

255
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,605
It's been a lot of surprises for me.

256
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,525
I will move him
to Geosan Medical Center now.

257
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:24,238
Is it what Chairman Shin asked?

258
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,532
It is my decision. I'm his guardian.

259
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:30,160
I can't leave my father
to a doctor like you even for a moment.

260
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,829
A doctor like me?

261
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,584
What does that mean?

262
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,212
-What?
-Explain what you mean.

263
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,506
You are being vague,

264
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,800
so I don't understand what you mean.

265
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,220
Let's be clear about this.

266
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,723
What do you mean by a doctor like me?

267
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,683
Look, Bu Yong-ju.

268
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:56,312
Everyone calls me Teacher Kim here.

269
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,688
Teacher Kim?

270
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:02,192
Do you think you can hide your past
with a new name?

271
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,153
I'm not hiding anything.

272
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,072
Let's just say it is for self-examination.

273
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,409
I once

274
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,454
listened to your seductive words

275
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,206
and worked alongside with you people

276
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,752
to achieve the same goals.

277
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,880
It is to show that
I introspect about my mistake.

278
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,025
-Chairman Shin's daughter?
-Yes.

279
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,735
She says

280
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,278
she is someone

281
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,113
who is much higher in rank than us.

282
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,616
And she seems to have

283
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,826
some ill-fated relationship
with Teacher Kim.

284
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,288
Do you know anything about that?

285
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,165
I told you.

286
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:01,627
I met Teacher Kim
after he left Geosan Medical Center.

287
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,673
But you have worked with
Teacher Kim for so long.

288
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,258
Didn't you hear anything about it?

289
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,343
No.

290
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:17,851
What are you doing?

291
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,270
Are you dating Dr. Kang?

292
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,029
Who told you that?

293
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,115
Did Dr. Kang say that?

294
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,826
No, it's just Manager Jang's speculation.

295
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:37,037
He says there is something
going on between you two.

296
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,039
Is that right?

297
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,041
No, it's not.

298
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,961
It's not true.

299
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:47,506
-I'm serious.
-I see.

300
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,675
I'm telling you.

301
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,760
Trust me. You have to trust me.

302
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,554
Okay.

303
00:16:58,475 --> 00:16:59,601
Oh, my goodness.

304
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,398
-Yeon-hwa.
-Yes?

305
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,774
Where is Dong-ju?

306
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,526
He's in the hybrid room.

307
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:19,079
-What do you think?
-I think

308
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,749
it is pancreas tail.

309
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,084
I see. I thought so, too.

310
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,919
I don't think it is pancreas tail.

311
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,005
You don't?

312
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,965
It is abscess for sure,

313
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,135
but I think it is originated
from the bowel.

314
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,386
Bowel?

315
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,055
Is that what you think?

316
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,890
Do you want me to page Teacher Kim?

317
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,727
Dr. Kang.

318
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,271
Why would you call Teacher Kim?
I'm right here.

319
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,482
The scan is unclear,

320
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,692
so I just wanted another's opinion.

321
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,694
You've been so disrespectful

322
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,362
and disobedient to me.

323
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,699
Do you think you are all that
because Teacher Kim favors you?

324
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,368
I don't think Teacher Kim favors me.

325
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,621
Look closely at the scan with your eyes.

326
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,915
It is obviously originated from the bowel.

327
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,375
-But it is connected to--
-Hey.

328
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,920
Are you trying to teach me or something?

329
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,547
I'm just giving my opinion.

330
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,257
It may look like that but--

331
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,384
So it is originated from the bowel.

332
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,637
It can't be pancreas tail.

333
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,847
Don't you think, Dr. Do?

334
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,100
That's what I think.

335
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,936
-Dr. Song.
-The patient's BP is dropping.

336
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,062
It is 80 over 40.

337
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,400
Set up the C-line
and execute a full drop of 500cc.

338
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,736
Also, inject 10cc of norepinephrine.

339
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,029
And bring me a Foley catheter.

340
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,364
Stop it.

341
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,949
Stay back.

342
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,829
Set up the C-line
and execute a full drop of 500cc.

343
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:42,788
And

344
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,332
inject 10cc of norepinephrine, too.

345
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:46,959
And bring me a Foley catheter.

346
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,920
Dr. Do will operate on this patient.

347
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,881
He is my patient, Dr. Song.

348
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,552
You can't even read the CT scan right.

349
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,805
Set up the C-line
and move him to the operating room.

350
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:00,973
Yes, Doctor.

351
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,356
Let me inject antibiotics
while you set up the C-line.

352
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,566
Yes, Doctor.

353
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:16,864
Dr. Kang looks pretty upset.

354
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,282
I think so.

355
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,705
-Dr. Woo.
-Yes.

356
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,331
Have you assisted an operation before?

357
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,709
-Yes, I have.
-Okay.

358
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,460
You will be assisting me today.

359
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,713
I will see you in the operating room
in ten minutes.

360
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,519
I still think it's near the pancreas.

361
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,857
Seo-jeong, can you knock?

362
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,905
What was that about with Dr. Song?

363
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,323
Why did you get into an argument?

364
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,159
We just had some disagreements.

365
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,371
By the way, Dong-ju,

366
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:10,292
did you say anything to Manager Jang?

367
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,586
Like what?

368
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:16,632
Did you tell him that
we're dating or something like that?

369
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,760
I...

370
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,430
I've never put it bluntly like that.

371
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,975
Then why did Ms. Oh ask me that?

372
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,686
What did she ask you?

373
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,521
She asked me if we're dating.

374
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,025
Are you sure you didn't lead her on?

375
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:38,779
No way. I'm very careful
when it comes to things like that.

376
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:47,037
Why aren't you wearing the necklace?

377
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,790
Why do you keep asking me that?

378
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,459
I just want to know

379
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,878
if we're dating now as of yesterday.

380
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:58,215
This is exactly why I can't start
anything with you.

381
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:01,009
We didn't start anything?

382
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,470
What was yesterday, then?

383
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,680
Yesterday?

384
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:07,266
What happened?

385
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,767
Don't you remember?

386
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,688
I guess it can't be helped.
I'll have to do it again.

387
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,148
-See?
-What? What did I do?

388
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:18,443
How can I start things with you
when you're so blatantly obvious?

389
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,821
I'm obvious?

390
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:23,949
I doubt it. I have an amazing poker face.

391
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,742
I'm Poker Face Kang.
Haven't you heard of it?

392
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,829
Poker face, my foot.
You make it look so obvious.

393
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:32,249
Tell everyone here at Doldam Hospital,
why don't you?

394
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,292
Can I do that?

395
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,668
Gosh.

396
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,339
Promise me one thing.

397
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,757
What is it?

398
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,927
Promise me you'll be professional
at the hospital.

399
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,221
I will continue to be your senior doctor,

400
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,598
and you will continue to be Dr. Kang.

401
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,351
Like how we've been until now,

402
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,228
we can't bring our emotions
to the workplace.

403
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,897
We'll simply be coworkers.

404
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,441
Let's do that, okay?

405
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,112
I'll promise you

406
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,406
if you agree that as of today,
we're dating.

407
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,952
-I'll have to see about that.
-You'll have to see about that?

408
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,872
When is it going to be?

409
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,915
I'll have to see about that.
Get back to work.

410
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,084
I love you.

411
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,010
Seriously?

412
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,221
I knew it. You need to work
on your poker face.

413
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,891
At this rate, everyone here
at this hospital will figure out.

414
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,434
Stop that.

415
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,685
What?

416
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,229
-Oh, I love you?
-Gosh!

417
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,190
You want me to stop saying I love you?

418
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,983
-Stop it.
-Okay.

419
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,443
-I love--
-Stop it.

420
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:45,113
Fine. From now on
I'll never say that I love you.

421
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,782
I love--

422
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,366
I love you. I love you.

423
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,286
Stop it. Stop.

424
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,622
I love you. I love you.

425
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,333
I love you.

426
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,420
-I love you.
-No.

427
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,216
What is it that you're after?

428
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,010
Going back to Geosan Medical Center?

429
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:12,015
Don't you have any questions
regarding Chairman Shin?

430
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:15,936
I'm sorry, but President Do will run
things around there for a while.

431
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:19,648
It's most likely
that the board will reappoint him.

432
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:23,318
There's nothing for you to gain
even if you go back there.

433
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,029
Chairman Shin

434
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,490
is in a worse condition than we expected.

435
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:34,538
You must be trying to make
a dramatic turn-around

436
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:37,624
by performing a successful operation
on Chairman Shin, but--

437
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,961
You can read CT scans, right?

438
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:43,922
From what I know, you too
are a graduate of a medical school.

439
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,134
Whose is that?

440
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,136
Chairman Shin.

441
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,266
As you can see,

442
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,977
he has late-stage lung cancer.

443
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,149
Lung cancer?

444
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,234
Yes.

445
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,487
That's what the CT scans say at least.

446
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,039
What about treatment?

447
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,542
Can it not be treated?

448
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,336
There are many different kinds
of lung cancer, Chairman Shin.

449
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,007
First, we'll have to do a biopsy

450
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,426
to find out what kind of cancer it is.

451
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,595
Then, we can try to figure out
how to treat it.

452
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,892
My gosh.

453
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,440
What if I don't get treatment?

454
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,526
How much time do I have?

455
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,197
Three months

456
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:52,824
at maximum, Chairman Shin.

457
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,537
Regardless of my heart?

458
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,333
Yes.

459
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,550
So...

460
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,470
what do you intend to do?

461
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:16,097
There isn't much a doctor
can do at this point.

462
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,976
There aren't many proposals
to make, either.

463
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,689
DOCTOR'S OFFICE

464
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:37,953
Dr. Woo.

465
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:41,748
-Are you going in an operation?
-Yes.

466
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,541
Is it the abscess patient?

467
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,669
Yes. Dr. Do told me to

468
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,629
be his assistant.

469
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,715
I see.

470
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:55,887
Do you...

471
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,684
What are you doing here?

472
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:03,186
What? I'm the assistant.

473
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,563
But I asked Dr. Woo.

474
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,568
She said something came up.
I'm filling in for her.

475
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:14,572
It's okay, right?

476
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,918
How are you going to approach this?

477
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,336
It's peritoneal abscess.

478
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,089
It seems to originate from the bowel,
so I will resect it.

479
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,132
Okay.

480
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:35,427
Commencing operation. Scalpel.

481
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,854
-Teacher Kim.
-Yes?

482
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:49,733
Dr. Kang told me to give this to you.

483
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,486
Please take a look at the CT scans
of patient Hwang Gi-su.

484
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,447
Where is Dr. Kang now?

485
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,699
He's in the operating room
with patient Hwang Gi-su.

486
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:58,992
It's an abscess patient.

487
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:02,245
Dr. Do is performing the operation.
He said it's originated from the bowel.

488
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,913
But Dr. Kang

489
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,750
thinks the origin is
from the tail of pancreas.

490
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,297
Hwang Gi-su.

491
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,507
MEDICAL RECORDS OF HWANG GI-SU

492
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,359
The bowel looks...

493
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,569
The bowel seems to be fine.

494
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,532
I'll check on the pancreas.

495
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,160
I'll perform omentectomy. Pad.

496
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:46,498
Bovie.

497
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,090
Retractor.

498
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,642
It's pancreas tail.

499
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,608
Is that right?

500
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,238
I'll call you back, Madam Oh.

501
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:22,492
-What brings you here?
-Patient Hwang Gi-su.

502
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,452
He's in operation
as the origin being the bowel.

503
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,454
Dr. Do is--

504
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,957
Dong-ju had a different opinion.
Why did you ignore him?

505
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,458
Did I?

506
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,086
I can't remember clearly.

507
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:36,464
You looked at the CT scans yourself.

508
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,091
Did you not suspect

509
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:40,885
even by the tiniest bit
that it could be pancreas tail?

510
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:44,806
I did think suspect that at first,

511
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:48,560
but Dr. Do was really certain
that it was the bowel is the origin.

512
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,770
If two fellows are in disagreement,

513
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,648
you should have looked
into the matter more carefully.

514
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,442
You are the chief of general surgery!

515
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,194
Instead,

516
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,613
all you did was taking sides.

517
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,075
What are you talking about?

518
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,619
I can read CT scans just fine.

519
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:10,957
Dr. Do and I came to the same conclusion.

520
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,626
What kind of doctor do you take me for?

521
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,422
DO IN-BEOM

522
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,550
Yes, Dr. Do.

523
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:21,968
What is it?

524
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:26,598
I opened up the patient,
but the bowel wasn't the origin.

525
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,224
Really?

526
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:30,560
What is it then?

527
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,438
It's the pancreas tail.

528
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,817
I see. I get it.

529
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,778
It's understandable.

530
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,156
Things can be different than expected

531
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,908
when we actually open the patients up.

532
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,662
Don't lose your composure.
Managing such situations

533
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,039
is part of a surgeon's capability.

534
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,792
So what should we do now?

535
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,421
Have you ever performed
distal pancreatectomy?

536
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,256
DISTAL PANCREATECTOMY:
PARTIAL PANCREAS RESECTION

537
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,136
I have once.
I assisted it a few times as well.

538
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,809
That's great. You have experience.

539
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,561
Why don't you show us what you can do?

540
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:17,982
I'll come in if there's a problem,
so don't you worry.

541
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,776
Okay.

542
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,825
It's the pancreas.

543
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,285
Gosh.

544
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,291
Is that true?

545
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:40,171
Have you really performed
distal pancreatectomy before?

546
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,550
Why? Do you think I was lying?

547
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,552
You lied about the Boerhaave's syndrome.

548
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,726
Commencing distal pancreatectomy.

549
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:56,813
I'll start with dissection. Forceps.

550
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,149
Bovie.

551
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,258
Please call Dr. Song again.

552
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,384
Okay.

553
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,395
What are you doing?
Aren't going to pick that up?

554
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:41,149
I don't recognize the number.
I'll pick it up later.

555
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,526
DO IN-BEOM

556
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:49,824
What's going on?

557
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,871
Tell me. What's going on?

558
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,876
Dr. Do is performing
distal pancreatectomy right now.

559
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,085
And?

560
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,715
You tell him what the problem is.

561
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,221
I'm calling to ask

562
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:15,433
whether you're supposed to dissect
the spleen as well.

563
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,394
He's calling to ask you.

564
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,437
Tell him.

565
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,315
Of course. You have to dissect it as well.

566
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,359
Why? Is there a problem?

567
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,861
I'm having difficulties exfoliating
the spleen artery.

568
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:30,114
I'm afraid I might cut the artery.

569
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:33,034
I see.

570
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,328
Oh, my. What should we do?

571
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,288
What do you think you should do?

572
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,248
You have to get in the operating room.

573
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,458
Who?

574
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:41,834
Me?

575
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,587
Should I be the one going in there?

576
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:51,386
Okay. Wait there, Dr. Do.

577
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,680
I'll be there soon.

578
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:55,598
Thank you.

579
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,983
How pathetic.

580
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,117
Spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy.

581
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,285
-Have you heard of it?
-I have.

582
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,037
I don't have experience of it.

583
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,790
If so, consider this an honor.

584
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,126
Watch carefully.

585
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,210
Forceps.

586
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,087
Bovie.

587
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,757
Because of the anatomical arrangement,

588
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:33,803
the dissection of the pancreas tail
requires dissecting the spleen as well.

589
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,221
However, there's been a report

590
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,849
saying that without the spleen,
the patient's immune system weakens.

591
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,809
So nowadays,

592
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,478
we tend to dissect the pancreas
without touching the spleen.

593
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,981
From what I heard,
you've been off-field for some time.

594
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,190
But you're doing quite well.

595
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:49,569
Of course. I'm the chief of GS
at Geosan Medical Center.

596
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,573
It's almost done.

597
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:54,991
You exfoliate it like this

598
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:58,369
and dissect the pancreas tail.

599
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,582
All done.

600
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:03,958
Do you see that?

601
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,168
It's clean, isn't it?

602
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:06,669
Yes.

603
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,510
What's going on?

604
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,971
I think the spleen artery
has been damaged.

605
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:18,514
Tap.

606
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:23,978
Flap.

607
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,813
Can you spot the location of the bleeding?

608
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,106
There's no clear vision.

609
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,028
Vascular clamp.

610
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,448
Suction. One more.

611
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,035
Irrigation.

612
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:43,623
Suction.

613
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,544
I did it. I located the vessel.

614
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,676
This is not looking good.

615
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,596
I think we'll have to remove the spleen.

616
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,981
-Suture.
-Wait a minute.

617
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,734
Wait for what?

618
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,369
What do you think you're doing?
Get out of my way.

619
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,375
There's a tear in the splenic artery.

620
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,501
TEAR: RIP OF TISSUE

621
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:30,419
If we just suture this area,

622
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,213
we can save the spleen.

623
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:37,927
May I do it?

624
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:40,805
What are you doing?

625
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:43,141
This is my operation.
Why are you trying to take over?

626
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,268
If you're confident, you should do it.

627
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,812
You said you have done it before.

628
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,232
If this goes wrong,

629
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,277
this is all on you, Dr. Kang.

630
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,528
Are you still going to do it?

631
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,531
You really are consistent.

632
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:02,160
The first thing you do
is looking for someone to blame.

633
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,786
Cut the crap.

634
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,413
Are you going to do it or not?

635
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,053
Loupe.

636
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:23,806
Okay.

637
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,606
Prolene number five.

638
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,316
Dr. Kang.

639
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,401
Give it to me.

640
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,999
Focus.

641
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,230
Cut.

642
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,319
Okay.

643
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:08,995
Cut.

644
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:17,962
Releasing.

645
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:21,716
Irrigation.

646
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,640
There's no bleeding.

647
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,310
I think the spleen will be fine now.

648
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:35,980
Should I close him up?

649
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,460
Do In-beom.

650
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:02,590
When will you stop lying
in order to perform an operation?

651
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:03,883
What are you talking about?

652
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,426
Take today for example.

653
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,763
You've never done
distal pancreatectomy before.

654
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,557
We should have switched positions.

655
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,184
It was my operation.

656
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:16,103
I thought I could handle the operation.

657
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,981
I've done simulations by watching
videos of it on the Internet.

658
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,191
Hey.

659
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,194
How can watching a video
and the actual operation be the same?

660
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,905
That's how I always practice.

661
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,450
How else am I going to
experience all the different cases?

662
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,160
You irresponsible scum.

663
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,995
Without such practice,

664
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,206
becoming a surgeon is impossible.

665
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,542
Once you cut a patient's abdomen open,

666
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,795
no one knows what will happen.

667
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:41,921
Are you saying

668
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,466
you will keep lying
to get more experiences?

669
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,261
You were just lucky with the spleen.
Don't get smart with me.

670
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:53,349
I hope you will stop lying
about your experiences.

671
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,267
If you do that again,

672
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,520
I will send the issue to the committee.

673
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,315
You coward.

674
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,859
Hey.

675
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,406
You little...

676
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:21,919
Let go, you jerk.

677
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:23,754
Let go!

678
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,631
-Let go.
-Let go!

679
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:30,261
You punk.

680
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,721
Go tell your daddy on me then.

681
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,390
-You idiot.
-Mr. Gu.

682
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,517
Let go of me.

683
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,729
Get off me.

684
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,231
Hey.

685
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,113
That's enough, both of you.

686
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,448
Gosh.

687
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,201
Hey.

688
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,537
Gosh.

689
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,624
What? Did they fight again?

690
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:05,087
Dr. Kang was so awesome
in the operating room.

691
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,798
And that made Dr. Do look
a bit like a loser.

692
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,469
Was Dong-ju awesome?

693
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,472
-What do you mean?
-He was doing angiogrhaphy.

694
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,141
I thought he was Teacher Kim.

695
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,685
He was just like him.

696
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,521
Stay focused.

697
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,526
Cut.

698
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,531
Did Dong-ju imitate Teacher Kim?

699
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,117
He was not just imitating.
He was as good as Teacher Kim.

700
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,870
His skills were not as good
as Teacher Kim's,

701
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:40,247
-but he was pretty close.
-What was that?

702
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,167
He always backbites Teacher Kim
for being a show-off.

703
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,461
Maybe he learned something
while backbiting Teacher Kim.

704
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:47,421
People get closer after a fight.

705
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,633
So where are they now?

706
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:57,806
What was that about?

707
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,850
What did you two fight about?

708
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:04,647
Say it.

709
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,026
He intercepted my surgery,

710
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,861
so I got upset.

711
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:16,116
I will make sure this never happens again.

712
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:19,078
What about you, Dong-ju?
Do you have anything to tell me?

713
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,623
No, I don't.

714
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:24,792
Okay.

715
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:29,213
If you don't, get out of my office.

716
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,812
I heard you were in a fight again.

717
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,189
I heard you beat each other up.

718
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:50,109
He hit me first.
What was I supposed to do?

719
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,944
What's wrong with you two?

720
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,780
You two are the same age.
It would be good if you became friends.

721
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,033
You two probably have no friends anyways

722
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,451
due to your difficult personalities.

723
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:02,121
What are you talking about?
I have many friends.

724
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:05,207
Is that so? Maybe that's why
no one has come to Jeongseon

725
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:08,210
to see you since you came here.

726
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:11,672
That's just because they are busy
with their work.

727
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,134
What about you?
You don't have many friends.

728
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,260
I do.

729
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,930
Ms. Eom, Dr. Jung, Mr. Park.

730
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:23,892
And I often drink beer with Ms. Oh

731
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:24,935
and Dr. Nam.

732
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:26,812
They are all my friends.

733
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:30,107
-I see. They are your friends.
-Right.

734
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,651
Then the trees and birds
in the backyard of the hospital

735
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,612
are your friends, too.

736
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,448
I should get going.

737
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,326
You can't just leave like that.

738
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:42,661
Weren't you worried about me?

739
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,755
Make sure to put some medicine
on the wound.

740
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,340
I should go.

741
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:56,842
I love you.

742
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,970
I told you not to do that!

743
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,555
It's too cheesy.

744
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,312
That's enough.

745
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,731
I want you to leave now.

746
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,491
Hey.

747
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,826
You are a grown-up. No more fighting.

748
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,871
I told you Dr. Do hit me first.

749
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:28,540
Maybe you made him upset.

750
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:29,875
I know what he's like.

751
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:33,462
He's not the kind of person
who'd hit someone for no reason.

752
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:36,423
He grew up without knowing
a day of hardship.

753
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,552
-Are you siding with him or what?
-Enough.

754
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,013
Be more cautious in the future.

755
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:46,058
This is a hospital, not a boxing ring.

756
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:01,031
They are not that good at acting.

757
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:04,118
What was that about?

758
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,704
Why are you so upset?

759
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:08,705
Me?

760
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,500
I'm not upset.

761
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:17,256
My relationship with Dr. Kang
was not good to start with.

762
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:20,384
When he intercepted my surgery,

763
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,344
I lost my temper.

764
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,184
You are not telling me the truth.

765
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:32,479
Or,

766
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:34,773
is it that

767
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:37,317
you don't know how to tell the truth?

768
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:41,280
-Pardon?
-That's it. Get out.

769
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,993
About Chairman Shin's operation.

770
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:48,662
I'm afraid

771
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:50,747
we won't be doing the operation.

772
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,084
He has terminal lung cancer.

773
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,711
LUNG CANCER TERMINAL:
LAST-STAGE LUNG CANCER

774
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,964
Go and tell your father about it.

775
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,510
What do you mean?

776
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,888
That's what you are here for.

777
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,933
And that's why you wanted
to join my operation team.

778
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,649
You know what?

779
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,985
I prefer a cornered stone

780
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,362
than a round one.

781
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:24,656
If you are a cornered stone,

782
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:26,700
it means you have your own style

783
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:29,578
and your own thoughts.

784
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:39,505
I like to see a cornered stone being faced

785
00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:42,883
with the mason's chisel.

786
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:47,804
I don't want someone that is
roundish and lukewarm.

787
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,640
I want someone

788
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:53,352
that will shape oneself and find his own

789
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,604
philosophy and belief.

790
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,441
I may have thought that

791
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,694
you were one of those people.

792
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,821
That day, you did an operation

793
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,074
that you didn't have to do.

794
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:10,786
I thought it was more than just sheer
bravado on your father's coat-tails.

795
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:14,831
I thought you did it
for the dangerous patient.

796
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,042
And you were pretty skilled.

797
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:22,130
That's why I wanted you here.

798
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,050
And?

799
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:27,803
I think

800
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,557
I was wrong about that.

801
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:37,145
Go tell your father.

802
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,440
Chairman Shin won't have
an operation in our hospital.

803
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,067
So

804
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:45,112
he doesn't need to be
anxious about it anymore.

805
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:48,699
And I guess

806
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,994
you should leave Doldam Hospital.

807
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,025
Terminal lung cancer?

808
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:25,861
Late-stage lung cancer?

809
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,238
Yes, that's what I heard.

810
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:30,699
What about the operation?

811
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:33,160
What will they do
with the artificial heart operation?

812
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:36,038
Chairman Shin won't make it until then.

813
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:37,539
Did Bu Yong-ju say that?

814
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:40,709
Are you sure he said

815
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,711
he'd give up on the operation?

816
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:45,839
Yes, he said that to me.

817
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,799
Okay.

818
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:48,925
I get it.

819
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:50,927
Father.

820
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:54,348
What? Tell me.

821
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:55,974
Can I

822
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,311
go back to Geosan Medical Center?

823
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,774
Wait a little longer

824
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:05,692
until things are settled.

825
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:07,444
Stop whining.

826
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,172
Come in.

827
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,177
It's me.

828
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:36,390
I came here as soon as I heard
about Chairman Shin.

829
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:38,975
You must be devastated.

830
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,269
Who told you about him?

831
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:42,813
At Doldam Hospital,

832
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:45,107
there are a few people
who are my eyes and ears.

833
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:47,401
I see.

834
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:49,611
It's hard to say this to you,

835
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:51,613
but since it turned out this way

836
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:55,200
I think Chairman Shin has to give up
on the heart surgery.

837
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,460
What is your opinion?

838
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:08,630
Do you think

839
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:12,426
I should go through the surgery?

840
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:16,138
Or since I am going to die soon anyway,

841
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,183
should I not

842
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,811
get the dangerous surgery?

843
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:26,565
To be honest,

844
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:29,443
in a situation like this,

845
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:33,363
following the patient's decision is

846
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:36,867
the only thing a doctor can do,
Chairman Shin.

847
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,412
If I decide

848
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,540
not to get the surgery,

849
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,127
what happens then?

850
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,549
I was going to fix your heart

851
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:57,596
and keep asking you for money
after saving your life.

852
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:01,099
But it seems that ship has sailed already.

853
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:02,768
You punk.

854
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:07,814
How can you still make jokes like that
in such a situation?

855
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,861
We cannot assure you or predict

856
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:15,781
which of the two organs

857
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:19,659
will start failing first.

858
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:24,456
What if

859
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:28,418
I decide to get the surgery anyway?

860
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:34,424
The artificial heart replacement surgery

861
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:37,219
also has a high risk.

862
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:43,600
Neither of them would be a good choice.

863
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:50,982
Right. I see.

864
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:57,280
-Hello, President Yeo.
-Hi.

865
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,201
Manager Jang, you were here, too.

866
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:05,831
Would you like to have a cup of coffee?

867
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,207
Yes, thank you.

868
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,502
About Dr. Kang...

869
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:13,839
He may appear to be picky,
but once you get to know him,

870
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:16,508
you can see that he has such a good heart.

871
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:18,677
-Don't you think so, President Yeo?
-Well, yes.

872
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,428
He seems so.

873
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,807
In fact, the shapes of his eyebrows

874
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,309
and the area between the eyebrows

875
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:29,688
indicate that he is a man
who would love a woman forever

876
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:31,690
once he falls in love with her.

877
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:33,024
Don't you agree, President Yeo?

878
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:36,862
I guess. I don't know much
about physiognomy.

879
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,364
He has the face of a man

880
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:42,701
who would be a good husband
as well as a good boyfriend.

881
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,127
Thanks for the coffee, Manager Jang.

882
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:53,545
I'll get back to work.

883
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:54,963
Okay. Go on now.

884
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:59,426
Just as I expected,
she can't hide her feelings.

885
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,928
Dong-ju, we have an emergency.

886
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,305
What do you mean?

887
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:06,182
I think Manager Jang figured it out.

888
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,893
-What did he figure out?
-Oh, gosh.

889
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,898
I mean, he seems to suspect us.

890
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:16,359
He went on talking about
weird things in front of President Yeo.

891
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:21,072
I think he might spread
a rumor in this hospital.

892
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:23,867
So?

893
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,121
Let's have a fight.

894
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:31,041
-Fight?
-Yes.

895
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,626
Let's fight more intensely.

896
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,252
Let's make it look like a real fight.

897
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:37,547
Dr. Yun.

898
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,633
Why did you give the patient
an analgesic first?

899
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,217
Dr. Kang, it's because I--

900
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:43,345
Can't you see that the patient is in pain?

901
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:46,306
-The patient was in so much pain so--
-I wasn't far from here.

902
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,850
I can come here from my office
in only two minutes.

903
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,143
You should have called me first.

904
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:52,604
I could have checked
if it was a surgical abdomen.

905
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:54,606
Right. I thought of that too, but--

906
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:56,524
Don't you know that analgesics

907
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,777
except for NSAIDs don't
affect the physical examination?

908
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,488
-I do. That's why I gave an order.
-In case of an acute abdomen,

909
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:02,781
call a surgeon first from now on.

910
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:05,408
The emergency room isn't
a control room for the hospital.

911
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,160
The doctors in here are

912
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:09,245
also good enough
to make decisions on their own.

913
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:12,165
Do you want to start a fight between
GS and EM doctors?

914
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:13,458
Hey!

915
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:14,793
Stop talking back. I'm your senior.

916
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,461
What's wrong with you two?

917
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:18,171
I told you, it was my fault.

918
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:20,507
-It's not your fault!
-It's not your fault!

919
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,175
Dong-ju and Seo-jeong

920
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:25,637
squabble every time they see each other.

921
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:27,639
I know.

922
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:29,516
-That's fake.
-You startled me.

923
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,518
Fake? What do you mean?

924
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:34,729
They're trying to hide the fact
that they're a couple.

925
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:37,816
The fight is a cover-up.

926
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:39,192
No way.

927
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:41,528
Don't jump to a conclusion.
That's not true.

928
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,239
What would you do if I'm right?

929
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:47,450
You can have free drinks
at my bar for one month.

930
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:49,494
Free food, too.

931
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:51,830
All right. Food is free, too.

932
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:54,082
Why would you two make a bet

933
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:56,459
on whether they are a couple or not?

934
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:58,795
-It's fun.
-It's fun.

935
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:04,467
It's from Teacher Kim.

936
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,386
I can't seem to get along with you.

937
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,393
Everyone, please be seated.

938
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:17,272
What is going on, Teacher Kim?

939
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:18,982
As of today,

940
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:22,193
the conference on Chairman Shin's surgery

941
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:25,905
will be suspended.

942
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,371
What do you mean

943
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,290
the conference will be suspended?

944
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,751
The CT scan result came out.

945
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,378
He has terminal lung cancer.

946
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,301
Terminal lung cancer.

947
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:48,887
Considering his condition,

948
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:51,806
the artificial heart replacement surgery

949
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,476
would be too much for the patient.

950
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:59,064
Therefore, everything we have--

951
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,323
May we come in?

952
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,293
It's okay. You can stay seated.

953
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:28,718
Are these people the staff members
who will participate

954
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:31,012
in my surgery?

955
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:33,306
Yes, Chairman Shin.

956
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:35,141
I see.

957
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,769
They all look trustworthy.

958
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:42,607
-Don't you think so?
-Yes, I agree with you.

959
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:47,445
I was discussing

960
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:50,532
your surgery with them.

961
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:52,408
That's good.

962
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:56,871
Actually, I came down here

963
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,706
to talk about it.

964
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,591
-Teacher Kim.
-Yes?

965
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:10,885
Let us

966
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:15,265
stick to our original plan.

967
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:17,642
Pardon?

968
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,232
Let's proceed with the surgery

969
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:26,818
as we planned.

970
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,696
Chairman Shin.

971
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,869
Since things turned out this way,

972
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:38,997
how about you become the chairman?

973
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:40,999
What do you say?

974
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,589
I think Geosan Medical Center needs

975
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:50,467
a young chairman at this juncture.

976
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:57,640
You can call me a greedy old man

977
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,642
or say that I'm senile.

978
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:01,478
But, even if

979
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:04,606
I only have one day left to live,

980
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:09,444
I want to breathe comfortably.

981
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:12,322
I'm going to die anyway.

982
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,658
It's not too much to ask of you, is it?

983
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:20,914
Right, Teacher Kim?

984
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:07,001
EPILOGUE

985
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:08,127
It's tough, isn't it?

986
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,340
Thank you so much.

987
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,932
That's pretty.

988
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,017
Was it a gift?

989
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:29,274
It's nothing...

990
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,986
