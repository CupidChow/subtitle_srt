00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,773
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

2
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,280
What is going on?

3
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,351
I need you to go to Doldam Hospital.

4
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,897
Do you want me to work there?

5
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,940
Form a team of your followers

6
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,318
and go down there.

7
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,320
Make sure

8
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,822
Bu Yong-ju doesn't operate
on Chairman Shin.

9
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,534
Hello,

10
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,161
staff of Doldam Hospital.

11
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:22,540
We have been dispatched
to Doldam Hospital as of today.

12
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,459
I'm the chief of General Surgery,
Song Hyeon-cheol.

13
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,920
I will appreciate your help and support.

14
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,926
If you can,

15
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,470
keep Bu Yong-ju quiet.

16
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,681
I want him out of my life
once and for all.

17
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,683
I will not let him

18
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,978
live a life of a surgeon.

19
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,815
But how, President Do?

20
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,026
That's what I need you for.

21
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,612
You must

22
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:54,989
find a way.

23
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,621
I'll try my best, President Do.

24
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,104
How should I interpret
this situation, President Do?

25
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,480
When I was down there last time,

26
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,692
I noticed that you're short on staff.

27
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,318
So I sent some of our staff
to support you.

28
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,862
Support me?

29
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:38,032
-Is that all?
-Why do you ask?

30
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,994
Do you have any problem with my decision?

31
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,539
Even if you do, shut up
and don't mention it.

32
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,709
That should be the best for you.

33
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,966
Times of unlimited competition.

34
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,190
You either kill or you die.

35
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,192
It's a battle of survival.

36
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,862
We are going to

37
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,324
Doldam Hospital for an innovation.

38
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,076
Don't forget that the future of
Geosan Medical Center

39
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,580
lies on our shoulders.

40
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,040
Listen.

41
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,416
-We can do this!
-We can do this.

42
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,834
-We can do this.
-Louder.

43
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,753
We can do this!

44
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,379
-We can do this!
-We can do this!

45
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,351
I'm Ji Min-jeong.

46
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,394
I've worked at Geosan Medical Center
for 10 years.

47
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,146
I was the head nurse there.

48
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,648
I'm Oh Myeong-sim.

49
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,316
I've worked here for 18 years.

50
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,360
I'm the head nurse here.

51
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,780
I'll be in charge of
distributing workloads.

52
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,324
Do you have a problem with that?

53
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,243
We are

54
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,203
the face of Geosan Medical Center.

55
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,496
We must never

56
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,957
let them have the upper hand

57
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,625
in taking the initiative.

58
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,460
I do.

59
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,129
I will be the one

60
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,048
distributing the workloads to my nurses.

61
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,800
It's only reasonable.

62
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,969
I know much more about them

63
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,346
than you do.

64
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,014
Do you...

65
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,433
have a problem with that?

66
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:31,271
They take pride
in beating their opponents.

67
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,482
And the world encourages them to do so.

68
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,818
Prove yourself.

69
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,530
You always came second to Dong-ju

70
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,075
both at school and at the hospital.

71
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,914
For once.

72
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,250
Go and win against Dong-ju just once.

73
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,294
Father, I...

74
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,799
I don't want a loser son.

75
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,011
Do you understand?

76
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,598
If you don't beat your opponents,
you're looked down upon.

77
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,525
The fear of becoming a loser

78
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:22,488
drive people into
the world of competition.

79
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,657
Brace yourself.

80
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,910
Dr. Bu Yong-ju.

81
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,417
FOR DR. TEACHER KIM

82
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,591
Try me.

83
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,441
Do you really not know?

84
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,694
-Are you sure?
-I really don't.

85
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,906
I didn't even have time to pack
because of the short notice.

86
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:08,242
Thanks to that,
my wife is very upset with me.

87
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,411
My kids were crying all night.

88
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,705
Even my mother-in-law
paid us a visit and--

89
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,916
But you're not making any sense.

90
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,793
You all barge in here

91
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,377
and yet, you don't know the reason for it.

92
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,046
That's exactly my point.

93
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,298
How can they reassign
so many people like this?

94
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:25,176
Hey. It's not like the hospital
will take responsibility

95
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,136
if I get divorced.

96
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,226
Hello, In-beom.

97
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,315
Which seat can I take?

98
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:41,359
Do you want to take this one?

99
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,486
I think this one is the best one here.

100
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,826
What is going on?

101
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,995
Why are you here?

102
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,666
Is it because of the surgery? Is that why?

103
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,462
Excuse me.

104
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,007
Can you please stop talking to me
like you know me so well?

105
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,509
Well...

106
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,262
I was just curious.

107
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:12,598
I don't want you to be curious about me.
It makes me uncomfortable.

108
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,558
Hey.

109
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,103
Why are you being rude?

110
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,272
I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable.

111
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,862
In-beom, wait. Are you upset?

112
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,622
What was that?

113
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,167
He was so rude to you.

114
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,335
-Aren't you going to do something?
-You think?

115
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,171
Was he rude?

116
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:45,840
Maybe.

117
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,386
What is going on between you two?

118
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,847
Aren't you going to tell me?

119
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,016
Things are just like you and me.

120
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,518
He is just a younger colleague,
just like you are.

121
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,480
How could you even
compare me to that jerk?

122
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,065
There is something special
between you and me.

123
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,526
Is there anything special?

124
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,278
What is that?

125
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,114
We have...

126
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,909
a special bond.

127
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,371
A special bond?

128
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,416
You don't think so?

129
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,174
Why?

130
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,676
What?

131
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,720
Nothing.

132
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,722
You are adorable.

133
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,312
You can't say that to a grown man.

134
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,064
I'm not a kid.

135
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,441
You are a kid. You didn't know that?

136
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,652
-Am I?
-Yes.

137
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,363
You just act like a teenager.

138
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,281
Did you really not know that?

139
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,494
-Seo-jeong.
-Let's get back to work.

140
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,189
You know what?

141
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,654
I'm not sure why you feel
uncomfortable around me.

142
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,158
But now that you are here,
I just want to get along with you.

143
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:41,080
If you have any questions,
you are always welcome to ask me.

144
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,584
And I know some famous restaurants...

145
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,380
around here.

146
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,635
Never mind.

147
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,030
How old is the file cabinet?

148
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,700
Vintage furniture is popular these days.

149
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,246
I'm sorry.

150
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,874
We are short of money.

151
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,668
I will buy you a new one if you want.

152
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,755
That's okay. I won't be here that long.

153
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,132
-Pardon?
-Oh, right.

154
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,135
This is for you.

155
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,642
Congratulations on your promotion,
Manager Jang.

156
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,977
Manager?

157
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,315
NOTICE OF APPOINTMENT

158
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:53,110
You are asked to perform
an important role as a manager

159
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,237
for Doldam Hospital by President Do.

160
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,156
Let's give it our best shot.

161
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,909
I will make sure to do my best.

162
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:03,079
I'm ready to put my life on the line
for the future of Doldam Hospital.

163
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,956
-Speaking of which...
-Yes, sir.

164
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,293
I'd like to know more
about Doldam Hospital in detail.

165
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,588
-Pardon?
-Like some inside stories

166
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:15,257
or hidden bottleneck problems.

167
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,634
Also,

168
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,344
it seems

169
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,888
Teacher Kim is a pivotal figure
in this hospital.

170
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:25,267
Is there anything wrong with him?

171
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,478
What do you mean?

172
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,525
Me? Are you talking to me?

173
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:35,111
Yes, you.

174
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:39,490
What is your position in this hospital?

175
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,660
Well, I am...

176
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,787
-Orderly.
-Orderly.

177
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,372
You are an orderly.

178
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,043
on the board for emergency medicine.

179
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,170
Actually, on the double board
for cardiothoracic surgery.

180
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,301
Maybe you are
a hidden medical expert in this hospital.

181
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,931
No, I wouldn't say that.
I just try to work hard.

182
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,307
Okay, then.

183
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,852
I will consider that for further tasks.

184
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,981
It doesn't matter what it is.

185
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,151
If you have anything that can
finish Teacher Kim with a single blow,

186
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,155
I want you to share it with me.

187
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,158
Finish Teacher Kim with a single blow?

188
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,118
If things go well with that,

189
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,413
I will recommend you
for a position at Geosan Medical Center.

190
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,291
Just think about it.

191
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,501
We still have plenty of time.

192
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:40,759
Are you not going to do anything
about them?

193
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,553
Just let it go.

194
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,055
It is so obvious

195
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,099
why they came all the way here.

196
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:50,269
But what can we do?
They say they came to support us.

197
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,898
Are you going to let them
stab you in the back again?

198
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,275
You are not alone this time.

199
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,277
The whole staff of Doldam Hospital
is at stake.

200
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,822
I'm aware of that. Gosh, you startled me.

201
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,367
Are you sure you're aware of that?

202
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:09,914
I'm sure I'm aware.
So please just let them be.

203
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,503
Do you know that there will be
no hospital you can go to...

204
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,299
other than here?

205
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:35,898
Where are you taking that?

206
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,776
We just got a new one,
so I'm taking it to the storage.

207
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,153
Who is she, by the way?

208
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,572
She will be working here for a while.

209
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,574
Her name is Woo Yeon-hwa.

210
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,825
Hello.

211
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,162
Hello, it's nice to meet you.
I'm Yun Seo-jeong.

212
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,622
Where is the new device?

213
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:54,291
-It's in the hybrid room.
-Okay.

214
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,637
She is my second favorite person
here after Ms. Oh.

215
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,681
I see.

216
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,353
Look at the ultrasound device.

217
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,690
Is this hospital beyond space and time?

218
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,024
It's not the Stone Age now.

219
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,110
I just saw the old device here.

220
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,237
-This is so cool.
-Is it a relic of the past or what?

221
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,698
Chest portable device? Are you here, too?

222
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:29,869
It's so nice to see you again.

223
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,328
I'm so happy.

224
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,498
It is a miracle that you could
actually save a life in here.

225
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,126
What is that?

226
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,752
It's an external cooling device.

227
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,089
Therapeutic hypothermia is
popular these days.

228
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:46,302
It became famous after they used it
for a president of a conglomerate.

229
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,889
Hello, you are new. It's nice to meet you.

230
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,141
Let me ask you a question.

231
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,852
Why have you been stuck
in this hospital for the past five years?

232
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,437
Beautiful mountain,
clean water, fresh air.

233
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,024
-Hey.
-And Teacher Kim.

234
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,234
Have you heard of the name?
He is a legendary surgeon.

235
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,111
He was once a legendary surgeon.

236
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,946
He is still a legendary surgeon.

237
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,742
I know things will get tough,
but once you get through it all,

238
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,453
your life will be changed.

239
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,747
No, I don't want a change.

240
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,998
Me being here

241
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,542
is the worst change
that has ever happened to me in my life.

242
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:22,338
The whole thing is a complete mess.
I don't want to go through anything.

243
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,924
Where do you want to put the ECMO?

244
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:26,759
ECMO?

245
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,762
Do we have a new ECMO?
I can't believe this.

246
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,599
It's so pretty.

247
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,060
Look at that.

248
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,519
She's dancing.

249
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,396
-I feel like crying.
-Please put it here.

250
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,864
This is so good.

251
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,575
-Are you happy?
-Of course I am!

252
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,412
Where should I put this?

253
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,588
Hello? This is Teacher Kim speaking.

254
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:06,966
Did you

255
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,135
receive the devices?

256
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,973
Yes, I received them all.

257
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,392
My work is done here.

258
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,894
If you try to mess with me again,

259
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,314
I won't let you get away with it.

260
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:24,900
So,

261
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,528
when will you schedule the surgery?

262
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,990
I will give you a call
as soon as we are ready.

263
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,158
Just make it quick.

264
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,203
Give me a call.

265
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,583
What a brat.

266
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,296
He's never scared of me.

267
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,298
That's why you like him.

268
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:51,927
This is jujube tea.

269
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,847
Jujube tea?

270
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,232
He killed someone.

271
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,527
And it was a pupil of his.

272
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,532
Simply put,

273
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,993
he's a psychopath.

274
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,913
I'm more used to using a knife.

275
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,041
Are you really a doctor?

276
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,880
How many patients have you killed?

277
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:06,543
ON YOUR WAY RESTAURANT

278
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,176
This is Doldam Hospital.

279
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,346
Yes. I got it.

280
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,972
A CPR patient coming in three minutes!

281
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,849
Teacher Kim!

282
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:22,684
Teacher Kim!

283
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,688
-What happened?
-It's a stab wound.

284
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,316
He collapsed in front of my restaurant.

285
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,404
Do-il, are you okay?

286
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,532
This is his blood. I'm fine.

287
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,993
-Dr. Yun, scissors.
-Okay.

288
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,838
We should call the police first.

289
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,550
-Vital signs?
-It's 100 over 70, pulse 130.

290
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,593
Set up IV lines and execute a full drop.

291
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,559
These three wounds
on his right side aren't too deep.

292
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,519
But these two on his left are punctured.

293
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,729
Check for hemoperitoneum with a sonogram.

294
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,065
HEMOPERITONEUM: PRESENCE OF BLOOD
IN PERITONEAL CAVITY

295
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,067
This is our new equipment.

296
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,279
Doctor, his saturation is at 88 percent.

297
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,156
Hey, Dr. Geosan. Perform an intubation.

298
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,574
Me?

299
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,660
Okay.

300
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,838
You're too slow!

301
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,173
Yes, Doctor.

302
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,223
It's done.

303
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,350
His blood pressure is 80 over 40.

304
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,435
Okay.

305
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,313
Get two packs of emergency RBCs.

306
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,398
Get RIS ready.

307
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,691
RIS: RAPID BLOOD INFUSION SYSTEM

308
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:53,859
It's here.

309
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,321
We have a new portable chest X-ray.

310
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,823
-Should I get it ready?
-No, we need to take a sonogram.

311
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,867
If his blood pressure rises above 100,

312
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,077
-take a CT scan as well.
-Okay.

313
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,830
We need the portable chest X-ray.

314
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,332
Okay.

315
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,251
We have an emergency patient.

316
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,516
Let's move him. One, two, three.

317
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,229
Dr. Yun, cover up his wound

318
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,189
and get his personal information first.

319
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,357
Call the general surgeons.

320
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,734
-Both Dong-ju and the new guy.
-Okay.

321
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,194
-Hey, Dr. Geosan.
-Yes.

322
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,862
-Both of you can follow me.
-Yes, Doctor.

323
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,155
I need a dressing set

324
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,782
-and a six-inch EB.
-Okay.

325
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,242
Can you see if he has a wallet

326
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,952
-and a phone?
-Okay.

327
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,536
Can anyone call the general surgeons?

328
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,997
-Call both Dr. Kang and Dr. Do.
-I will!

329
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,792
I will get them.

330
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,045
She's very quick.

331
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,755
Yes, and she's nice.

332
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,802
-Gosh, you startled me.
-I'm sorry.

333
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,178
We have an emergency patient.

334
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,892
An emergency patient?

335
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,897
Hello, Dr. Kang.

336
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,318
This hospital is worse than I thought.

337
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:22,489
How can he think of doing a surgery
for the chairman here?

338
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,201
So,

339
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,079
have you made your decision?

340
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:30,914
Which side will you take?

341
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,125
Me or Bu Yong-ju?

342
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,088
Hello, Dr. Do.

343
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,132
Are you all settled in?

344
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,384
What about the office? Is it okay?

345
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,594
It's fine.

346
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,971
I knew it.

347
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,931
It's just fine.

348
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:52,602
What can we do? We should
do our job as long as we are here.

349
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,396
Let's get to work.

350
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,316
I'll talk to you later.

351
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,484
Bye.

352
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,950
Are you still taking sides?

353
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,164
Then what are you doing here?

354
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,501
I haven't got any connections or families,

355
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,129
but your father is the president.

356
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,548
How did you end up here?

357
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:24,843
I did not end up here.
I'm just here for an experience.

358
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:28,346
I can go back whenever I wish.

359
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:29,806
Unlike you.

360
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,274
Apart from your father,

361
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,360
is there anything you can do
better than me?

362
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,073
If you have anything, show me.

363
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,451
Prove yourself.

364
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,369
For once.

365
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,830
Go and win against Dong-ju just once.

366
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,708
You're awful.

367
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,461
I'm just awful,
but you're awful and terrible.

368
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,756
Why?

369
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,382
Do you want to hit me?

370
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,469
You're not even worth it.

371
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,137
It'll only hurt my hand.

372
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:13,725
You're not even a good surgeon.
Why are you worried about your hand?

373
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,193
Excuse me.

374
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:29,282
You are wanted at the emergency room.

375
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,041
Your lips are bleeding.

376
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:42,963
Excuse me.

377
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,883
Aren't you a general surgeon?

378
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:50,470
Teacher Kim wanted you there, too.

379
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,560
Ventricular fibrillation. Compression.

380
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,478
VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION:
CARDIAC RHYTHM DISTURBANCE

381
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,856
Give me 200J.

382
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,567
-We're ready.
-Move away.

383
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:05,986
Clear.

384
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,195
Compression.

385
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,828
Let's perform intubation.

386
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,251
Tube, please.

387
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,172
Okay.

388
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:27,465
Resuscitator.

389
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,178
Move away.

390
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,307
Okay.

391
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,518
Give him 1mg of epinephrine
every 3 minutes.

392
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,145
Squeeze the resuscitator
every six seconds.

393
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,313
Okay.

394
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,981
Two minutes passed.

395
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,441
Switch hands and check his pulse.

396
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,151
Yes.

397
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:49,446
No pulse, he's in PEA.

398
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:50,780
You, compression.

399
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,115
PEA: PULSELESS ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY

400
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,491
When was the report made?

401
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,535
It was 3:48 p.m.

402
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,038
He was at a bus stop,
and he suddenly collapsed.

403
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,372
Someone called 911,

404
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:02,959
and the witness was performing CPR on him.

405
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,211
What was his initial treatment?

406
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,338
We performed ventricular fibrillation
on him twice.

407
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,965
That's 17 minutes before he arrived here.

408
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:10,967
Do you have his information?

409
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,970
He had an ID, so we talked to his wife.

410
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,555
She's on her way here.

411
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,891
Okay. Thank you.

412
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,939
Dr. Kim, he has another wound on his back.

413
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,690
-Hey, Dr. Geosan.
-Yes, Dr. Geosan here.

414
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,984
Continue to perform compression
until he comes back.

415
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,153
-Don't give up.
-Okay.

416
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:32,989
Let's check his pulse.

417
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,282
He's still in asystole.

418
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,617
My gosh.

419
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,333
It looks like it's somewhere
in the thoracolumbar junction.

420
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,502
I felt something hard inside.

421
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,672
I think this is a knife blade.

422
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:53,218
It must have broke when he was stabbed.

423
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,639
Where are the surgeons?

424
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,140
They are so slow.

425
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,184
Drag them here if you have to.

426
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,435
Yes, Teacher Kim.

427
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,771
What took you so long?

428
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,775
-What's the case?
-He's a stabbed patient.

429
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,360
He was stabbed five times in his stomach,

430
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:12,821
and there is a knife blade stuck
in the TL junction.

431
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,239
What about nerve injuries?

432
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,865
Both of his lower motors do not seem well.

433
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,784
BOTH LOWER MOTOR:
MOVEMENT OF BOTH LEGS

434
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,494
What's wrong with your lips?

435
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:23,415
-What about his stomach?
-He has two bowel perforations.

436
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:26,084
We can't see if it's his small bowel
or large bowel through the CT.

437
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,837
His sonogram showed that
the wounds are close to his vessels.

438
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,130
It's toward his vessels as well.

439
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,926
-Did you fight with someone?
-I'm not a kid.

440
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:40,640
What's with him?

441
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,393
Is he sulking because of that?

442
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:48,648
Yes, Dr. Song.

443
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,151
We need you in the emergency room.

444
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,987
-Dad!
-Honey!

445
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,488
-Honey!
-May I help you?

446
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:59,075
We got the call saying my dad
collapsed at a bus stop.

447
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,869
They said he was transferred
to Doldam Hospital.

448
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,871
Our doctors are treating him right now.

449
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,664
Please wait over there.

450
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,708
How could this happen?

451
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:10,211
-My goodness.
-Don't cry, Mom.

452
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,840
Checking heart rhythm.

453
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,223
He has a pulse. It's an ROSC.

454
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,725
The blood pressure is 90 over 60.

455
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:24,851
Nice.

456
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,105
-He needs a C-line, right?
-What?

457
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:33,234
Right. I need a C-line.

458
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,448
-That's the one.
-Right.

459
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:40,742
It's not looking good.

460
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,789
Dr. Kang is here.

461
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:48,249
Why did you come alone?
Where's the other guy?

462
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,210
The other guy? Who?

463
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:53,296
Medical team of general surgery
from Geosan Medical Center came down here.

464
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,257
I wasn't expecting that from President Do.

465
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:00,345
I asked you where the other guy is.
We paged you both.

466
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,639
I don't really know where he is.

467
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,182
I'm here.

468
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,322
He's a John Doe.

469
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,199
He has five wounds in his abdomen.

470
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:24,452
The three on his right are light wounds,
but the other ones aren't.

471
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,578
He has perforated bowel.

472
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,497
Blade of the knife broke

473
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,416
in the right side of his abdomen.

474
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,334
Will this call for a combined operation?

475
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:32,544
Yes.

476
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,671
-Where should we start?
-With his abdomen.

477
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,798
He might not be able to walk again,

478
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,299
but at least he won't die.

479
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,217
Okay.

480
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,429
I'll go prepare for
a different operation, then.

481
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,389
Hold on.

482
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,349
I just got the call.

483
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,644
Are you going to operate
on a John Doe patient?

484
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,064
My goodness.

485
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,400
He isn't something
a small hospital like this can handle.

486
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,194
Don't waste your time on him.

487
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,321
I suggest you transfer him
to a bigger hospital.

488
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:03,366
It doesn't matter
how big or small a hospital is.

489
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,743
It's the surgeon that matters.

490
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,745
I'm just worried that it might go wrong.

491
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,873
What will happen if we operate
without the guardian's consent

492
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,834
and the operation doesn't go well?

493
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,420
It's not like we can ask you to take

494
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,839
full responsibility and resign.

495
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:27,974
Excuse me.

496
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:32,562
According to
the Emergency Medical Service Act,

497
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,982
in case the emergency patient
is not capable of making decisions

498
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,317
and there is no a guardian to ask,

499
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,403
an exception is made to ask for consent.

500
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:48,828
I'm just saying.

501
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,416
Hey. Did you hear that?

502
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,338
It's the law.

503
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,009
What should we do?

504
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:06,012
Move him to the operating room.
Can you set the place up?

505
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:07,138
Okay.

506
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,519
-Do In-beom, was it?
-Yes.

507
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,563
You will perform the surgery.
Dr. Kang is the assistant.

508
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,273
Why am I the assistant?

509
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,399
What are you saying?

510
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,985
Are you not up for it?
Suit yourself, then.

511
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,779
Can I fill in his spot?

512
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:25,448
You should help them treat
the cardiac arrest patient.

513
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,993
I'll treat the spine. That will be all.

514
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,792
Did you see that?

515
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,502
He's like that.

516
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,172
The smell of human blood
makes him go crazy.

517
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,674
Like a mad man.

518
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:45,343
Let's move the patient, Mr. Park.

519
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:46,427
Yes, Doctor.

520
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,431
Excuse me. Coming through.

521
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,851
Hey. Be careful.

522
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,644
I'm sorry.

523
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,398
What are you doing? Go after Teacher Kim.

524
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:02,652
I can take care of my own business.
I'm not a kid, you know.

525
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,492
You're one to hold grudges.

526
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,537
Are men all like that, Mr. Park?

527
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,746
I'm not sure.

528
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,295
Gosh.

529
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,298
Excuse me.

530
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,051
Watch where you're going.

531
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:31,723
Are you blind or something?

532
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,397
Gosh.

533
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:46,362
It's waterproofed. Bandage up your hand.

534
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:50,033
You can't go in the operating room
with an open wound.

535
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,953
Did I do something wrong to deserve this?

536
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,749
I won't know if you don't tell me.

537
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,334
What don't you like about me?

538
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,920
Your very existence.

539
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,130
Satisfied?

540
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,007
Hold on.

541
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:07,842
Why would you say that?

542
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,261
Did I do something wrong?

543
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,430
-Let go of me.
-Tell me.

544
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:15,183
Why don't you like my very existence?

545
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,895
Are you asking because you don't know?

546
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,314
Is there something I should be aware of?

547
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:26,152
Are you playing innocent
or just plain rude?

548
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,029
What are you talking about?

549
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:29,989
I understand.

550
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,284
Even when your dad is
the president of Geosan Medical Center,

551
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,745
you wouldn't want other people knowing

552
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,916
that you're born out of wedlock, right?

553
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,712
What?

554
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,298
It's okay. I understand.

555
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:49,592
I'll pretend to understand.

556
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:54,013
So stop bothering me from now on.

557
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,022
Born out of wedlock?

558
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,066
Who?

559
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:06,943
Me?

560
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,029
What?

561
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,157
Does he think...

562
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,213
Don't use your fist when you
get in a fight in the future.

563
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:33,177
If you really feel like
beating someone up, just kick him.

564
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,846
Or you could just take the beating.

565
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,222
Why me?

566
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:41,185
-What are you talking about?
-You had me come down here.

567
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,646
And now you're asking me
to perform a surgery.

568
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,482
Why? Do you think I'm trying to use you

569
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,861
to get back at your father?

570
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,529
Aren't you?

571
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,907
Stop your nonsense
and focus on the operation.

572
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,966
Where's Dr. Kang? Why isn't he here?

573
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,062
Are you okay?

574
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:07,730
I'm sorry.

575
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,947
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

576
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,255
Page Dr. Kang again.

577
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,423
-Okay.
-There's no need.

578
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,677
I'll be the assistant today.

579
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,851
Teacher Kim as an assistant?

580
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:45,935
Teacher Kim.

581
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,274
He's here. Dr. Kang.

582
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,693
Sorry I'm late.

583
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,237
Get out of here. We don't need you here.

584
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,909
-Teacher Kim.
-I said, we don't need you here.

585
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,582
Let's get started.

586
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,042
-Teacher Kim.
-Show me what you've got.

587
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,879
Let's see how good you are.

588
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,381
Commencing operation.

589
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,175
Scalpel.

590
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:31,731
Bovie.

591
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,326
Focus.

592
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,494
Okay.

593
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,122
His heart is back,

594
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,708
but I don't think he will wake up.

595
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,961
Even if he does,
he won't be able to live normally.

596
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,757
-What about his brain?
-There is no hypoxic damage.

597
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,675
HYPOXIC BRAIN DAMAGE:
BRAIN DAMAGE FROM LOW OXYGEN

598
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,677
If his brain is fine,

599
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,472
-shouldn't you try TTM?
-TTM?

600
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,558
That's too expensive. It won't be easy.

601
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,519
I'll talk to his wife.

602
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:12,897
What?

603
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:16,859
-Targeted temperature management?
-Yes.

604
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:20,863
If one's heart stops for whatever reason,

605
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:24,325
there is a high chance
it will stop again within 24 hours.

606
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,078
So we performed a blood test
and a brain CT scan

607
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,829
to find out why it stopped.

608
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,164
A brain CT scan?

609
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:33,334
Isn't that expensive?

610
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,086
Mom, what are you saying?

611
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,504
These are the necessary procedures.

612
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,005
And the result showed

613
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,092
he didn't have much brain damage.

614
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,052
There is something

615
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,346
called targeted temperature management.

616
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:48,641
We keep the patient's body temperature
lower than normal

617
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,143
to prevent further brain damage.

618
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:54,563
Will he wake up if we do this treatment?

619
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,068
There is no guarantee.

620
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,404
But to speak with numbers,

621
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:05,032
when someone's heart stops
outside of a hospital,

622
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:08,244
only 4 out of 100 survive.

623
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:09,954
Among them,

624
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:14,458
only one out of the four
can carry on a normal life.

625
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,211
My goodness.

626
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,547
What if we do this treatment?

627
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,216
The chances are twice as high.

628
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,801
We'll do it.

629
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,428
The problem is

630
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,179
the cost.

631
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,391
How much does it cost?

632
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:33,894
The cost of just
the materials is 1.6 million won.

633
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:39,233
We are actually very poor.

634
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:43,404
We are eligible for medical care type one.

635
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:47,283
But the materials of this treatment
aren't approved by the medical care.

636
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,952
You won't be covered for these.

637
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,540
You have to pay this.

638
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,044
What do we do?

639
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,463
What are we going to do?

640
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:03,215
Please perform the treatment.

641
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:06,260
-Seon-hwa, please.
-Mom, don't worry.

642
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,721
I'll find that money.

643
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:11,098
We probably have a lot to pay as of now.

644
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,308
Mom.

645
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:16,395
Dad became like this
after giving his everything for us.

646
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,691
How sad will his life be
if we can't do this for him?

647
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,234
Okay.

648
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,072
Doctor, please do your best.

649
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,823
Please save him.

650
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,160
We'll do our best.

651
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,120
No.

652
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,122
That treatment is not insured.

653
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,499
Exactly.

654
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:38,667
Why is this important treatment
still uninsured?

655
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,378
This isn't a plastic surgery.

656
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,464
I don't know what they do
in those high offices,

657
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,257
but no.

658
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,718
We're spending money
on a patient with no hope.

659
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,261
What if he doesn't wake up?

660
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,389
His chances are only 8 to 100.

661
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,807
Even if the chances are

662
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,476
as low as 1 to 100,
shouldn't we try everything?

663
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,894
What if it doesn't work?

664
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,522
What will you do
about his family's financial strain?

665
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,732
What if they say that they can't pay?

666
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,527
What will you do
about the damages to the hospital?

667
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,571
That's not for me to worry about.
That's for those high ups.

668
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:08,823
We treat patients,

669
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,741
and people in high offices fix this world.

670
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,910
If you don't like what they do,

671
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:15,871
you should become one of them
to fix this broken world.

672
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,498
A doctor doesn't have the time for that.

673
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,208
Someone like you should step up, Mr. Jang.

674
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,919
I'm Manager Jang, not Mr. Jang, Dr. Yun.

675
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,423
I've been promoted
as a manger as of today.

676
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,550
Really? Congratulations.

677
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:28,676
Thank you.

678
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:32,763
I will treat him, okay?

679
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:33,931
No way.

680
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,850
Never. Not in this life.

681
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,561
-Mr. Jang.
-Manager. I'm Manager Jang.

682
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,980
I'm sorry, Manager Jang.

683
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,108
We have police officers here.

684
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,819
I think they are here
for that stabbed patient.

685
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:47,945
Okay.

686
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:50,489
No. Understood?

687
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,621
Mr. Jang, I mean, Manager Jang!

688
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,999
Darn it.

689
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,587
-Let's do this.
-Are we really doing this?

690
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,881
Do you trust my instinct?

691
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:10,050
I have a strong feeling
that he will wake up. Let's do it.

692
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:13,471
Will you take the responsibility
if something goes wrong?

693
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,264
Will you do this?

694
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,765
Thank you very much.

695
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,476
I've just been called.

696
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,645
-Thanks!
-Hey.

697
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,022
Seo-jeong!

698
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:24,899
That Crazy Whale.

699
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:28,110
I knew I should have never met you again.

700
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,404
Where is this place?

701
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,198
Who am I?

702
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:33,824
Darn it.

703
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,457
Miss.

704
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,210
Shouldn't you be taking care of me?

705
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,294
What's his case?

706
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:48,547
I'm not sure. He's asking us
to give him a vitamin IV.

707
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:50,049
We're already busy enough.

708
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,259
-Is it him?
-Yes.

709
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:09,735
Yes, it's me.

710
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,114
He's in a surgery right now.

711
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:19,495
Jeez. Don't worry about it.

712
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:22,206
I'll take care of this.

713
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,667
Make some soup, will you?

714
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,085
Make sure you put in beef.

715
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,586
Okay.

716
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,468
Sir, how are you doing?

717
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,136
Bad.

718
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:37,846
Why?

719
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,229
You look okay.

720
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:46,814
You can go home.

721
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:47,898
Be quiet.

722
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:49,942
Give me some IV.

723
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:52,695
Don't you have them
with vitamin A, B, C, D, E, F, and G?

724
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,905
Come on, get them on me.

725
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,198
Let me fill up on my vitamins.

726
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:00,786
If you want nutritional IV,
go to the outpatient clinic.

727
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,915
You are awfully talkative.

728
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,043
Just put me on IV
if you don't want to die.

729
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:12,089
You're the one who should leave
while I'm still nice.

730
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,133
If you don't, I'll call the police.

731
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:15,301
Do you want them here?

732
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:23,100
-Do you really want to die?
-No way.

733
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:24,351
I'd like to live a long life.

734
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,353
-Mr. Gu.
-Yes.

735
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:27,646
My gosh.

736
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,232
He's leaving. Help him.

737
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:33,777
Who is this Mr. Gu?

738
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:51,170
Why are you here?

739
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,963
Is the surgery over?

740
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:56,091
-I was kicked out.
-Kicked out? Who kicked you out?

741
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,845
Who would kick me
out of the operating room?

742
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:02,181
Hey.

743
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:05,768
You shouldn't walk out like this.
You should have stayed.

744
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:07,811
Let me see that.

745
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,316
Teacher Kim always yells
and embarrasses everyone.

746
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,653
I thought you would be used to him by now.

747
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:18,197
That kind of a surgery is so rare.

748
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,199
It would've helped you if you stuck around

749
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:22,993
to just watch what he does.
Isn't that right?

750
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,790
Go out with me, Seo-jeong.

751
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,004
What are you saying?

752
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,299
I'll forget

753
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,219
about how you called me
a kid and a teenager.

754
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,679
Go out with me.

755
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:52,022
You can't speak to me like this.

756
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,899
You're very bold.

757
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,151
Is that a no?

758
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:57,945
Forget about it.

759
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,988
Go back to the operating room

760
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:02,783
and tell him that you are sorry
no matter what he says.

761
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,618
Tell him that you'll do your best

762
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:07,746
even if all you do is assisting him.

763
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,540
The third time's a charm.

764
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,543
I'll ask you out two more times.

765
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,421
So think about it.

766
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,507
You did not listen
to anything I said, did you?

767
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,260
Goodbye, then.

768
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:31,061
One of them is asking me out all the time,

769
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,897
and the other one is caught up
in a family affair.

770
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,692
My life became so tiring.

771
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:05,179
Things got very annoying
thanks to that weird girl.

772
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:09,183
What a witch.

773
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,696
Hey.

774
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:28,535
Yes?

775
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:36,877
Do you have a lighter?

776
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,088
I don't smoke.

777
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:45,719
It's a non-smoking area.

778
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,893
That doctor is such a jerk.

779
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,657
Where is Mr. Jang?

780
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,368
He stepped out with the police officers.

781
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:11,453
-The police were here?
-Yes.

782
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,831
The patient who was stabbed
with a knife. Remember?

783
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:18,126
They're saying he got involved
with gangsters.

784
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:25,676
Are you blind or something?

785
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:27,594
He's a stabbed patient.

786
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,137
He was stabbed five times in his stomach,

787
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,265
and there is a knife blade stuck
in the TL junction.

788
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,981
Where are Mr. Jang
and the police officers?

789
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,357
They're at the emergency room.

790
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,826
Where on earth are they?

791
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:56,039
Dr. Kang, what are you doing here?

792
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:57,916
Mr. Jang.

793
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,836
As of today, I'm the manager.
I've been promoted.

794
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:02,879
Where are the police officers?

795
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,840
What? They already left.

796
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:06,341
Do you have something to tell them?

797
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:10,846
I think a gangster came into our hospital.

798
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:12,723
A gangster?

799
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,850
Do you remember the stabbed patient?

800
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,269
The police said he might be
involved with gangsters.

801
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:19,646
-Yes. So what?
-I just saw this man

802
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:23,525
with something like a sickle
wrapped in papers in the bathroom.

803
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:28,488
Ask the police to come back
and tell all the staff members.

804
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:29,948
I'll go to the operating room.

805
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,325
-Okay.
-Okay.

806
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:40,542
Hello? Is this the police?
I'm calling from Doldam Hospital.

807
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,588
Dr. Song, it's me again.

808
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:49,217
It seems like a lot happens
in this hospital.

809
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,679
They got involved
with gangsters this time.

810
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,932
RESTRICTED AREA
OPERATING ROOM

811
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,062
Who are you looking for?

812
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:01,688
Where is Dr. Yun?

813
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,358
She's in the hybrid room with a patient.

814
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,113
I see.

815
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,159
I think a suspicious man is
in our hospital now.

816
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:16,161
Please protect everyone
in the emergency room.

817
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:19,456
Okay. Mr. Jang... I mean,
Manager Jang already told me.

818
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,625
-Please don't worry.
-Thank you.

819
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,754
-I'm counting on you.
-Okay.

820
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:37,891
Hurry up and find the man.

821
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,394
Have you seen a man with a weapon?

822
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,020
Please stay calm.

823
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,149
Come out.

824
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,902
Come in. Hurry.

825
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:53,824
Search the room in every corner.

826
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:19,933
I think it's the small bowel.

827
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:21,143
Irrigation.

828
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:24,771
Suction.

829
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:26,606
Pad.

830
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,944
Bring five more packed RBCs.

831
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:32,070
Yes, Doctor.

832
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:35,407
-How is his condition?
-Good so far.

833
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,494
I found the bleeding point.

834
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:42,831
Hemostatic forceps.

835
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,005
Forceps to tie it.

836
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:07,564
Dr. Kang.

837
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:09,274
What are you doing here?

838
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:11,401
I told you to leave.
Why did you come back?

839
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:12,652
We have an emergency.

840
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,697
Emergency? What do you mean?

841
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:19,367
I assume that the gangster
who hurt this patient is in our hospital.

842
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:20,619
Why?

843
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:24,039
Are you afraid that gangster might
barge in here?

844
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,791
You never know.

845
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:28,502
-We should stay alert.
-Forget it. Get out of here now!

846
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:34,716
I'll stay.

847
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:42,808
What? Hey.

848
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:46,394
Even if the gangster comes in here,

849
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,563
you wouldn't be of much help.

850
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:51,066
So just stop bothering me
and get out of here.

851
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:52,651
I'll stay here.

852
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:56,988
Go back and tell him that you are sorry
no matter what he says.

853
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,662
What did I do so wrong?

854
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:10,585
I was late only for a few minutes.
Is it that wrong?

855
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,212
You were late,

856
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:15,590
and you were even preoccupied
when you came in here.

857
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:16,800
I wasn't preoccupied.

858
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:20,762
What were you thinking
after I told you to assist Dr. Do?

859
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:24,266
You were frustrated and upset.
You didn't want to do it.

860
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,518
Should I do this or not?

861
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,645
That was all you thought about.

862
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:33,567
Listen. This isn't your playground.

863
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:37,279
Whether you two fight or whatever,
leave it outside.

864
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:38,697
Once you entered this room,

865
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:41,700
you should've cleared your mind
and focused on the patient.

866
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:44,160
How dare you throw a tantrum

867
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,705
when you started an operation
without a clear mind?

868
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:50,917
Do you think you can do your best
when you're preoccupied?

869
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:56,840
You don't even deserve
to breathe in the air in this room.

870
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:57,966
Get lost.

871
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,398
I stopped the bleeding.

872
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,442
I'll conduct a segmental resection,

873
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,444
and then end-to-end anastomosis.

874
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:20,155
I'll close it up as soon as possible
and move on to the spine.

875
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:21,239
Okay.

876
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:22,574
Babcock forceps.

877
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:40,008
I hope he'll get through this.

878
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:43,386
-Let me ask you something.
-What is it?

879
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,597
You could've ordered
the targeted temperature management.

880
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,641
Why did you try to convince me?

881
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:51,186
It's because he's your patient.

882
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:53,855
No. I think there's some other reason.

883
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,398
What is it? Tell me.

884
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:57,317
There's no other reason.

885
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,527
Why would there be?

886
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,323
I'll go drink some water.

887
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,658
Why all of a sudden?

888
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,328
She seems so suspicious.

889
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:09,996
Doesn't she?

890
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:14,584
She says she's on the double board
for EM and CS,

891
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:18,213
but she behaves passively like an intern.

892
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:27,514
I knew it. Something is off.

893
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:29,599
Don't you agree?

894
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:32,477
I don't know.

895
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:44,948
How could I say
that I'm working as an orderly?

896
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:47,450
No way I'd tell him that.

897
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,745
RESTRICTED AREA
OPERATING ROOM

898
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:53,373
IN OPERATION

899
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,757
I wish I was in there.

900
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:14,561
Where did he hide? Why can't we find him?

901
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:17,981
-Have you found him?
-No, we haven't.

902
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,483
Did you search thoroughly?

903
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,902
Don't you think Dr. Kang was mistaken?

904
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,697
Do you think so? Gosh.

905
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,574
Excuse me.

906
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,118
Are you still here?

907
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,330
He's in there, right?

908
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:38,585
-Excuse me?
-The guy stabbed with a knife.

909
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,423
He's undergoing a surgery
in this room, right?

910
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:45,800
Am I right?

911
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,602
I'll be done after one more stitch.

912
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:57,771
We'll switch the positions once he's done.

913
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:01,483
Dr. Nam, how's he doing?

914
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:03,610
He's better since Dr. Do
stopped the bleeding.

915
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,779
-Prone position?
-Yes, please.

916
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,698
Would he be okay with the pressure
on his abdomen?

917
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:11,117
I think he'll be okay
if we raise his pelvis a little.

918
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,535
-Cut.
-Cutting.

919
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:16,206
-I'm done.
-Okay. Let's switch the positions.

920
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,837
Hey.

921
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:48,446
Are you ready?

922
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:50,865
Okay.

923
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,457
Seo-jeong.

924
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,757
This is ridiculous.

925
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:09,342
Hey.

926
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,262
How dare you come in here
looking like that?

927
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:15,890
I'm sorry, Doctor.

928
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:20,728
It's not that I wanted to come in here.

929
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,783
I'm sorry.

930
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,118
I'm so sorry.

931
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,082
Get in there slowly.

932
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,043
Walk slowly.

933
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:49,716
You might get a cut on your neck.

934
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,301
You.

935
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:53,887
Step back. Now.

936
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:57,682
Seo-jeong, are you all right?

937
00:57:57,765 --> 00:57:58,892
I'm sorry.

938
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:03,521
Who are you?

939
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:07,150
Who are you and why are you
doing this in the operating room?

940
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,943
Who is the leader?

941
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,949
Who gives orders in this operating room?

942
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:18,578
That's me.

943
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:25,793
What's the matter?

944
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:30,048
Stop the operation right now.

945
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,134
If you don't stop it right now,

946
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:35,261
I will kill this woman.

947
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:42,852
Get off the patient right now!

948
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:44,479
No!

949
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:53,112
