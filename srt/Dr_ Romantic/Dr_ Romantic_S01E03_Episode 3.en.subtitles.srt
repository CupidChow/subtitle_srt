1
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,330
Her wound is small but deep.

2
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,625
An artery, a nerve, and two tendons.

3
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:46,004
Three tendons. We have to put
five together. Have you done this?

4
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,383
Have you?

5
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:54,220
No, I've only seen a video.

6
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,056
It's my first time.

7
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:59,225
If you make a single mistake,

8
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,187
I'll cut off your wrist
and give it to Seo-jeong.

9
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:03,813
Understand?

10
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,398
Let's begin.

11
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,233
Mosquito.

12
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,573
We will perform a dissection
for the next five minutes.

13
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,743
I will operate on her
for neurological rehabilitation,

14
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,037
arterial reconstruction,
and tenorrhaphy within 30 minutes.

15
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:22,082
Is that even possible?

16
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:23,708
Hook.

17
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,127
Hold this.

18
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:27,712
Suction tip.

19
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,055
Partial median nerve and radial artery.

20
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,681
Flexor pollicis longus
flexor carpri radialis

21
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,974
and palmaris longus complete.

22
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,434
Is he really going to do everything

23
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,061
without any additional incision?

24
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,858
The 10,000-hour rule.

25
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,153
It says if you work on something
for 3 hours a day for 10 years,

26
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,114
you will become an expert.

27
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,699
It sounds somewhat plausible.

28
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,201
If so,

29
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,412
how long will it take you
to become a specialist?

30
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,957
It will take 20 hours a day for 11 years

31
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,084
which is about 80,300 hours in total.

32
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:10,880
You will only become a specialist
after spending 80,000 hours in

33
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,465
studying and slaving as a resident.

34
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,927
You'll also have to pass the board exam.

35
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,305
You must try all your best
so that you can complete it in 11 years.

36
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,349
However...

37
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,978
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

38
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,729
I didn't spend my entire life

39
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,649
studying, practicing,

40
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,276
and dissecting to get stuck here

41
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,236
in some small hospital

42
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,114
in the countryside.

43
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,782
Things are still unsettled.

44
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:41,744
So what are you getting at?

45
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,788
That's why I'm still anxious
about the future.

46
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,331
No matter what happens,

47
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,002
I'm going back to Geosan Medical Center.

48
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,921
Whatever happens,

49
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,049
I will go back to where I belong.

50
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,259
That's how I felt.

51
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,263
We have five minutes left on tourniquet.

52
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,390
TOURNIQUET:
A DEVICE USED TO CONTROL BLOOD FLOW

53
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,186
I will start arterial reconstruction
right away.

54
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,229
Loupe.

55
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:12,942
Jeweler.

56
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,320
Nylon number eight.

57
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,496
The suture is so thin that you can't
even see it with the naked eye.

58
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,338
But

59
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,381
he's being unbelievably fast.

60
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,051
Who

61
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,303
on earth is he?

62
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:41,721
Dr. Kang.

63
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,556
Cut.

64
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,939
Do you want me to cut your wrist off?

65
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:53,191
Cut.

66
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,030
Cut.

67
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,328
Cut.

68
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,082
Cut.

69
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,837
-We have 20 minutes left.
-Cut.

70
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,885
I will start neurological
rehabilitation immediately.

71
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,179
I will perform tenorrhaphy
at the same time.

72
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,223
TENORRHAPHY: SUTURE OF A TENDON

73
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,017
Stay focused.

74
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,523
Cut.

75
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,359
Cut.

76
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,404
Cut.

77
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,533
For the next five minutes,

78
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,410
I'll perform tenorrhaphy of tendon.

79
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,246
-What? Within five minutes?
-Let's start.

80
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:54,544
Needle.

81
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,339
To the right.

82
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,514
That's not it. Stretch it upwards.

83
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:19,986
It's been five minutes.

84
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,534
Okay.

85
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,748
We have two minutes left.

86
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,335
Cut.

87
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:42,925
Cut.

88
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,139
He's fast.

89
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,475
-Cut.
-He's unbelievably fast.

90
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:51,601
We have one minute left.

91
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:55,938
Cut.

92
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,650
Suction.

93
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,404
Suction.

94
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,459
Cut.

95
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,091
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,678
We have 19 seconds left.

97
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:32,683
Cut.

98
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,018
Cut.

99
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,355
The nurse prepares everything

100
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,358
in advance as if she knows
what he'll do in the next step.

101
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,401
Everyone in this operating room

102
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,571
is working in perfect order without
making any unnecessary moves.

103
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,658
-Time's up.
-Cut.

104
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:50,868
Tourniquet off.

105
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,589
-What about bleeding?
-There isn't.

106
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,509
The vital sign is 100 over 70.
The oxygen saturation is stable.

107
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:09,971
Okay.

108
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,741
Close it up. You can do that much, right?

109
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,120
It's upsetting.

110
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,248
Good work.

111
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,881
But I couldn't say anything to him.

112
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,633
His operation

113
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,720
was the most perfect one that
I have ever witnessed in my life.

114
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,140
I was

115
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:58,436
like a fool more than ever.

116
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,776
I'm okay.

117
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:07,945
I'm fine.

118
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,411
Damn it.

119
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,351
Yes?

120
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:41,604
We finished up on Dr. Yun
and moved her to the ICU.

121
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,316
-Okay.
-About Dr. Kang...

122
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,278
Well, he seems totally lost.

123
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,405
Okay. I'll do that.

124
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,413
Teacher Kim must have pushed him so hard.

125
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,709
He just did everything as usual.

126
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,169
You know his style, right?

127
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,712
And just like other doctors,

128
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,548
this one will leave, too.

129
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:13,219
He'll also curse Teacher Kim
just like the others.

130
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:29,860
I need an explanation.

131
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,115
Who on earth are you?

132
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,783
What are you talking about?

133
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,744
I just don't get this.

134
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,372
-Get what?
-The man who tried to cut

135
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,748
my wrist off at a casino

136
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,543
turns out to be a chief surgeon
stuck in the ER.

137
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,336
My private life and hobbies

138
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,839
are none of your business.

139
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,216
The operation in the afternoon
was definitely a general surgery.

140
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,720
But the angiorrhaphy was
way too professional

141
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,722
for a general surgeon.

142
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,724
Are you complaining about how good I am?

143
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,184
Seriously, what is your area of specialty?

144
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,604
Are you a gambler or an ER doctor?

145
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,147
Or are you a surgeon?

146
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,816
If you are a surgeon, you must be
specialized in a particular field.

147
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,944
Are you a general surgeon?
Are you specialized in blood vessels?

148
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,738
What is your main area of field?

149
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,532
Saving lives.

150
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,534
That's what I'm specialized in.

151
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,037
Don't play games with me.

152
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,456
I'm asking very seriously.

153
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,083
Are you sure it's not because
you're ashamed of yourself?

154
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,376
What do you mean?

155
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,629
You were embarrassed of yourself
in the operating room.

156
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:34,634
That's not all, right? You're a doctor,

157
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:39,013
but you wasted your time
at a casino bar early in the evening.

158
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,600
You tried to use a defibrillator

159
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,685
on a patient with dyspnea, too.

160
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,524
What do they do
in university hospitals these days?

161
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,278
How do they teach their medical students?

162
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,572
Don't patronize me.

163
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,367
I passed the board exam
with the highest score in the country.

164
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,913
That's exactly my point.
What good is it when you can't even tell

165
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,748
the difference between

166
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,334
cut and suction in the operating room?

167
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,794
There wasn't anything wrong with me.

168
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,338
Your hands were just way too fast.

169
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,256
Do you know why

170
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,177
surgeons wear masks in the operating room?

171
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,638
It's to prevent contamination.

172
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,473
No. It's to keep the mouth shut.

173
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,519
It's to keep the mouth shut so that
they can speak with their hands.

174
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,730
Don't make an excuse for yourself

175
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,816
in front of a patient who is
on an operating table.

176
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,734
Don't try to rationalize yourself.

177
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,153
Surgeons don't get second chances.

178
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:39,448
You were the one who was clumsy
in the operating room.

179
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,200
Do you get that?

180
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,622
You didn't answer my question.

181
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,257
I asked you what you really are.

182
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,677
You little brat...

183
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,648
I'm the teacher.

184
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:14,942
Teacher...

185
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:17,862
Kim.

186
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:20,823
What?

187
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,325
That's me.

188
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,287
Dr. Kim. In other words, I'm Teacher Kim.

189
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,164
All right?

190
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:44,054
Did you hear what Dr. Kang just said?

191
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,016
He passed the board exam
with the highest score in the country.

192
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,602
I heard that. Why?

193
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,939
I see.

194
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,587
Strange people.

195
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,135
And a strange doctor.

196
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:27,097
This is Search Team Three.

197
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,141
We're at Doldam Hospital.

198
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,602
We found a vehicle
of suspected hit-and-run.

199
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,896
Strange hospital.

200
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:37,441
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

201
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,109
What are you doing...

202
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,404
in this strange place?

203
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,784
What were you doing here...

204
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,913
for the last five years?

205
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,774
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

206
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,591
No, Seo-jeong!

207
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,142
What?

208
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,268
Did you say Seo-jeong?

209
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,605
Are you talking about Yun Seo-jeong
who disappeared five years ago?

210
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,273
Are you saying
that the Crazy Whale is there?

211
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,234
Yes, she is.

212
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,157
This is such big news.
So how is she doing there?

213
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,075
Is she married? Does she have kids?

214
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,243
What?

215
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,412
She's preparing
for the double board certification? Why?

216
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:16,624
I don't know why
she's wasting her time like that.

217
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:17,917
No.

218
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,753
I can't put her on right now.

219
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,963
By the way,

220
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,383
can you find out about
someone called Teacher Kim?

221
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,719
What? Teacher Kim?

222
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,179
What's that? Is that a name?

223
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:34,350
I don't know for certain.
Everyone calls him like that.

224
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,769
He's a chief surgeon here
at Doldam Hospital.

225
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,813
Please find about his real name,
which school he went to,

226
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,273
and what his field of specialty is.

227
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,984
Also, I want to know
what he's doing here at Doldam--

228
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,821
In-su. It's me, Seo-jeong.

229
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,532
Seo-jeong?

230
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,953
Hey, Crazy Whale! Are you alive?

231
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,997
Kang Dong-ju has no idea
what he's talking about.

232
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,499
Forget what he said.

233
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,834
Why didn't you call me?

234
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,211
Hello?

235
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:03,879
Hello?

236
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,967
My gosh, Crazy Whale.

237
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,218
She hasn't changed a bit.

238
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,261
Who's the Crazy Whale?

239
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,139
Her name is Yun Seo-jeong.

240
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,350
You probably heard of her

241
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,936
as the Queen of Forefinger.

242
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,105
She used to be the legend of ER.

243
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,565
-She must have been skilled.
-Of course.

244
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,235
She used to be the ace of our department,

245
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,320
but she disappeared
after she had a car accident.

246
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,990
Anyway, she's been at
Doldam Hospital all this time.

247
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:31,991
Doldam Hospital?

248
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:35,494
It's the place where Kang Dong-ju
got sent off to.

249
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,745
The one in Jeongseon.

250
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,001
I'm not saying that the president
did anything wrong.

251
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,837
He probably deserved it.

252
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,006
Have you heard of someone
called Teacher Kim?

253
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,258
No, right?

254
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,260
Well, I should ask someone else.

255
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,095
I think I'll ask Dr. Ahn.

256
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,141
Doldam Hospital.

257
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,310
What are you doing here?

258
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,104
I'll ask you the same thing.

259
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,481
Are you spying on him now?

260
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,734
Why do you want to find
about his background?

261
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:07,943
What do you need it for?

262
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,572
You shouldn't be walking around.
Don't you know about that?

263
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:14,199
Your artery, nerve, and three tendons
were damaged.

264
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,578
Although the operation was successful,

265
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,329
you still need to take some rest.

266
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:24,251
Don't ever try to question him.

267
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,128
Don't cause any trouble.

268
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,133
You may get infected
with the slightest touch,

269
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,510
and that may lead to an artery blockage.

270
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,596
I'm telling you as your doctor.

271
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,599
Please return to your bed
without complicating the situation.

272
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,352
You're the one who's complicating
the situation. Don't you get it?

273
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,398
Do you know how hard
I worked for the last five years?

274
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:50,360
Do you know how hard I worked
to return to this place?

275
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:58,786
Forget it.

276
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,747
Let me ask you for a favor.

277
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,959
I'm not sure how long you'll stay here,

278
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,879
but let's please treat each other
like we're strangers.

279
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,007
Don't talk to me unless
it's work-related, okay?

280
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,012
-Seo-jeong.
-Please don't talk to me, Dr. Kang.

281
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,849
And

282
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,186
stop prying into
Teacher Kim's private affairs.

283
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,190
He's not someone you can do that to.

284
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,775
Do you get it?

285
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,113
Do you like him?

286
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,369
Is that why you were here

287
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,454
for the last five years? Is that it?

288
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,167
You're insane.

289
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,220
My gosh.

290
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,806
-He's insane.
-Hey, Dr. Yun.

291
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,267
-How's your wrist?
-Completely insane.

292
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:08,814
Me?

293
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:12,734
You're insane. You're crazy.

294
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,113
Why did you ask her that?

295
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,407
I'm so embarrassed.

296
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,286
This is embarrassing. So stupid.

297
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,454
Darn it.

298
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,083
You must make Dr. Kang stay
no matter what.

299
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,752
What are we missing
here at Doldam Hospital?

300
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,797
Money, equipment, and doctors.

301
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,049
-Everything.
-You're right.

302
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,509
A total mess.

303
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,430
That is our reality.

304
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,808
We need Dr. Kang

305
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,895
to overcome this reality.

306
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,439
You said he would leave
in less than a week.

307
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,317
He won't even last a week.
I'll bet 50,000 won.

308
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,819
Wait. Was it three days?

309
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,447
I'll bet 100,000 won.
He'll leave in 3 days for certain.

310
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:04,036
I didn't know who he was back then.

311
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,164
Now I know

312
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:11,126
that he passed the board exam
with the highest score in the country.

313
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,003
He's like a jewel to us.

314
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,546
We can't just let him go.

315
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,507
The important thing is

316
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,009
his willingness.

317
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,385
I have heard

318
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,638
that he wishes to leave

319
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,058
this dreaded hospital as soon as possible.

320
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,100
See?

321
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:30,103
That's why we should do
something to keep him here.

322
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,272
He's the top of his class,

323
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,358
good looking, and young.

324
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,069
If we just let him stand at the entrance,

325
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,196
people around the area,

326
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:43,450
especially the ladies,
will go crazy about him.

327
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,036
I can't believe what you said just now.

328
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,412
It was really awful.

329
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,332
Hospitals are all about providing
services nowadays.

330
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,709
The doctors

331
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,795
at our hospital are

332
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,588
too old.

333
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,385
What do you think, Ms. Oh?

334
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,222
Shouldn't we ask
for Teacher Kim's opinion?

335
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:07,933
Teacher Kim can do his own thing.

336
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:11,311
Don't you think it's about time
to have a normal doctor?

337
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,190
-In that case...
-Yes, President Yeo.

338
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,110
-First,
-Yes?

339
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,612
let's hear from Teacher Kim.

340
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,260
Can you do a checkup?

341
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,162
He's not here yet.

342
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,123
I mean Teacher Kim.

343
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:17,919
I see.

344
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,340
Did you have lunch?

345
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,549
It's Friday.

346
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:25,218
Of course I ate. I ate twice as much.

347
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,554
-Check this again.
-Okay.

348
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,599
Are you allowed to walk around?

349
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,434
Did your doctor approve?

350
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,102
It's Friday.

351
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,021
I couldn't just sit around.

352
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,316
I mean, I'm on the board
for emergency surgeries.

353
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,411
This is Doldam Hospital Emergency Room.

354
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,288
Yes. I'll get it ready.

355
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,708
It's a motorcycle accident.
Five patients will arrive in five minutes.

356
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,005
All right.

357
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,008
He had a motorcycle accident.

358
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,010
There's no external bleeding,
but he's unconscious.

359
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,971
Blood pressure is 100 over 70.
Other 4 just have minor scratches.

360
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,264
We'll begin with the intubation.

361
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,766
Set up IV lines and execute a full drop.

362
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,559
Stick two pints of
emergency pack RBC on him.

363
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,826
He's a hit-and-run driver.

364
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,121
The guy who drove into

365
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,330
your car.

366
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:39,000
He ran away after hitting
two middle school students.

367
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,585
Don't worry.

368
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,671
I will talk to the insurance company

369
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,841
and make sure the expenses
for your car are fully paid.

370
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,175
Do you want some?

371
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,471
No, thanks. I don't like juice.

372
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,308
Is that so?

373
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,395
MOM

374
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:05,986
Doctor.

375
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:09,156
It's a call from the ER for a patient
with car accident injuries.

376
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,240
Okay.

377
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,127
My dear Dr. Kang doesn't like

378
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,004
juice that much.

379
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:28,466
He doesn't like to answer
his mom's call, either.

380
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,313
It's hemoperitoneum.

381
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,856
He needs a surgery now. Can you do it?

382
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,025
-Is his guardian here?
-On their way.

383
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,484
They'll be here in an hour.

384
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,694
He needs a surgery now, though.

385
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,613
I'll get his guardian's consent
when they get here

386
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,031
and then begin the surgery.

387
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,242
It'll take them about an hour.

388
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,870
He may get a shock
from excessive bleeding.

389
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,163
We should operate first.

390
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,665
What may go wrong is your wrist.

391
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:04,586
You should go back and get some rest.

392
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,129
I'll take care of him.

393
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,924
No, thanks. I'll take care of it.

394
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:12,385
The general surgeon is the one
who calls the shots. I give the orders.

395
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,055
Wait until his guardian is here,
Seo-jeong.

396
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,016
I mean, Dr. Yun Seo-jeong.

397
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,645
Are you scared that things will go wrong?

398
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,605
I'm sticking to the rules.

399
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:27,192
Doctors are responsible for things
happening in an unconsented surgery.

400
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,444
You should be thinking
about ways to save him

401
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:32,280
instead of being worried
about things that didn't happen.

402
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,282
I've seen too many doctors

403
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,619
who fought and got sued by
family members after they did that.

404
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,246
I'm not even at Geosan Medical Center.

405
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,414
Why would I get myself
into such a trouble?

406
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:43,083
Are you serious?

407
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,503
-You're no fun at all.
-I'm sorry,

408
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,046
but I've always been like this.

409
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,465
I always stick to the rules.

410
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:51,800
I'm not sure if you remember.

411
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,179
I see.

412
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,765
I'm sorry I didn't remember, you jerk.

413
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:04,229
-What? What did you say?
-Forget it.

414
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,147
We're taking him to the operating room.

415
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,485
Let go. This is my patient now.

416
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,821
-My goodness.
-Both of you, stop!

417
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:28,962
Go to the operating room
and tell Dr. Nam to get ready.

418
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,046
Yes, sir.

419
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,173
Not you.

420
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,384
You.

421
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:39,097
What are you doing?
Get the operating room ready.

422
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,059
I will go. I can do it.

423
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,478
No. Get out, Seo-jeong.

424
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,107
I'm fine now. I'm okay.

425
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,150
I can do it.

426
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,277
Get away from this patient now!

427
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,617
According to the Medical Law
Article 8, Clause 1,

428
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:03,121
and the Mental Health Act Article 3,
Clause 1, a mental patient

429
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,331
cannot perform as a doctor.

430
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,793
You have hurt yourself.

431
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,545
I can't let you be with a patient.

432
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,507
You are disqualified
from this hospital as of today.

433
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:20,263
-Teacher Kim.
-I mean what I say.

434
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:23,308
I won't take back my words,
so don't even try.

435
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,310
Get out.

436
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,250
Hey, you.

437
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,128
Go and get the operating room ready.

438
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:53,838
Don't you think it was too harsh?

439
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,509
How could you say she's disqualified?

440
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,594
Mr. Park! Mr. Park!

441
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:01,930
Yes, Doctor.

442
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,641
Tell Dr. Nam to prepare for an operation

443
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,726
and move this patient
to the operating room.

444
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,645
His guardian hasn't arrived yet.

445
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,688
Get the consent over the phone.

446
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:11,940
-Yes, Doctor.
-Good.

447
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,321
Hey.

448
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,324
You should be on call tonight.

449
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:22,742
Pardon?

450
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,662
Didn't you see me kicking out
the emergency medicine specialist?

451
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:28,790
You should fill the position
since the specialist isn't here.

452
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,961
That's nonsense.

453
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,004
Surgeons are never on call
for the emergency room.

454
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,965
I'm not asking for your opinion.

455
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,717
I'm giving you an order.

456
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,885
It seems like you like taking orders.

457
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:44,389
This is a special order I'm giving you
as the head of General Surgery.

458
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,391
So you'll be on call tonight.

459
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,478
Today is Friday, so you should stay alert.

460
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,483
This is ridiculous.

461
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,569
What a jerk.

462
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,992
I'm going to cut the abdomen open now.

463
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,202
Scalpel.

464
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:25,472
You are disqualified
from this hospital as of today.

465
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,339
DR. SONG OF GEOSAN MEDICAL CENTER

466
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,342
Yes, Dr. Song. This is Kang Dong-ju.

467
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,302
Hi. How are you doing?

468
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,806
I'm dying to leave here.

469
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,766
Since you left,

470
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,768
I've been feeling so bad.

471
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:14,687
There are no fellows as good as you
in General Surgery.

472
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,398
I'm playing golf
with President Do right now.

473
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:20,693
Do you think you can join us
for dinner tonight?

474
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,530
Pardon? Did you say tonight?

475
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,073
Yes.

476
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:28,743
Come say hello to him
and beg him to have you back.

477
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:33,665
I'll text you the time and place.

478
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,751
It'd be better if you bring him
a bottle of kaoliang wine.

479
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:37,836
You know what I mean?

480
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,379
Hey, Dr. Song.

481
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,798
I'll be there in a minute.

482
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:44,843
-You must come, okay?
-Wait.

483
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,812
7 P.M., SANJEONGSIK IN JEONGSEON
GANGWON PROVINCE

484
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,817
RECOMMENDED ROUTE
37.7KM, 48 MINUTES

485
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,111
It takes 48 minutes from here.

486
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:07,448
I have to leave at 6 p.m. at the latest.

487
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,743
What should I do?

488
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:15,999
Hello? Okay. I'm on my way.

489
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,918
This is driving me crazy.

490
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,421
I can't believe what just happened.

491
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,132
Please hold him.

492
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,301
This is unbelievable.

493
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,011
Guys, you shouldn't run in the hospital.

494
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,888
We were on a family trip.

495
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,681
Of course, we're in the hospital.

496
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:34,392
What happened?

497
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:35,518
They were on a family trip.

498
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,937
They've been having abdominal pain
since they had lunch.

499
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,316
Are you all right?
Doctor, why are you standing there?

500
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,026
My father is dying!

501
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,861
-Who's in Internal Medicine?
-It's President Yeo.

502
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,863
-Please call him.
-Yes, Doctor. Follow me.

503
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,698
Sir, please lie down for a second.

504
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:51,993
What did you say? You're responsible
for this. Let go of me.

505
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,037
Hey, you!

506
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,788
-I'll be right back.
-Doctor.

507
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,624
It's your fault.

508
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,584
What happened to them?

509
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:03,087
They're car accident patients.
They are arguing over who's at fault.

510
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,051
Please calm down.

511
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,428
Sir, let me check your wound.

512
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,981
Don't be late. Okay?

513
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,195
RESTRICTED AREA

514
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:33,576
It's not as hectic as I expected.

515
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,578
I thought there would be
a long line of patients.

516
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,833
How's the newbie doing?

517
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,377
Do you think he'll be useful?

518
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,544
He's garbage.

519
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,713
That's disappointing.
He looked like a nice person.

520
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:46,923
Hold on. I forgot.

521
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,050
I heard

522
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,010
you told Seo-jeong to leave the hospital.

523
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,846
-Who told you that?
-Myeong-sim did.

524
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,809
-You didn't mean it, right?
-I meant it.

525
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:00,812
I won't let someone deluded like her
be with a patient.

526
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:01,896
Wait.

527
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,648
Hey, where are you going?

528
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,905
Hi, Teacher Kim. I heard you finished
your operation.

529
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,826
Why did you bring that orchid?

530
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,745
This one grew up so beautifully.

531
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,914
I brought it so you can
appreciate it in your office.

532
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,250
Do you have something to say?

533
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,087
Well...

534
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,842
It's about Dr. Yun Seo-jeong.

535
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,887
You're not going to kick her out, are you?

536
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,932
-Who said that?
-Ms. Oh did.

537
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:39,934
You're not serious, are you?

538
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:52,864
Are you stepping out?

539
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,241
Yes, I am.

540
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,618
I'm going out to enjoy my hobby.

541
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,745
But it's Friday.

542
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:01,664
I left the work to Dong-ju.

543
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,499
Still, it's Friday.

544
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,626
Don't you think it'd be difficult
for him to handle alone?

545
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,589
It's not so bad to deal with
too much work sometimes.

546
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,841
He would be able to
build up his experience.

547
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:15,178
Did you really mean

548
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,472
what you told Dr. Yun?

549
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,724
Yes, I meant it.

550
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,560
This time, neither President Yeo nor Do-il

551
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,145
will change my mind.

552
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,272
So you should give up, too.

553
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,076
Right.

554
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:41,871
I'm sure he didn't mean it.

555
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,917
He wouldn't kick me out.

556
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,922
I should implore him again.

557
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,344
I don't mind kneeling down.

558
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,919
Is Mr. Lee Chang-geun's guardian here?

559
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,838
Who is Mr. Lee Chang-geun's guardian?

560
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,923
-Mr. Lee Chang-geun's--
-When is my grandfather's turn?

561
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,341
What's his name?

562
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,851
-It's your fault.
-No, it's your fault, you jerk.

563
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,727
Did you just call me a jerk?

564
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,941
-Take his X-ray.
-Yes, Doctor.

565
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,987
THE VIP HAS ARRIVED

566
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,867
Please lie down slowly.

567
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,119
You're going to take an X-ray.
Please move slowly.

568
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,418
Excuse me. Teacher Kim!
Teacher Kim, where are you going?

569
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,718
May I help you?

570
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:21,971
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

571
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,766
He's the car accident patient, right?

572
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,438
I'm his family. Can I see him briefly?

573
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,774
Please wash your hands with this
and come inside.

574
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,375
This is intensive care unit.

575
00:36:58,758 --> 00:36:59,717
Mom!

576
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,181
No!

577
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,453
You scumbag.

578
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,124
Gosh. What are you doing?

579
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,002
Stop it.

580
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,631
You killed my son.

581
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,716
You don't deserve to be alive.

582
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,677
-I will kill you.
-Go get someone. Hurry.

583
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,762
You can't do this.

584
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,722
Stop it, please.

585
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,350
My son died.

586
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,019
He killed my son.

587
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,813
Ma'am.

588
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,524
You are even worse.

589
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,985
You shouldn't have saved his life.

590
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,237
Why did you save his life?

591
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,031
He is a murderer who killed my son.

592
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:07,159
Why did you save his life?
It's all your fault.

593
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,204
Let go of me, please.

594
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,873
Get off me.

595
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,917
Let go of me.

596
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:18,004
Why did you save his life?
He killed my son.

597
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,964
I will kill you all.

598
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,508
I will kill everyone.

599
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,761
-I will kill him.
-Wait.

600
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:29,765
Ma'am. There seems to be
a misunderstanding.

601
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,977
He's not the one
who hit your son with a car.

602
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,940
The hit-and-run driver was moved
to a patient's room a while ago.

603
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,066
This patient was...

604
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,446
transferred here
because of a motorcycle accident.

605
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:47,366
You almost killed an innocent guy.

606
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,169
Take her out.

607
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,009
-Are you all right?
-I'm okay.

608
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:12,558
-He is fine, thank goodness.
-Dr. Yun!

609
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,855
-How are you feeling?
-I feel much better.

610
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,232
Please wait
until the fluid is fully injected.

611
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,359
Okay.

612
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,366
What should I do?

613
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,826
I should leave now to be there on time.

614
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,509
Don't be late. Okay?

615
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,969
Forget about your pride.

616
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,180
Just think about
going back to Geosan Medical Center.

617
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,557
-Ms. Woo.
-Yes.

618
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,435
Put the metro on bed number eight.

619
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,645
Kang Dong-ju.

620
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,023
You should go.

621
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,359
You should walk out that door right now.

622
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:24,839
We have an emergency patient.

623
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,137
He is a 48-year-old man.

624
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,304
It seems he drank pesticide.

625
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,931
-My goodness.
-Are you all right?

626
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,182
-Dr. Kang.
-My gosh.

627
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,021
-Dr. Kang.
-Wake up!

628
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,273
No.

629
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,567
-Don't look back.
-Wake up!

630
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,611
This is your last chance.

631
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,656
It is your last chance to go back
to Geosan Medical Center.

632
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,616
As soon as I turn around,

633
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:55,619
my life will be ruined.

634
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:05,045
Dr. Kang!

635
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:07,548
Please save my son.

636
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,508
Please save my son.

637
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:12,011
Doctor, please.

638
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,764
Please save my son. Doctor.

639
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,475
Please.

640
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,894
Please save my son.

641
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,271
Please help me.

642
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:25,316
Doctor. Please.

643
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,610
I'm begging you.

644
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,160
Please save my son.

645
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,205
Doctor, please.

646
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,625
Please save my son.

647
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,087
Darn it.

648
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,762
A 48-year-old man drank pesticide
as he was drunk.

649
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,182
-Did you check the bottle?
-It's organophosphate.

650
00:41:58,265 --> 00:41:59,099
Prepare charcoal

651
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,559
and check how many vials of atropine

652
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:01,894
-we have available.
-Yes, Doctor.

653
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:04,396
-Let's move him to the hybrid room.
-Excuse me.

654
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,148
Please wait outside.

655
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,484
-Thank you, Doctor.
-This way, please.

656
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:10,236
He will be all right.

657
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,779
This way, please. He will be fine.

658
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,118
Who else is coming?

659
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,411
In fact,

660
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,580
I asked Dong-ju to come.

661
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,042
It's not that he is competent.

662
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:28,128
But we need more fellow doctors
in General Surgery Department.

663
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:31,757
You know what we're going through now.

664
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,927
Young doctors these days
don't prefer to become a surgeon.

665
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,221
The hospital is full of patients
but lacks fellow doctors.

666
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:39,723
It's not for Kang Dong-ju.

667
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,309
It's for me, President Do.

668
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:45,145
What about the list of
cardiothoracic surgeons

669
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,899
-for the operation on the chairman?
-Please don't worry about it.

670
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:51,360
We have the best cardiothoracic surgeons
for the operation.

671
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:54,363
You know there is a board meeting
in two months, don't you?

672
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:55,656
Of course I do.

673
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:58,826
I will do everything I can
for your second term.

674
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:00,703
Let me pour you a glass.

675
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,288
Please let me express my gratitude.

676
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,046
-How many liters is it?
-It's 7L.

677
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,423
Do you have the result of ABGA?

678
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:13,549
It's here, Doctor.

679
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,719
It's 6.8 pH?

680
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,762
Bring me five ampules
of sodium bicarbonate.

681
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,598
-I will perform the intubation.
-Yes, Doctor.

682
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:25,227
-Thank you for coming here.
-It's my pleasure.

683
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,520
Thank you.

684
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,200
Let me check his heart rhythm.

685
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,286
-I will do it again.
-Okay.

686
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,208
It's ready.

687
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,212
Clear.

688
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:13,233
-The number you have dialed...
-Is he out of his mind?

689
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:19,239
Dong-ju. What do you think you are doing?

690
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,825
It's almost 9 p.m. Why aren't you coming?

691
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,203
Are you in a car accident or something?

692
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,788
Or are you trying to get smart with me?

693
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,334
Are you leaving already?

694
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,461
I'm tired tonight.
I can't stay any longer.

695
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:34,797
Wait, President Do.

696
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,426
Dong-ju, you idiot.

697
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,638
You are doomed. Do you understand?

698
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,603
Please.

699
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,231
Dr. Kang.

700
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,219
You should pronounce him dead.

701
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:24,680
It is

702
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:26,473
9:29 p.m. now.

703
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,769
Why should I?

704
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,839
Your son

705
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:02,468
passed away.

706
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,472
Doctor.

707
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,808
Would you mind speaking
a little bit louder?

708
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:12,936
We were in such a hurry,

709
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,899
and we forgot to bring hearing aids.

710
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,364
I said, your son passed away.

711
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:28,619
What did he say?

712
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:31,330
I can't hear you.

713
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,625
Doctor.

714
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:38,795
I know my son is a bit old,

715
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,466
but he should meet someone nice
and get married.

716
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,636
Please treat him well.

717
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:46,845
Please, Doctor.

718
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,515
Why should I do this?

719
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,893
Your son passed away.

720
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,648
Your son died.

721
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,566
He passed away!

722
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:15,958
Doctor.

723
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:18,835
I want to see

724
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:22,714
him getting married before I die.

725
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:24,508
Please.

726
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:29,721
He's...

727
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:33,559
my one and only son.

728
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,521
Please save him.

729
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:38,689
Please.

730
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,111
I'm sorry.

731
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,593
Why should I...

732
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:10,512
I'm sorry.

733
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,017
How could this...

734
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:18,478
Not like this.

735
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,946
Dong-ju, you idiot.

736
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:30,949
You are doomed. Do you understand?

737
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,411
Press one for the next voice message.

738
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,754
MOM

739
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,804
MOM

740
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:56,767
Hello?

741
00:48:57,142 --> 00:49:00,103
Dong-ju? It's me.

742
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,441
Have you been busy all day?

743
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:06,068
You didn't call me back.

744
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:18,121
It's tough, isn't it?

745
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:02,124
Thanks to Dr. Kang,
this Friday went by smoothly.

746
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:06,628
But still, it was unnecessary
for you to leave the ER

747
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,922
entirely up to him.
You should come back right away.

748
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:11,883
I still have things to take care of.

749
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:14,720
I'll come back as soon as I'm done.

750
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,891
I heard you put up a fight

751
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:03,351
against some lady who caused
a scene at the ICU.

752
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:04,853
With that hand.

753
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:15,322
You don't have a fever.

754
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:23,246
No swelling.

755
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:25,624
No heat sensation.

756
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,335
It's looking better than I anticipated.

757
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,921
What are you doing right now?

758
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:33,548
I'm just checking on my patient.

759
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:36,009
I want a different doctor.
Please get me someone else.

760
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:39,221
There aren't any other doctors
in this place.

761
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,183
Do you want me to call
Teacher Kim for you?

762
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:49,189
That wouldn't go very well, right?

763
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,358
He disqualified you in your face.

764
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,026
What did you just say?

765
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:56,738
I thought you two were very close friends.

766
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:59,157
I guess I was very wrong.

767
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,200
Hey.

768
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:03,745
Why are you here at Doldam Hospital?

769
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:07,290
Why are you in my life again?

770
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,709
I didn't come here because I wanted to.

771
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,837
You just happened to be here
when I got here.

772
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:14,089
Don't you think this is wrong?

773
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,591
You and I

774
00:52:17,133 --> 00:52:18,385
at the same hospital?

775
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:22,055
No, you're wrong.

776
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,683
You're not even working here anymore.

777
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,228
You're such a jerk.

778
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:32,315
Why did you change so much?

779
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,986
I was always like this.

780
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:39,114
Perhaps you don't remember,

781
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:42,033
but I've always been straightforward.

782
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:45,120
Good for you.

783
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,753
Why did you take a sedative?

784
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:03,763
Leave me alone. I'm tired.

785
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,110
I said, get out.

786
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:21,406
I don't want to see you here.
Leave me alone.

787
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:25,452
I missed you.

788
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:33,168
I'm serious.

789
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:12,999
This is Kang Dong-ju.

790
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,253
We have burn patients. Four in total.

791
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:18,922
We need you down here.

792
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:21,091
Burn patients?

793
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,386
Did she say burn patients? How many?

794
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:27,055
Four.

795
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,518
The patients are here.
Please hurry, Dr. Kang.

796
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,399
What are you doing? Get down there.

797
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:43,530
I've never treated a burn patient.

798
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:45,907
What?

799
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,328
One with a first-degree burn
and two with second!

800
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,205
And one with third-degree burn
all over the body.

801
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:54,666
Third-degree goes to the hybrid room
and the rest goes over there.

802
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:55,709
Okay.

803
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,550
Dr. Kang. Please start
with the third-degree burn patient.

804
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,644
What are you doing? Go in there!

805
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:29,034
Secure the airway first.
Start the intubation.

806
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,368
Intubation.

807
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,246
Here.

808
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:36,458
Please.

809
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,336
The trachea is already swollen.

810
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,506
Then perform cricothyroidotomy.

811
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,508
-Prepare for cricothyroidotomy.
-Okay.

812
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,846
-Wait. Give me the tube.
-What do you need the tube for?

813
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,726
Hey. What are you doing?

814
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,144
Kang Dong-ju.

815
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:02,942
Okay.

816
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,360
Fix it to 23cm.

817
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:17,082
That's enough.

818
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,126
Set up IV lines with 2L of hydration.

819
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,045
Set up IV lines with 2L of hydration.

820
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:23,004
Okay.

821
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:23,922
Wait.

822
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:26,007
-Warm saline.
-Please prepare warm saline.

823
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:27,300
Okay.

824
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:31,554
You're doing good so far.
You have to dress the burn wounds.

825
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,556
Don't forget to measure
the area of burn on the back.

826
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,933
Okay.

827
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:35,975
Hold this.

828
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:39,354
Take deep breaths.

829
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:41,856
Please check on the carboxyhemoglobin.

830
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,024
Okay, Doctor.

831
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,656
The patient's saturation is dropping.

832
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,283
It must be a respiratory tract burn.
I'll proceed with the intubation.

833
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:56,871
Move over.

834
00:56:58,581 --> 00:56:59,541
Doctor.

835
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:05,547
What's wrong with your face?

836
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:07,674
Dress the burn wounds.

837
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,552
Where's the third-degree burn patient now?

838
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:13,388
He's in the hybrid room with Dr. Kang.

839
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,597
Are you okay, Teacher Kim?

840
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:18,059
Call the burn center.

841
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:19,936
We need a chopper fast.

842
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:21,312
Okay.

843
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,482
He should be hospitalized
for at least four weeks.

844
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,568
Who did that to him?

845
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:27,694
I wonder.

846
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:34,159
Okay, you're doing well.

847
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,286
What?

848
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:39,956
Dr. Kang.

849
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:43,293
What is it?

850
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:47,130
His blood circulation isn't well.

851
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:48,465
His hand is blue.

852
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:50,341
Burn contracture has begun.

853
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:51,718
Perform the escharotomy immediately.

854
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,430
-Escharotomy?
-Cut open his skin.

855
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,151
What are you doing?

856
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:11,070
If you don't, his skin will shrink
and block his blood circulation.

857
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,198
It'll build into necrosis.

858
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:15,033
You're so frustrating.

859
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:18,328
What's with him?

860
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,423
Teacher Kim.

861
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:39,432
Our Friday night is

862
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:42,101
not over yet.

863
