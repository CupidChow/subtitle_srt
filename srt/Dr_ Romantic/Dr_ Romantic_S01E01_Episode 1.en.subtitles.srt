1
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,076
Times of injustice.

2
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:40,331
Save him. My dad came here first.

3
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,292
Honey.

4
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:44,627
Somebody please help us.

5
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:48,214
My dad got here before him.

6
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,008
Times of discrimination.

7
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,184
Times of grievance and distrust.

8
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:05,023
Mr. Kang Eun-yeong passed away at 8:23pm.

9
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,238
Dad.

10
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,242
Dad.

11
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:17,911
Honey.

12
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,998
The operation was successful.

13
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,751
The senator is fine now.

14
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,712
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

15
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,635
My dad was here first.

16
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,932
My dad got here...

17
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,309
before he did.

18
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,938
My dad got here first.

19
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:46,898
Gosh.

20
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,735
Let go. Let go of me.

21
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,529
My dad was here first.

22
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,824
My dad was here before that man.

23
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,826
You should have saved him first.

24
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,869
My dad was here first. Let go.

25
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,788
Injudicious medical operations

26
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,624
and discrimination against patients

27
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,793
created times of injustice...

28
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:07,794
KANG DONG-JU

29
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,254
...in the medical field.

30
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,464
Why? Why did you do that?

31
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,466
Why do you play with people's lives?

32
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,261
And you call yourself a doctor?

33
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,221
You're not supposed to do that.

34
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:19,806
Hello, is this the police?

35
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,724
This is the emergency room
of Geosan Medical Center.

36
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:23,935
At that moment

37
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,399
a man showed up.

38
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:33,987
My dad died miserably.

39
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:48,751
Let me go.

40
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,257
One.

41
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:56,759
Two.

42
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,803
Three.

43
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,604
Do you hear me?

44
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,563
BU YONG-JU

45
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,861
Do you feel better

46
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,363
after letting it all out?

47
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,993
Why do you care?

48
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,162
Don't be mistaken.

49
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:27,290
Taking it out on others
doesn't mean you took revenge.

50
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,712
No matter how much fuss you make
with your baseball bat,

51
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,299
those people won't even
remember your face.

52
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,679
If you really want revenge,

53
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,101
become a better man than those people.

54
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:52,899
Pay them back with your capability
rather than your rage.

55
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,567
Do you understand?

56
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,947
Unless you change,

57
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,824
nothing will change.

58
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,841
Doctor.

59
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:29,811
Doctor.

60
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,607
Pay them back with your capability
rather than your rage.

61
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,733
Do you understand?

62
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,412
How am I supposed to do that?

63
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,790
I can't.

64
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,168
I'm nothing.

65
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,888
Unless you change,

66
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,099
nothing will change.

67
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,016
EMERGENCY CENTER

68
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:02,070
KANG DONG-JU

69
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,201
Dr. Kang Dong-ju.

70
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,097
SEPTEMBER, 2011

71
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:33,142
Hey, did you hear the news?

72
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,770
I heard one of the new interns
is a complete freak.

73
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:39,440
-A freak?
-He has no respect for his seniors.

74
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,901
He tries to get smart with
the seniors and even be disobedient.

75
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:46,197
In-su said that intern drove him nuts.

76
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,618
They say he was top of his class
while he was in med school

77
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:54,372
and the head of General Surgery Department
has his eyes on him.

78
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,958
Simply put, he's the untouchable.

79
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,585
He's still a mere intern though.

80
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,214
I don't want to.

81
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,757
What?

82
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:06,467
Hey.

83
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,762
How come you never run errands
for your seniors?

84
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,140
I didn't become an intern
to get coffee for you.

85
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,558
Why did you become an intern then?

86
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,018
To save people.

87
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,897
Did you hear that?

88
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,649
An intern saving people?

89
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,695
You should save
your relationship with us first.

90
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,573
You won't save lives if you don't
even listen to your seniors.

91
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:32,493
Please don't put irrelevant subjects
in the same sentence.

92
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,121
Getting coffee and saving lives
are totally irrelevant to each other.

93
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,289
What did you say?

94
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,666
It's the small things
that make who you are.

95
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:42,170
Don't ask me for your coffee
if you know that already.

96
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:48,384
Apart from my assigned tasks,
I won't be your errand boy.

97
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,345
Did you just say errand boy?

98
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,431
-Hey!
-Stop right there!

99
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,515
He's not worth it.

100
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,186
He's the untouchable, remember?
Don't touch him.

101
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,271
Untouchable, my foot.

102
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,231
An accident at a construction site!

103
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,150
Four trauma patients
will arrive in two minutes.

104
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,402
Get Dr. Moon
of General Surgery Department.

105
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,445
Okay.

106
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,161
Bring them inside.

107
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:17,955
This way.

108
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,833
His blood pressure and pulse are stable.

109
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,919
He suffered abrasions
and is complaining of wrist pains.

110
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,545
He says he can't feel his thumb.

111
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,755
-Do you feel anything?
-No.

112
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,048
You can't feel anything?

113
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,966
-Hey, intern.
-Yes?

114
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,218
Maybe it's a push injury.

115
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,678
The circulation is fine,
but the median nerve got compressed.

116
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,013
Use a pad splinter for his arm

117
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,224
and get a wrist series of forearm
AP and lateral view.

118
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,600
Get reduction done quickly.

119
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,559
Okay.

120
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,561
-Doctor Yun, I need you.
-Okay.

121
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,440
I can hardly feel his pulse.

122
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,692
We have to check for
popliteal artery dissection.

123
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,277
Run him through low extremity angiography.

124
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,403
Yes, sir.

125
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,323
Where did all the interns go?

126
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,283
-Here, sir!
-Get your butts over here.

127
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,371
My mom got here first.

128
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:02,250
Doctor Kang, you have to go.

129
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,293
I said, my mom was here first.

130
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,587
My mom is really sick, too.

131
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,724
Can you come check out this patient?
She has difficulty breathing.

132
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:19,976
How much fluids did you inject?

133
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,769
2L so far. Emergency transfusion is ready.

134
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,104
-What about FAST?
-Negative.

135
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,814
There aren't any clear signs of
bleeding focus.

136
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,732
-Doctor Yun.
-How long was he under there?

137
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,652
Getting to the site wasn't easy.
He was rescued after an hour.

138
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,445
Hey, intern. Insert the Foley catheter.

139
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,905
There's a patient who got here first.

140
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,992
She has a history of COPD
and is showing presence of SIRS.

141
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,785
I think it's pneumonia sepsis.

142
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,120
Did you check her vital signs?

143
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,289
It's pretty stable at 100 to 72 but--

144
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,124
Then insert the catheter right now.

145
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,334
We have to check her chest
and run her through ABGA.

146
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,379
Can't you see? This patient's
blood pressure is dropping.

147
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,506
It could be blood poisoning
caused by pneumonia.

148
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,052
-Hey, intern!
-Yes?

149
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,389
You do it. Who does he think he is?

150
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,224
Stop bothering me and get out of my way.

151
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,439
Move aside. It's an emergency patient.

152
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,441
Move slowly.

153
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,441
Doctor, it's Doctor Yun
from the emergency room.

154
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,653
The patient has
abdominal penetrating injury.

155
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:54,862
I'll take the call.

156
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,282
What's going on?

157
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,909
He's a 45-year-old man.

158
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,912
A meter-long rebar
has punctured through his abdomen.

159
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:07,124
A block of concrete
is hanging on one side of the rebar.

160
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,752
Stay focused!

161
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,089
Where is it in his body?

162
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:17,510
It's penetrating from the lower back
to the upper stomach on the left.

163
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,846
-What are his vital signs?
-His blood pressure is normal.

164
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,598
His pulse rate is 130.

165
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,809
There is no massive bleeding though.

166
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,728
Take FAST in case of hemoperitoneum.

167
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,022
Keep his vital signs stable.
I'll remove the rebar.

168
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,273
Okay, Doctor.

169
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,777
You heard me, right?
We finish in 30 minutes.

170
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,737
Stay alert.

171
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,824
-Get IV injections in both arms.
-Okay.

172
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,785
Prepare 2L of saline
and the catheters for C-line and Foley.

173
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:43,869
-Yes, Doctor.
-Yes, Doctor.

174
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,969
Please move out of the way.

175
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,304
-You can't come in.
-Clear the way.

176
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,306
FAST scan is ready.

177
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,273
No!

178
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,869
Doctor Nam.

179
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,454
-Go get gauze and EB now!
-Okay.

180
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,914
His BP is 90 over 60, decreasing rapidly.

181
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,332
Full drop on IV injection.

182
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,877
Get two pints
of packed RBC for emergency transfusion.

183
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,338
-Tell them to bring 20 more packs.
-Okay, Doctor.

184
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,632
-Set up the blood transfusion.
-Okay.

185
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,260
-Please call Doctor Moon!
-Okay.

186
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,724
Doctor, the emergency room called again.

187
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,267
I think you have to answer this.

188
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,852
I'll take it.

189
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:54,148
Doctor, the rebar fell out by accident.

190
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,900
His blood pressure is decreasing rapidly.

191
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,028
Those fools.

192
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:00,905
Where's Doctor Yun?

193
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:02,740
Doctor Yun!

194
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,744
What are you doing?
Doctor Moon is asking for you.

195
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,332
-Doctor Yun.
-Doctor Yun!

196
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,376
Do you hear me?

197
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,754
Get yourself together!

198
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,548
What are you doing?

199
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,803
Yes, Doctor. I'm right here.
Please go ahead.

200
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,472
In ten minutes.

201
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,724
Hang in there.
I'll be there in ten minutes.

202
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,728
Do whatever you can to keep him alive
for ten minutes!

203
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:33,687
Do you understand?

204
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,981
Yes, Doctor.

205
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,692
His blood pressure keeps dropping.

206
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,861
Hey intern, bring the gauze.

207
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:41,946
Okay.

208
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,842
-Bring me the drape and scalpel.
-Okay, Doctor.

209
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,096
Doctor Yun.

210
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,307
-What are you doing?
-His aorta might be damaged.

211
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,726
-Then we don't have time.
-Are you going to do an incision now?

212
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:19,400
If we take more time,
the blood might fill up in the abdomen.

213
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,818
Then it'll be too late.

214
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,278
I'll make the smallest incision.

215
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,904
-Goodness.
-Doctor Yun.

216
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,659
-Scalpel.
-Doctor Yun.

217
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:29,827
I need more gauze.

218
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,506
Gauze.

219
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,786
Doctor Yun.

220
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,581
-Seo-jeong!
-Please!

221
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,168
Be quiet.

222
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:28,052
Is she looking for the artery?

223
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,874
-I found it.
-Did you get it?

224
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:01,877
Yes, I did.

225
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,798
Based on the location, it's not the aorta.

226
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,758
I think it's the splenic artery.

227
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,970
The patient's pulse is becoming stable.

228
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,485
-It's Doctor Moon.
-Seo-jeong, it's Doctor Moon.

229
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,445
What happened?

230
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,822
His vital signs...

231
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,535
are getting stable.

232
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:37,913
What about his bleeding?

233
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,833
There's bleeding from a splenic artery,
but I'm holding it.

234
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,794
What do you mean? With what?

235
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,839
With my forefinger.

236
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,222
That lunatic.

237
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,018
Send him to the operating room now.

238
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,769
Okay, Doctor.

239
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,856
-Let's move him to the operating room.
-Okay.

240
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,066
-Doctor.
-Okay.

241
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,152
-Clear the way.
-Okay.

242
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,113
-Please move out of the way.
-Clear the way!

243
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,197
Move out of the way.

244
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,824
Move.

245
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:16,076
-Please move!
-Make way, please!

246
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,161
Move.

247
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,204
-Please make way.
-Move out of the way.

248
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,956
Please move out of the way.

249
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,184
-Wrap up the rest.
-Okay, Doctor.

250
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,351
Great job, Doctor.

251
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,355
Be careful.

252
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,068
We're coming through.

253
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:02,081
-I'm sorry. There was an incident.
-Forget it.

254
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,957
I'll be in charge from now on.

255
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,586
Good job.

256
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,631
Thank you.

257
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:32,194
Seo-jeong, you were amazing today.

258
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,654
You were awesome.

259
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,115
I was lucky.

260
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,616
Crazy Whale,

261
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,202
here is another nickname for you.

262
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,912
Queen of Forefinger.

263
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,708
Having fun?

264
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,753
What's going on, Doctor?

265
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,423
Why didn't you call me
about the pneumonia sepsis patient?

266
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,845
I had to send a patient
with punctured abdomen to the OR.

267
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,347
I heard that patient came in
after the one with pneumonia.

268
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,726
Her vital signs were stable
and she only had a slight fever.

269
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,937
Are you saying a slight fever
isn't an emergency?

270
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,732
Does a patient have to bleed
so much with a punctured artery then?

271
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,109
That's what an emergency is for you?

272
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,610
That's not what I meant.

273
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,571
That patient had ARDS.

274
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,531
If Dong-ju had been five minutes late,

275
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,283
she would have been dead.

276
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,870
Didn't he ask you to check the chest
and run a blood test?

277
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,122
He asked twice but why did you ignore it?

278
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,333
-I didn't ignore it--
-Then what?

279
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,585
Did you have no clue?

280
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:33,172
How can a resident overlook it?
Even an intern suspected that.

281
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,758
-I'm sorry.
-Apologize to the patient, not me.

282
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:37,926
You dumbhead.

283
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,013
You don't deserve to eat anything.

284
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,808
This is our first meal.

285
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,143
He's so mean.

286
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:48,061
Dong-ju is the one to be blamed.

287
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,314
How can he tell on her?

288
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,149
What should we do about this?

289
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,901
What do you want me to do, Seo-jeong?

290
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,199
Hey, Doctor Intern.

291
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,660
Are you talking to me?

292
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,371
-Your name?
-Kang Dong-ju.

293
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,248
That's you, Doctor Intern.

294
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,875
My name is Kang Dong-ju.

295
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,461
Right, your name is Doctor Intern.

296
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,050
You told on me to Doctor Park
from Internal Medicine Department.

297
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,387
I only reported to explain
why I had to call him.

298
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,182
You seemed too busy

299
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,808
with the patient who was bleeding so much.

300
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,771
So is the patient with ARDS okay?

301
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,523
Luckily, she got better.
I sent her to the patient's room.

302
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,651
That's really impressive.

303
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,153
You saved a life as a mere intern.

304
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,197
You did a very good job.

305
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,408
Thanks to you, I will be able to
relax for the next one month.

306
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,078
Well, I will try my best.

307
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,287
Will you?

308
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,082
Did you all hear that?

309
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:53,293
Doctor Intern just said
he would try his best.

310
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,128
He will be taking care of

311
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:58,215
all the JS patients
in the emergency room from now on.

312
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,801
What do you mean?

313
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:04,221
JS patients in this emergency room
are very delicate.

314
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:08,225
Attending to them will be
a valuable learning experience for you.

315
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,476
Good luck.

316
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,860
What is JS?

317
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,322
It stands for jerks and surly patients.

318
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,448
Obnoxious patients.

319
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,785
Obnoxious patients?

320
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,829
Gosh.

321
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,206
Hey, lady. How much is it for two hours?

322
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,167
-I want to sing a song.
-Can I see your face?

323
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:38,839
The wound on your forehead is deep.
I should disinfect it with alcohol.

324
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:43,218
Alcohol isn't for disinfection.
You should drink alcohol.

325
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,220
How can a doctor be so ignorant?

326
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,973
-We should disinfect the wound first.
-No, I don't need that.

327
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:51,226
-Wait, sir.
-I don't need that.

328
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,522
What has the country done for me?

329
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,859
-Let me check your wound first.
-Oh my!

330
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,236
Gosh. You pervert.

331
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,406
Make sure to do it well.

332
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,826
My boss hates needles.

333
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,624
Do you want to die or what?

334
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,513
Do you think you can handle it?

335
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,639
Is everything okay?

336
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,311
Everything is okay.

337
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:37,105
I heard you are the smartest intern ever.
I knew it.

338
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,818
Keep trying your best.
Thanks for the coffee.

339
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,448
My gosh.

340
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:54,873
Darn it!

341
00:22:58,376 --> 00:22:59,419
That's enough.

342
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:02,672
It's anal foreign body.

343
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,634
It seems something got stuck
inside his body. Take it out.

344
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,095
What exactly is in there?

345
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,097
Can't you tell?

346
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,643
Masturbation?

347
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,687
It is the size of four golf balls.

348
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,273
He can't get it out.
Maybe the string got twisted or something.

349
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,733
What?

350
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,069
The string is stuck out of his anus

351
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:26,446
but he just can't pull it out
because of pain.

352
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,366
Fortunately, no free air is seen
on the X-ray.

353
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,493
By the way, have you eaten?

354
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,455
Sorry, but you still have to do it.

355
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,499
-Make sure to get it out.
-Wait.

356
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,795
-How should I do that?
-Just think about it.

357
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,673
What would you need if it is too tight?

358
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:52,097
Hey, don't you think
you are being too harsh?

359
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,225
I think so. What if he runs away?

360
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,352
There's nothing I can do about it.

361
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,610
Sir, please relax yourself.

362
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,863
I just can't.
Can't you numb it or something?

363
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,866
-It will be okay.
-On the count of three.

364
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,829
We are almost there.

365
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,498
-Breathe.
-Happy thoughts.

366
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,791
On the count of three.

367
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,181
You are a doctor, indeed.

368
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:38,977
I got them all out.

369
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,521
I heard the patient screaming.

370
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,857
He had an anal fissure.

371
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,775
Didn't his sphincter tear as well?

372
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,944
I performed a digital rectal examination

373
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,905
and it was not serious.

374
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,948
That's good. Good job, Doctor Intern.

375
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:55,160
-You are hazing me, aren't you?
-What are you talking about?

376
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:58,371
You are making me take care of
obnoxious patients on purpose.

377
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:01,875
-Am I wrong?
-Stop being ridiculous.

378
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,794
What are you talking about?

379
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,713
Are you discriminating between patients?

380
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:09,799
I'm just complaining about
your unfair dealing.

381
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,095
Hey, Doctor Intern.

382
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,349
Do you know how to
put an elephant into a fridge?

383
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,101
-What?
-The answer is...

384
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,020
Let an intern do it.

385
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,605
Interns in an emergency room

386
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,024
are supposed to do anything they are told.

387
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,734
It doesn't matter
if patients are nice or not.

388
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:30,403
You can't discriminate against or
reject a patient in any case.

389
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,905
Even if...

390
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,367
a patient has something bigger than
a golf ball in his anus

391
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,035
there is no exception, okay?

392
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:40,121
If you can't do that, just quit.
I will let you go.

393
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,209
What did I do wrong?

394
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,462
While you were giving a performance
with a bleeding patient,

395
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:50,131
I just took care of the patient with ARDS.

396
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,341
What is so wrong about it?

397
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,265
What did you just say?

398
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,141
A performance?

399
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,394
Crazy Whale and Queen of Forefinger.

400
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,938
You like the nicknames
in that context, don't you?

401
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:08,400
You are an exhibitionist
who wants to be recognized by everyone.

402
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,444
In psychiatry, it is called

403
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:15,115
histrionic personality disorder.
Don't you think?

404
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:18,034
Then, you have narcissistic
personality disorder.

405
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,996
You are a snob who has
a swollen opinion of himself.

406
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,872
You are just an audacious psycho.

407
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,166
What?

408
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:30,922
Damn it.

409
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,892
What? An audacious psycho?

410
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,813
Histrionic personality? Why that little...

411
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,708
He never says hello to me, not even once.

412
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,756
Do I want to be recognized?

413
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:15,884
Maybe.

414
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:20,388
-Guys!
-Really?

415
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,516
Why did you tell them?

416
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,604
-His eyes were crying.
-No, I wasn't.

417
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,189
My heart broke.

418
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,443
Eat up.

419
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,576
Don't you have a friend to eat with?

420
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,541
Do you have a girlfriend?

421
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,961
No, I have no time for dating.

422
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,759
Do you even enjoy your life?

423
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,761
You don't have a friend or a girlfriend.

424
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:05,767
I see. No wonder you were
top of your class for six straight years.

425
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,394
You must've been so proud of that.

426
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,187
Am I wrong?

427
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,483
In an emergency room,

428
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,736
it's not the order of arrival.
It's the order of emergency.

429
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:19,531
I judged that

430
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:23,368
the patient with pneumonia sepsis
was not in critical condition.

431
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:28,248
So it was just a misjudgment.

432
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:31,292
It doesn't have anything to do
with my giving a performance.

433
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,794
Do you understand, Doctor Intern?

434
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,173
Thank you for the drink.

435
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:56,234
I'm paying you back
for the coffee you bought me last time.

436
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,072
What?

437
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,866
What did you just do?

438
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,534
-What was that?
-Let's go.

439
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:06,619
What was that?

440
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,917
-What was that?
-Oh gosh.

441
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:17,922
Was it hazing or playing hard to get?

442
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,801
I know he is arrogant, but he works hard.

443
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:25,054
Seriously? But he said
you have a histrionic personality.

444
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:28,933
He was even covered with excrement,
but he endured.

445
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,478
There are not many interns
who would do that.

446
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,854
Look at you.

447
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:36,441
You are so in love with him.

448
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,734
What?

449
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,780
I've had a fever since this morning.

450
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:45,658
My stomach feels heavy.
I think it's indigestion.

451
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,497
Do you want me to call Doctor Yun?

452
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,875
You will have a basic checkup first.

453
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,877
I will X-ray your chest
and take your blood sample.

454
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,961
Okay.

455
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,964
Get him an electrocardiogram, too.

456
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,595
It's not hazing.

457
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,850
I know Doctor Yun well.
I've seen her for a long time.

458
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:14,020
She just cares about you
because you are good.

459
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,564
Her nickname is Crazy Whale.

460
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,359
In fact, she is just
a tenderhearted whale.

461
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,986
I will prepare for an electrocardiogram.

462
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,369
Honey! No!

463
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,287
Doctor!

464
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:33,957
Oh my gosh.

465
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,042
-What's wrong with him?
-He has no pulse.

466
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,544
I think he's having a cardiac arrest.

467
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,463
-Sir!
-Doctor, you should do CPR.

468
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,090
Right.

469
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,593
Call Doctor Yun immediately.

470
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,393
What's going on?

471
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,521
He complained of fever
and went into cardiac arrest.

472
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:57,564
Fever?

473
00:30:58,481 --> 00:30:59,524
Does he have myocarditis?

474
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,735
How long has it been?

475
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,362
About a minute.

476
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,989
Should I call the thoracic surgeons?

477
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,615
I heard they have a team dinner today.

478
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,868
It'll take them 30 minutes to come.

479
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,328
Bring me a defibrillator
and an intubation tube.

480
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:13,997
One ampoule of epinephrine
every three minutes.

481
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,039
Okay.

482
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,339
Push harder. That wouldn't help.

483
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:26,426
A-ra.

484
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,094
Move over.

485
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:32,807
Bring the defibrillator right now!

486
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,564
I'm going to defibrillate him.

487
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,191
It's ventricular fibrillation.
Charge 200 joules.

488
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,115
Step away.

489
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,159
Clear.

490
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,044
Let's check his heart rhythm again.

491
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,170
Charge 200 joules.

492
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,548
Step away.

493
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,591
Clear.

494
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,223
Let's check his heart rhythm again.

495
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:16,643
I'll check his pulse.

496
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,355
It's PEA. I'll do chest compression.

497
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,815
PEA : PULSELESS ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY
COMPRESSION : CHEST COMPRESSION

498
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,692
It's not working.

499
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,152
His pulse isn't coming back.

500
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:27,904
How long has it been?

501
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,989
It's been 4 minutes and 30 seconds.

502
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,930
I'll do it.

503
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:10,989
Let's stop here.

504
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,536
Are you out of your mind?

505
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,496
His doctor isn't here.

506
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,373
I've called the cardiothoracic surgeon.

507
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:21,708
I think you should wait.

508
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:25,545
When a young man with fever
and dyspnea goes into a cardiac arrest

509
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,463
there's a high possibility of myocarditis.

510
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,798
We can keep him alive with ECMO.

511
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:32,051
If we waste any more time
he'll be brain-dead.

512
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,345
There's no point in
reviving his heart after that.

513
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,430
Bring the ECMO.

514
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,390
What if it goes wrong?

515
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:40,059
You'll have to take full responsibility.

516
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,728
I said, bring the ECMO!

517
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:45,231
You got lucky when you blocked
the bleeding with your finger.

518
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:49,110
You said yourself that you were lucky.

519
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,612
You can't be lucky every single time.

520
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,614
Let's just stick to CPR.

521
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:57,076
If that doesn't bring him back,
then that's too bad.

522
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,244
How would you feel?

523
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,913
Imagine that you're lying in this bed

524
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,624
and your doctor says it can't be helped.

525
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,959
How would you feel?

526
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,420
This is different.

527
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:09,839
It might be considered
medical malpractice.

528
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,383
I agree with her.

529
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,801
Please wait for the doctor in charge.

530
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,596
Are you all serious?

531
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,598
I'll take full responsibility.

532
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:19,974
Bring it right now!

533
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,519
Gosh.

534
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,905
I brought you the ECMO.

535
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,407
Are you out of your mind?

536
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,701
You should be stopping her.

537
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,914
Okay. Let's move the patient
to the hybrid operating room.

538
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,006
Are you sure about this?

539
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,008
I worked in the CS team
during the last term.

540
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,802
I assisted over ten times within a month.

541
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,220
You can't afford to make a mistake.

542
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,931
A-ra, start chest compression.

543
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:01,766
This is driving me crazy.

544
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,979
-Let's begin.
-Hold the probe.

545
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,450
Guide wire.

546
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:25,832
Scalpel.

547
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,254
Mosquito forceps.

548
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,179
Dilator forceps.

549
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,769
Pass me the 12 French.

550
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,230
Pass me the 24 French.

551
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,191
Gauze.

552
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,694
Tube.

553
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,451
Hold the guide wire.

554
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:08,708
Seal it up.

555
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:14,922
Cut.

556
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,259
Cut.

557
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,390
Turn the ECMO on.

558
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,784
Thank goodness.

559
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,589
What's the patient's name?

560
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:57,840
It's Lee Myeong-hun.

561
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,347
Myeong-hun.

562
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,349
You can hear me, right?

563
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,686
I'm Doctor Yun Seo-jeong
who operated on you.

564
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,856
This equipment is oxygenating your blood.

565
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,692
I believe you'll be all right.

566
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,030
Please,

567
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,282
don't give up.

568
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:24,909
Okay?

569
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:48,891
I understand. Monitor his condition
and call me back.

570
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,397
Doctor Moon, what are you doing?
Doctor Do is waiting.

571
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,773
-Exactly.
-I know.

572
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,490
How long has it been since the operation?

573
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:07,785
It's been 30 minutes.
The patient is in good condition.

574
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:10,329
-Call me when something happens.
-Yes, Doctor.

575
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,208
You come with me.

576
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,922
Are you out of your mind?

577
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:23,342
How dare you make such a big decision?

578
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,178
Who was supposed to be responsible
had the patient died?

579
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,515
The operation was successful
and the patient is stable so far.

580
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:32,143
When you work in the emergency room

581
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,437
just take care of
the emergency situations.

582
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,897
If you want to make a decision
to put someone on ECMO

583
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,983
become a licensed specialist first!

584
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:42,320
I did what I had to do to save his life.

585
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:47,116
Anyway, I won't let this slide.

586
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:48,951
Brace yourself.

587
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:18,356
It's okay.

588
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:20,274
It's okay.

589
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,319
You saved his life.
That's all that matters.

590
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,240
You did the right thing.

591
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,035
You did the right thing, Seo-jeong.

592
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,520
What is it?

593
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,358
I'm sorry.

594
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,526
It's all my fault.

595
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,487
I couldn't

596
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,864
treat him properly in time.

597
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,617
My CPR was done poorly.

598
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,577
I admit

599
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,205
that I lack the experience.

600
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,042
Forget it. It's okay.

601
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:25,297
The patient is alive after all.

602
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,258
We did what we had to do.

603
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,510
A letter of explanation?

604
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,179
I can write 1,000 of it.

605
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,722
Don't be discouraged.

606
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,687
I guess there was a reason
why you were top of your class.

607
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,690
Your assistance was pretty helpful.

608
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:45,985
Was it?

609
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:51,490
It feels like I just managed to put
the elephant's foot into the fridge.

610
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,118
Good work, Doctor Intern.

611
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:26,525
What do you think you're doing?

612
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:32,448
Have you gone crazy?

613
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,701
Is it okay?

614
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,705
Is it okay

615
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,167
to be crazy about you?

616
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,970
You're insane.

617
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:45,020
I have a boyfriend by the way.

618
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:47,523
I'm taken.

619
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,692
How dare you?

620
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:51,694
Gosh.

621
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:12,798
He must be out of his mind.

622
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,429
What a lunatic.

623
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,140
Are you going home now?

624
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,392
-He's crazy.
-Oh, right.

625
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:25,311
Doctor Moon is here.

626
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,490
What happened back there

627
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,242
was just an accident.

628
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:23,869
You know that, right?

629
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,622
-An accident?
-You know...

630
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,250
It was right after saving a dying patient.

631
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:33,879
How should I say this?

632
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:36,465
We were a little bit too happy
at that moment.

633
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:39,843
Too much adrenaline got released

634
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:43,514
and our brains weren't
functioning rationally.

635
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:47,935
It was a behavioral disorder
of malfunction.

636
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:50,396
What are you talking about?

637
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:54,441
I'm saying it didn't mean anything.

638
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:55,859
Do you get it?

639
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,654
That's when it started for me.

640
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:04,910
When you put your hand
inside the body of the patient

641
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:06,453
to spot the arteries.

642
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,873
Then you jumped on the patient's bed

643
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,625
and went up to the operating room.

644
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,672
I thought you were really awesome.

645
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,801
Didn't you hear what I said?

646
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,387
I told you I'm seeing someone.

647
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:25,973
I want to go out with you.

648
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:29,017
I said I have a boyfriend
whom I'm seeing seriously.

649
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:31,979
I want to sleep with you.

650
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:36,900
What?

651
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,570
What did you just say?

652
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:40,946
I like you.

653
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,033
I want to sleep with you.

654
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:07,473
That's him.

655
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:10,684
That's the man I'm seeing.

656
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:12,644
There he is.

657
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,569
I have to go.

658
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,121
What are you thinking about?

659
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:20,420
Is it this one that blocked
the blood vessel?

660
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,589
Yes.

661
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:47,072
This is your last year
as a resident, right?

662
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,033
Let's get married when you're done.

663
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:52,995
Doctor Moon.

664
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:55,455
Do as I say.

665
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,909
This is the emergency room
of Geosan Medical Center.

666
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:35,871
What is it?

667
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,456
Okay, I understand.

668
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,960
It was Doctor Moon
from Department of Surgery.

669
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:45,380
There was a traffic accident.
Doctor Yun is seriously injured.

670
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:57,476
Seo-jeong.

671
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:58,602
Her blood pressure is low.

672
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:02,314
She hit the right side of her head.
X-ray the right collarbone and wrist.

673
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:04,483
Get the sonogram ready
to check for internal bleeding.

674
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:05,525
Yes, sir.

675
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:08,654
-Hurry up.
-Get her IV injections, please.

676
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,143
Jelly.

677
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,490
It's not much but there's hemoperitoneum.

678
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:56,743
Send her up to the operating room.
I'll be performing the surgery.

679
00:49:57,619 --> 00:50:00,330
We have to care for the fractures
in her shoulders and arms.

680
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,916
Get the orthopedist on the shift
for the combined operation.

681
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,045
Did you not hear me?

682
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,555
Have you been drinking?

683
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,855
I'll call someone else
to perform the surgery.

684
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:28,024
-Let's run her through a CT scan.
-Yes, sir.

685
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,093
Doctor Moon.

686
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:02,476
It's Doctor Intern, not Doctor Moon.

687
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,687
We're getting you a CT scan.

688
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,940
Where's Doctor Moon?

689
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,655
He's in the emergency room.

690
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,866
He's fine and not bleeding at all

691
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,826
so don't worry.

692
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,579
Check on Doctor Moon right now.

693
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:23,872
Are you out of your mind?

694
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,541
You're the one who might die.

695
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,502
It's not me. It's him.

696
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:32,380
His head was hit, not mine.

697
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:43,475
-You should go see him now.
-Doctor Yun.

698
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:44,684
Kang Dong-ju!

699
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,192
Please.

700
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:55,654
Check on Doctor Moon.

701
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,156
Please?

702
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:00,617
Please?

703
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:49,082
What's

704
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:52,544
going on here?

705
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:58,133
How's Doctor Yun?

706
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:05,932
Kang Dong-ju!

707
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:08,018
That scumbag.

708
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,060
Kang Dong-ju!

709
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:14,649
No, Tae-ho!

710
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:23,867
Tae-ho! Oh no.

711
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,952
He's not breathing.

712
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,579
He's not breathing.

713
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:31,917
It's not me. It's him.

714
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:34,878
His head was hit, not mine.

715
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:36,755
No!

716
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:38,798
Oh no.

717
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:41,092
Tae-ho.

718
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,762
Tae-ho.

719
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:36,690
It was a cerebral hemorrhage

720
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:38,942
from the shock during the car accident.

721
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:53,957
Seo-jeong?

722
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:34,748
What's with the look?

723
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,791
Was my proposal

724
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,043
too sudden?

725
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:40,795
Actually...

726
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,884
someone confessed his love to me.

727
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:50,013
Was it that guy?

728
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,599
To be honest,

729
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:59,522
my heart fluttered a little.

730
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:04,069
I'm sorry.

731
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,287
Doctor Moon!

732
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:07,006
-The person you have dialed--
-Is she not answering?

733
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,217
Her phone is turned off.

734
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:13,555
Why didn't she tell me
that she was going somewhere?

735
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:14,848
I'm worried about her.

736
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,766
Can't you call her family?

737
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:19,102
She doesn't keep in touch with anyone.

738
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:20,854
-She's alone.
-What do you mean?

739
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,856
Doesn't she have parents?

740
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,859
No, she has no family at all.

741
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:27,402
She's completely alone.

742
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:28,695
I didn't know that.

743
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,656
Where did she go?

744
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:50,425
I like you.

745
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,053
Crazy bastard.

746
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,848
She still seems conscious.

747
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:44,854
She must be out of her mind.

748
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,189
Who are you?

749
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:49,651
How did she hike in this condition?

750
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:52,737
Is he a pervert?

751
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,700
Her back seems fine.

752
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,293
Gosh, why is it the leg?

753
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:11,005
Oh my goodness.

754
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:14,175
I can't just leave her here.

755
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:16,469
Okay.

756
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:18,096
First,

757
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:21,099
I'll reposition the ankle.

758
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:34,904
It's going to hurt a little.

759
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,409
One.

760
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:42,537
Two.

761
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:45,206
Three.

762
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:56,342
What should I do next?

763
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:19,490
