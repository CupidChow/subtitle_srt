00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,504
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

2
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,217
You asked me if I needed a job.

3
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,011
The thing is,

4
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:55,930
I need money.

5
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:02,979
How much can you offer me?

6
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,190
You need money,

7
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,651
and that's why you'll work in the OR?

8
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,780
That's what it sounds like to me.

9
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:14,115
-Am I right?
-Yes.

10
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,495
So if I offer you an enticing amount,

11
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,206
you'll gladly sell yourself?

12
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,041
If you need me, yes.

13
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,543
How much are you willing to pay?

14
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,422
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

15
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,855
Help…

16
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,234
Please help me.

17
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,820
Hello? I can't hear you. What did you say?

18
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,156
My mom and dad…

19
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,744
won't move.

20
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,997
What exactly is the situation?

21
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,000
I can't

22
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,669
breathe.

23
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,046
Please help me.

24
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,384
Are you calling from Buam-dong?

25
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,136
Can you tell me the house number?

26
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,429
Hello? Young man.

27
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,473
Hello?

28
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:39,951
That day…

29
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,204
Why didn't you mend the diaphragm tear?

30
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,831
A CUT IN THE DIAPHRAGM

31
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,459
The surgery at Geosan Hospital.

32
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,544
That one.

33
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,964
He didn't need a combine surgery.

34
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,632
CROSS-DEPARTMENTAL SURGERY

35
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:58,052
I thought it would be better for the CS
to work on the diaphragm.

36
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,721
That's all?

37
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,556
What more do you want to know?

38
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,809
No, I just got curious.

39
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:08,688
I wondered if it was that you didn't do it
or just couldn't do it.

40
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,073
Goodness.

41
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,451
Wow, it's still warm.

42
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,913
I just roasted it in the fire
sitting in our office.

43
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,082
-Would you like some?
-No.

44
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,501
I rarely eat carbs after 6 p.m.

45
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,837
Oh, I see.

46
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,924
You're really good
at taking care of yourself.

47
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,467
I can never seem to do that.

48
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,684
I didn't.

49
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,606
I didn't want to touch something
that I wasn't responsible for.

50
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,942
It's not like anyone will give credit

51
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,360
to a salaried doctor.

52
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,987
It's not like I get paid more.

53
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,952
Do you always deal with things like that?

54
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,829
I learned that this is the smartest way
to survive.

55
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,332
Then why did you blow the whistle?

56
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,126
It doesn't make any sense.

57
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,712
You don't like taking responsibility,

58
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,965
you don't want to take any credit,

59
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,342
and you want to avoid trouble

60
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,343
as much as you can,

61
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,595
but you blew the whistle.

62
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,265
I'm not here to look for a life coach.

63
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,977
You wanted me to put a price on you.

64
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,895
Then I need to know things.

65
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,281
I was naive, that's all.

66
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,367
Because of that stupid decision,

67
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,995
my petty life as a doctor was destroyed.

68
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,914
And I've been regretting it ever since.

69
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,250
Is that good enough?

70
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,385
You'll find the staff room if you go down

71
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,928
that hallway.

72
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,181
The buses have stopped running,

73
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,268
and you probably have no place to stay.

74
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:11,602
You can--

75
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,645
You haven't

76
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,689
told me how much you'll give me.

77
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:19,152
You can sleep there tonight
and go back to Seoul tomorrow.

78
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,448
-You're telling me to leave?
-Yes.

79
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,243
I think I had a wrong take on you.

80
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,330
What are you trying to do?

81
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,334
You called me all the way out here.
Are you kidding me?

82
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,340
Do I look like a nice guy to you?

83
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,841
You said you needed a hand.

84
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,052
A doctor is who I'm looking for!

85
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,729
I'll pay you for your travel,

86
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,733
so get lost, okay?

87
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,825
What am I doing here?

88
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,870
Pardon? Did you just say something to me?

89
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,584
Are you going somewhere?

90
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,462
Goodness.

91
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,762
No, it's all right.

92
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,305
No, I'll give you a hand.

93
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,308
I don't like it
when others touch my things.

94
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,018
Oh, right.

95
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,228
I see.

96
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,482
Great work.

97
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:40,817
Great work today.

98
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,110
Yes, great job.

99
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,986
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

100
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,489
Mr. Jang, you're still here.

101
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,075
The new doctors are here for an interview.

102
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,702
Oh, I see.

103
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,456
Hello.

104
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:57,917
Oh, right. This.

105
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,335
You left this with me.

106
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,129
Oh, the fingers.

107
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,256
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

108
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,298
Goodbye, then.

109
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,768
It's been a month.

110
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,063
What? What do you mean?

111
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,606
Dr. Bae Moon-jung.

112
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,152
It has been a month since he came to work
for Doldam Hospital.

113
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,447
It seemed like you might be curious.

114
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,157
Me?

115
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,033
Not at all.

116
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,871
Did his family come with him?

117
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,123
No. He came alone.

118
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,420
I heard he's divorced.

119
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,547
Divorced?

120
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,341
Moon-jung got divorced?

121
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,263
Do you need me

122
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,806
to find out more information?

123
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,891
Oh, well…

124
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,517
No,

125
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,269
that's not necessary.

126
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,605
Oh, I see.

127
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,857
SURGERY, FAMILY MEDICINE

128
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,905
SURGERY, FAMILY MEDICINE

129
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,091
That's good.

130
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,654
Hi, Elizabeth.

131
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,366
I'm here.
You must've been bored all alone.

132
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,600
I can't

133
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,519
breathe.

134
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,980
Please help me.

135
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,339
One week.

136
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,010
Give me just a week's time.

137
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,887
If anything, I'm good at operating.

138
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,891
I'll show you what I can do for a week
to change your mind.

139
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,103
I've never

140
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,772
put a price on a person in my life.

141
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,108
And I never plan on doing it.

142
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,110
Just ten million won for now.

143
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,196
I don't care if it's an advance
or if it's a loan.

144
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,698
I don't care what it is.

145
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,201
I just need ten million won in a hurry.

146
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:23,956
Can't you do that?

147
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,044
Why Dr. Seo Woo-jin of all people?

148
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,464
He has the worst reputation here.

149
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:36,427
Not only does he never mingle,
people talk about his bad character,

150
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,637
and recently,

151
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,306
there was a rumor

152
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,892
about him working at a bar
to pay back his student loan.

153
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,518
You should find

154
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,187
a different doctor.

155
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:48,981
Can't you do that?

156
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:52,902
Then prove it.

157
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,615
Show me why I must change my mind

158
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,617
within the week.

159
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,410
Then,

160
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,871
will you give me ten million won?

161
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,374
It'll be much harder than you think.

162
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,212
You'll really give me the ten million won,
won't you?

163
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:31,065
MECHANISM OF ACCIDENTS

164
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,112
This is Bonghwadae. Everything is clear.

165
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,322
Everything looks clear until the rotation.

166
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,741
This is Car One.

167
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,284
Code green.

168
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,370
Everything is clear to the left and right.

169
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,622
Car Two, clear.

170
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,624
This is Car One.

171
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,751
Namhansanseong, report. Rotating.

172
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,086
ETA 10.

173
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,713
Namhansanseong is clear.

174
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,173
-ETA 10.
-This is Bonghwadae, clear.

175
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,883
Bonghwadae, return to base.

176
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,849
We'll be arriving in ten minutes.

177
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,559
Yes. All right.

178
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,813
How long will the joint training be?

179
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,940
About two and a half hours.

180
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:16,193
You'll oversee training for an hour,
have the army chief of staff

181
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,528
debrief you for 30 minutes,

182
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,488
and move on to the next location.

183
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,159
Stop the car!

184
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,744
Mr. Park.

185
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,579
Mr. Park, in front of you!

186
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,294
Car Three, report.

187
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:34,879
Car Three, report.

188
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,297
This is Car Three.

189
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,549
This is Car Three. Code red.
It's a code red.

190
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,260
Mr. Park, wake up.

191
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,344
Mr. Park!

192
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,117
Hello. Good morning.

193
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,911
Hello, good morning--

194
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,209
Who are you?

195
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,796
Hello.

196
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,172
I'm Yoon A-reum,

197
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,715
fourth-year resident of EM.

198
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,635
I've been transferred
to Doldam Hospital as of today.

199
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,928
It's nice to meet you all.

200
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,930
Nice to meet you. I'm Oh Myeong-sim.

201
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,264
She's the head nurse

202
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,183
and the biggest influence in Doldam.

203
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,392
And I'm

204
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,562
Jeong In-su, your respected direct senior.

205
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,523
I've been on duty all alone

206
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,608
in this emergency room

207
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,568
for such a long time.

208
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,071
Dr. Yoon left two months ago.

209
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,197
Exactly.

210
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,117
Those two months seemed so long.

211
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,204
Anyway, I'm glad to have a colleague.

212
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,914
I feel encouraged.

213
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,791
I'm Um Hyun-jung.

214
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:57,378
I've been in Doldam's ER forever.
If you have any questions, ask away.

215
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,046
I'm Joo Young-mi.

216
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,382
I've been here for only two months.

217
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,342
-And this is--
-I'm Park Eun-tak.

218
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,761
I'm in the ER when there are no surgeries.

219
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:06,679
You're handsome.

220
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:13,310
-What?
-You have quite the discerning eye.

221
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,437
He's the pretty boy of Doldam Hospital.

222
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,066
He's the most popular with everyone,
from old ladies to elementary school kids.

223
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,490
All right, now that we've said hello,
let's get to work.

224
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,908
-Yes.
-Nurse Joo?

225
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,953
Is it because it's still morning?
There aren't that many patients.

226
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,876
WE HOPE TO SEE YOU HEALTHY

227
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:38,794
What?

228
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,213
What's wrong?

229
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,173
Did I say something wrong?

230
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,469
Well, Dr. Yoon.

231
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,805
There's something

232
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,640
you must never say in the ER.

233
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:55,102
-What is it?
-What you just said.

234
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,522
-Oh, that there aren't many patients?
-Dr. Yoon!

235
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,523
NURSING DEPARTMENT

236
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:04,653
Goodness.

237
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,531
Let me say it politely once again.

238
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,783
You are not supposed to say that out loud

239
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,118
here at Doldam Hospital.

240
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,371
I don't care about the reasons or facts.
Do not do it. Ever.

241
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,539
Don't.

242
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,291
Do you understand?

243
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,418
Oh, yes.

244
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,760
WE HOPE TO SEE YOU HEALTHY

245
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:28,969
Why not?

246
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,596
Why can't I say that?

247
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,182
It's our jinx.

248
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,516
What jinx?

249
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,310
The moment you say that,

250
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,687
we get bombarded with emergency patients.

251
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,065
It's a scary jinx here at Doldam Hospital.

252
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,107
What?

253
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:47,112
Gosh, I thought it was something serious.
There can't be such a jinx.

254
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,990
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

255
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,118
WE HOPE TO SEE YOU HEALTHY

256
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:00,918
No way.

257
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,461
There is just no way.

258
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,505
And it's not just for me.

259
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,215
There's no way this flies with you.

260
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,301
Let me hear the reason first.

261
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,178
Why in the world are you here?

262
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,596
Haven't you heard?

263
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,431
No, I haven't.

264
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,392
I was fired from the main hospital.

265
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,103
What is it this time?
Why did you get fired again?

266
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,480
You should ask Ho-jun
because I'd love to know too.

267
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:24,900
Why are you here?

268
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,236
Haven't you heard?

269
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,612
No, I haven't.

270
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,572
This jerk of a general surgeon

271
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,242
refused to mend a diaphragm tear,

272
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,078
so I blacked out after doing two surgeries
in a row.

273
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,330
I completely fainted.
I was totally knocked out.

274
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,666
Hey, get the facts straight.

275
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,293
You fell asleep.

276
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,586
No, I fainted.

277
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,880
I'd been working too hard
two days before that,

278
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,675
-and I had caught a cold too.
-Then what about your snoring?

279
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,554
-Do you have evidence?
-The staff who were in that OR.

280
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:54,972
Should I send a group text?

281
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:58,017
-Do you even have their numbers?
-It's a piece of cake.

282
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,602
You don't know people well enough
to ask them that.

283
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,521
But I can still check for the facts.

284
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,982
My gosh.

285
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,443
You really are annoying, Woo-jin.

286
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,453
What are you doing?

287
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,373
What?

288
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,833
What are you trying to do?

289
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,126
Get away from me.

290
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:40,768
Eye booger.

291
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:42,978
What?

292
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:45,898
In your eyes.

293
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,945
Gosh, darn it.

294
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,536
Who are you?

295
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,167
Hello, Moon-jung.
I'm Cha Eun-jae, a second-year CS.

296
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,502
I see.

297
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,420
The doctors who came yesterday.

298
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,546
Who are you?

299
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,298
Hey, what's with you?

300
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,133
He was our senior in school.

301
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,303
He's a general surgeon.

302
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:19,139
His name is Seo Woo-jin,
and we were in the same class.

303
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,682
My juniors from med school?

304
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,560
I'm Bae Moon-jung, an OS.

305
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,312
Nice to meet you, juniors.

306
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:26,730
You too.

307
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,611
Did you just come to work?

308
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,612
Yes.

309
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,197
I'm a little late.

310
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,824
Goodness, Moon-jung.

311
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:40,077
Please speak comfortably with us.
We're much younger than you.

312
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,764
Emergency patients. Aren't you coming?

313
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,224
Yes, we are.

314
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,400
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

315
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,155
MILITARY POLICE

316
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,620
Yes, Doctor Kim
of Doldam Hospital speaking.

317
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:24,580
Goodness.

318
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,332
Hey, what is it?

319
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,420
What?

320
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,091
You must empty the ER completely.

321
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,468
The entire ER?

322
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,095
We cannot do that.

323
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,307
We're asking for cooperation.
It's necessary for security.

324
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,600
Oh, I see.

325
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,519
All right.
You're important people. Of course--

326
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,645
No.

327
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,189
I understand the situation,

328
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,733
but I cannot hand over
the authority of the ER.

329
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,194
He's a minister.

330
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,695
We understand he's a minister,

331
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,448
but we cannot send away
other emergency patients.

332
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,574
That's our principle.

333
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,201
Who on earth is here?

334
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:07,080
-The Minister of National Defense.
-What? The Minister of National Defense?

335
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,710
Wait, who are you?

336
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:14,087
Oh, they're new doctors.

337
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,923
I see. Nice to meet you.

338
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,299
I'm Dr. Jung--

339
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,383
Ms. Oh,

340
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,385
the minister will be here in two minutes.

341
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,513
Will you please leave the room?

342
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,682
We must get ready to take the patient in.

343
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,602
It's to give him adequate treatment.

344
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,562
Please move aside.

345
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:35,442
We should probably do that for now.
Please come with me.

346
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,736
Let's do this for the minister. Let's go.

347
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,571
Please. This way.

348
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,240
Nurse Park, call Doctor Kim.

349
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:44,743
Let's prepare enough warm saline,
intubation tubes, and C-lines.

350
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:45,953
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

351
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,872
Ms. Oh, these are the new doctors.

352
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,833
Hello. I'm Cha Eun-jae,
a second-year CS.

353
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,460
I'm GS Seo Woo-jin.

354
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,254
I'm Head Nurse Oh Myeong-sim.

355
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,755
-And I'm--
-We're expecting

356
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,507
TA patients from nearby.

357
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,175
The driver died on the spot.

358
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,804
The man who was in the passenger's seat
and the minister suffered major trauma.

359
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,889
The minister sustained blunt trauma

360
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,058
from not wearing his seat belt,
and his vitals are bad.

361
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,101
Please get prepared.

362
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,269
Dr. Yoon.

363
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,479
Get a MAC catheter, sono machine,
and some chest tubes.

364
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,814
Yes, sir.

365
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,416
Yes, this is Do Yun-wan.

366
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,459
It's been a long time.

367
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,378
Don't mention it.

368
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,380
I made a safe comeback

369
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,840
thanks to your concern.

370
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,634
Yes.

371
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,512
This morning?

372
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,389
Goodness.

373
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,598
And?

374
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,811
To Doldam Hospital?

375
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,480
This is the minister!

376
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,195
-Goodness.
-Dr. Jung.

377
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:03,989
Yes?

378
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,115
What are his vitals?

379
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:08,660
It was initially 100 over 80,
but it dropped to 80 over 40 on our way.

380
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,455
-And the saturation?
-At 88 percent, so he's on full oxygen.

381
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,790
Put him on warm saline
and a reservoir mask, ten liters.

382
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,083
Got it.

383
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:21,298
Our new doctors seem to know what to do.
Don't you think so?

384
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,300
Hey, A-reum, what are you doing?

385
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,301
Yes, sir.

386
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,553
-Get the FAST ready, too!
-Patient coming through!

387
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:27,763
SONOGRAPHY FOR TRAUMA

388
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:28,722
What are his vitals?

389
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,974
BP is 110 over 70, 115 BPM,
so it's relatively stable.

390
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,226
But he has pain in his right shoulder
and right leg.

391
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,562
-Dr. Bae!
-Yes, coming.

392
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,483
Get the bed ready.

393
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,111
Saline on both sides, and go for OP lab.

394
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,071
PREOPERATIVE TESTS

395
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,323
Yes, sir.

396
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:48,992
Minister, we must cut your shirt.

397
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,918
-This is worse than I thought.
-What are his vitals?

398
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,211
He's at 80 over 40.

399
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,004
Minister, can you hear me?

400
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,094
Goodness.

401
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,346
It won't be as easy as we thought.

402
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:13,642
Please tell me everything

403
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,061
that there is for me to know.

404
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,270
Yes.

405
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,399
Is he taking any medication?

406
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,821
-Stand by at the door.
-Yes, sir.

407
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,454
The sonography machine is here.

408
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,133
He has a massive hemoperitoneum…

409
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,968
SEVERE INTERNAL BLEEDING

410
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:51,555
and both his liver and spleen are damaged.

411
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,014
Let's see his chest, too.

412
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,690
The BLUE looks normal.

413
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,650
And the PLAPS-profile…

414
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,987
A hemorrhage.

415
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:11,116
It's a blunt injury,
but there's a hemothorax, hemoperitoneum,

416
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,826
and his vitals are unstable.

417
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,203
And he's the Minister of National Defense?

418
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,247
Man, my first day is quite eventful.

419
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:21,501
-His oxygen saturation is dropping.
-Minister? Minister!

420
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,962
Get ready for intubation.
Eun-jae, get on the MAC.

421
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,547
I'll do the intubation. You do the MAC.

422
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,840
No time. Get on the MAC.

423
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,858
What are you doing?

424
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,193
You'll take ages.

425
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,170
I'm done.

426
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,590
Isn't it working? You need me to do it?

427
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,009
Take it out.

428
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,930
Fix it at 21 cm.

429
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,974
Ask for two emergency packed RBCs,

430
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:20,143
and prepare ten packed RBCs and FFP each.

431
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,144
Got it.

432
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,312
Do we have an RIS?

433
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,397
-We do.
-Okay.

434
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,525
We'll take a CT scan when we get blood.

435
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:27,609
Forget the CT scan.

436
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,486
Send him to the OR immediately.

437
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:36,868
His BP and saturation dropped,
so Dr. Seo has just intubated him.

438
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,621
We checked for hemothorax
and hemoperitoneum on sonography.

439
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,001
We need to open him up now

440
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,628
to stop the bleeding first.

441
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,130
Before you take the CT scan?

442
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,925
No way.

443
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,260
Where's Dr. Nam?

444
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,345
He said he'd go straight to the OR.

445
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,181
Ms. Oh, please head over to the OR

446
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,891
and get prepared. Hurry.

447
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,017
Yes, sir.

448
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,730
I brought the blood.

449
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,732
You'll open him up without a CT scan?

450
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,818
There's a higher possibility that

451
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,861
he'll go into arrest while we do that.

452
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,530
We can earn that much time

453
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,031
on packed RBCs and MAC.

454
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:21,037
-Have you ever done damage control?
-No.

455
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,331
With trauma patients,
it's all about saving time.

456
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,251
If you stick to the procedure,
you won't be able to save him.

457
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:27,711
Nurse Park,

458
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,546
get him to the OR right now.

459
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,548
Woo-jin, you're my first assistant.

460
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,842
Get ready in five minutes

461
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,552
and sprint over to the OR.

462
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,096
Hurry up!

463
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:40,724
Yes, sir.

464
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:43,935
Let's go.

465
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:46,438
What are you doing?

466
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,316
I'm Cha Eun-jae, a second-year CS.
I was transferred yesterday.

467
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,277
I'm not sure if you remember me.

468
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,987
Ever dealt with a hemothorax patient?

469
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,823
Yes, of course. I'm a second-year fellow.

470
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,201
I won't cut any slack for people who sleep

471
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,745
or doze off in the OR.

472
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:03,830
Don't let me catch you.

473
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,206
I'll get you.

474
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,627
Tell me now if you can't do it.

475
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,046
No, I'll be fine. That won't happen.

476
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,632
Then you get ready in five, too.

477
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,718
Be on standby in front of the OR
until I call you in.

478
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,095
Yes, sir!

479
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,233
How did he know I fell asleep in the OR?

480
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:36,821
And even if he does know,
how can he say that in front of everyone?

481
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,991
Gosh, darn it.

482
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,159
My gosh.

483
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,829
MALE CHANGING ROOM

484
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,207
You're going into the OR, too?

485
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,834
Did you think you were the only one?

486
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:53,880
I won't…

487
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,257
carry you this time.

488
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,184
Gosh, darn it.

489
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,481
Oh, man.

490
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,324
It's your first operation at Doldam.

491
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,576
I'm at your service.

492
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,625
Nice to meet you, Dr. Seo.

493
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:31,626
I'm Nam Do-il.

494
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,170
Hello. Nice to meet you.

495
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,589
You must be blessed with so much work.

496
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,050
And your first operation here
is on a minister.

497
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,344
Don't be too nervous.

498
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,929
We're all experts, too.

499
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,241
OPERATING ROOM, ELEVATOR

500
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,411
Where's the minister?

501
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:09,706
He's in critical condition,
so he went into the OR.

502
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,709
If he's in critical condition,
why was he brought here?

503
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,919
Stop the operation and call a chopper!

504
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,213
He's going to Jigoo Hospital in Seoul.

505
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,840
Then he'll die

506
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:20,592
before he gets there.

507
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,850
I'm Doctor Kim of Doldam Hospital.

508
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,228
I just talked to Dr. Hong
of Jigoo Hospital

509
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,980
to share his condition with him.

510
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:37,692
And he agreed to let me perform
an emergency operation on him.

511
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:46,242
Yes, I told them to send him there.

512
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,952
He has too much abdominal bleeding,

513
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,247
so something bad may happen
if you delay it any longer.

514
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,082
If you wish to let him live,

515
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:56,002
leave everything in Doctor Kim's hands.

516
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:58,630
That's his only chance for survival.

517
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,640
Aren't you going to visit Doldam Hospital?

518
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,310
Mr. Do?

519
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,103
Forget it.

520
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,396
I'll go later.

521
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,482
But this is the minister.

522
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,651
And I heard he's in critical condition.

523
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,862
He probably won't leave him to die.

524
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,365
Bu Yong-ju isn't the type

525
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,827
to miss out on an opportunity like this.

526
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,457
But this case won't be that easy.

527
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,211
The minister suffers from angina.

528
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,506
He has been taking aspirin
for about two years.

529
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:42,966
If you open him up now,

530
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,385
he'll bleed heavily,
and it'll be hard to stop the bleeding.

531
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,932
He's an elderly gentleman,
and the risk is quite high.

532
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,185
I'm not sure if I can ask you

533
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,396
to perform such an operation.

534
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,993
This is your first operation
in the new OR, Doctor Kim!

535
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,912
And your first patient is the minister!

536
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,957
Don't you think this is divine providence
for Doldam Hospital?

537
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,419
Don't get ahead of yourself.

538
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,880
Our first bet may bring us our worst luck.

539
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:22,797
What?

540
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,465
Goodness.

541
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,063
I wonder…

542
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,608
which one of us will benefit

543
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,360
from this operation.

544
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,289
ALPRAZOLAM

545
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:22,273
He has a severe abdominal blunt injury

546
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,651
along with liver and spleen injuries.

547
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,445
His BP is low,
and we can't keep his saturation up

548
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,989
because of the left hemothorax.

549
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:33,076
He may go into cardiac arrest
as soon as you open him.

550
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:34,494
You sure about this?

551
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,995
For today,

552
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:39,707
we'll control the bleeding first
with a damage control surgery.

553
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:43,419
After we conduct a splenectomy,
we'll perform perihepatic packing.

554
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,672
Then we'll watch his condition,

555
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,299
then within 48 hours,
we'll take a second look.

556
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,384
SECOND OPERATION

557
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:51,511
Let's get started.

558
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:57,141
There's a lot of internal bleeding.
We'll see a lot of blood when I open him.

559
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,936
Ms. Oh, prepare as much large tape
as you can.

560
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,604
Get several abdominal suction tubes, too.

561
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:02,897
ABDOMINAL CAVITY SUCTION DEVICE

562
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,023
Scalpel.

563
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,609
Suction.

564
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:12,407
Bovie.

565
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,628
His BP is dropping.

566
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,006
Give me the large tape.

567
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,883
Suction. Don't stop.

568
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,601
We're starting to see something.

569
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,354
We'll finish the splenectomy
within five minutes.

570
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,397
SPLEEN REMOVAL

571
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,607
-Five minutes?
-Splenic artery.

572
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,608
ARTERY IN THE SPLEEN

573
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,901
Forceps.

574
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,696
Right angle.

575
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,408
One more right angle.

576
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:58,703
Scissors.

577
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,581
How can he be so speedy?

578
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,001
What are you doing?
Will you stand there watching?

579
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,004
Tie.

580
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,065
I'm sorry. One more.

581
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,948
You said you're good at operating.

582
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:39,118
Were you bluffing
when this is all you can do?

583
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,663
Cut.

584
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,042
Clip.

585
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,006
Bovie.

586
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,729
Let's move on to the liver.

587
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,066
Bovie.

588
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:19,450
Wow, he's really quick.

589
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,287
That's why he's called Master Hands.

590
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,210
Dr. Cha, get ready and come in.

591
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,169
Okay.

592
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:43,266
There's too much bleeding.
His liver seems to be almost severed.

593
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,559
Bipolar bovie.

594
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,982
-Tie.
-I'll do it.

595
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:05,872
Cut.

596
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,083
Bipolar bovie.

597
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,254
Bovie.

598
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,466
Suture.

599
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,139
He keeps bleeding as I suture.

600
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:24,849
It's because of the aspirin.

601
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,309
Aspirin?

602
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,728
Cut.

603
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,647
If he's taking aspirin
on top of this much bleeding,

604
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,608
how does he plan on stopping this?

605
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:34,901
Clip.

606
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:38,029
You can't stop the bleeding of small veins
with a clip.

607
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,740
I'll use topical hemostatic agents,

608
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:43,492
pack him up, and suture the area
on our second look.

609
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:47,872
I've never heard of such an operation.
Should I keep following him?

610
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,167
Gauze.

611
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,671
CS.

612
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,007
-Are you in here, CS?
-I am.

613
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,843
-Get the tube in there.
-Yes, sir. Tube, please.

614
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,222
Scalpel.

615
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,352
Let's make this work, Eun-jae.
You can do it.

616
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,774
Kelly forceps.

617
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,082
How many mils?

618
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,627
It's 600 ml.

619
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,798
It's 600.

620
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,217
There must be another bleeding point.

621
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,677
What should we do, Dr. Kim?

622
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:51,811
It's 800 ml.

623
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,901
OPERATION TIME, CURRENT TIME

624
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,611
TIME UNDER ANESTHESIA

625
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,854
What is he going to do? Will he…

626
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,440
Doctor Kim.

627
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,109
Doctor Kim.

628
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:44,780
Is this surgery

629
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,741
going to fail?

630
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,954
The intercostal vessel.

631
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,622
VESSELS BETWEEN TWO RIBS

632
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:55,875
Let's open his chest first.

633
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:57,585
We'll see from there.

634
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,421
-But there's no indication that--
-It's the aspirin.

635
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:02,298
The blood won't clot.

636
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,800
We have to save every drop we can.

637
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,594
Dr. Nam, his vitals?

638
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,805
The transfusion is still keeping up,
so it's stable at around 80.

639
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:13,309
Let's get the patient
in the right semi-decubitus position.

640
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,770
TO POSITION RIGHT SIDE HIGHER

641
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:20,107
What? Everyone's going along
with this madness?

642
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,261
Dr. Cha, are you all right?

643
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,304
Yes.

644
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,390
I'm sorry.

645
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,474
I…

646
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,185
Seo Woo-jin. Move.

647
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:06,404
Scalpel.

648
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:14,328
Retractor.

649
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,385
OPERATING ROOM

650
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:35,724
Suction.

651
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:38,561
Suction!

652
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,611
Found it.

653
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:50,489
No way.

654
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,741
It was intercostal vessel bleeding.

655
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:54,618
This man…

656
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:56,912
He's really crazy.

657
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:58,789
Clip.

658
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,633
Dr. Cha.

659
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,138
Are you feeling ill?

660
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:17,391
Dr. Cha!

661
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,601
I'm okay.

662
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,061
I'm fine.

663
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,704
MILITARY POLICE

664
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:40,623
He went into the ICU a little while ago.

665
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,626
Yes, of course.

666
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,044
We should wait a bit.

667
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:46,837
Right.

668
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:56,305
His vitals aren't dropping anymore.
They're stable for now.

669
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:58,182
Watch him closely.

670
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:00,226
If his vitals become
even slightly unstable,

671
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,853
or if you notice anything unusual,
call me right away.

672
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,444
Call me, okay?

673
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:13,864
Yes, sir.

674
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,992
I'll keep checking in on him, too.

675
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,578
All right. Thanks. That would be great.

676
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:20,955
No problem.

677
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,716
-Dr. Jung.
-Hello.

678
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,760
How's the other patient doing?

679
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:37,429
-Did you say he's the aide-de-camp?
-Yes. The CT scan shows

680
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:40,766
that his spleen is slightly damaged,
but the capsule isn't ruptured.

681
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:44,645
The bleeding is minimal,
so we'll observe him in the ICU for now.

682
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:47,314
The bleeding might suddenly get worse.

683
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,192
Then he'll need surgery right away,
so watch him closely.

684
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:51,777
-Yes, sir.
-Keep up the great work.

685
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,861
Thank you.

686
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,082
My name is Jang Gi-tae.

687
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:07,876
Would you like to drink something?
Here, it's complimentary.

688
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:10,629
Oh, would you like to drink something?

689
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,298
I guess not.

690
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:15,175
I'm Head Administrator Jang Gi-tae.
Yes, please help yourself.

691
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,177
-The minister will be okay.
-Mr. Jang.

692
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,263
-Spare me a second.
-What's wrong?

693
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,723
Well…

694
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,017
You need to see this.

695
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:30,941
GENERAL SURGERY, PARK MIN-GOOK

696
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,319
Hello, Park Min-gook speaking.

697
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:35,863
This is Do Yun-wan, the chairman.

698
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,573
Oh, hello, sir.

699
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,366
How can I help you?

700
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,707
MINISTER RYU INJURED IN TRAFFIC ACCIDENT

701
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,584
Yes, I'm reading it now.

702
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,961
It hasn't been disclosed yet,

703
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,173
but he's at Doldam Hospital now.

704
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,759
He was in critical condition,

705
00:43:56,842 --> 00:44:00,012
so I heard Bu Yong-ju operated on him.

706
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,266
But all his aides and staff

707
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,810
are incredibly concerned.

708
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:16,945
What is it

709
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:18,989
that you want to say?

710
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,199
With that said,

711
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:24,495
since you're our most competent doctor,

712
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:28,332
I'd like to recommend you as his doctor.

713
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,253
What do you think?

714
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:48,435
What are you doing here?
I told you to stay in the ICU.

715
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,859
What is it? What's the matter?

716
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,699
The intercostal vessel bleeding earlier…

717
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,200
VESSELS BETWEEN TWO RIBS

718
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:04,993
How certain of it were you?

719
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,412
What do you mean?

720
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:10,165
It's the defense minister,
not just anybody.

721
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,419
Shouldn't you have taken a safer route?

722
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:18,799
Regardless of who he is, what he does,
and what his position is,

723
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:22,136
he's just another patient to me
once he's in the operating room.

724
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,554
I don't think about anything else.

725
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:26,390
This is all I think about,
from beginning to end.

726
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:29,810
"I must save this person.
I will save this patient no matter what."

727
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:33,897
Are you saying we can do anything
to save him?

728
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,775
He entrusted his life to me
because he wants to live.

729
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,610
We must save him, of course.

730
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:43,615
That's why you performed
such a reckless surgery?

731
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:44,992
What?

732
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:49,747
Without even seeing his CT scan,
you knew it was his intercostal vessel.

733
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,124
It was all based on your gut instinct
and luck.

734
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:55,085
What if your instincts were wrong
and Lady Luck wasn't on your side?

735
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,880
Then the minister…
What would have happened to him?

736
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,175
What is this about?

737
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,261
Why are you suddenly acting like a doctor?

738
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:07,514
I thought you were here
for the ten million won.

739
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,349
Exactly.

740
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:12,603
I'm here because I desperately need money,

741
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,397
but after watching that operation,

742
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,357
I'm a little scared

743
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:20,235
that I might be holding on
to another rotten lifeline.

744
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:25,240
Who says I'm your lifeline?

745
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:28,076
I haven't decided on anything yet.

746
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,040
You promised me a full week,
and not even a day has passed yet.

747
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,584
You haven't changed my decision at all.

748
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:36,960
Do you realize that?

749
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:40,672
Just my gut instinct and luck?

750
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:44,885
If that was all you could see,

751
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,138
it means you're not any better after all.

752
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,599
What do you mean by that?

753
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,017
It is your job

754
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,186
to find the answer.

755
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:07,908
STAFF ONLY

756
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,159
Good work.

757
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,328
We got over a big hurdle.

758
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:13,956
It's too early to say.

759
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:16,959
I just stopped the bleeding. That's all.

760
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:19,586
Don't be so modest.

761
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,172
I know how competent you are as a doctor.

762
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:27,803
Right, that guy we talked about.
Did you meet him?

763
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:32,599
Yes. Actually,
he was in the OR with me earlier.

764
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,560
He's an incredibly skilled surgeon.

765
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,270
Well, I don't know.

766
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,730
Maybe he just likes to bluff and show off.

767
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,653
It is our job to groom someone like him

768
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:46,446
into a true doctor.

769
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,325
I'll be in touch.

770
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,257

THE COUPLE WAS FOUND DEAD

775
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:18,270
WHY SUCH AN EXTREME DECISION?

776
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,480
WHY SUCH AN EXTREME DECISION?

777
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:53,513
Gosh…

778
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,658
Dr. Cha.

779
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:16,787
What are you doing here?

780
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,414
Oh, I came to see Doctor Kim.

781
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,750
-Is he not in his office?
-It's not that.

782
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,418
He is in his office,

783
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,879
but he seems pretty busy.

784
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:46,984
Why are you standing there like that?

785
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,861
You said you have something to tell me.

786
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:51,405
Say it.

787
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,074
Well…

788
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:58,870
The thing is,

789
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,999
my stomach was upset because
of the bread I had in the morning.

790
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:05,293
I should've taken better care of myself
before the surgery.

791
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,504
I let that happen during my first surgery.

792
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:08,714
I apologize.

793
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:10,549
I feel horrible.

794
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:20,600
Well, you seem busy,
so I'll leave you to it.

795
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,105
Why did you come to our hospital?

796
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:28,567
-Pardon me?
-What kind of mistake did you make

797
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,610
to get kicked out and end up here?

798
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:33,989
I didn't get kicked out.

799
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:36,158
There are only two options.

800
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,118
I'll have to either suspend you,

801
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,995
or I'll have to transfer you.

802
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:41,621
Transfer me? To where?

803
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,999
Doldam Hospital in Jeongseon.

804
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,877
This was my choice.

805
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,545
Is that your habit or what?

806
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:54,426
Why do you keep beating around the bush
instead of answering my questions?

807
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,470
I never did that.

808
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,812
Why can't you be honest and admit it?

809
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,564
Is it that hard for you?

810
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:09,441
Why?

811
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:13,862
Because of your pride? Or because
people might look down on you?

812
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:17,282
I'm not really following, sir.

813
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,078
Right, I'm not surprised.

814
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,831
You're the way you are
because you're clueless.

815
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:33,256
As of this moment,
you're banned from my OR.

816
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:38,845
I can't work with a surgeon
who runs out in the middle of the surgery.

817
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:41,932
As I explained, I had an upset stomach…

818
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:45,769
Don't even think about making excuses.

819
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:49,523
Doctors can't bring their personal issues
into the OR.

820
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:53,610
I don't care whether you were feeling sick
or vomited because of anxiety.

821
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:57,197
Leaving your patient
is enough to disqualify you as a doctor.

822
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,115
Understood?

823
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:02,119
How could a cardiac surgeon
work with such a mindset?

824
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,831
Hey, how dare you even think
to operate on patients?

825
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:07,666
Who are you trying to kill?

826
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:10,752
Get over it, or just quit being a doctor!

827
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,391
DOCTOR KIM

828
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,322
Did you have to be so harsh on her?

829
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:23,533
You could've said it in a nicer way.

830
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:27,579
Gosh, what a complete mess. Both of them.

831
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:30,874
One is going into the OR because of money,

832
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:37,047
and the other one left her patient
and ran out of the OR.

833
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:42,552
Young doctors these days won't learn
if you push them hard like that.

834
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,763
They'll just call you a stuffy old man.

835
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:49,976
Are you saying I should hold my tongue
and sugarcoat my opinions?

836
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:53,605
I can't do that, Ms. Oh.
I don't even have the time to do that.

837
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,692
What will you do if both of them
decide to pack up and leave?

838
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,529
Then I guess

839
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:04,741
they weren't suited for our hospital
to begin with.

840
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:07,535
It wasn't easy to bring them here.

841
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:10,038
Am I wrong?

842
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:31,601
Have some water.

843
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:34,104
Thank you, Dr. Yoon.

844
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:42,779
I'm usually not like this.

845
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,076
You see,

846
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:51,413
I worked so hard to get here.

847
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,124
Since getting into med school,

848
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,751
I've never slept
more than four hours a day.

849
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,171
When everyone else was eating and pooping,

850
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:03,633
I was constipated because
I was always stuck in the library.

851
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,176
I studied nonstop.

852
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:08,263
I bet I've shed about a liter of blood
from my nose.

853
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:11,016
I worked so hard to graduate second
in my class,

854
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,852
and I finished third place
in the CS department.

855
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:16,604
But now…

856
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:18,857
At this

857
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:21,109
small hospital in the countryside,

858
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:23,987
I was told to quit being a doctor.

859
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:28,408
Gosh, I'm sure he didn't really mean it.

860
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:30,410
It's so unfair.

861
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:32,162
I feel sorry for myself

862
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:34,622
for spending all those years
just to become a doctor,

863
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:39,252
and I feel like all my hard work
was for nothing.

864
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,798
Come on. Don't think like that.

865
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,759
You're our role model.

866
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,802
Who?

867
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:49,679
Me?

868
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:55,310
Everyone knows that
Professor Oh in CS is sexist.

869
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:59,564
Watching you hold your head up high
under him

870
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:03,651
impressed us all and made us think
we should be half as good as you are.

871
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:06,571
So many female doctors look up to you.

872
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:07,781
Also,

873
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:10,700
you were recruited by the genius doctor.

874
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:14,412
Recruited?

875
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:16,581
Who?

876
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,875
I bet you still don't know

877
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:22,128
who brought you to this hospital.

878
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:26,174
Geez, I thought I had someone useful
for a change.

879
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:28,885
She's a girl,

880
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:31,262
but she's smarter than most guys.

881
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:32,514
She got good grades, too.

882
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,975
And her research paper is better
than some professors'.

883
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,937
Why does she get so tense in the OR?

884
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:39,938
Goodness.

885
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:43,775
She's a second-year fellow, right?

886
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,653
Why don't you send her to me?

887
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:51,616
A CS who can't even go into the OR?
Why would you take her?

888
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:54,202
If she causes trouble in the OR,

889
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,746
she'll really be doomed.

890
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,958
-Right, so why don't you send her to me?
-Goodness.

891
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:07,090
Gosh, no way.

892
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:10,385
It's true. I saw and heard it myself.

893
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,305
They won't last long, right?

894
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:17,058
Which one, Seo Woo-jin or Cha Eun-jae?

895
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:19,477
Both of them.

896
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:22,105
Why do you think so?

897
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:24,441
Well, young people these days

898
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:27,235
aren't exactly fond of people
like Doctor Kim.

899
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:31,739
They don't like to be corrected
and hate it when someone's being nosy.

900
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,950
"I just need to do my job."

901
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,618
They draw a clear line like that.

902
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:39,080
That's not always the case though.

903
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:41,791
Some young doctors are very hardworking.

904
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:44,419
Dr. Seo

905
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:47,255
has fast hands. He's quite competent.

906
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:48,798
Right?

907
00:57:58,266 --> 00:57:59,559
Oh, there you are.

908
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:02,437
-I've been looking for you.
-Me?

909
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,773
Yes, here.
Medicine for pain and inflammation.

910
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:07,817
I was told to give you this.

911
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:09,611
By whom?

912
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:10,612
Well…

913
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:12,822
I was asked not to tell, by Doctor Kim.

914
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,199
Gosh.

915
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,914
MEDICINE

916
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:27,295
Hey, Dr. Seo.

917
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:32,175
I already called the X-ray department.
Go there now and get a chest X-ray done.

918
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:33,885
X-ray?

919
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:36,304
I was told to check for bone fractures.

920
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,557
-By whom?
-Doctor Kim.

921
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:43,061
He said you were in a lot of pain
in the OR.

TREATMENT ROOM 2

924
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:05,041
Just my gut instinct and luck?

925
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:07,544
If that was all you could see,

926
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,838
it means you're not any better after all.

927
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:13,007
What do you mean by that?

928
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,634
It is your job

929
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:16,886
to find the answer.

DOLDAM HOSPITAL

934
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:07,979
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

935
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,359
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

936
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:19,699
Yes. I'm doing fine, of course.

937
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:22,452
The hospital is nicer than I expected.

938
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,454
What?

939
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,164
What about my voice?

940
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:29,709
No, I did not cry.

941
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:33,671
You know, the temperature drops at night
in the countryside.

942
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:36,090
I guess that's why I have a stuffy nose.

943
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:40,678
Gosh, I'm fine.

944
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:44,015
I operated on the defense minister
on my first day.

945
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:48,603
All the doctors here are already saying
the hospital absolutely needs me.

946
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:52,857
I have to go, Mom.
Okay, I'll call you back later.

947
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,318
Which one do you want?

948
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:58,363
Coffee with milk and sugar.

949
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,031
CAFE AU LAIT

950
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:06,621
How's your stomach?

951
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:09,123
-Are you feeling better?
-What?

952
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:12,168
Yes, of course. I'm fine.

953
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:22,428
Want to take this one?

954
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,138
No, I only drink black coffee.

955
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,310
BLACK COFFEE

956
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:47,370
-Later, then.
-All right, later.

957
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:51,874
Hey.

958
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:53,960
About Doctor Kim…

959
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:56,045
What do you think of him?

960
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:59,882
I was told to give you this.

961
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:00,842
By Doctor Kim.

962
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:02,844
Go there now and get a chest X-ray done.

963
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:05,555
-By whom?
-Doctor Kim.

964
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:11,269
Who cares what he's like?
I just need to make money.

965
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:16,607
-Why do you ask?
-I was just curious.

966
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,402
Is he just a cranky old man?

967
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:21,654
-Or…
-Or what?

968
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:27,326
Never mind. See you.

969
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:55,354
Dr. Seo, we need you for a minute.

970
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:58,441
What? Who's here?

971
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:02,028
Professor Park Min-gook is here
from the head hospital in Seoul.

972
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:04,489
But he didn't come alone.

973
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:16,959
Professor.

974
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,379
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

975
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:39,273
Nice to meet you.

976
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:42,693
I'm surgeon Park Min-gook
from Geosan Hospital.

977
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:47,824
How can we help you?

978
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:48,783
Well,

979
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:53,204
Chairman Do hasn't called you yet?

980
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,207
He must be referring to President Do.

981
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:58,543
What about him?

982
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:00,211
What did he say?

983
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:01,879
He put me in charge

984
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,549
of everything regarding Minister Ryu,

985
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:06,634
as of this moment.

986
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:10,054
He said that to you?

987
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:12,765
I operated on the patient,

988
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:15,101
and he'll transfer him to you
without my approval?

989
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:18,104
That's right. I said that.

990
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:24,902
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

991
01:04:29,156 --> 01:04:30,157
It's been a long time.

992
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:32,660
How have you been?

993
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:36,581
Gosh, you sly, obnoxious jerk.

994
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,794
You really came back.

995
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,379
I said I would.

996
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:46,841
You got kicked out in such disgrace.

997
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:49,927
You should lie low and live in hiding.

998
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:52,930
There's nothing for you to take here.
Why come back?

999
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:54,599
Are you that bored?

1000
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:56,517
I'm back because I have so much to do.

1001
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:58,060
But then again,

1002
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:00,271
what would you even know?

1003
01:05:01,188 --> 01:05:03,149
You don't know how power or politics work

1004
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:05,443
and refuse to be part of it.

1005
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:09,822
But I do know who is leeching off others

1006
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,741
like a parasite.

1007
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:18,247
Watch your words.

1008
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:22,209
I am the chairman
of the Geosan University Foundation.

1009
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:23,711
What's he saying?

1010
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:25,922
-He's now the chairman.
-What?

1011
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:28,716
He's the foundation chairman.

1012
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:30,676
He is?

1013
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:33,804
So what?

1014
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:39,143
What do you want me to do about it?

1015
01:05:39,852 --> 01:05:41,145
As of this moment,

1016
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:45,232
all medical treatment for Minister Ryu

1017
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:49,820
will be overseen by Professor Park here.

1018
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:53,199
Make sure no one at Doldam Hospital

1019
01:05:54,158 --> 01:05:56,243
gets in his way.

1020
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:57,828
If you don't do as I say,

1021
01:05:58,829 --> 01:06:01,123
you'll be reprimanded accordingly.

1022
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:02,875
But what if

1023
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:06,045
I do not agree to that as his doctor?

1024
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:09,840
We don't need your agreement.

1025
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:13,010
You can either obey my orders,

1026
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:15,721
or you can leave.

1027
01:06:18,015 --> 01:06:19,225
So, what will you choose?

1028
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:20,601
Your livelihood,

1029
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:22,937
or pride?

1030
01:06:40,287 --> 01:06:41,414
Dr. Nam!

1031
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:44,083
-Dr. Nam.
-What's up?

1032
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:46,585
Well…

1033
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:49,755
I saw cars from broadcasting stations
driving by.

1034
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,091
From broadcasting stations?

1035
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:54,176
Are they shooting a TV show here?

1036
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:55,761
But they were all headed

1037
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:58,806
to Doldam Hospital.

1038
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:01,475
Doldam…

1039
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,482
Oh, she must work at the hospital.

1040
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:10,026
-Wait!
-Stop her!

1041
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:11,777
-Get her!
-Excuse me.

1042
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:13,404
How is Minister Ryu?

1043
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:14,488
Over here!

1044
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:16,198
Is it true that he's here?

1045
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:18,576
Is the defense minister here now?

1046
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:20,369
How serious is his injury?

1047
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:23,330
Is it true that he had surgery?
How critical is his condition?

1048
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:24,707
-Say a few words…
-Wait!

1049
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:26,500
-Follow her!
-Come on!

1050
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,962
His BP is hovering around 90 over 60,

1051
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:32,048
but his temperature went up
to 38.9 degrees.

1052
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:33,966
What about his urine?

1053
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,010
About 10 to 15 ml per hour.

1054
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:38,846
Put him on propacetamol
and get a chest portable.

1055
01:07:38,929 --> 01:07:40,848
Monitor his input, output,
and temperature.

1056
01:07:40,931 --> 01:07:42,516
-I'll call Doctor Kim.
-Got it.

1057
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:51,192
Seo Woo-jin?

1058
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:53,402
You work here now?

1059
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:57,114
What brings you here?

1060
01:07:57,198 --> 01:07:59,784
I'm Minister Ryu's doctor now.

1061
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:04,246
I'm sorry,

1062
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:07,166
but I've heard nothing about this.

1063
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:10,377
The decision was made just now,
so you'll hear about it shortly.

1064
01:08:10,961 --> 01:08:14,006
Hand everything over to Dr. Yang
and step aside.

1065
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:18,010
I can't leave the patient until his doctor

1066
01:08:18,677 --> 01:08:20,137
tells me to do so.

1067
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:22,223
Hey, Seo Woo-jin.

1068
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:24,016
Dr. Seo!

1069
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,768
His BP is dropping.

1070
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:31,899
Didn't you hear what Professor Park said?

1071
01:08:31,982 --> 01:08:34,652
He is now Minister Ryu's doctor.

1072
01:08:34,735 --> 01:08:36,278
Get out of our way, okay?

1073
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:39,031
I can't leave the patient
unless his operating surgeon tells me to.

1074
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:41,075
You little… What's your problem?

1075
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:45,663
-Tell us…
-Just a comment!

1076
01:08:46,705 --> 01:08:49,500
There are so many reporters outside.
What do we do?

1077
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:52,336
They're asking how Minister Ryu is doing.

1078
01:08:52,711 --> 01:08:53,546
Doctor Kim.

1079
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:56,632
Did you call them?

1080
01:08:57,466 --> 01:09:00,094
Wait and see.
Things will get very interesting.

1081
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,346
Gosh! What should we do?

1082
01:09:02,429 --> 01:09:03,430
Doctor Kim!

1083
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:21,532
-Tell us!
-How's Minister Ryu now?

1084
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:57,276
EPILOGUE

1085
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,403
Want to take this one?

1086
01:09:59,486 --> 01:10:01,113
No, I only drink black coffee.

1087
01:10:03,407 --> 01:10:04,450
I won't…

1088
01:10:05,409 --> 01:10:06,535
carry you this time.

1089
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:11,540
-My gosh.
-Dr. Cha.

1090
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:12,625
Cha Eun-jae!

1091
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:20,007
Darn it.

1092
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:22,551
Wake up, Eun-jae.

1093
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,233
-Later, then.
-All right, later.

1094
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:12,268
People of Doldam, those jerks
want an all-out war with us.

1095
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:14,019
Professor, here.

1096
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:15,187
-Why you…
-Please don't.

1097
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:16,730
Find out more about Cha Eun-jae.

1098
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:19,483
We can go back to the main hospital.

1099
01:11:19,566 --> 01:11:21,986
You'll really let them take Minister Ryu?

1100
01:11:22,069 --> 01:11:24,655
Will you take responsibility
if something goes wrong?

1101
01:11:24,738 --> 01:11:26,282
Can you save him?

1102
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:29,910
-Will you really not go back with me?
-What Do Yun-wan never considered.

1103
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:31,287
We must use it.

1104
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:35,291
But he already knows everything
about you and our hospital.

1105
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:37,543
There are things he doesn't know.
