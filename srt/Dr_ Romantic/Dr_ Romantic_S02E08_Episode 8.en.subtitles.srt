1
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:47,505
ICU, STAFF ONLY

2
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,676
POLICE

3
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,894
ICU, STAFF ONLY

4
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,606
TREAT PATIENTS LIKE YOUR FAMILY

5
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:11,946
I actually wanted to be a violinist.

6
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,868
But one day, my teacher said,

7
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,579
"You don't seem to be talented,

8
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,915
so you should just learn it as a hobby."

9
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,877
I cried for two days straight,
then gave up on my dream.

10
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,338
EMERGENCY ROOM

11
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,132
They were a married couple

12
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,384
who came in a few days ago

13
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,514
to the ER with their son who fell ill.

14
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,141
Then he suddenly became...

15
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,646
But I guess

16
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,273
I also didn't have the knack for this.

17
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:51,069
I should've known when I walked into

18
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,571
the anatomy dissection lab.

19
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,075
I should have...

20
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,370
run away back then.

21
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,676
But I should go, shouldn't I?

22
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,933
Let's go, Eun-jae.

23
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,997
You can't let this pass.

24
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,416
That Doctor Kim might be
the actual influence around here,

25
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,709
but he's just a chief surgeon.

26
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,919
How dare a chief
get an attitude with the president?

27
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,380
And in front of everyone,
as if he wanted all of them to see.

28
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,632
"Principle"? Give me a break.

29
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,635
You don't want to risk
ruining your reputation,

30
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,345
so you're just trying to avoid problems.

31
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,557
You cannot condone this type of behavior
in order to establish order around here.

32
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,768
You must show him who's the boss,
then take control within the hospital...

33
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,025
A huge fight broke out
between inmates in prison.

34
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:57,612
One of them had been on dialysis
and got his vein ripped during the fight.

35
00:03:59,072 --> 00:03:59,906
We have the patient.

36
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,532
-What's his condition?
-He's awake.

37
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,784
Into the hybrid room.

38
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,577
Be careful.

39
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,040
What? He's really young.

40
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,124
You're right.

41
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,960
He apparently murdered two people,

42
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,294
but he's younger than I thought.

43
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,796
-Nurse Um!
-Yes!

44
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,297
-Let's move the patient.
-Okay.

45
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,507
Wait a second.

46
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,634
Could you remove these?

47
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,058
We'll move him. One, two, three.

48
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,108
What are his vitals?

49
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,693
80 over 40, 110 BPM.

50
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,196
Full drop 300 ml of half-saline,
and bring two packs of RBC.

51
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,489
Should the half-saline be warm?

52
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,824
Yes, it should be.

53
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,285
He has ESRD,
so don't give him too much fluid.

54
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,370
Should I put the line on his right arm?

55
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,625
-Let's go with the right.
-Yes, ma'am.

56
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,586
The patient has end-stage renal failure.

57
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,800
Sir. How long have you been on dialysis?

58
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,012
Five years.

59
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,641
Ever since his kidney deteriorated
five years ago due to drug abuse,

60
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,728
he has been on dialysis three days a week,
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

61
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,441
Don't you think it's completely ripped?

62
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,026
-Doctor Jung.
-Yes?

63
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,611
We need to figure out his veins first,

64
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,071
so let's move him to the OR

65
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,782
-and stitch him up first.
-Yes, sir. And I'll give him

66
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,492
-a second-generation cephalosporin.
-Okay.

67
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,369
-More gauze and EB too.
-Yes, sir.

68
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,121
EB: ELASTIC BANDAGE

69
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,665
-Please call Doctor Cha.
-Yes, sir.

70
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,167
I'm here, Doctor Kim.

71
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,501
What's the patient's condition?

72
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:39,213
He's an ESRD patient who has been
on hemodialysis for five years.

73
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,799
His arteriovenous fistula is ripped.

74
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,134
He's an inmate

75
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,303
who's not very cooperative.

76
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,349
I don't think he can use
the ripped AV fistula again,

77
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,433
so just suture it.

78
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,144
Then we'll need to establish
another AVF for his dialysis.

79
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,855
Should I establish a temporary
hemodialysis catheter?

80
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,482
Yes, you should do that.

81
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:01,194
Then let's set up another date
for his AVF surgery on the other arm.

82
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,445
Yes, sir.

83
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,490
How are you doing?

84
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,078
Are you all right?

85
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,125
I'm trying hard to be okay.

86
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,462
Let it go as soon as possible.

87
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,589
It wasn't your fault, okay?

88
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,013
If something happens, call me right away.

89
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:31,599
Thank you...

90
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,728
for saying that.

91
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,867
Doctor Cha, should we move him to the OR?

92
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,494
Yes.

93
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,454
Nurse Park.

94
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,832
Will you come into the OR with me?

95
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:57,542
Yes, of course.

96
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,979
ONCE IN A WHILE

97
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,566
What?

98
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,445
Did he go somewhere?

99
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:30,825
ONCE IN A WHILE

100
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,292
There's an emergency patient.

101
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,587
He just needs his vein sutured
and the catheter inserted.

102
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,880
I won't be too late.

103
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:45,882
Okay.

104
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,853
Please excuse me.

105
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,108
He's tattooed to his inguinal.

106
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,902
Nurse Park, how does it look over there?

107
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,612
This side looks awful too.

108
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,779
Everything is infected.

109
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,991
Your neck is a mess too.

110
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:15,495
Where did you get these tattoos
that ended up getting this badly infected?

111
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,164
He probably did it in prison.

112
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,417
In prison?

113
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,086
Isn't that illegal?

114
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,797
I guess they still do it in secret
behind the guards' backs.

115
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,177
I have a friend
who got tattooed in prison.

116
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,763
You had such a friend?

117
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,893
If it weren't for Doctor Kim,
I don't know where I would be today.

118
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,396
Do you want to look at this side?

119
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,773
This side doesn't look as bad.

120
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,276
Yes, let's put it in here for now.

121
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,028
Did he get pre-op antibiotics?

122
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,154
Yes.

123
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,366
Sir, we'll insert a catheter
on this side of your neck.

124
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,992
Can you turn your head this way?

125
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,746
Sir.

126
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,207
You need this to get dialysis.

127
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,709
If this part also gets infected,

128
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,337
the only way you'll live is
by getting a kidney transplant, okay?

129
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,636
Who'd be willing to give
their kidney to a murderer?

130
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,598
Who?

131
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,475
That's why you need the catheter.

132
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:22,853
No one may give you a kidney,
but you still need to live.

133
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,356
You need to get a catheter in there
and continue the dialysis.

134
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,440
Turn your head.

135
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,611
Turn your head.

136
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,330
Stay still, sir.

137
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,207
Give me new gloves and drape him.

138
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,048
We have a patient!

139
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,678
WE HOPE TO SEE YOU HEALTHY

140
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,013
Did a paramedic get hurt?

141
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,473
This is Officer Choi Soon-young.

142
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,726
-What happened?
-She got hit on her head a few times

143
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,270
while trying to rescue
a drunk man around 5:00 p.m.

144
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,522
She suddenly collapsed 15 minutes ago

145
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,065
and has been unconscious since then.

146
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,817
Get her into the hybrid room.

147
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,110
Yes.

148
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,778
Nurse Um, call Doctor Kim.

149
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:13,779
Yes, ma'am.

150
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,867
Doctor Kim, this is the ER.

151
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:37,970
Ma'am.

152
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,513
Ma'am?

153
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,642
She's in a coma.

154
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,394
-And her vitals?
-100 over 60, 70 BPM.

155
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,730
-Give me a tube for intubation.
-Got it.

156
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:48,981
Give a liter of normal saline

157
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,524
in a line,
then get the OP lab done.

158
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,693
Here.

159
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,535
Fix it at 22 cm right here.

160
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,385
She's in arrest. I'll go up.

161
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,178
And 1 ml of epinephrine,
every 3 minutes.

162
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,096
Got it.

163
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,894
Ms. Oh, who is it again?

164
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,270
Officer Choi Soon-young.

165
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:31,148
She suddenly collapsed
and went unconscious.

166
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,360
I'll check her pulse.

167
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,364
ROSC?

168
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,408
ROSC: RETURN OF SPONTANEOUS CIRCULATION

169
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,784
She came back after one cycle.

170
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,119
And her vitals?

171
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,912
She's at 140 over 70, 110 BPM.

172
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:45,955
Ms. Oh.

173
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,791
Put her on a central line,

174
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,461
then hurry up and mix 500 ml of D5W
with 32 ml of norepinephrine

175
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,046
and give it to her at 10 ml per hour.

176
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,757
-Yes, sir.
-I'll do it.

177
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,884
We get the chest portable?

178
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,137
No, let's take the CT scan first.

179
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,639
We'll take the radiograph on our way back.

180
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,291
Both of her pupils are dilated.

181
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,917
PUPIL: THE CENTER OF THE IRIS

182
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,963
It's a problem with her brain, isn't it?

183
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,138
The central line is established.

184
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,556
We're ready to take the CT scan.

185
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,016
We'll take her.

186
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,650
Mr. Heo.

187
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,488
So have you reached her guardian?

188
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:04,116
Yes. She lives alone with her mother,
and we got a hold of her.

189
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,534
She's on her way.

190
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,913
Is she in critical condition?

191
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:12,041
I heard she suddenly collapsed.

192
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,085
What happened to her?

193
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,421
She was hit a few times on the head

194
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,924
while rescuing a drunk man who had fallen.

195
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,802
Sir, pull yourself together.

196
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,678
How much did you have to drink?

197
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:28,057
Stop annoying me. Go away.

198
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,810
It's a cold day today.
Why don't you get up?

199
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,187
Darn you. Who do you think you are

200
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,647
-to order me around?
-Goodness.

201
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,148
-Calm down.
-Let me go.

202
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,274
What's with you?

203
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,443
-Sir, calm down.
-Let me go.

204
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,736
-Let go.
-Sir, please.

205
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,946
-Calm down.
-Let me go.

206
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,615
She was fine for about two hours.

207
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,868
She suddenly didn't feel well
and started to throw up.

208
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,538
Then she collapsed and became unconscious.

209
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,122
It looks like...

210
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,459
there's a problem with her brain.

211
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,254
We'll have to check the CT scan,

212
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,506
but both of her pupils are...

213
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,217
already fully dilated.

214
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:04,468
-What?
-What?

215
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,360
My gosh.

216

ADULT ECHOGRAPHY

217
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,157
-Hold the probe like this.
-Okay.

218
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:28,784
Local anesthetic.

219
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,871
Sir, this will hurt a little.

220
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,122
It's okay to make a sound.

221
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,254
Catheter, please.

222
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,636
You can take the probe off.

223
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,972
SONOGRAPHY PROBE: ULTRASOUND TRANSDUCER

224
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,154
It'll ache a little.

225
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,159
We're done. We just need to fix it.

226
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:11,994
You're good.

227
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,623
Nylon, please.

228
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,879
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

229
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,468
We're here. This way.

230
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,179
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

231
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,849
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

232
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,270
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

233
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,271
In here.

234
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,108
-Ma'am.
-Goodness,

235
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,485
you're all here.

236
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,280
I heard Soon-young is hurt. What happened?

237
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,449
How badly is she hurt?

238
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,118
Well, ma'am...

239
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,995
Why? Is she in serious condition?

240
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:02,962
Where is

241
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,422
Soon-young right now?

242
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,299
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

243
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:09,843
There is...

244
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,262
no way to help her.

245
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,848
Is this an SAH case?

246
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,392
SAH: SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE

247
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,893
It is a SAH case,

248
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,729
but it wasn't caused by the impact.

249
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,398
Was it spontaneous?

250
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,565
But it isn't

251
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,860
completely unrelated to the impact.

252
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,615
How's Ms. Choi's condition?

253
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,451
She has no voluntary movement
or brainstem signs.

254
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,161
BRAINSTEM SIGN: NORMAL NERVE REFLEXES

255
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,128
Doctor Kim.

256
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,547
Ms. Choi's mother is here.

257
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,436
Doctor.

258
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:06,233
I heard Soon-young
is in critical condition.

259
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,160
We took a CT scan,

260
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:22,207
and it looks like
there was bleeding in her brain.

261
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,589
If she gets surgery,

262
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,050
will she live?

263
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,387
She's a rather healthy girl.

264
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:40,392
We'll have to keep an eye on her,

265
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,979
but it doesn't look...

266
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,025
very positive at the moment.

267
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,989
But can you

268
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,117
still operate on her?

269
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:01,580
Everyone around here knows
that you can save

270
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,166
just about anyone.

271
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,504
Can you please...

272
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:18,180
operate on Soon-young too?

273
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,349
Please?

274
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,145
I'm sorry.

275
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:31,735
There is nothing...

276
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,239
I can do right now.

277
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,532
I'm sorry, ma'am.

278
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,825
I'm sorry.

279
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,730
Hey, Soon-young.

280
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,235
It's me, Mom.

281
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:21,910
My baby.

282
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:32,212
Oh, goodness, my daughter.

283
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,053
Oh, my goodness.

284
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,310
Soon-young.

285
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,371
My baby.

286
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,628
NURSING DEPARTMENT

287
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:50,958
What's wrong?

288
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,417
Did something happen?

289
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,589
A paramedic came in with a head injury,

290
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,466
and it was a SAH case.

291
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,010
She shows no voluntary movement

292
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,470
or brainstem signs.

293
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,556
Brain death?

294
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,353
Yes.

295
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:12,771
It looks like it.

296
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,358
I see.

297
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:21,071
I just inserted a catheter
into the neck of a lifer.

298
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,950
He killed two people,

299
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,412
and it doesn't look like
he wants to live either.

300
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:33,625
I stood there wondering why I'm trying
so hard to save a man like him.

301
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,636
That means you're a talented surgeon.

302
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:49,016
I'm a talented surgeon?

303
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:50,809
See that?

304
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,978
You treated him even after an attack.

305
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,731
A doctor needs that kind of attitude.

306
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,859
Having good skills doesn't equal talent.

307
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:01,903
Is that so?

308
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:07,617
Do you think so?

Moon-jung.

316
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,644
-Are you leaving?
-Yes, what about you?

317
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,396
I'm waiting for Eun-jae.

318
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,231
Why? Is something going on?

319
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,400
You said you'd buy me a bite and a drink.

320
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,859
Do you want to do it today?

321
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,247
Why do we have so much food?

322
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,915
Hey, come in, Nurse Park.

323
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:38,667
Come in.

324
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,585
Wait, we need spoons and chopsticks.

325
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,504
Are you done with the lifer's operation?

326
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:43,505
Yes.

327
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,799
By any chance, was anyone here already?

328
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,801
Who? No one was here.

329
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,345
Were you going to meet someone here?

330
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,389
Yes, something like that.

331
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,517
-Here.
-Goodness.

332
00:23:58,186 --> 00:23:59,271
I'm a little late.

333
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:00,272
Doctor Jung, come in.

334
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,816
Have some hearty soup to warm you up.

335
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,609
Nurse Park, just grab a seat already.

336
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:05,735
Yes, Nurse Park.

337
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:06,862
Let's grab a drink once.

338
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,447
Come on, take a seat.

339
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,573
One second, please.

340
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,284
Here.

341
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,959
Doctor Yoon, where are you?

342
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,711
I'm at the hospital.

343
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:23,795
Where are you?

344
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,173
I'm at the pub.

345
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,049
Why did you go back there?

346
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,136
Oh, Mr. Nam wasn't around,

347
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,680
the door was locked,
and the weather was cold.

348
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,683
That's when someone asked
for directions to Doldam Hospital,

349
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,560
so I came by to show her the way.

350
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,563
I thought you were still operating.

351
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:42,814
Nurse Park.

352
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,816
What are you doing? It's cold.

353
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,859
Come inside.

354
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,278
Is that Mr. Jang?

355
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,946
Yes.

356
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,824
The ER Team is here to grab a drink.

357
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,701
I see.

358
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,953
Then you should grab a drink with them.

359
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,039
What about you?

360
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,042
We can set another date.

361
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,377
Nurse Park, why aren't you coming in?

362
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:05,879
The soup is getting cold.

363
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,092
You should go.

364
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,427
I'll hang up.

365
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,862
This must be a great place.

366
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:31,905
It's really good.

367
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,365
Have some wine too.

368
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,583
Wow, this is amazing.

369
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,876
It's really great.

370
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,796
Do you know a little about wine?

371
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,173
Of course, I don't.

372
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,510
I'm actually an avid soju drinker.

373
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,137
I like soju with beer.

374
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:03,186
Are you close with Doctor Seo?

375
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:04,604
I'm not sure.

376
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:08,233
I'm not sure if we're close
or if we're just used to each other.

377
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:12,070
But I've known him since med school,
so I know what he's like.

378
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:13,697
Then

379
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:18,326
do you know how his parents
passed away?

380
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:21,288
What?

381
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,707
I think he was in middle school...

382
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,169
when they passed away
in an unfortunate incident.

383
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:35,010
You didn't know.

384
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,304
No.

385
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,055
Not at all.

386
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:43,768
Does it sting?

387
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:50,191
I figured he wasn't from a rich family.

388
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,651
Call me if anything happens.

389
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:52,652
Okay.

390
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,589
I presumed that
there must be a reason

391
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,674
behind his cold and difficult personality.

392
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,810
MILK

393
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,939
But I never would've thought

394
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:34,444
that he'd lived his whole life
all alone, without any family.

395
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,116
Doctor Yoon?

396
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,202
Why are you still here?

397
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:43,578
Hey, Doctor Seo.

398
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:44,954
I'm glad you're here.

399
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,373
I ordered some chicken.

400
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,582
Do you want some?

401
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:50,877
-All right!
-Cheers!

402
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,337
Great work, everyone!

403
00:27:56,675 --> 00:28:00,053
Why isn't Nurse Park coming in?

404
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:02,555
I'm not sure. He was on the phone.

405
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:03,973
Gosh, that's good.

406
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,433
That's so refreshing.

407
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,436
I can give you as many refills
as you want, so eat up, everyone.

408
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,437
-Okay.
-Okay.

409
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,400
What's wrong? Who texted you?

410
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,442
What?

411
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,194
No, it's nothing.

412
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:19,698
Wait, are you dating someone, Mr. Jang?

413
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,075
Really?

414
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,411
Stop making me feel worse.

415
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,663
It would be so great
if that were the case.

416
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,039
Darn it.

417
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,667
Where are you going? Hey!

418
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,211
I'm going to the bathroom.

419
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,046
The washroom. The toilet.

420
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,339
My gosh, man.

421
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:37,424
"The toilet"?

422
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,134
He has been looking nice lately.

423
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,094
I think you are dating someone. You are!

424
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,053
I think so too!

425
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,015
Yes. It's me, Mr. Jang.

426
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:47,642
Where are you again?

427
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,394
Yes, I know. Okay.

428
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,062
I'll be there. Yes.

429
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,272
Taxi!

430
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,401
I had no idea.

431
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,906
One day, I was passing by his office,

432
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,366
and I saw Doctor Bae in there

433
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,118
putting some bones together.

434
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,620
I think it was from the chicken he had.

435
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,289
Isn't that amazing?

436
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,250
Should we give him these too?

437
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,086
Yes, I think he'll be thrilled.

438
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,429
I couldn't find a taxi.

439
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,435
You should catch your breath.

440
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,187
Thank you.

441
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,399
Goodness.

442
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,947
Anyway, why did you

443
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:46,868
want to see me this late at night?

444
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:50,330
We needed someone to discuss
the matters of the hospital with,

445
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,707
and Mr. Jang, there is

446
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,376
no one else knows
Doldam Hospital as well as you.

447
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,837
Well, that is true.

448
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,469
Anyway,

449
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,846
what were you discussing?

450
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,056
To be honest,

451
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:12,852
President Park and I both think
Doldam Hospital is in serious condition.

452
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,605
The system where every decision is

453
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,776
spontaneously made only according
to that so-called Doctor Kim is

454
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,154
not only dangerous
but also completely absurd.

455
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:26,282
It's because we have a shortage of people

456
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,910
but a huge number of trauma patients.

457
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,995
-We couldn't help--
-President Park

458
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:35,375
wishes to create a more reasonable
and methodical system.

459
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:39,838
In order to do that,
it's important to gain control early on.

460
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,841
"Gain control early on"?

461
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,092
Here.

462
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,553
We need to change the system

463
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,847
that revolves around Doctor Kim

464
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,516
to one with President Park in the center.

465
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,185
Are you saying

466
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,938
you want to show him who's boss?

467
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,274
Do you have any good ideas?

468
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,704
If you are looking for something

469
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,706
that would quickly make a bold statement,

470
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,627
you would have to go with money.

471
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,172
It's great to have goodwill,
and of course, justice is important.

472
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:27,552
But the biggest secret that holds the key
to all human emotions is

473
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,346
none other than money.

474
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,599
Money.

475
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,601
What? Money.

476
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,519
That's why

477
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,355
we wish to give everyone a raise.

478
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,775
As our first measure,

479
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,944
we will raise

480
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,864
your current salary by five percent.

481
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,616
Also, we will raise

482
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:53,244
your overtime pay by five percent.

483
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:54,829
-Thank you!
-Yes!

484
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,831
-Thank you!
-All right!

485
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,333
That's awesome!

486
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,251
He's using a few pennies

487
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,463
to erase the fact
that President Yeo was ever here.

488
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:04,964
That can't be right.

489
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:08,676
People don't get forgotten
that easily over some money, Ms. Oh.

490
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,178
-Park Min-gook!
-Park Min-gook!

491
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,305
But why does it feel so menacing?

492
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:13,765
-Park Min-gook!
-Park Min-gook!

493
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:14,766
Park Min-gook!

494
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:15,975
Park Min-gook!

495
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:16,976
Park Min-gook!

496
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:17,977
Park Min-gook!

497
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,145
Park Min-gook!

498
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,574
Doctor Cha.

499
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:35,912
Doctor.

500
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,163
So?

501
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,248
Looking for a new hospital?

502
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,418
I thought I had a month's time.

503
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:43,544
So what?

504
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,755
You're going to stay until the very end?

505
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:48,758
Hey.

506
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:52,178
What can I do to make you feel better?

507
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,138
If you tell me the way--

508
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,139
There is no way.

509
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,769
Even if I tried a little harder?

510
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:01,813
I'll be really good.

511
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,356
If you let me off this once--

512
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,900
There are certain types of people
that you should never let off.

513
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,028
Those who show off
thinking their seniors are a joke.

514
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:12,115
Those who step up and get cheeky
without knowing their place.

515
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,659
When you feel bad for those people
and let them off once,

516
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,328
they always manage to come at you again.

517
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,415
It's best to nip it in the bud.

518
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,335
Just until I return to the main hospital.

519
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,131
Did anyone say they'd take you back?

520
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,758
Wake up from your absurd dream

521
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,262
and go find another hospital, Doctor Cha.

522
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:47,567
What's going on?

523
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,987
No, nothing. It's nothing.

524
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,617
Your creditors.

525
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,995
Did they ever come back after that day?

526
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,121
I don't...

527
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,665
I don't want to discuss that with you.

528
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:04,709
Is that so?

529
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:10,048
Okay then.
If you don't want to, forget it.

530
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:13,384
You and I never shared
what's really in our hearts anyway.

531
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:14,677
Right?

532
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:16,220
What's wrong?

533
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,891
Come to think about it,

534
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,393
you and I barely know each other.

535
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,564
We somehow got involved
and came to Doldam Hospital together,

536
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,609
so I guess we have a kind of camaraderie

537
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,278
or something like that.

538
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,282
But we can't say
that we've become good friends,

539
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:37,909
can we?

540
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:38,910
Is something going on?

541
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:42,663
Something has always been going on
ever since we came to work here,

542
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:44,957
and it's still going on.

543
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,001
Tell me. What is it?

544
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,431
Let's talk again later.

545
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,276
Sir.

546
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,070
Does it hurt when I touch you here?

547
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,740
What's his temperature?

548
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:18,950
It's 37.1 degrees.

549
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,786
Do you feel chilly at all?

550
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,084
Let's run a CBC, ESR, and CRP.

551
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,044
And take out the catheter for tip culture.

552
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,462
Then, what about the hemodialysis?

553
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,172
Right, one second.

554
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,632
TIP CULTURE: BACTERIAL CULTURE TEST

555
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,679
It will get infected
if I put it in here.

556
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,600
Then let's leave it in there for now.

557
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,352
Change the second-generation cephalosporin

558
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,980
to the third-generation for his infection,
and give him vancomycin.

559
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,899
Before you give him antibiotics,
let's conduct two blood culture tests,

560
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,569
once from his peripheral line,
and once from his hemo-catheter.

561
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,655
If his temperature goes above 38 degrees,
give him propacetamol IV as needed.

562
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:58,906
PROPACETAMOL IV: FEVER REDUCER

563
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:05,413
Did we finish giving her all the mannitol
she had on her from the ER?

564
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:06,789
Yes, we did.

565
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,499
What's her temperature?

566
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,418
It's 36.8 degrees.

567
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,712
Is the norepinephrine
dropping at 20 micro-milliliters?

568
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:13,880
Yes.

569
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:17,091
She's still showing no voluntary movement
or brainstem signs.

570
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:20,553
It's brain death.

571
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,554
STOP OF BRAIN FUNCTIONS

572
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:22,597
I'm sure of it.

573
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:37,069
The moment when we feel
the most helpless as doctors is

574
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,823
when there is nothing
we can do for our patient.

575
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:51,000
Excuse me, ma'am.

576
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,547
ORGAN DONOR REGISTRATION

577
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,469
Excuse me, Doctor.

578
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,513
-Yes?
-This.

579
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,851
My daughter did something like this.

580
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:15,483

ORGAN DONOR REGISTRATION

585
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,286
Please...

586
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,003
Please take good care of her.

587
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,148
In that helpless moment,

588
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:58,776
he looked angry...

589
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,612
rather than sad.

590
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,121
Do you know where Doctor Kim is?

591
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,747
I texted him, but he didn't reply.

592
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,291
He's in a meeting.

593
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,668
The paramedic who came in on Saturday

594
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,753
is going to be pronounced brain-dead.

595
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:20,673
What is it?

596
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,050
Oh, it's the catheter patient.

597
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,719
He's starting to get mild fever
due to the

598
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,429
vasculitis where the catheter
was inserted.

599
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,596
You removed his catheter?

600
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,100
No. He's getting dialysis today,
so I haven't.

601
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,021
Gosh, in this case,
he has no chance of living

602
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,439
other than by kidney transplant.

603
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,944
-Doctor Cha.
-Yes?

604
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:47,325
The paramedic who'll soon be
declared brain-dead has

605
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,201
the same blood type as him.

606
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:54,373
She's also A positive,
same as the catheter patient.

607
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,251
Per our regulations,

608
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,462
we'll commence the committee meeting

609
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,088
to make a decision on the brain death.

610
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,591
In the ICU, there's a patient

611
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:04,508
DR. KIM, CHAIRPERSON

612
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,178
who has been suggested
as being brain-dead.

613
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,055
Doctor Seo.

614
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,181
Yes, sir.

615
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,683
She's a 32-year-old paramedic.

616
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,978
She's brought to ER last Saturday
after suffering a head injury

617
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,855
while trying to rescue a drunk man.

618
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,024
She was already in a coma upon arrival.

619
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:23,235
Then after one episode of cardiac arrest,
ROSC was detected.

620
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,781
The cranial CT scan showed SAH.

621
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,867
It's been 36 hours
since she was admitted to the ICU,

622
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,994
but still no spontaneous breathing...

623
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,080
or any brainstem reflexes.

624
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,582
Did you cross-check
with the neurological examination?

625
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,125
Yes, we did.

626
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,794
But no response at all.

627
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,087
What about her EEG?

628
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:45,049
The EEG results are enough
to declare her brain-dead.

629
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,427
I heard the patient is registered
for organ donation.

630
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:49,845
Do we have next-of-kin's consent?

631
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,972
Her mother is the one...

632
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,603
who informed us of the patient's wishes.

633
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,191
Let's make our decision then.

634
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:05,444
Does anyone object to declaring her...

635
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,655
brain-dead?

636
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,073
KIM KI-HO, IM KI-SEOK

637
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:09,990
No objections.

638
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:12,576
No.

639
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,049
Then we will declare the patient...

640
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:30,803
brain-dead.

641
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,735
I feel terrible.

642
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,028
She's still very young.

643
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,697
Every time she came to the ER,

644
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,740
she always had a big smile on her face.

645
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,580
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

646
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,669
Doctor Kim. I need to talk
to you about something.

647
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:07,882
A kidney transplant?

648
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:09,842
For the lifer?

649
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,135
Vasculitis occurred where

650
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,761
the hemodialysis catheter was inserted,

651
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:13,929
and he now has a mild fever.

652
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,891
I checked for other areas,

653
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,977
but I don't think we can insert a new one
due to his tattoo infection.

654
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,564
Even if we manage to do it,
the area will get infected again.

655
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,027
So?

656
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,780
How's he going to get a transplant
when he's not even next in line?

657
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:38,496
The paramedic who was
declared brain-dead just now

658
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,372
has the same blood type.

659
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,333
Eun-jae, you're serious?

660
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:45,044
Please allow me to do an HLA typing
and a crossmatch test.

661
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:46,754
If it's a match,

662
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,714
my patient will be made a priority.

663
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:50,216
Right?

664
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:00,601
I can't agree to this.

665
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:04,021
I just want to check
if she's a suitable donor. That's all.

666
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,731
Her only daughter was declared brain-dead.

667
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,358
Shouldn't we give her time to mourn?

668
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,318
I understand where you're coming from,

669
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:12,821
but isn't it a good thing that she can
give it to someone who really needs it?

670
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:15,324
And she has a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

671
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,368
If we don't get the timing right,

672
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,954
she may not be able
to donate her organs at all.

673
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,038
Do you...

674
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,749
Do you only care about your patient?

675
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:26,043
Is it wrong to want
to save him while we can?

676
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,920
We must pay our respects.

677
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,255
Why don't you get it?

678
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,173
Are you being like this
because he's a lifer?

679
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,260
-What?
-He killed two people.

680
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,929
Isn't that why you're being like this?

681
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:41,559
She's a human being.

682
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,018
Okay?

683
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,603
She was someone's daughter,

684
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,064
a paramedic, and a person
named Choi Soon-young.

685
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:49,608
Don't treat her as just an organ donor.

686
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:50,818
She's a human being.

687
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:00,494
What are you...

688
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,080
talking about?

689
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:06,750
You'll donate my daughter's organs...

690
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,254
to whom?

691
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,429
Why?

692
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,764
Why did her mother
suddenly decide against it?

693
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:25,477
It's not uncommon for guardians
to change their minds, you know.

694
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,606
Let's give her some time.

695
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:30,941
Gosh.

696
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:34,278
We have six patients on the waiting list.

697
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:37,114
One of them is a 16-year-old pianist
who can't see.

698
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,617
And a man whose son's getting married.

699
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,661
She'd give them a second chance at life.

700
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:50,127
Could you try to persuade her mother?

701
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,061
No.

702
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,647
I'm not going to do that.

703
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:16,070
I'll be grateful if she willingly decides
to donate her daughter's organs.

704
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:17,571
But even if she doesn't,

705
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:21,200
I don't want to pressure her
or make her uncomfortable in any way.

706
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:25,788
The recipients are important, of course.

707
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:30,417
But we should respect the decisions
of the donors and their families first.

708
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,962
It shouldn't be the other way around.

709
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,933
Was I wrong again?

710
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,067
I guess you and Nurse Park
make plans together

711
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,027
and even go on dates now.

712
00:44:58,529 --> 00:44:59,488
Oh, that.

713
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,574
We were just going to grab some beer.

714
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:03,659
At Once in a While?

715
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,452
Well, yes.

716
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:07,705
I knew it.

717
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,415
I knew it'd be you.

718
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,291
Sorry?

719
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:12,793
Never mind.

720
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,336
Anyway, congratulations.

721
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,547
-On what?
-Your future together.

722
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:20,384
What? What do you mean?

723
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,010
There's nothing going on between us.

724
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,138
Right?

725
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:26,724
There's nothing going on between you two.

726
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,352
But I lost my chance
before I could even start.

727
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:34,982
I'm sad.

728
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,662
Did you tell Nurse Joo that we were

729
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,330
meeting up for beer last night?

730
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:52,499
No, I didn't.

731
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,084
Then how did she find out?

732
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,669
Nurse Um seemed to know about it too.

733
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,129
Why? What did Nurse Joo say?

734
00:45:57,212 --> 00:46:00,424
Out of the blue, she congratulated us
on our "future together."

735
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,926
Then she said she never even got a chance.

736
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:06,388
What if everyone in the ER thinks that?

737
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,183
-You don't want them to?
-Of course not.

738
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,268
There's nothing going on between us.

739
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:13,103
We haven't even done anything yet.

740
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,438
I thought we did.

741
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:23,655
My gosh.

742
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,284
You're very straightforward.

743
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,454
Does it make you uncomfortable?

744
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,706
Then I'll slow down a little.

745
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:37,377
Wow, you can even control your pace?

746
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,714
You seem like a total pro.

747
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,512
I once had a crush on someone.

748
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:49,932
But I never expressed my feelings...

749
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,934
until she left...

750
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:54,520
and that's how it ended.

751
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,864
I won't repeat the same mistake.

752
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:12,955
Are you asking me out...

753
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,333
right now?

754
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,169
I'll never be late again.

755
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:21,338
But promise me that you'll never

756
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,550
eat fried chicken with someone else
when we're supposed to hang out.

757
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,576
We'll remove the catheter.

758
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:51,994
Got it.

759
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:55,038
He needs a fever reducer as well.

760
00:47:58,917 --> 00:47:59,960
Excuse me.

761
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:04,882
Wait.

762
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,509
Please let me in just once.

763
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:10,095
Please let me see my son just this once.

764
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:11,388
No visitors are allowed

765
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,181
outside of the visiting hours.

766
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:14,766
Gosh, my poor son.

767
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,268
What will happen to him?

768
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,738
Well, due to the infection getting worse,

769
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,740
we've decided to remove the catheter.

770
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,368
We'll look for another blood vessel,
but it won't be easy.

771
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,914
If he can't receive dialysis,
he probably...

772
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,418
won't last for more than three days.

773
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,845
My son...

774
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:58,310
My poor son...

775
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,270
No...

776
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:05,067
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

777
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,485
My poor son.

778
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:10,280
What am I going to do now?
My poor son.

779
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,115
No...

780
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:36,848
ADMIN OFFICE, TREATMENT ROOMS

781
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:52,948
Here.

782
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:57,369
Doctor Kim told me to give you this.

783
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:59,997
CHOI SOON-YOUNG

784
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:07,629
I heard he was bullied in school.

785
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:12,175
The young man serving a life sentence.

786
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,721
His mom gave him medicine
which was supposed to help him

787
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:17,264
concentrate better...

788
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,809
and that's how his kidneys failed.

789
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:27,107
His classmates bullied him
because he was always on dialysis.

790
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:32,654
After putting up with it for a while,
he finally lost it and ended up...

791
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,660
killing two people.

792
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,126
It's all my fault.

793
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:48,837
I was obsessed with money.

794
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,673
I was so focused on earning money...

795
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:56,636
that I had no idea
what my son was going through.

796
00:50:57,763 --> 00:51:01,475
I just kept telling him
to get good grades.

797
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,147
It is all my fault.

798
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:11,109
It's my fault that those kids died.

799
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,613
And because of me, my son ended up...

800
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,497
It really is all my fault.

801
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:34,132
That's how all moms are.

802
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,220
When anything bad happens to their kids...

803
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:42,349
they always think it's their fault.

804
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,070
The organ donation.

805
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,701
I'll do it.

806
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,626
My daughter had a knack...

807
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:13,588
for helping and rescuing those in need.

808
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,133
I guess she wanted...

809
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:25,142
to save a life even as she's dying.

810
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,236
The sadness

811
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:39,364
of having to say goodbye to a loved one...

812
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,745
can give hope...

813
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,456
to someone else.

814
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,798
-Mom.
-And to some...

815
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:01,803
it can also give the motivation to tackle
this thing called life, once again.

816
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,852
CHOI SOON-YOUNG

817
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,605
Until the whole process is completed,

818
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,857
we must do our best

819
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:16,818
to honor the donor as well as her mother.

820
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,820
Let's be as respectful as we can...

821
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,114
in our next procedures.

822
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,575
Yes, Doctor Kim.

823
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:25,493
Got it.

824
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:28,788
Got it.

825
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:40,717
PATIENT TRANSPORT

826
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,099
PATIENT TRANSPORT

827
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,478
PATIENT TRANSPORT

828
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,369
We'll turn off the ventilator and set off.

829
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:08,787
-Got it.
-Okay.

830
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,306
I see. Okay.

831
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:30,517
RECEPTION, OUTPATIENT CARE

832
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:34,771
Choi Soon-young is on her way down.

833
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:36,356
Please be ready.

834
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:42,070
EMERGENCY PATIENTS WILL BE SERVED FIRST

835
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:07,947
OPERATING ROOM, ELEVATORS

836
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:31,763
Goodbye.

837
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:34,307
My dear daughter.

838
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:43,691
Thank you for being my daughter.

839
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,157
I love you.

840
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:18,726
Ma'am.

841
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:23,731
We'll take her in now.

842
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:32,782
Okay.

843
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,940
-Ma'am.
-Gosh.

844
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,527
Soon-young.

845
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,549
Let's pay our respects to the deceased.

846
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:14,509
All bow.

847
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:20,890
Thank you.

848
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:23,142
Anesthesiologist, can we begin?

849
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:26,771
Yes, we can.

850
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:28,565
All right, we'll begin.

851
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:30,233
Scalpel.

852
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:38,283
I'll administer the anesthetic.

853
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:39,951
Wait.

854
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,287
Yes?

855
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:45,957
What is it? Do you have something to say?

856
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:47,959
Thank you.

857
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:53,089
Please tell her that I'm very grateful.

858
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:57,844
You should tell her yourself
once you recover.

859
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,388
We'll administer the anesthetic.

860
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:01,806
Give him 5 ml of propofol.

861
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:25,538
We have the heart.

862
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:26,748
The lung team should come in.

863
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:34,339
Scalpel.

864
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:41,471
Gauze.

865
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:43,806
Forceps.

866
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:47,268
Bovie.

867
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,233
We'll cut down to the iliac fossa

868
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:56,235
for the kidney transplant.

869
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,071
ILIAC FOSSA: ROOM FOR THE NEW KIDNEY

870
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,046
The liver is out.

871
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:16,047
LIVER

872
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:18,800
We'll now begin the cannulation,

873
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:20,426
so bring in the thoracic team.

874
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,137
Get the perfusate ready.

875
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:24,514
Perfusate is ready.

876
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:25,890
Have the ice on hold.

877
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:29,060
We're ready for perfusion,
so you may begin.

878
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:30,895
Okay, then I'll begin.

879
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:34,899
Cutting the aorta.

880
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:36,192
AORTA: THE MAIN ARTERY

881
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,364
-Perfusion on.
-Perfusion on.

882
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:48,204
Perfusion begins at 16:23.

883
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:49,789
16:23?

884
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,420
Nurse Park, is the fluid going in okay?

885
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:56,963
Yes, Doctor Kim.

886
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:59,340
Removing the heart.

887
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:00,842
Scissors, please.

888
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:06,848
The container, please.

889
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:16,899
The heart is out.

890
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,360
Bring in the lung team.

891
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:20,445
THE LUNGS

892
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:26,701
Removing the lungs.

893
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:34,584
The lungs have been removed.

894
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,086
The liver team may come in now.

895
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,967
The liver is out.

896
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,763
The liver has been removed.

897
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:48,598
Now, we'll move on to the kidneys.

898
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:49,932
Long forceps.

899
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,770
Vessel loops, please.

900
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:55,980
VESSEL LOOP: CORDS FOR IDENTIFYING
BLOOD VESSELS

901
01:02:56,063 --> 01:02:57,690
Check on the other team, please.

902
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:58,816
Sure.

903
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:02,361
Hello?

904
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:04,906
The other team is asking where we're at.

905
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,576
Tell them we've cut the iliac vessel.

906
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:11,037
The iliac vessel has been cut.

907
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:13,623
We'll now remove the kidneys.

908
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:15,166
The container, please.

909
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:17,877
Here's the right kidney.

910
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:22,590
Another container, please.

911
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:25,593
Here's the left kidney.

912
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,224
I'll head out and bench the kidney.

913
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:32,809
BENCH: CLEANING UP BLOOD VESSELS

914
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,143
Okay, got it.

915
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,104
The kidney is out. It's being benched now.

916
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,815
Doctor Kim will be here shortly.

917
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:39,941
Okay.

918
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:55,122
Ophthalmology. You may come in now.

PATIENT TRANSPORT

926
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,001
The surgery was a success.

927
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:26,213
The transplant went well,
and he's urinating properly now.

928
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:28,132
We just need to see how he recovers.

929
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:30,551
I'm glad to hear that.

930
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,767
Are you worried about something?

931
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:43,856
Well, I'm always the one causing trouble,
so that's what I'm worried about.

932
01:05:45,816 --> 01:05:46,859
Why do you say that?

933
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:51,697
I just feel like I keep finding
the wrong answers.

934
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:55,910
I thought working hard was enough,

935
01:05:56,243 --> 01:05:58,120
but that doesn't seem to be the case.

936
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:02,333
I wanted to avoid
causing others inconvenience,

937
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:05,002
but even that's not working out.

938
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:08,547
I've been doing my best,

939
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,093
but do other people feel the same way?

940
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:13,970
I'm not sure if they do.

941
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:20,726
Could it be because you're
looking for answers set by others?

942
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:26,524
Forget about the answers that others want.

943
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:28,484
What is the answer that you want?

944
01:06:34,448 --> 01:06:36,951
Life doesn't always give you answers.

945
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:40,079
But if you know what you're looking for...

946
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:42,748
tackling life becomes much easier.

947
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:50,423
Smile, please.

948
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:52,508
Look at the camera.

949
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:57,596
Let's look at the camera on the left.

950
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:04,937
CHOI SOON-YOUNG

951
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:20,578
Are you all right?

952
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:22,288
Hey.

953
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:25,207
Well, I guess I'm all right.

954
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:26,500
What about you?

955
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:28,878
I'm just...

956
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:33,007
I don't know.

957
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:36,761
That's okay.

958
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:41,223
It's impossible to know everything anyway.

959
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:57,406
ADMIN OFFICE, TREATMENT ROOMS

960
01:08:10,294 --> 01:08:11,128
Don't think that

961
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:14,131
I tried so hard to help you
because I like you.

962
01:08:14,298 --> 01:08:15,800
You're my patient.

963
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:18,886
Whether you're a lifer or not,

964
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:21,138
you are my patient.

965
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:24,475
That's why I did my best to help you.

966
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,061
So you'd better...

967
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:30,439
become a model prisoner when you return.

968
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:33,484
Become a model prisoner,

969
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:36,070
receive parole, and return to society.

970
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:38,364
Then be a good son to your mother.

971
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:40,366
Also...

972
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:43,577
you should try

973
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,705
to help others like Ms. Choi did.

974
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:48,582
Got it?

975
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:55,798
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

976
01:09:00,344 --> 01:09:01,303
I will relay...

977
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:05,307
your words to him when he wakes up.

978
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:09,103
Thank you. Have a good day.

979
01:09:14,733 --> 01:09:15,818
One down.

980
01:09:16,777 --> 01:09:18,654
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

981
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:23,617
Doctor Yang.

982
01:09:28,038 --> 01:09:28,873
Well...

983
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:31,000
I decided not to leave.

984
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:34,295
-What?
-I won't look for another job.

985
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:38,716
I don't know how you can be
this brazen and shameless.

986
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:41,552
I apologize for
being brazen and shameless.

987
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:43,387
But you see,

988
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:46,348
I can't stop thinking that it's unfair.

989
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:50,352
I kept working hard
even after getting cut on the neck.

990
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:53,564
All I did was work hard,

991
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:55,858
so why must I move to another hospital?

992
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:58,861
-What's with this attitude?
-I'm sorry.

993
01:09:58,986 --> 01:10:00,404
I apologize for my attitude.

994
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:01,572
But you know what?

995
01:10:02,406 --> 01:10:04,116
I'll just keep going.

996
01:10:05,409 --> 01:10:08,329
If I find another job and leave
without putting up a fight,

997
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:11,081
I'll be embarrassed
and mad about it forever.

998
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:13,167
I'll probably resent myself for it.

999
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:14,919
What's the matter with you?

1000
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:17,087
Are you high? How dare you?

1001
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:18,339
You're right.

1002
01:10:19,423 --> 01:10:20,549
I'm on drugs.

1003
01:10:24,678 --> 01:10:27,973
Thanks to this medication,
I've been able to operate in the OR.

1004
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:32,937
So don't you dare threaten me
to leave this hospital.

1005
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:36,565
I won't put up with any further threats.

1006
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:38,442
Please cooperate.

1007
01:10:54,124 --> 01:10:55,668
Just one more left.

1008
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:12,935
What are you doing here alone?

1009
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:17,940
I'm just going through
the transplant surgery again in my head.

1010
01:11:19,316 --> 01:11:21,193
Oh, I see.

1011
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:28,117
My dad is a doctor.

1012
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:32,663
So are my older brother and sister.

1013
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:36,750
My mom is just a stay-at-home mom.

1014
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:39,878
Her biggest joy in life
is talking to me on the phone.

1015
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:42,798
Are you bragging about your family?

1016
01:11:44,758 --> 01:11:48,262
Among all the doctors in my family,
I'm the least competent one.

1017
01:11:49,346 --> 01:11:50,180
I see.

1018
01:11:50,597 --> 01:11:52,808
That explains your obsession
with getting the best grades.

1019
01:11:55,269 --> 01:11:56,437
To be honest,

1020
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:59,148
you've always irked me
since the day we met.

1021
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:01,942
The feeling is mutual.

1022
01:12:02,693 --> 01:12:03,944
I found you irksome too.

1023
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:07,573
You were always cold to everyone.

1024
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,492
You were arrogant and hard to approach.

1025
01:12:10,784 --> 01:12:12,036
You did everything your way.

1026
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:14,121
You put on airs and complained a lot.

1027
01:12:14,872 --> 01:12:16,999
And you thought you were so good-looking.

1028
01:12:17,374 --> 01:12:19,168
That's why I thought you were obnoxious.

1029
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:21,170
But...

1030
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:23,589
There's a twist?

1031
01:12:25,132 --> 01:12:26,050
I have to say...

1032
01:12:27,551 --> 01:12:28,677
I felt a little bad.

1033
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:33,891
Yesterday,

1034
01:12:34,808 --> 01:12:36,560
I found out that...

1035
01:12:37,644 --> 01:12:40,064
you lost your parents when you were a kid.

1036
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,696
When I heard that...

1037
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,325
my heart ached for some reason.

1038
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:00,000
There's no need to feel bad for me.

1039
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:03,170
I'm really serious right now.

1040
01:13:03,253 --> 01:13:05,005
Right, don't be so serious.

1041
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:08,342
The moment we become serious,

1042
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:09,843
we'll be doomed.

1043
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:11,887
Things will become boring and pointless.

1044
01:13:12,846 --> 01:13:14,932
So forget everything you heard.

1045
01:13:16,016 --> 01:13:17,976
How can I forget what I already heard?

1046
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,895
How do you expect me to forget it all?

1047
01:13:20,312 --> 01:13:21,146
Why not?

1048
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,649
Should I teach you again?

1049
01:13:25,192 --> 01:13:26,110
Teach me what?

1050
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:27,694
How to reset.
