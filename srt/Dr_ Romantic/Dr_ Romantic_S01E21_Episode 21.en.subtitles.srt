00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:26,484
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

2
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,907
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

3
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,954
Dr. Kang Dong-ju?

4
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,044
Is this the result of Dr. Nam's case?

5
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,050
-Good work.
-Thank you.

6
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,054
I'm glad that the operation is over.

7
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,097
You two received letters.

8
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,766
This is for Dr. Nam.

9
00:00:58,516 --> 00:00:59,559
And this is for Dr. Kang.

10
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,645
Which one of you will
open your letter first?

11
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,369
Are you leaving just like that?

12
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,122
Dr. Nam? Dr. Kang?

13
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,416
MAYO CLINIC HOSPITAL, USA

14
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,433
Dong-ju, what are you up to?

15
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,685
Can't you knock?

16
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,774
What's that? Is it a letter?

17
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:49,901
It's nothing.

18
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,238
I'm off to the Intensive Care Unit.

19
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,450
What was that?

20
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,619
It looked like an air mail.

21
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,413
In fact, it was from the US.

22
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:03,665
From the US?

23
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,417
Did he receive a letter from the US?

24
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,338
Why did he hide it?

25
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,756
Did you see which city it was from?

26
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,509
I didn't have the time
due to other letters.

27
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,970
There was one from the Supreme Court too.

28
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,180
-It was for Dr. Nam.
-Really?

29
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,392
Did the court finally make its ruling
for Dr. Nam's case?

30
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,608
It was about seven years ago.

31
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:34,028
A 10-year-old girl died
on the operating table.

32
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,157
She had elbow supracondyle fracture

33
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,826
and died of fat embolism.

34
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,205
Her parents sued
the anesthesiologist, Dr. Nam.

35
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,208
He lost the first trial,

36
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,295
but the ruling was overturned
in the second.

37
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,965
That's why it was taken
to the Supreme Court.

38
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,466
SUPREME COURT, SENTENCING

39
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,260
APPEAL TO THE SUPREME COURT IS DISMISSED

40
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,686
Right after the accident,
he quit Geosan Medical Center

41
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,271
and started working as a freelancer.

42
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,607
Then he came to Doldam Hospital

43
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,358
at President Yeo's suggestion.

44
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,486
He then brought Teacher Kim here,

45
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,449
and Teacher Kim brought me here.

46
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:23,119
And Ms. Oh brought me here.

47
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,538
I didn't bring you here. You followed me.

48
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,207
I see.

49
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,003
In the end,

50
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,088
Teacher Kim and you

51
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,467
came to Doldam Hospital thanks to Dr. Nam.

52
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,386
Then he met you.

53
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,516
Didn't you know that?

54
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,268
Know what?

55
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,272
The first operation Teacher Kim
performed at Doldam Hospital

56
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,609
-was on you.
-What?

57
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:56,694
Really?

58
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,363
We have a patient here!

59
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,243
Please come this way.

60
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,786
-This way?
-Yes.

61
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,372
Be careful.

62
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,959
Gosh.

63
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,254
-What should we do?
-What's wrong?

64
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,172
There's no doctor on duty now.

65
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,174
I can perform the operation myself.

66
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,593
Have you assisted on one before?

67
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,097
I'm sorry, but I've never
assisted on one before.

68
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,765
Then please, prepare normal saline

69
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,558
for hydration.

70
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,436
-And call Dr. Nam.
-Yes, Doctor.

71
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,609
This is Teacher Kim speaking.

72
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,904
We have an emergency patient
who needs a surgery.

73
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,992
Myeong-sim, I really need you here.
Can you please come?

74
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,870
Okay. Please come right away.

75
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,459
It was the beginning

76
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,630
of Teacher Kim's and my career
at Doldam Hospital.

77
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,510
There is a beginning to everything.

78
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,316
And behind every beginning,

79
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:20,028
there is a cause and motivation.

80
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,949
It can be from myself

81
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,202
or from someone else.

82
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:32,206
Once it begins,
it creates direction in life.

83
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,500
And through the journey,

84
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,420
it creates a form of life.

85
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,230
The beginning of everything.

86
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:00,651
Could there be any fate
or coincidence stronger

87
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,820
than that?

88
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,948
Hey.

89
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,537
It's been a while.

90
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,123
You...

91
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,433
You...

92
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,647
Why... How?

93
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,652
This place has a charm of its own.

94
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,821
I thought it would be old and empty.

95
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,699
I've been hearing news about you
since the end of last year.

96
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:53,162
I heard about
the artificial heart transfer surgery too.

97
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:57,041
Then I found out that you are
here at Doldam Hospital.

98
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,547
Have you been well?

99
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,072
Do you still have these?

100
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,868
Yes, I've been listening to them.

101
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,349
Music is very funny.

102
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,437
It turns back the time.

103
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,272
Doesn't it?

104
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,775
Yes.

105
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,281
When did you come back?

106
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:13,075
It's been about three years.
No, it might be four.

107
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,040
I've grown old, haven't I?

108
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,542
You look the same.

109
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,377
You look pretty cool.

110
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,924
I know you're lying,
but it still sounds good.

111
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,135
Although, I hear that's a sign of aging.

112
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,724
What's this?

113
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,434
Do you brew your own coffee?

114
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,355
Yes. It's like a habit.

115
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,607
What? A habit?

116
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,529
You hated these things.

117
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,863
Did I?

118
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,449
Watching movies, going to restaurants.

119
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:57,119
You especially hated sitting at a cafe

120
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,080
and chatting,

121
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,708
but here you are
making coffee for yourself.

122
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,878
-Was I like that?
-My goodness.

123
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,465
You always gave me a hard time
during our dates.

124
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,592
I can write a whole paper on it.

125
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,719
Was I like that?

126
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,852
That laugh is new too.

127
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,105
Jeez.

128
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,657
Anyway, what brings you here?

129
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,742
I'm sure

130
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,996
you didn't come here to see me.

131
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,250
There is this Chinese-Korean

132
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,502
in this volunteer group I'm involved with.

133
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,670
I see.

134
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,756
She has pheochromocytoma.

135
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,302
She was diagnosed while she was being
treated for malignant hypertension.

136
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,971
I want you to do her surgery.

137
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,767
That's not a difficult surgery to do.

138
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,770
You should ask the doctor
who gave her diagnosis.

139
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,527
Actually,

140
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,989
she's HIV positive.

141
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,131
Aren't you eating?

142
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,342
I'm not.

143
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,428
It's been three minutes.

144
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,895
What's with him? I wonder what happened.

145
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,356
He's been moping all day long.

146
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,316
Earlier today,

147
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,110
he was looking at some letter.

148
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,322
Could it have been bad news?

149
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,698
A letter?

150
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,202
It looked like an air mail.

151
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:04,080
In fact, it was from the US.

152
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,210
Doctors!

153
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,878
We have huge news.

154
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,380
Do we have a patient?

155
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,007
It's a woman. There's a woman.

156
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,134
-A female patient?
-No, not that.

157
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,763
There is a woman here
visiting Teacher Kim,

158
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,641
and she is absolutely gorgeous.

159
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,017
-What?
-What?

160
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,145
-A gorgeous woman?
-Yes.

161
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,649
A woman who is beautiful beyond words

162
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,360
is sitting right there
in Teacher Kim's office.

163
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,704
I thought we were eating.

164
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,541
Is it so weird that
a woman's here to see him?

165
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,418
Right?

166
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,068
I can't see her face.

167
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,237
Something is definitely going on.

168
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,791
It's a call from Teacher Kim.

169
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,209
Teacher Kim?

170
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,503
I didn't get one.

171
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,881
-We're called to President Yeo's room.
-President Yeo's room?

172
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,301
-I'll be back.
-Sure.

173
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,471
-Dr. Yun.
-Yes?

174
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,889
Over there.

175
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,979
-Hello.
-Hello.

176
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,159
HIV positive?

177
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,702
HIV means...

178
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,330
she has AIDS.

179
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,874
She has high blood pressure,

180
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,878
so if she isn't operated on immediately,

181
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,547
it'll be very dangerous.

182
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:21,759
She asked many hospitals
to conduct her surgery,

183
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,179
but was declined everywhere
for many reasons.

184
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,473
That's how she ended up here.

185
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:30,476
I think we should decline it too.
She has AIDS.

186
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,521
What if the word gets around
about her surgery?

187
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,065
No patient would
ever come to our hospital again.

188
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,776
An AIDS patient is still a patient,
Manager Jang.

189
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,278
This is nonsense, Teacher Kim.

190
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:42,947
President Yeo.

191
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,075
I also agree

192
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,786
with Manager Jang, Teacher Kim.

193
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:52,915
We won't do an open surgery.
It'll be through a laparoscope.

194
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,251
We'll put on a shield mask,

195
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,337
and we'll be extra careful.

196
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,714
There will be no problems.

197
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,716
No matter how careful we are,

198
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,302
accidents are bound to happen.

199
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,514
What if we stab ourselves
with a needle while drawing her blood?

200
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,767
You can't get scared over things
that haven't happened yet.

201
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,937
How will you treat patients
with that mindset?

202
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,940
Then let me tell you about
the things that will happen.

203
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,775
If we operate on an HIV patient,

204
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,777
we'll have to sterilize
the entire operating room

205
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,821
which means one of two rooms
can't be used all day.

206
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,282
What will you do with
the patients during that day?

207
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,616
In-beom.

208
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,660
With your logic,

209
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,705
this patient can't be treated
anywhere in this country.

210
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:37,585
Above everything,
your wrist concerns me more.

211
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,671
If you'll use a laparoscope,

212
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:44,383
you have to use more muscles
on your fingers and hand.

213
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,178
That's for me to be concerned about.

214
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,224
President Yeo, this surgery can

215
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,978
only go forward with your permission.

216
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,647
Please say yes.

217
00:14:58,856 --> 00:14:59,857
No.

218
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,192
We can't do this for
the sake of our patients.

219
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,028
No. Never.

220
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,655
President Yeo.

221
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,423
It's taking longer than I expected.

222
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,594
What could they be talking about?

223
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,679
How did it go?

224
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,014
Bring the patient here early tomorrow

225
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,141
and all the image data you have.

226
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,186
We will decide on a date
as soon as possible.

227
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:24,984
It's all because of her.

228
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,861
Teacher Kim's judgment was clouded
because of that woman.

229
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,240
-Manager Jang.
-It's the only explanation.

230
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,784
Teacher Kim even has an injured wrist,

231
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,247
so how can he operate
on a patient with AIDS?

232
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,248
Manager Jang.

233
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,209
Please go and persuade Teacher Kim again.

234
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,962
I don't think Teacher Kim
made a wrong decision.

235
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,214
-Ms. Oh!
-Even President Yeo approved,

236
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,465
so stop it already.

237
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,634
Jesus!

238
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,430
Don't you think we should stop him?

239
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,974
No matter what we say, he won't listen.

240
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:01,270
Like you said, Teacher Kim
still has a wrist problem.

241
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,273
If you are so worried,
say that you'll do it instead.

242
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,734
You are better at laparoscopy than I am.

243
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,069
Are you kidding?
I won't even enter the room.

244
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,821
I won't take such a risk.

245
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,666
What's the matter?

246
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:25,753
Seo-jeong.

247
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,463
Yes?

248
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,341
I'm sorry. I'm just tired.

249
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,887
What was the meeting for?

250
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,389
It was about a patient with HIV.

251
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,141
She has pheochromocytoma.

252
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,560
Teacher Kim

253
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,146
wants to operate on her
as soon as possible.

254
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,148
I see.

255
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,197
What's wrong? Are you feeling sick?

256
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,076
A little bit.

257
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,119
I don't feel good today.

258
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,788
I think I need some rest.

259
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,623
I'm going home early.

260
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,991
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

261
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,706
Ms. Oh, is the rumor true?

262
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,460
Will an AIDS patient be operated here?

263
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,796
Everyone's slightly on edge

264
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,756
because of the rumor.

265
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,473
What did you say?

266
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,434
He's operating on a patient with HIV?

267
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,686
Yes, Dr. Song.

268
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:08,522
I don't think I can do that.

269
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:10,941
Gosh.

270
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,068
He's unbelievable!

271
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,655
Ms. Oh, I think they are here.

272
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,825
It's the patient with HIV.

273
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,910
What should we do, Ms. Oh?

274
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,340
What do you think?

275
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,802
Like I said,
she is exceptionally beautiful.

276
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,345
Stop it.

277
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,021
This way.

278
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,362
It's all right.

279
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,249
What?

280
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,961
Is that Lee Yeong-jo?

281
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,674
What's the matter?

282
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,843
-Do you know her?
-Of course I do.

283
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,595
We went to medical school together.

284
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,056
Is she a doctor?

285
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,641
She was a general surgeon like me.

286
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,602
She was so hard-core about her work.

287
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:31,980
I heard she went abroad to work
with Doctors Without Borders.

288
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,441
-When did she get back?
-Is that so?

289
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,945
-Doctors Without Borders?
-She was very famous.

290
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,906
She and Teacher Kim were a famous couple.

291
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,575
What? She and Teacher Kim

292
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,535
were in a relationship back in college?

293
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,750
Teacher Kim.

294
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,587
Okay. I will be right there.

295
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,006
Come in.

296
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,938
It's 220 over 120.

297
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,150
Her blood pressure is very high.

298
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,404
-What's her prescription?
-Beta-blocker and CCB.

299
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,824
Even after two types of depressants,
it's still too high.

300
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,411
How many hospitals have you been to?

301
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,621
I visited five different hospitals

302
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,916
and called more than that on the phone.

303
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,127
Does she speak Korean?

304
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,253
Yes, she does.

305
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,755
Ma'am.

306
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,884
Your blood pressure is too high.

307
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,763
It's still high despite the depressants

308
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,473
which is very dangerous.

309
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:53,395
You should have an operation as soon
as possible. Is that okay for you?

310
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,361
-Ms. Oh.
-Yes.

311
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,614
Please check the OP lab
and have the operating room ready.

312
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:09,286
Also, computerize all the image data.

313
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,537
Sure.

314
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,415
Do you want to come with me?

315
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,293
It will be okay.

316
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,587
I will be here until
the operation is over.

317
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,755
Okay.

318
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,266
The situation is more
serious than I thought.

319
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,686
If any blood vessels
in the brain ruptures,

320
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:37,481
-our hands will be tied.
-I know.

321
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,778
Thank you, anyway.

322
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,821
For rushing the surgery.

323
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:48,825
I just did what I had to do.
You don't have to thank me every time.

324
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,162
You always say that.

325
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,581
I can't believe you remember.

326
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:04,925
So I will perform
the operation this afternoon.

327
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,594
I'm not designating
anyone as my assistant.

328
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,137
I'll take volunteers instead.

329
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,931
Which one of you will join me?

330
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,728
I'll do it.

331
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:19,940
By the way,

332
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,734
is your wrist really okay to do this?

333
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,529
I can perform the laparoscope if you want.

334
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:28,115
I'm trying not to move my wrist
as much as possible,

335
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,283
but I have no choice now.

336
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,913
Make sure to put on two pairs of gloves

337
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,792
and have disposable
surgical instruments ready.

338
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,794
-I'll do that.
-Okay.

339
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,755
Call me when you are ready.

340
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:44,965
-Sure.
-Good.

341
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,679
If you're unlucky,

342
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,807
you will be infected with HIV.

343
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,685
-Aren't you afraid?
-Not really.

344
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:02,107
I don't think I'll be that unlucky.

345
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,541
Did you rest well last night?

346
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,585
Yes, I did.

347
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,211
I'm just asking,

348
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,338
but are you angry at me?

349
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,507
Me?

350
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:29,843
Why would I be?

351
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,470
Did you do anything wrong?

352
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,514
Well...

353
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,434
I kind of think I did.

354
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,686
No, you didn't.

355
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,479
Dr. Yun.

356
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,984
We have a JS patient in bed number five,
and it's killing me.

357
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,986
It's been idling for the past ten minutes.

358
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,238
Really? I'll take a look.

359
00:24:56,703 --> 00:25:01,249
Hello? Honey, it's Mom.

360
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,628
Yes, I'm fine. I'm good.

361
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:07,881
I miss you so much.

362
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:12,385
Really? Did you enter the drawing contest?

363
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:16,348
I'm so proud of you.

364
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:23,897
I will work hard and earn a lot of money

365
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,983
so that I can buy you
the piano and books you like.

366
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:33,573
Be nice to your grandma, okay?

367
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,077
Dr. Do.

368
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,330
Who is she talking to?

369
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,292
It seems she's talking to her daughter.

370
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:49,089
I don't think she knows
about her mom's illness though.

371
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,480
The most dangerous moment

372
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:08,692
of this surgery is when
we take out the cytoma.

373
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,277
Do-il, if you can...

374
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,114
Don't worry about it.
I'll hold onto it no matter what.

375
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,282
Okay.

376
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,743
There won't be any problems
if we manage that.

377
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,495
Teacher Kim.

378
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,497
The patient is in the operating room.

379
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,498
Really?

380
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,000
I'll get ready.

381
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,251
-Let's go, Dong-ju.
-Sure.

382
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,044
-Get ready.
-Yes, Teacher Kim.

383
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,844
Teacher Kim, I want to talk you
out of this one last time.

384
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,595
Please stop right here.

385
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:41,641
I just would like to advise you
to not put this place

386
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,435
in a dangerous situation

387
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:45,228
because of your personal relationship.

388
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:49,107
Please don't do this surgery.

389
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,319
If it wasn't Yeong-jo
who asked you to do this,

390
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:55,030
would you have agreed to it?

391
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,740
You wouldn't have.

392
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,375
That's right.

393
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,712
I asked him for a personal favor.

394
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,467
If I hadn't, the patient would
have died a miserable death.

395
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:21,639
That's why I contacted
my boyfriend from ten years ago

396
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,475
to ask for this favor.

397
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,602
Is that bad?

398
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,854
I'm not saying it's bad,

399
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,773
but she is HIV positive.

400
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:30,899
I know.

401
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:34,652
It's scary to perform a surgery
on an HIV patient.

402
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,740
But do you know what's scarier?

403
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,744
Your prejudice.

404
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,127
I can't blame you for being careful
of the unknown dangers.

405
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,921
But neglecting your duties

406
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,007
because of those dangers,

407
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,095
is even worse.

408
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:07,102
Please don't think of this
as a situation to avoid.

409
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,521
Consider this from a bigger picture.

410
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,737
I ask of you, please.

411
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,159
This isn't necessary.

412
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:31,501
In that case, I'll get going
since the patient is waiting.

413
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,549
We'll catch up after the surgery.

414
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,193
Hello, this is Doldam Hospital,
emergency room.

415
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,448
-Teacher Kim.
-Yes?

416
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,575
It's a gunshot patient.

417
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,243
What?

418
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,082
We'll get him to the hybrid room.

419
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:14,711
Please hold on.

420
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,549
He was shot while hunting for a boar.

421
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:21,384
-Was it a shotgun?
-That's right.

422
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,845
-Vitals?
-It's 90 over 40, pulse 140.

423
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,972
Set up IV lines and execute a full drop
of normal saline.

424
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:28,183
File two pack of RBC
for an emergency situation

425
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,601
and give him tetanus vaccine.

426
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,106
-We also need 50mg of pethidine.
-Okay.

427
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,818
Sir, calm down. We'll treat you.
Please calm down.

428
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,153
Let me see your wound.

429
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,493
My goodness. How many wounds does he have?

430
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:49,704
They are spread all over from
his thigh to left abdomen.

431
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:53,208
-I count at least 20.
-Bring FAST.

432
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:02,383
There is fluid in his abdomen.

433
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,843
I see some organ damage too.

434
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,553
How are his vitals?

435
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,846
It's 100 over 70, pulse 120.

436
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,849
Then take a CT scan and
bring him to the operating room.

437
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,017
Yes, Teacher Kim.

438
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,067
Everyone has protective goggles on.

439
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,236
Are you wearing disposable gowns?

440
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,655
Make sure you wear two layers of gloves.

441
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,449
After the surgery,

442
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:30,328
this room will be sterilized
and shut down for 24 hours.

443
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,747
We'll start anesthetizing you.

444
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,416
Think of this as a nap.

445
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,170
Please give 120mg of propofol
and 40mg of rocuronium.

446
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,338
Yes.

447
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,514
This disposable laryngoscope isn't so bad.

448
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:50,557
It's pretty bright too.

449
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,725
Most of them are disposable nowadays.

450
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,894
Do you remember how a group of infants

451
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,564
were infected because of a laryngoscope?

452
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,858
They import equipment that comes
in contact with patients,

453
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,986
but mark them as equipment used
for observatory purposes.

454
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:06,197
Right, I heard you got a letter
from the Supreme Court.

455
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:08,366
-Was the ruling in your favor?
-Yes.

456
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:12,620
But it doesn't feel good
even though I won the case.

457
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,414
It's a relief though.

458
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,084
Dr. Kang, I heard you got
a letter from the US.

459
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,670
-Pardon?
-Didn't Dr. Yun ask about it?

460
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,130
She heard it too.

461
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,056
Dr. Nam, it's Teacher Kim.

462
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,644
Dr. Nam, did you anesthetize the patient?

463
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,772
Yes, I'm finished. You can come in now.

464
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,526
Why? What's wrong?

465
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:47,322
We just got a gunshot patient.

466
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:50,533
He has at least 20 shards in his body.

467
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,163
Dr. Kang.

468
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,708
-Yes, Teacher Kim.
-Why don't you come on out?

469
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,126
Sure.

470
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:12,347
-What is it?
-You take this gunshot patient.

471
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,350
Find out the locations with the CT scan,

472
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,936
take him to surgery, and remove them.

473
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:21,481
Bullets are made of lead,
so his organs may melt down.

474
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:24,317
So, don't delay the surgery and
get them out as soon as possible.

475
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:28,196
But I have never dealt
with a gunshot wound.

476
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:30,865
That's true.

477
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,994
You haven't done pheochromocytoma
with a laparoscope either.

478
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,371
No, I haven't.

479
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,374
What do we do?

480
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,000
I'll go in with you.

481
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,962
I've dealt with numerous gunshot patients.

482
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,588
I was in a disputed territory

483
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,966
where I had gunshot patients
come in almost every day.

484
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,343
I'll assist and guide him.

485
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,472
-Okay?
-Okay.

486
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,475
Okay, then.

487
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,894
I'll get to the pheochromocytoma case.

488
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:01,604
Take good care of him.

489
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,943
I will do my best.

490
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,319
Me too.

491
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:40,977
In-beom.

492
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,438
Why are you here?

493
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,482
I'll hold the laparoscope.

494
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,819
I think I'll be able to use my wrists

495
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,321
better than you right now.

496
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,532
Have you ever operated
on a pheochromocytoma patient?

497
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:55,867
Once.

498
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,997
I'm not lying this time.

499
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,374
May I do it?

500
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:21,225
The CT scan shows a total of 14 shards.

501
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,269
Five in his abdomen
and three in his pelvis,

502
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:24,604
and the rest are in his thigh.

503
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,814
That's what you see
on the CT scan and the x-ray,

504
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,358
but there may be more. Keep that in mind.

505
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,694
Sure. Let us begin.

506
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,530
We'll start with the abdomen. Scalpel.

507
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,241
Gauze.

508
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,496
Bovie.

509
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:45,792
Kelly.

510
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:49,670
One more.

511
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,675
Let's begin.

512
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,302
Scalpel.

513
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:11,526
Trocar.

514
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,074
Scope.

515
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,249
Hold this.

516
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:30,128
We'll put in three more trocars. Scalpel.

517
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:32,839
Bovie.

518
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,804
Let's see.

519
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,639
I found one.

520
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,141
Forcep, please.

521
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,354
Count them.

522
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:49,897
Okay.

523
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,858
We should cut this bowel.

524
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,027
Well, it's...

525
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,405
It's lodged near the artery.

526
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,699
-Get ready to tie it.
-Hemostatic.

527
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,920
-You are the assistant here.
-Okay. I will keep that in mind.

528
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,339
Hemostatic.

529
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,345
-Bovie.
-Sponge-holding.

530
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,684
GIA stapler.

531
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,149
Specimen out.

532
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:36,402
Babcock forceps.

533
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,737
Scissors.

534
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,739
One more.

535
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,659
GIA stapler.

536
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,247
-Is that five?
-It's four. We need one more.

537
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,044
I think there was one around the kidney.

538
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,590
Teacher Kim's first love?

539
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,260
Yes. I wonder if you know anything about

540
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,971
how they met

541
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,476
and why they broke up.

542
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,061
Well...

543
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,938
I don't know much.

544
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,776
I'm well aware of their history.

545
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,698
Bu Yong-ju and Lee Yeong-jo

546
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,034
fought at every opportunity.

547
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,828
They squabbled over nothing
every time they met.

548
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,374
They would even get physical
during some of their fights.

549
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:33,584
We thought

550
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,546
one of them would die soon.

551
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,926
But then at some point,
they were madly in love with each other.

552
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,054
I'm experiencing deja vu.

553
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:48,057
I know a couple who are just like them.

554
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,183
What?

555
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,353
By the way...

556
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,315
Why did they break up?

557
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,822
First, they drifted apart after
Teacher Kim left for Cleveland.

558
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:06,242
Then Lee Yeong-jo went abroad to work with

559
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,369
Doctors Without Borders.

560
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,830
That's how things ended.

561
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,624
I see.

562
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,713
Out of sight, out of mind.

563
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:27,263
I will ligate adrenal vein.

564
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:28,597
Hemoclip.

565
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,815
Metzenbaum.

566
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:43,821
Black bovie.

567
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:51,537
You should be careful.
This is the adrenal artery.

568
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,169
Hemoclip.

569
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,296
One more.

570
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,633
The blood pressure may drop rapidly,
so don't panic.

571
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:12,183
Is her blood pressure okay?
It's dropping too rapidly.

572
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,852
It's 110 over 70. It's dropping rapidly,

573
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,312
but it's okay for now.

574
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,688
I will keep checking on it.

575
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,398
-Please continue.
-Okay.

576
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,400
Black bovie.

577
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,323
Bovie.

578
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,783
Kelly.

579
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,871
Dr. Kang. It's from Teacher Kim.

580
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:37,041
How is it going?

581
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,543
We are looking for a bullet
around the kidney.

582
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,420
I found it.

583
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,923
It's right next to the kidney.

584
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:51,055
He got a slight injury here,

585
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,890
but it'll be okay if we stop the bleeding.

586
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,434
How many bullets did you pull out?

587
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:58,270
We pulled out
all five bullets from the abdomen.

588
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,439
He survived by good luck.

589
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,525
No large veins were ruptured.

590
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,112
Keep up the good work.

591
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,411
I got it off. Hand me the bag.

592
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,380
-It's done.
-Specimen out.

593
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,550
Scope.

594
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:33,973
No bleeding found.

595
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:40,104
Okay. It's very clean.

596
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,774
Well done.

597
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:52,366
Stay focused until the end.

598
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:53,909
Okay.

599
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,498
I will put in the drain line
and finish it off.

600
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,252
How is it going?

601
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:05,045
I'm taking out
the eighth bullet from the pelvis.

602
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,756
I will put in the drain line
and go over to the thigh.

603
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,467
Can you do that without
an orthopedic surgery?

604
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,343
I don't think any bullet is deeply lodged.

605
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,929
Also, we can't send him
to another hospital like this.

606
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,055
Scalpel.

607
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:19,351
There's no time to care about
who studied general or orthopedic surgery.

608
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,769
We have no choice but to go on.

609
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,314
Is that how things are done there?

610
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:26,400
We don't have a CT scan
or an x-ray over there.

611
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,235
We have no other choice
but to open them up.

612
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,655
If there was a military unit around,

613
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,159
we borrowed a metal detector.

614
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,454
You used a metal detector to find bullets?

615
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,791
Gosh, that's a good idea.

616
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:47,046
Dozens of people die there every day.

617
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:49,715
Whatever it is...

618
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,093
We just do our best at the given moment.

619
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,640
There's no such thing as respect for life

620
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,683
or human dignity there.

621
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,980
We just try to hold out every day.

622
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,316
That's all we care about.

623
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,445
Can you believe how different it is

624
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:15,616
even when we're living in the same era?

625
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,871
-How many do we have now?
-We have 13 bullets.

626
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,545
This makes 14 which is all of them.

627
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,715
I will finish up then.

628
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,342
Vicryl number three.

629
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:45,229
Good stitching.

630
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:48,065
You must have learned it from Teacher Kim.

631
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,570
I picked it up from him.

632
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,738
In that case, you are a good student.

633
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,490
Thank you.

634
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:58,701
-Cut.
-Cut.

635
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,541
-Cut.
-Cut.

636
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:29,648
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

637
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:30,899
Yeong-jo.

638
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,194
How about a cup of coffee?

639
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,655
-That'll be nice.
-All right.

640
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,813
Here. Try this.

641
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:21,575
It's nice.

642
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:34,963
At the last place
I went for volunteer work,

643
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,132
a bomb exploded.

644
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:42,137
All my colleagues died there.

645
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:45,933
Oddly enough,

646
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:49,103
I didn't cry though.

647
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:53,482
I was...

648
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,778
just angry.

649
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,408
Why is this happening to me?

650
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,743
What did I do wrong?

651
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:12,000
I grew tired and scared of people.

652
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,551
I know I had good intentions at first.

653
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,810
I think...

654
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:35,232
I'm lost.

655
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:42,239
If you were lost,

656
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,286
you wouldn't have

657
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,330
brought the patient here.

658
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:51,748
That was

659
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,543
just like an old habit.

660
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,672
That's what I used to do,

661
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,467
so that's what I did.

662
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,972
I thought I should do that, at least.

663
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:11,852
Also,

664
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,232
I missed you.

665
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:21,987
What about you?

666
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,448
How are you doing?

667
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:28,243
-Are you doing well here?
-Me?

668
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:32,789
I don't know.

669
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,462
Going to the movie theater,

670
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,216
going to famous restaurants,

671
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,637
and drinking coffee

672
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,140
with a woman I love like this...

673
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,521
I was a jerk who thought
it was a waste of money and time.

674
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:01,527
Still, I turned out all right, didn't I?

675
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,488
Is that so?

676
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,368
I think you're right.

677
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:27,135
Do you need it?

678
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,474
Can I borrow it?

679
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,540
Why did we...

680
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,753
let those days go by?

681
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,265
Cheer up, Seo-jeong.

682
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,601
You can do well.

683
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:01,647
Be simple. Be cool.

684
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:16,078
-What are you doing?
-I was...

685
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,789
I was waiting for you.

686
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:22,501
-I have something to tell you.
-Really?

687
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:24,878
So do I.

688
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:29,007
I have something to tell you too.

689
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:32,469
-What is it?
-Shall we

690
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:34,846
go on a date?

691
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,307
Did you say date?

692
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,936
-Where?
-Let's go.

693
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,145
Sorry?

694
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,734
Here. Let's put
Teacher Kim's name in the picture.

695
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,322
I'm glad you're here.
Please take a picture with us.

696
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:55,325
-I don't want to.
-Please, just once.

697
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:57,244
-One, two, three.
-You asked her

698
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,079
-to do this, right? Don't.
-No, I didn't.

699
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,832
-Take it at a good angle.
-Okay. At a 45-degree angle.

700
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,875
One, two, three.

701
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:06,837
Let's take one at the stairs.

702
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:09,923
Ready.

703
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:13,969
One, two, three.

704
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,764
-Manager Jang, please join us.
-Yes?

705
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:18,765
-Can I join you?
-Sure.

706
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,308
One, two, three.

707
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,437
The color of your phone is very pretty.

708
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:25,272
Try to look intelligent.

709
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:28,442
Dong-ju, I like your pose. Here we go.

710
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,694
Ready. In one, two.

711
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:32,946
That's great.

712
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:38,577
-Are you taking a picture of me?
-One, two, three.

713
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:40,996
-Me?
-Yes, stand with him.

714
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:46,543
Ms. Oh, I want to take a picture of you.

715
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:48,378
Please don't do this here.

716
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,716
Please take a picture with us.

717
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,342
One, two, three.

718
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:59,264
-Thank you, everyone.
-No problem.

719
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:02,184
Seo-jeong, why are you doing this?

720
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,102
Let's move to the next place.

721
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:07,189
President Yeo,
please take a picture with us.

722
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:09,649
One, two, three.

723
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:19,451
-Seo-jeong.
-This place is perfect.

724
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,120
Isn't it too dark here?

725
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,289
The picture still looks great.

726
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:27,834
Ready.

727
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,462
One, two, three.

728
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:33,757
Take a look at the pictures.

729
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,677
But...

730
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:40,305
Can I ask you what you're doing?

731
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:42,349
I told you that we're on a date.

732
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:48,188
What is it?

733
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,649
Why are you taking pictures with me?

734
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:54,820
I have decided...

735
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,322
to let you go.

736
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,160
But then,

737
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:05,080
I realized that I don't have
many pictures with you.

738
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:10,710
We never went on a proper date either.

739
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,672
That's why.

740
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:16,883
Where...

741
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:20,095
are you letting me go?

742
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,727
Actually,

743
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,106
I saw your letter.

744
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,776
I didn't mean to.

745
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,654
I found it inbetween a book.

746
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:39,281
So?

747
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:41,908
You don't need to worry about me.

748
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,662
Look at Teacher Kim and Dr. Lee Yeong-jo.

749
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:49,833
They deeply care for each other,
but respect each other's lives.

750
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:53,086
I think we can do the same.

751
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,005
This is driving me nuts.

752
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:56,840
You don't have to feel that way.

753
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,718
I'm really okay. I mean it.

754
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:01,136
That letter...

755
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:03,054
Did you read all of it?

756
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:06,349
I just saw the name of the hospital
written on the envelope.

757
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,019
Why do you ask?

758
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,407
Here. Read it.

759
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,330
Not that part. Under that line.

760
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,045
What?

761
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:38,048
-It says, "Sorry."
-That's right.

762
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,300
Right? Can you see that?

763
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:41,843
What's this?

764
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:45,388
Did they...

765
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,185
-turn you down?
-Yes, they did.

766
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:51,353
Goodness.

767
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,021
Oh, my.

768
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:55,440
Have you been turned down?

769
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:58,902
-That's awesome.
-What? Awesome?

770
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:05,450
I hid it because I was embarrassed.

771
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:07,869
I didn't want to tell you
because I was embarrassed.

772
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:11,456
You jumped to conclusions
and decided to let me go.

773
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,210
Then,

774
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:17,837
are you not leaving?

775
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:22,050
That's not it. You can't leave, right?

776
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:27,555
I wouldn't have gone alone
even if they had accepted me.

777
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,933
Why would you send away someone you like?

778
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:33,269
You should either go with me
or make me stay.

779
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,105
Still,

780
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:38,525
if we pursue different things,

781
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:40,110
we could part from each other.

782
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:42,445
How much longer do you
think you're going to live?

783
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:45,824
We have only a few decades.
Why would we part from each other?

784
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:48,493
If that would be good for the sake of us,

785
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:50,578
I could do that.

786
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:53,123
You are so old-fashioned.

787
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:56,042
That's how people thought
in ancient times.

788
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,836
You're the one who's old-fashioned.

789
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:01,464
Young people these days
would call you controlling.

790
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:02,590
Controlling?

791
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:05,093
Have you not heard the song,
"Beautiful Restriction"?

792
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:08,096
As far as I know, that's an old song too.

793
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,306
Anyway,

794
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:12,976
I'm disappointed.

795
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,489
-I love you.
-Whatever...

796
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:31,202
What did you just say?

797
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,122
Wait.

798
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:36,207
You obviously said something.

799
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:40,045
-What?
-I didn't hear it clearly.

800
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:41,796
Can you say that again?

801
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,798
I didn't say anything. Did I say sorry?

802
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:44,924
No, not that one.

803
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,593
-Dr. Kang?
-Not that.

804
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:48,053
-I heard an L-word.
-No.

805
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:49,929
-Come on. I didn't catch it.
-No.

806
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,308
-I didn't say anything.
-Liar.

807
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:54,642
-I'm serious.
-I'll tickle you.

808
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:55,935
-It's nothing.
-Come on.

809
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,520
-Sorry. I said sorry.
-Say that again.

810
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:00,356
We have a patient!

811
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,444
My head hurts!

812
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:05,862
It hurts.

813
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,072
-Dr. Jung.
-Yes?

814
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:08,323
To the hybrid room.

815
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:09,657
Come this way.

816
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:17,207
One, two, three.

817
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:19,167
-Jeong Hye-ja's guardian. This way.
-Yes?

818
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:24,839
EMERGENCY ROOM

819
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:29,302
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

820
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:51,449
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

821
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:54,327
So...

822
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:57,539
how did you and Teacher Kim first meet?

823
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:05,296
Can you keep a secret?

824
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,173
Of course.

825
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,635
-At the police station.
-What?

826
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:13,721
At the police station?

827
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,891
Oh Myeong-sim.

828
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:19,477
I know it's hard,

829
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:23,273
but how can you slap a patient
across their face as a nurse?

830
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:26,860
My goodness. Should I be patient
with a guy who feels me up?

831
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:30,238
Being a patient isn't an
excuse for everything.

832
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:33,408
-I never did that!
-You did so!

833
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:35,368
-Do you have evidence?
-You felt me up!

834
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,995
-Where's your evidence?
-You did it!

835
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:39,539
Sir, I understand but it's a bit too much.

836
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:41,749
You can't go around punching people.

837
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:43,585
What can you do?

838
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:45,795
These two bullies were
taking money from this one kid.

839
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:48,047
How can I let that pass?

840
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,300
Is this what the world has become?

841
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:52,343
Okay, then.

842
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,012
Why did they beat you?

843
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,430
They asked if I had money.

844
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:58,892
Hey! This guy is in a situation.

845
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:01,769
-Look over here.
-Will someone shut him up?

846
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:04,397
I think that guy is really dead, sir.

847
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:05,773
Hey, you.

848
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:11,821
Wake up. Sir.

849
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,449
Blood. He's bleeding.

850
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:25,668
You and you. Let's move him.

851
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:28,004
Who are you?
Are you a doctor or something?

852
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:30,632
I am a doctor. So let's move him.

853
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,175
-Yes, Doctor.
-Be careful.

854
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,595
Slowly. Put him down over here.

855
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:42,060
Do you have a first-aid kit?

856
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,394
Bring the first-aid kit.

857
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:45,772
Bring some gauze. Hurry!

858
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:46,940
What's going on?

859
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,778
It's not a gauze,
but I have a handkerchief.

860
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:54,948
Okay.

861
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:58,243
I need to stop his bleeding.

862
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,328
Take that off.

863
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:04,749
Here.

864
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:07,460
-Press on his wound.
-Sure.

865
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:09,879
If you don't repair him soon,

866
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,298
he'll be in danger from
excessive bleeding.

867
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:14,842
Where's the nearest hospital?

868
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,928
The hospital I work in
is five minutes from here.

869
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:19,472
Does it have a suture set and loupe?

870
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:21,057
Yes.

871
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:24,352
Can I conduct an arteriorrhaphy?

872
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:28,439
If you are capable
of doing such a surgery,

873
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:29,691
yes, it's possible.

874
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:32,151
I am capable, of course.

875
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,363
What's your name?

876
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,240
I'm Oh Myeong-sim, a nurse.

877
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:40,702
-Who are you?
-I'm Teacher Kim, a doctor.

878
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,498
Oh, Teacher. Sure.

879
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:11,899
OPERATING ROOM

880
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:36,215
THOSE WHO DON'T CLEAN UP
DO NOT DESERVE TO EAT!

881
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:38,551
THOSE WHO DON'T CLEAN UP
DO NOT DESERVE TO EAT!

882
