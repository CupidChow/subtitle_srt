1
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:28,445
Seo-jeong.

2
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,371
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:39,956
I'm so sorry.

4
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,919
Get in there slowly.

5
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,839
Walk slowly.

6
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,762
You might get a cut on your neck.

7
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,431
Seo-jeong, are you all right?

8
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,724
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,517
Who are you?

10
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,313
Who are you and why are you
doing this in the operating room?

11
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,315
Who is the leader?

12
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,611
Who gives orders in this operating room?

13
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,738
That's me.

14
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,700
You can talk to me.

15
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,702
What's the matter?

16
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,289
If you don't stop the operation right now,

17
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,208
I will kill this woman.

18
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,842
Hey, you.

19
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:33,760
Stop right there.

20
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,888
Put your phone down.

21
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:41,351
You will hurt her if you do anything rash.

22
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,231
This is an operating room.

23
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,566
You can't just barge in like this.

24
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,528
Also, threatening someone with a sickle is

25
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,488
just plainly wrong.

26
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,614
Be quiet.

27
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:58,368
If you don't want her to get hurt,

28
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,328
take your hands off of him.

29
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,626
-Excuse me.
-Stop the operation right now!

30
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,587
-I'm going to kill her!
-No!

31
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,588
JEONGSEON HEADQUARTERS

32
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,298
This is the control room.

33
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,885
An armed man walked
into an operation room at Doldam Hospital.

34
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,555
-Please check immediately.
-Okay.

35
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,557
I'm so sorry.

36
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,517
We made you come here for nothing.

37
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,478
Our staff members searched the whole place

38
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,521
and found no one.

39
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,481
Did you look through places

40
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,524
where he can be hiding?

41
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:32,318
We went through both floors twice.

42
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,695
Everything's fine.

43
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,490
Yes, go ahead.

44
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,034
I got a report of an armed
man at Doldam Hospital.

45
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,620
I guess someone reported
the situation over there, too.

46
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,498
He's holding someone as a hostage
at the operating room.

47
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,583
Please check.

48
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,669
Did you check the operating room?

49
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,381
Didn't you hear me?

50
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,925
Stop the operation immediately.

51
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,345
Hey, you. Turn off those machines.

52
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,556
The rest of you

53
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,892
can move aside. Hurry!

54
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,229
If you don't want to see her die,

55
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,441
turn off the machines,

56
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,694
and move away as I count to three.

57
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,572
If you don't, I will really kill her.

58
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:19,824
One.

59
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,492
Teacher Kim.

60
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,620
Two.

61
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,208
Just do as he says.

62
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,669
Move away from the table.

63
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,550
Keep your position.

64
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:44,599
Teacher Kim.

65
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:48,061
Do not make your own move
without an order during a surgery.

66
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:52,232
-Remain at your post.
-What if she really gets killed?

67
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:55,985
Seo-jeong.

68
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,239
Answer me, Seo-jeong.

69
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:05,870
Yes.

70
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,081
Yes, Teacher Kim.

71
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:10,875
I am

72
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,919
not going to stop this surgery.

73
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:16,839
Teacher Kim.

74
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,516
Okay.

75
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,810
Hey, you.

76
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,146
Do you think

77
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,982
I'm joking here?

78
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,901
Mr. Nam, how are his vital signs?

79
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,486
It's still stable.

80
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,363
But Teacher Kim.

81
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,156
Scalpel.

82
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,492
-Teacher Kim.
-Give me the scalpel.

83
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,333
Do you know...

84
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,545
what kind of an animal

85
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,213
he is?

86
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,508
He is

87
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,636
a rapist. Do you understand?

88
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:14,689
I was working late to earn all the money

89
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,942
that I could get my hands on.

90
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:21,779
One day, he trampled...

91
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,535
into my house when there were
only my wife and my daughter.

92
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,832
At that time,

93
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:35,668
my wife was

94
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,336
pregnant with another baby.

95
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:39,964
My daughter was...

96
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:43,885
She was...

97
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,805
only 11 years old.

98
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,351
That animal!

99
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:57,940
But...

100
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,694
do you know how long his sentence is?

101
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,156
Three years.
It's because he is a first offender.

102
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,786
He was even released on parole

103
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,663
because he was a first-time offender
and a trusty.

104
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,792
Can you believe that?

105
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,212
After that,

106
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,926
my wife miscarried our baby

107
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,138
and my daughter ended up

108
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:36,437
having to live with a Foley catheter

109
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,523
for the rest of her life.

110
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,402
But that prick

111
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:48,741
was released on parole.
Can you believe any of that?

112
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,124
So what?

113
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,752
Do you want to punish him yourself?

114
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,337
The laws of this country

115
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,215
is just nonsense.

116
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:05,967
I have to do this.

117
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:07,927
I am

118
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,388
a husband and a father.

119
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,640
Even though

120
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,727
I'm a poor, powerless,

121
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,523
and incompetent father,

122
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,276
I'm still their guardian.

123
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,154
I just have to

124
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:31,701
do something to make him
pay for what he did!

125
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,583
I see.

126
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,211
I understand what you mean.

127
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,091
Do whatever you want.

128
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,512
Teacher Kim.

129
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,474
However,

130
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,935
not until I finish this surgery.

131
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,942
Doctor.

132
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,155
How could you say that
after hearing the whole story?

133
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,449
I'm truly sorry for you,

134
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,036
but I can't give up on this patient.

135
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,705
I have no authority
to make such a decision

136
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,291
as I'm not a judge.

137
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,836
You can do whatever you want
to make him pay the price.

138
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,589
But you will have to do that
only after the surgery.

139
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:31,177
Do you want to kill this woman
to save that jerk's life?

140
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,179
Is that what you want,

141
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,722
Doctor?

142
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,265
I will do my job.

143
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,476
And you will do your job.
That's what I mean.

144
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,560
Damn it.

145
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,236
Scalpel.

146
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,405
Stop it! Don't move an inch.

147
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,283
Pass me the scalpel.

148
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,036
Don't, Ms. Oh.

149
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,663
Don't do that.

150
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,124
-Please stop, everyone!
-Give me the scalpel.

151
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,042
Pass me the scalpel!

152
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,836
Okay! Fine!

153
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,131
I will kill all of you then.

154
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,574
I hope you are right this time,

155
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,535
Teacher Kim.

156
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,089
You brat!

157
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,549
Seo-jeong!

158
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,847
Stop the surgery, you brat!

159
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,892
What? A hostage situation?

160
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,853
Yes, Doctor. That's what I heard.

161
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,354
In the operating room?

162
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,940
First, move the patients who can walk

163
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,442
to a safe place.

164
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,945
Make sure no one goes
near the operating room.

165
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,032
Was anyone hurt?

166
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:17,658
No one?

167
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,078
Hey, stop the surgery.

168
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:24,540
You jerk, stop it right now.

169
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,625
Stop it!

170
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,461
I told you to stop it.

171
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,546
Stop it!

172
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,176
I'm begging you, Doctor. Please.

173
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,136
Please stop it.

174
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,681
-Stop it, you scum!
-Gauze.

175
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,519
I can't believe this!

176
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,146
Suction.

177
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,440
Okay, then.

178
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,984
Half an hour.

179
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,070
I'll give you half an hour.

180
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,741
This isn't a simple operation.

181
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:02,036
I need at least an hour.
No, I need two hours--

182
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,081
Don't be absurd.
I will give you 30 minutes.

183
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,417
If it takes longer than that,
I will get my hands on her.

184
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,587
I'm not kidding. Do you understand?

185
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,255
Cops.

186
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:18,803
Gauze.

187
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,439
Ms. Jeong.

188
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,943
-Yes, Doctor.
-Can you play some music?

189
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,114
-Pardon?
-That's a good idea.

190
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:39,824
Okay.

191
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,948
Open it wider.

192
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,628
-What about the patients?
-They are moved to a safe place.

193
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,713
Mr. Gu is guarding the hybrid room.

194
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,466
-What about the operating room?
-It's not over yet.

195
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,468
I hope nothing will happen.

196
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,888
I hope Ms. Oh is safe.

197
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,332
What's wrong?

198
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:03,926
Nothing.

199
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,555
I will treat the damaged lamina first.

200
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,432
Then I will conduct
epidural hematoma evacuation

201
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,018
and find the bleeding focus.

202
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:15,813
Punch.

203
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,245
It's Manager Jang.

204
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:33,789
What should I do?

205
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,624
Should I answer the phone?

206
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,917
You should answer it.

207
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,086
It may be urgent.

208
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,840
Don't do anything stupid,
or you'll be sorry.

209
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,431
Hello, Manager Jang.

210
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,765
Suture.

211
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,896
-What?
-What's the matter?

212
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,148
It's for you.

213
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:00,983
What?

214
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:02,902
MANAGER JANG

215
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,905
Mr. Ham Seung-ho, can you hear me?

216
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,574
This is Officer Lee Dae-ho
from Jeongseon Police Station.

217
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,119
The operating room is surrounded
by the police now.

218
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,079
Put down the weapon and get out of there.

219
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:14,997
Who did it?

220
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,082
Who called the police?

221
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,584
No one called the police.

222
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,795
I think you know that, too.

223
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,135
-Cut.
-Cutting.

224
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,596
Stop! Don't make a move.

225
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,723
Stop the surgery, Doctor.

226
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,811
-Cut.
-Cutting.

227
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,647
Didn't you hear me?

228
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:44,193
You gave me 30 minutes
and I still have 6 minutes left.

229
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,612
-Cut.
-Cutting.

230
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,822
Stop it right now!

231
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:52,201
Ham Seung-ho.
Your family is waiting for you outside.

232
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,079
They are worried about you.

233
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,581
Do you want to talk to them?

234
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,001
Don't be ridiculous.

235
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,171
You can't fool me.

236
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:05,923
Dad.

237
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,811
Dad, are you there?

238
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,403
Dad, come out.

239
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,155
I'm here with Mom.

240
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,952
I'm a bit scared.

241
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,707
A-rin.

242
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,089
Cut.

243
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,133
Cut.

244
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:53,971
Dad.

245
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:10,988
Teacher Kim.

246
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,245
My operation is finished.

247
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,540
You can do what you'd like.

248
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,250
You can kill him or let him go.

249
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,128
Even if he lives,

250
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,131
he'll be disabled for the rest of his life

251
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,384
because he hurt his spinal nerves.

252
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,803
He won't be able to walk,

253
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,931
and he won't be able to use
the toilet by himself, either.

254
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,101
He will probably wish that he was dead.

255
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,645
Even so,

256
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,857
if you still wish to become
a murderer for someone like him,

257
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,359
go ahead.

258
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,278
But you will lose

259
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,740
a lot of things once again.

260
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,117
You will never see

261
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:01,080
your daughter becoming
a high school or a college student.

262
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,751
You won't be able to see her
come to you saying

263
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,712
that she wants to marry
some idiot she found.

264
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,756
Shut up. Do you...

265
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,967
Do you think that's possible?

266
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:17,554
You should protect your daughter
so that they are all possible.

267
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,475
I think that's the role
you should play as her father.

268
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,018
Shut your mouth!

269
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,605
Before I kill you all.

270
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,775
Okay.

271
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,986
This is all we can do.

272
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,739
It's up to you now.

273
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,159
Everyone, go outside.

274
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,790
What are you doing? Get out!

275
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,562
Seo-jeong.

276
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,439
You should get out, too.

277
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,359
Can she?

278
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:20,909
Get out of here

279
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,870
before I change my mind.

280
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:26,832
Let's go.

281
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,923
No matter what you choose,
this is your life.

282
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,553
But I hope you won't lose
your family because of your decision.

283
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:00,866
Teacher Kim.

284
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,076
Are you okay?

285
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:05,913
Teacher Kim.

286
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,160
You can't go in yet.

287
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,190
Why?

288
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,025
Why did you do that?

289
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,944
Why? Why?

290
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,697
Why?

291
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:26,952
What did my daughter ever do to you?

292
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,330
Why did you do that?

293
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:47,973
What happened?

294
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,391
Is everything over?

295
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,351
I'm not sure.

296
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,190
Dad!

297
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:20,630
A-rin.

298
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:39,816
Honey.

299
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,053
I'm sorry.

300
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,680
I'm so sorry.

301
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,810
A-rin, were you scared? I'm so sorry.

302
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,270
I'm fine.

303
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,730
Honey, I'm fine.

304
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,524
Honey, you should

305
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:24,528
make A-rin's favorite beef soup

306
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,573
and make sure she eats a lot.

307
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,494
A-rin.

308
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,205
Eat well,

309
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,458
and be good to your mom.

310
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:42,629
I'll be back very soon. I'm fine.

311
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:45,590
I'm sorry if you were scared.
I'm so sorry.

312
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,342
Honey.

313
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,094
Don't cry.

314
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:50,846
I'm really fine.

315
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,068
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

316
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,070
Excuse me.

317
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,660
Let me see your hand.

318
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,888
The next time you come,

319
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,265
your vitamin IV is on me.

320
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,437
I'm sorry,

321
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,106
and thank you.

322
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,443
Doctor.

323
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,071
Please do come.

324
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,183
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

325
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,649
She went through a lot

326
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:28,109
at such a young age.

327
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,488
But she still has her father.

328
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,242
She has a great father,

329
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:37,535
so she'll be fine.

330
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:40,747
What about you?

331
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,750
-Are you okay?
-No.

332
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,710
I was scared to death.

333
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,840
Anyway, it's a relief.

334
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,968
No one got hurt thanks to Teacher Kim.

335
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,887
-Right?
-You could have died

336
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,348
because of his stupid philosophy.

337
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,891
But wasn't he amazing?

338
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:03,937
How could he remain calm
in such a situation?

339
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,607
I would have panicked if I were him.

340
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,025
There are two possibilities.

341
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,070
Either he's a natural born doctor

342
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,407
or he's born crazy.

343
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,720
Don't you think it was
against common sense?

344
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,138
In a situation like that,

345
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:41,433
you should've stopped the surgery
and resolve the situation.

346
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:46,146
Besides, you let everyone leave
but left the patient alone.

347
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:48,106
How could you do that?

348
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,276
You almost let the man with a sickle

349
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,902
kill the patient.

350
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:56,614
Teacher Kim already knew
that he couldn't kill the patient.

351
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,408
Right, Teacher Kim?

352
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:03,663
What if the word gets out?

353
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:08,168
That can be a reason
to close this hospital.

354
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:15,342
What I'm saying is

355
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:19,179
that the ways Dr. Bu Yong-ju
deals with situations are

356
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:22,432
very provocative and dangerous.

357
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:27,520
It's hard for a person
with common sense to understand or accept.

358
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,940
That's enough. I'll just tell you
two things.

359
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,735
First, he's not an assailant.
He's a father.

360
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:34,819
Second,

361
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,906
don't talk about this story
like a criminal case again.

362
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:39,783
Close this hospital?

363
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:43,328
Say something like that just one more time

364
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,954
and I'll teach you a lesson.

365
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:47,791
I'll barge into your office
with a sickle. Is that clear?

366
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:51,461
I'll get back to work.

367
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:55,423
How dare he?

368
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,844
Hey, let me tell you something, too.

369
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,971
Don't call him Dr. Bu Yong-ju.

370
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,848
He hates that name.

371
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:07,936
He might throw a punch.
You should be careful.

372
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:09,604
Then, see you later.

373
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,568
Wait.

374
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,321
Are doctors in this hospital gangsters?

375
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,076
Do you how worried I was?

376
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,204
I felt like my heart was burning down.

377
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:31,626
Were you afraid I might get killed
in the operating room?

378
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,044
You're speaking thoughtlessly again.

379
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:36,005
You have no idea how I feel.

380
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,467
You just have no clue.

381
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:42,178
I guess that's why I got married

382
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:43,346
and got divorced.

383
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:44,973
Myeong-sim.

384
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,519
Mr. Jang, I made it clear
we should call each other properly.

385
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:52,355
I'm the manager now. I'm Manager Jang.

386
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:53,982
I told you I've been promoted.

387
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,734
I'm tired. I'd like to take a rest.

388
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:57,569
I understand.

389
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:00,405
But what about your work?

390
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:03,491
Let the staff members from
Geosan Medical Center do that.

391
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,826
I'm going home early.

392
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,040
She's so heartless.

393
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:23,720
Teacher Kim.

394
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,599
-What are you doing here?
-I was worried about you.

395
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,853
You must have been shocked
in the operating room.

396
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,521
I'm sorry.

397
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:38,693
I was so stupid to let him
drag me in there.

398
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,696
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

399
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:43,656
I know.

400
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,410
I don't know what to say.

401
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,789
I think I'm pathetic, too.

402
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:54,459
Goodness. Don't you even
understand what I'm saying now?

403
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:58,713
You were the one who was in danger.

404
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,800
You shouldn't be worried
about anyone else.

405
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:02,759
I'm sorry?

406
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:08,473
Are you worried about me by any chance?

407
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:09,557
Gosh.

408
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,018
How stupid you are.

409
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,687
No wonder why you're working as an orderly

410
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,731
when you should be working
as an ER doctor.

411
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,442
But you told me to do that.

412
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,946
Would you kill yourself if I told you to?

413
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,490
I would at least pretend to do that.

414
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,577
Don't smile. It makes me emotional.

415
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,121
Yes, Teacher Kim.

416
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:35,500
If what happened today causes
a relapse of your PTSD,

417
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,126
you'll be kicked out.

418
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:41,422
If you overdose on your medications
and make me worried again,

419
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,841
you'll be kicked out, too.

420
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:47,178
I mean, you should keep yourself together.
Do you hear me?

421
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,263
Yes, of course.

422
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,765
Please don't worry. I'll be fine.

423
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,693
Seo-jeong.

424
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:05,864
You did well.

425
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,246
You handled it well.

426
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,709
By any chance, are you...

427
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:25,174
complimenting me?

428
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,305
Was that a compliment?

429
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,654
PTSD?

430
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,409
Try to forget what happened
in the operating room.

431
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:52,952
Let's forget it.

432
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:56,873
Let's just remember his sad story
with compassion for him.

433
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,917
I still don't understand.

434
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:00,543
What do you mean?

435
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,003
Teacher Kim.

436
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:04,797
What about him?

437
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:10,386
He didn't do a dura repair.
What do you think about that?

438
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,640
I guess he didn't have enough time.

439
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,516
He must've thought he couldn't
finish the surgery

440
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,143
in 30 minutes if he does that.

441
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:21,272
Still, he wouldn't skip
a necessary procedure.

442
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,982
What are you suggesting?

443
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,373
I wonder

444
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,419
if he was in dilemma at that moment.

445
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,466
I'm sure he was hesitating at that moment.

446
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,262
Why?

447
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:56,641
That's nonsense. There's no way
he did that on purpose.

448
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,143
Teacher Kim skipped an important procedure

449
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,728
because of his personal emotion?

450
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:04,607
That patient is a brutal rapist.

451
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,111
When I heard the story,

452
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,530
I wanted to forget about my oath

453
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,865
and stop the surgery for a moment.

454
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:18,454
Wouldn't Teacher Kim have
the same feeling at all?

455
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:21,082
I don't think he felt that way at all.

456
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:24,627
I know him well as I've seen him
longer than anyone else.

457
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,547
He would never let his personal
emotions distract him.

458
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,674
If he was a person who would be
swayed by that story,

459
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,634
he would've given up on the surgery

460
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,678
when he saw the man put
the sickle on Seo-jeong's neck.

461
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,180
Then, why do you think he didn't do that?

462
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,391
I'm sure he had no choice.

463
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:42,061
In some cases, we shouldn't
seal up the wound.

464
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:46,232
Besides, damaged nerves rarely recover.

465
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:50,695
Do you really think

466
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:52,739
he had no choice?

467
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,701
Or did he decide not to do it?

468
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:23,269
Ma'am, are you free tomorrow?

469
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,482
I have something to discuss with you.

470
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,610
Please come back with your child tomorrow.

471
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,201
It's A-rin, right?

472
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,121
A-rin.

473
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:47,210
I'm very good at treating sick people.

474
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,712
Don't worry, A-rin.

475
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:51,714
I promise you

476
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,010
I'll do everything in my power

477
00:34:57,011 --> 00:35:00,264
to help you heal completely.

478
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,016
Okay?

479
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,190
Come here.

480
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,735
Don't worry about the medical bills.

481
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,695
I will

482
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:18,699
treat you for free. Okay?

483
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,001
Now it's fair.

484
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,265
I didn't make that much.

485
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:46,144
Cabbages were so fresh,
so I made your favorite kimchi.

486
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,354
I also sent you some mandu, too.

487
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:51,566
-Six thousand won, please.
-Thank you.

488
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,402
That's too much work.
You didn't have to do that.

489
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,863
It's not hard. It's what I do.

490
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,824
I've been making dumplings
for a long time.

491
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,368
I can do that even with my eyes closed.

492
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,955
Okay. I got it.

493
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,374
Don't skip meals.

494
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,835
-Okay?
-Okay.

495
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,211
I won't.

496
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,511
DONG-JU

497
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,274
President Yeo.

498
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:34,942
We are here.

499
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,611
Come on in, Doctor Do.

500
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,364
Where is Dr. Kang, by the way?

501
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,949
He said he would sleep in the staff room.

502
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,659
He is so stubborn.

503
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:48,414
You must be tired.
You may go upstairs and unpack.

504
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,876
These rooms are occupied.

505
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:54,712
You can choose a room you want
among those rooms.

506
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,095
Hey.

507
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,819
-Hey, it hurts!
-I know it hurts.

508
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,197
Do it gently. It really hurts.

509
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,824
I can't be more gentle than this.

510
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,037
The wound is deep.

511
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,456
-I should stitch it up.
-Really?

512
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,584
-How many stitches?
-I don't know it yet.

513
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,878
Please prepare for local anesthesia.

514
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,004
Okay.

515
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,049
Please make sure not to leave a scar.

516
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,884
You are in the emergency room.

517
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,511
I'm not a plastic surgeon.

518
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:44,929
Please.

519
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,139
I'm not asking too much.

520
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,140
Okay.

521
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,685
Let me numb it up.

522
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,687
Stay still, you punk.

523
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,771
I'm sorry.

524
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,904
Why does it hurt so much?

525
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:03,489
Are you

526
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,324
really a doctor?

527
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,452
Why? Do you think I'm a quack?

528
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,537
You're not?

529
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,792
You should be honored to be treated by me.

530
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,259
The one and only surgeon

531
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:26,387
with a triple board.
He was known as a legendary surgeon.

532
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,680
He is a failure as a human.

533
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,641
Simply put, he is a psychopath.

534
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,269
Someone calls him a psychopath.

535
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:34,854
And...

536
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:36,856
Please stop, everyone.

537
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,232
Keep your position.

538
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,859
Please don't do that.

539
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:40,985
I am

540
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,654
not going to stop this surgery.

541
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:44,739
As a doctor,

542
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,743
he makes me feel so small.

543
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,664
What are you doing here?

544
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,374
What about you? What are you doing here?

545
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,835
What do you think I'm doing? I'm on call.

546
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,129
Give him a tetanus shot

547
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,214
-and send him home.
-Yes, Doctor.

548
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,177
Goodness.

549
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:16,145
What?

550
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,938
Do you want to tell me something?

551
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,941
I almost punched you

552
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,861
in the operating room earlier today.

553
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:28,574
He pulled a weapon on Seo-jeong's neck.

554
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,660
How could you keep your cool like that?

555
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,996
What makes you think like that?

556
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,082
You seemed cool, at least to me.

557
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:41,170
If I gave up on the surgery,

558
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,964
things would have gone even worse.

559
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:48,469
Someone could have died
or at least gotten severely wounded.

560
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:51,138
I could barely keep myself in control.

561
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,809
I just tried to

562
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,770
wrap things up without anyone
getting hurt.

563
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,981
You are showing off again.

564
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,820
The technical term for this is bluffing.

565
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:10,032
In fancier words, it is romantic ideals.

566
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:11,742
Romantic ideals?

567
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:16,372
Do you know anything
about romantic ideals?

568
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:19,417
I'm nothing
without my romantic view of life.

569
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,170
-You didn't know?
-Not at all.

570
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,589
-Never.
-I understand.

571
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,092
Dr. Kang is too smart,

572
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:30,928
calculating, and selfish

573
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,389
to see that.

574
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:34,974
Are you looking down on me again?

575
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,559
It's not a compliment.

576
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,686
Why do you hate me so bad?

577
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:39,603
Hey.

578
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,647
I don't hate you.

579
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,358
I just feel uncomfortable to see
your inferiority complex

580
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,861
and self-accusation.

581
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:51,198
You always struggle to hide it.

582
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,743
You can't stand being defeated
because of the complex.

583
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,162
It is disgusting.

584
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:59,457
I'm trying my best to do a better job.

585
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,418
Does that bother you so much?

586
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:04,420
Hey.

587
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,173
You just care about doing a good job

588
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,300
without thinking the meaning of it.

589
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:12,136
What's the point of being a doctor then?

590
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,391
Please wake me up if any patient
comes in, okay?

591
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,851
-Okay.
-Doctor.

592
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,107
Bye.

593
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,818
It still hurts.

594
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,154
Gosh.

595
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:35,951
Teacher Kim rarely leaves
the emergency room.

596
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,912
He even spends more time

597
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,164
in the emergency room than in his house.

598
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,798
This is the emergency room
of Doldam Hospital. Yes.

599
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:51,842
Okay.

600
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,304
-What was that?
-There is a car accident patient.

601
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,639
He will arrive in five minutes.

602
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:57,973
It's okay.

603
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,935
-Don't wake him up.
-Pardon?

604
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,145
I will take care of it.

605
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:42,685
Hi.

606
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,106
I have something to say to you.

607
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,318
This is embarrassing.

608
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,237
Hey, In-beom!

609
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,989
Didn't you hear me?

610
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,365
I don't have anything to tell you.

611
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:57,992
I do.

612
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,119
I don't want to hear it.

613
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,204
You are being touchy.

614
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:06,625
Hey. What you said is not true.

615
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:10,421
You and I don't have any blood ties.

616
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,174
President Do and my mother

617
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,051
were just old college friends.

618
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,178
It seems

619
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,849
President Do once had
a little crush on my mother though.

620
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:25,728
But she was with another man.

621
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,231
And that's my father.

622
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,609
I haven't met him even once though.

623
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:35,279
He abandoned my mother
even before I was born.

624
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:37,615
Do you expect me to believe that?

625
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:40,284
You have to. I'm telling you the truth.

626
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:45,456
Since then, President Do helped her
when she needed some help.

627
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:46,749
As a friend.

628
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,752
After my mother died,

629
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:52,212
he paid for my education
and living expenses.

630
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,006
Of course, he did as a guardian.

631
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:56,925
If you want to lie,
you should be more creative.

632
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,177
I once thought

633
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,805
that President Do might be
my birth father.

634
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:05,100
I wished he was my father.

635
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,810
I desperately hoped that.

636
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,772
But unfortunately,

637
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:11,774
it didn't happen.

638
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,443
-What is your blood type?
-My blood type is B.

639
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:16,028
My blood type is B, too.

640
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:19,615
Hey, 27 percent of Korean people
are type B.

641
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:21,533
Do you have any other evidence?

642
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:24,036
Did you get a DNA test with my dad?

643
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,245
I don't have to.

644
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,539
If you want to make sure,
I can do it with you.

645
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,624
Do you want to do that?

646
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,504
Do you really want to do that?

647
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,589
Why? Are you afraid?

648
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:39,718
You are dragging me to a dead end.

649
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,680
Okay, then. Let's do it.

650
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:45,015
But you will have to pay for that.

651
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,101
I don't have any money
for such a stupid thing.

652
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,521
He just can't believe me.

653
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,070
Is it you?

654
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:01,907
Are you the one who made my dad like that?

655
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:02,991
Are you?

656
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,785
Let go of me, please.

657
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,204
How much money do you want to extort
from us using my father?

658
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,039
CT scan and what?

659
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:10,999
Hypothermia?

660
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,001
Excuse me.

661
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,586
Let me explain
about the treatment, please.

662
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:16,964
A president of a conglomerate
underwent the treatment--

663
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:20,259
Maybe the president was rich
enough to afford that.

664
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:21,969
We don't have any money for that.

665
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:25,222
That treatment is not even
covered by insurance.

666
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:27,349
The material cost is
already 1.6 million won.

667
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:31,311
And the CT scan and the ICU? What a fraud.

668
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:35,566
Please calm down and let go of me.

669
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:38,485
Doctors are all swindlers.

670
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:42,156
All you do is talking nonsense
just to make more money.

671
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,240
Hey!

672
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:46,785
I think you are decidedly mistaken.

673
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:48,704
I get paid here,

674
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:52,291
and doing a CT scan doesn't give me
any more money.

675
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,626
We just did that because it was necessary.

676
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,212
Also, we even got his guardian's consent
before starting everything.

677
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:59,756
I'm his guardian.
Whose consent did you get?

678
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,508
I asked them to do it.

679
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,927
After all, we have to save him.

680
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:08,390
Hey, do you think he'll live?

681
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,268
Didn't you see?

682
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:13,270
Can't you see that he's suffering?

683
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:14,688
-Hey!
-Forget it.

684
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,983
Stop his treatment immediately.

685
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,988
Stop it right now before
I sue you for overtreatment!

686
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:25,532
Sir, that is an overstatement.

687
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:26,825
Dr. Yun.

688
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,452
Don't step in. You'll get hurt.

689
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:31,455
It's true that the patient
isn't doing so well.

690
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,750
But he is not hopeless.

691
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,793
The brain scan proved it.

692
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,172
If we have one percent of hope,

693
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:43,008
shouldn't we do our best?

694
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:45,886
That's for those who are more fortunate.

695
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,055
We don't have money.

696
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:51,016
We work day to day to make a living.

697
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,893
What if he passes away?

698
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:56,021
The rest of us will spend our entire life
paying back the hospital.

699
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,231
Stop it.

700
00:46:57,314 --> 00:47:00,567
He's not going to wake up!
What's the use of keeping him there?

701
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:05,447
You jerk.

702
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,158
You are such an ungrateful child.

703
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:11,495
Am I wrong?

704
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,375
Do you have the money
to pay the hospital bill right now?

705
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,252
Your father

706
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,881
spent his entire life
making a living for you two.

707
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:26,218
Can't you do this much for him?

708
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:28,804
Is he

709
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:32,516
someone who should be treated
like this by you?

710
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:33,850
Mom.

711
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:38,188
I know. We don't have any money.

712
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:41,650
That darned money.

713
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:43,944
That money we never had
and we never will have!

714
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,615
But I still want to give him

715
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:51,827
one last chance to open his eyes.

716
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,206
I don't care if it's just for once.

717
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:59,084
-I wish he would.
-What if he does wake up?

718
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:05,007
Even if he does,

719
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,427
he'll be in bed for the rest of his life!

720
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,305
How can you handle that?

721
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,516
We'll somehow manage.

722
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:16,935
Is that so?

723
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:21,815
Fine.

724
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,694
You're so cool, Mom.

725
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,573
I don't care, then.
You two can take care of this.

726
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,534
You can take care
of the hospital bill, too.

727
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,997
Do you think I'm saying this for me?

728
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:48,258
Mom, don't worry.
I'll do everything I can.

729
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:50,761
Don't worry.

730
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,188
Is she Dr. Yun?

731
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:02,606
Yes, Doctor.

732
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,442
I see.

733
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:07,903
Where is Dr. Bu?

734
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,280
He's probably in the president's room.

735
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,576
Has it begun already?

736
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,998
What did you say?

737
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:23,293
I need to hear more details

738
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,587
about yesterday's account
in the operating room.

739
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:30,425
Was there any problem
during the operation?

740
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,177
Did you put the patient

741
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,346
under any risk during the process?

742
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:37,140
We will make a written report
about the account.

743
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,727
One more thing.

744
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:44,731
I also heard one of the doctors here
has a history of PTSD.

745
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:51,613
We are also here to investigate
whether Dr. Bu

746
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,199
knew about this.

747
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:58,662
What are you talking about?

748
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:01,498
Why does Dr. Yun
have to be psychologically tested?

749
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:02,416
I'm not sure.

750
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:06,378
An investigator
and a neuropsychiatrist came today,

751
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:09,840
and they wanted to see
Teacher Kim and Dr. Yun.

752
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:33,280
Why is Seo-jeong getting tested?

753
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,323
It was ordered by Geosan Medical Center.

754
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,700
Don't ask me.

755
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:39,077
Who told them about this?

756
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:41,163
What are you saying, Dong-ju?

757
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:42,664
Are you

758
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,666
taking Dr. Bu's side?

759
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:49,796
I'm disappointed.

760
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:54,134
This is not about taking sides.

761
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:57,679
You're using Seo-jeong
to get rid of Teacher Kim.

762
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,765
Get a grip, you idiot!

763
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,935
You shouldn't be worried
about anyone else.

764
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:07,689
You should worry about yourself.

765
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:15,697
You have a history of PTSD.

766
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,450
I completely recovered two years ago.

767
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:21,620
Really?

768
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:27,876
You and Dr. Moon got into an accident
together five years ago.

769
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:29,294
What was your relationship with him?

770
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:35,675
How did that accident happen?

771
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:37,761
It's because of you.

772
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:43,350
Dr. Yun.

773
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,185
Please answer me.

774
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:47,354
I died because of you.

775
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:50,941
Please answer.

776
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,820
Did you overlook the fact that Dr. Yun has

777
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,696
a history of PTSD?

778
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:02,160
What do you really want to know?

779
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:07,916
I'm a busy man.
Stop beating around the bush.

780
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:09,543
Tell me what you want.

781
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:13,797
Why did President Do send you two here?

782
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:17,801
We're conducting an investigation.

783
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,097
Dr. Bu Yong-ju.

784
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:24,516
Keep your manners, will you?

785
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:28,395
Are you here for me or this hospital?

786
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,485
Are you here...

787
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,697
for both?

788
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:13,315
Mr. Jang.

789
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:20,113
Manager, Dr. Kang. I am Manager Jang.

790
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:22,449
-Do you have the number?
-Pardon?

791
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,535
The number? Whose number?

792
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:33,251
It says that you recently hurt your wrist.

793
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:36,421
How did you hurt yourself?

794
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,300
What happened?

795
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:47,349
This is important. Please answer me.

796
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:50,977
Dr. Yun.

797
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,485
Push her until

798
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,528
she confesses.

799
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:01,947
May I really do that?

800
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:05,533
Many people already know that you are

801
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,661
Dr. Yun's guardian.

802
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:10,622
I also heard something
from Dr. Moon before.

803
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,042
I do not feed

804
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,544
a dog which tries to bite me.

805
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:19,297
Push her as far as you can.

806
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:22,258
I don't care if she loses

807
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:24,469
her certification as a doctor.

808
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,262
Let me ask you again.

809
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:31,810
How did you hurt your wrist?

810
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:45,198
It was my mistake.

811
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:48,827
What kind of a mistake
are you referring to?

812
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:51,538
I accidentally took an overdose

813
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:56,251
of nervous sedative.

814
00:54:56,626 --> 00:55:00,755
Every single thing you say
will be very important.

815
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:05,093
Again, in the worst-case scenario,
you might get disqualified.

816
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:08,263
Please choose your words carefully.

817
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:10,390
I understand.

818
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:14,519
However,

819
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:18,648
I still can't lie

820
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,694
to get out of a situation.

821
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:27,323
I am still...

822
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,201
a doctor.

823
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,497
What are you doing?

824
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:39,085
I have nothing more to say.
You can do your thing.

825
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,462
If you refuse to be investigated,

826
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,631
you may be put at a disadvantage.

827
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:48,470
Isn't that what you want?

828
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:52,098
No matter what I say, how I cooperate,

829
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:53,600
or not cooperate,

830
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:57,437
the result will be the same.

831
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:00,315
So stop bothering me.

832
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:01,983
Just do as you want.

833
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,902
-Excuse me.
-In fact,

834
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,489
don't touch anyone else.

835
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,449
Don't drag innocent people

836
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:12,869
into this like a coward. Okay?

837
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:17,999
Dr. Bu Yong-ju is disqualified
from any medical practice as of now.

838
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,796
Until we hear a reasonable explanation

839
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:25,590
about what happened
in the operating room yesterday

840
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:27,884
and the fact that you ignored
Dr. Yun's condition,

841
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:29,969
you'll be suspended.

842
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:31,638
You agree, don't you?

843
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:35,100
You brought this on yourself.

844
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,491
How did it go?

845
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:54,828
Where is Seo-jeong?

846
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,705
She's being tested

847
00:56:57,789 --> 00:57:00,834
by a neuropsychiatry specialist
from Geosan Medical Center.

848
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,460
What's going on?

849
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,045
Why are they investigating us

850
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,464
and what's with the psychological test?

851
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:09,384
Teacher Kim.

852
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:11,344
Here you are.

853
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,263
You're back already.

854
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,223
I heard you were being investigated.

855
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,517
I don't think it's over already.

856
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,228
I told you so.

857
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:22,605
You should have listened to me.

858
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,692
You're not good enough
to operate on Chairman Shin.

859
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:27,944
Look how it ended.

860
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:29,612
Because you were stubborn,

861
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,906
you're going to lose
another one of your favorite pupils.

862
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,909
Goodness. I feel so sorry for you.

863
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,997
You little...

864
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,165
Teacher Kim.

865
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,546
You have a visitor.

866
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:48,256
A visitor?

867
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:57,724
Hi, Teacher Kim.

868
00:57:58,558 --> 00:57:59,767
I'm here.

869
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,439
You said I should be hospitalized.

870
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:09,527
Just as you ordered,

871
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,864
I delivered your message to him.

872
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:23,833
Why are you still standing there?

873
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:26,586
Show me the way to my room.

874
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:46,314
