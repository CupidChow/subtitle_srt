1
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,837
Why do you choose
to go down the difficult path?

2
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:50,300
Many trauma patients
are still visiting Doldam Hospital.

3
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:54,220
And the staff there
take pride in what they do.

4
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,139
What does that have to do with us?

5
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,227
If you decide to demolish Doldam Hospital
to build a hospital only for the rich,

6
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:05,440
you'll face internal opposition
and lose the local community's support.

7
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,151
At first, there will be opposition.

8
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:11,321
But once we give them some benefits,

9
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,990
they'll calm down soon enough.

10
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,868
That's how you work, Professor Park.

11
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,830
That's how you failed three years ago.

12
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,625
And I remember

13
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,127
that you had to step down in the end.

14
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,136
Like I said,

15
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,139
Bu Yong-ju isn't such an easy opponent.

16
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:41,726
I know.

17
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,730
I've noticed his strong presence

18
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,900
there at Doldam Hospital.

19
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,236
And?

20
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,447
I'll show him the truth.

21
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,034
THE AGE OF DISTORTION

22
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,244
The age of distortion.

23
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,288
That the so-called
Doctor Kim's convictions

24
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,084
are dogmatic and dangerously nonsensical.

25
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:10,380
It locks up even righteous convictions
in black-and-white logic.

26
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,591
That the belief system he holds to

27
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,846
and deems as righteous
is completely unrealistic and impractical.

28
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:21,808
This strange world
even judges universal values

29
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,727
to be right or wrong
according to one's self-interests.

30
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,410
They think their power gives them rights.

31
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,997
They claim their privilege is justified.

32
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:48,793
So what?

33
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:52,422
Do you think you can get rid
of Bu Yong-ju by doing that?

34
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,175
They put basic civility behind them.

35
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,635
I believe the truth always has power.

36
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,221
I'll make sure

37
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,682
to prove that I'm right,

38
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,561
and he's wrong.

39
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:12,442
The world became a place for people
who believe they must crush another

40
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,278
to prove that they are right.

41
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,364
Nurse Park.

42
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,367
Did you know
that President Yeo was resigning?

43
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,077
No, I didn't know.

44
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:28,041
Must we keep it from everyone
even in this situation?

45
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,669
You promised that you would.

46
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:35,757
Nurse Um said that
he just left a letter and nothing else.

47
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,135
Ms. Oh seems quite upset because of that.

48
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,805
Now that all of this has happened,
it's pointless to keep it a secret.

49
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,435
Wouldn't it be better
to just tell them the truth?

50
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,439
About what?

51
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,986
STAFF LOUNGE

52
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,823
What are you talking about?

53
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,037
Nurse Park.

54
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,276
PRESIDENT YEO UN-YEONG

55
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,117
PRESIDENT YEO UN-YEONG

56
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,462
STAFF LOUNGE

57
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,638
PRESIDENT YEO UN-YEONG

58
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,068
Dr. Jeong!

59
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,448
Hey, what's going on?
What happened to Eun-jae?

60
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:26,034
-A guardian hurt her with a box cutter.
-What?

61
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,952
-Hurry up and call Doctor Kim!
-Okay.

62
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,708
One, two, three.

63
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,336
Take the gurney out.

64
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,047
Hold yourself together, Eun-jae.
Hey, Eun-jae!

65
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,924
-Give me more gauze to stop her bleeding!
-Right here, Dr. Jeong.

66
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,635
More gauze!

67
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,262
-And a D-set and EB!
-Got it.

68
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,263
And a hemostat.

69
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,349
HEMOSTAT: CLAMPS USED TO STOP BLEEDING

70
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:37,980
THE LINE THAT SHOULD BE PROTECTED…

71
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,833
I heard President Yeo was…

72
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,628
diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer.

73
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,971
When did you find out?

74
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,140
It's been about a month.

75
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,186
I was concerned about
the sound of his cough,

76
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,689
so I found out while examining him.

77
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,031
That's why

78
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,286
he suddenly went away on vacation.

79
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,081
He didn't want to cause a fuss.

80
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,959
Everyone dies,

81
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,295
so he wanted

82
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,715
to go down that path quietly
as if nothing had happened.

83
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,221
You're right.

84
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,392
Everyone goes down that path.

85
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,980
But it's President Yeo.

86
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:04,275
This all feels too sudden and strange.

87
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,496
Tell me your plan now, Doctor Kim.

88
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,749
I'm talking about Professor Park.

89
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,716
Your office is larger than I thought.

90
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,302
It's quite run-down, though.

91
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,888
President Yeo was a man

92
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,307
who liked simple things.

93
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,936
He used the furniture that was handed down
from former presidents.

94
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,271
Replace everything over the weekend,

95
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,774
especially the desk and that chair.

96
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,193
Those are too rough for Professor Park.

97
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,112
It's President Park, Dr. Yang.

98
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,031
Right, yes.

99
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:55,409
If you tell us the brand you'd like,
I'll replace those right away.

100
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,411
I'll let you know later.

101
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,624
Right, and he needs
a new coffee machine too.

102
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,418
-Professor Park--
-President Park.

103
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,878
President Park

104
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,464
likes to drink freshly brewed coffee.

105
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,007
Okay, a coffee machine.

106
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,970
-Is there a particular brand you use?
-I'll tell you that later too.

107
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:15,930
All right.

108
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:20,351
Oh, and if you need anything else,
just let me know.

109
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,061
I'll prepare it in a flash.

110
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:30,570
Right, anyway, it's a huge honor

111
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:34,991
to welcome such a great doctor
as Doldam Hospital's president.

112
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,618
I'm very grateful, and…

113
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,454
Excuse me.

114
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,416
Yes, I'm in the president's office.

115
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,584
If it's not urgent…

116
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,878
What? Who got hurt?

117
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:54,969
Dr. Jeong.

118
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,638
Eun-jae got hurt?

119
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,724
Where? How bad is it? What happened?

120
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,268
She was gashed on the neck
by a guardian who had a box cutter.

121
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,227
What?

122
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,021
Dr. Seo is suturing the wound.

123
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,816
She would've been in grave danger
if it had gone in two millimeters deeper.

124
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,069
Are you sure you're doing a good job?

125
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,364
You must be back to yourself again.

126
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,201
I should've just asked Doctor Kim.

127
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:23,414
Isn't that part a little too tricky
for a mere fellow to mess with?

128
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,790
Your head.

129
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,002
I hope it doesn't scar.

130
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,088
Why did you step in to begin with?

131
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:34,425
The kid's mom was beaten up so badly.
How could I just stand around?

132
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,093
It's their family's business.

133
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,346
The violence broke out in the hospital.

134
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,431
Were you traumatized by domestic abuse?

135
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,522
Head.

136
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:54,320
I just stood up to him
along with the victim.

137
00:10:54,403 --> 00:11:00,034
I'm sure it must be frightening
as a woman living in a foreign country.

138
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,410
That's called being nosy.

139
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,372
It's called human nature, Dr. Seo.

140
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,124
If you call that being nosy,

141
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,920
don't you think it makes the world
seem even colder and drier than it is?

142
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,297
But you shouldn't get hurt!

143
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,636
Doctor Kim.

144
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,471
Cut.

145
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,056
Cut.

146
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,685
How is she?

147
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,812
She bled a lot in the beginning,

148
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,730
but the major blood vessels
weren't damaged.

149
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,148
I injected TD and antibiotics.

150
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,609
Don't worry, Doctor Kim.

151
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,069
It's just a scratch.

152
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:38,155
You wouldn't have needed
seven stitches if it were a scratch.

153
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,825
It won't affect my ability
to see my patients.

154
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,159
And there's not a lot of pain.

155
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:46,038
It'll hurt once the anesthesia wears off.
Prescribe some painkillers for her.

156
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,331
Yes, sir.

157
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,042
Doctor Kim!

158
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:51,919
Doctor Kim!

159
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,754
Goodness, Dr. Cha.

160
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,339
Are you all right?

161
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,925
Yes. I'm fine, Mr. Jang.

162
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,010
That's good news in this unfortunate time.

163
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,804
What's going on?

164
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,265
May I see you out there?

165
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:11,939
I wonder what's going on.

166
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,442
They're discussing the incident right now.

167
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,569
Head.

168
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,028
What? Okay.

169
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,699
Doctor Kim!

170
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,593
What are you all doing here?

171
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,470
I'm glad you're here.

172
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,639
I was asking him about the accident.

173
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,934
If you want to talk about the accident,
do it at a police station.

174
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,770
Why are you doing that here?

175
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:54,273
An injury case broke out in the hospital.

176
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,108
We should call the police immediately.

177
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,693
The offender's husband

178
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,821
keeps asserting
that he's been unfairly accused.

179
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,281
Unfairly?

180
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:10,915
What's so unfair?

181
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:14,335
That lady doctor messed with me first.

182
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:18,422
I was waiting in front of the ICU
all night, then I took a short nap.

183
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,007
That's when she suddenly came,

184
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,093
yelled at me, told me to leave,
and pushed me around.

185
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,095
It seemed like she was completely insane.

186
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:29,642
Although you didn't do anything wrong?

187
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,520
I came because my kid is sick.
What can I do wrong around here?

188
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:36,023
His life is in the doctors' hands.

189
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:40,611
We're the underdogs at the hospital.
The doctors have all the power.

190
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:41,779
Hey, man.

191
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:47,284
You acted violently,
then your wife hurt one of our doctors.

192
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,495
Stop disregarding the situation

193
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,833
while you play the powerless victim.

194
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,419
What you're doing now
is overusing your underdog status, okay?

195
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,754
Listen to him!

196
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,589
He just completely denounced me.

197
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,133
He's been like that with me
ever since I walked into the ER.

198
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:06,512
He told me off to my face
and kicked me out!

199
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,222
Did you do that?

200
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:13,561
No one is allowed to speak
or act violently in the ER!

201
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:17,690
And it only makes sense
to kick you out if you break that rule!

202
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,943
My gosh, this is driving me insane.

203
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,612
Fine.

204
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,865
It's because I am ignorant.

205
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:29,159
My son was on the brink of death,
and I'm bad with words.

206
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,704
So it's true I got a little worked up.

207
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:36,625
But you can't call that violence.
That's an unfair and false accusation.

208
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,586
And what happened in front of the ICU

209
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,504
was just self-defense.

210
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:44,008
My wife was shocked
when that lady doctor attacked me,

211
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,051
so she was trying to protect me.

212
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,220
That's why, isn't it?

213
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,017
You were trying to protect me.
It was a mistake, wasn't it?

214
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,689
Ma'am.

215
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,525
Do you agree with what he's saying?

216
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,044
My gosh, this is frustrating!

217
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,049
There's no need to be frustrated.

218
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,384
We can just check the security footage.

219
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,388
Don't you have any surveillance cameras?

220
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,265
Yes, we do.

221
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,434
We do have them.

222
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,438
Could we check the footage?

223
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:40,898
Well…

224
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,765
Mr. Lee, what do you think
is happening here?

225
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,894
It looks like

226
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,690
Dr. Cha picked a fight first
no matter how many times I watch it.

227
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,149
Eun-jae.

228
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,694
You can't run from this one.

229
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:31,323
Goodness. What should I do?

230
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,118
I'm all right.

231
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,036
Are you sure you're okay?

232
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,830
Yes, of course. I'm fine.

233
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,707
Don't worry about me.

234
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,460
Just seven stitches?
We've all done this as a kid.

235
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,004
Goodness.

236
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,880
You must've been shocked because of me.

237
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,717
The box cutter barely touched me.

238
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,219
See that? It's completely clean.

239
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:53,762
Yes.

240
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,931
I was shocked because I bled so much,

241
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,933
but I ended up getting stitches
for a tiny wound.

242
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,393
Don't worry.

243
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,937
My gosh. I'm telling you, I'm fine.

244
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,064
But still, it could've been worse.

245
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,899
Of all places, it was…

246
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,651
That's true,

247
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,195
but don't you think I was totally lucky?

248
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,991
It grazed by major blood vessels
by just two millimeters.

249
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,410
Our job is pretty extreme, isn't it?

250
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,787
People swear to our faces all the time,

251
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,457
then we often get beaten up, sued,

252
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,500
and now, we get cut with a box cutter?

253
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,211
It's not like we can choose
the patients we take on.

254
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:30,090
It wasn't the lady's fault.

255
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,342
Her husband caused everything.

256
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,845
Are you the Mother Teresa of Doldam?

257
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,263
You shouldn't defend them.

258
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,307
I'm not defending them.

259
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,683
I'm defending myself.

260
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,395
We should be sorry for what happened.

261
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,065
If you keep saying it could've been worse
and that it was dangerous,

262
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,859
I'll be too frightened
to see more patients.

263
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:49,860
Don't you think so?

264
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,364
Come on.

265
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,200
I said that as a joke.

266
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,868
Just laugh, will you?

267
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,788
I'm totally fine. My gosh.

268
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,332
Man, I'm suddenly craving caffeine.

269
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,625
I'll get some coffee.

270
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,044
I need some coffee.

271
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,964
That means she's totally not all right.

272
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,509
I think so.

273
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,393
What can you do about it?

274
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,028
You should go home if that was too much.
Don't strain yourself.

275
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,572
No. I'm fine.

276
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,825
Don't pretend to be strong.

277
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,243
If I don't do that,

278
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,537
how will I last in this world?

279
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,038
You got hurt.

280
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,499
And you're living under a threat.

281
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,751
Why would you suddenly bring that up?

282
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,255
Just as you don't want
your weakness to be exposed,

283
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,924
I don't want people to see
my weak side either.

284
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,512
If I say I was distressed,
they'll say I'm way too weak.

285
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,640
If I say I was scared,
they'll say it's because I'm a woman.

286
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,644
If I can't be cool about it,
they'll call me a nuisance.

287
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:09,231
Who would say that in this situation?
People who say that are weird.

288
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,150
You were like that too.

289
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,360
You said I shouldn't have stepped in.

290
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,321
It was out of worry. Don't you get it?

291
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,159
What is this?

292
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:24,204
When I do it, I'm just stepping in,
but when you do it, it's out of worry?

293
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,207
Where's the line?

294
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,294
Where does stepping in begin,
and how do I do it out of worry?

295
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,462
Forget it. We're done here.

296
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,174
Hey, take the coffee.

297
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,010
I pressed the wrong button.

298
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,428
You can have it.

299
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,326
Hey.

300
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,620
Hey, Dr. Seo.

301
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,705
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

302
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:07,706
Hello.

303
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,501
SURGERY, FAMILY MEDICINE

304
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,878
Why didn't you keep your promise?

305
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,297
And why aren't you taking my calls?

306
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:16,965
Do you want to die?

307
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,593
-Let's talk outside.
-No.

308
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,887
I won't cut you slack anymore.

309
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,764
Today is your day of humiliation.

310
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,435
WE PROVIDE HEART-TO-HEART TREATMENTS

311
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:35,943
Ms. Oh.

312
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:38,862
What are you doing here?

313
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,365
I'm sorry

314
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,827
I couldn't tell you about
President Yeo when I found out.

315
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,874
You shouldn't have to be sorry.

316
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,127
You kept your promise with President Yeo

317
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,421
when he asked you not to tell anyone.

318
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,174
You don't have to apologize to me.

319
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,969
I never fathomed he would

320
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,680
leave like that.

321
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,099
He's always

322
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,227
neat and simple with everything he does.

323
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:12,646
Ms. Oh,

324
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,523
are you all right?

325
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,694
I'll have to be okay.

326
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,239
That's the last assignment

327
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,574
that he left for us.

328
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,077
We'll keep the Doldam spirit

329
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,289
and be ourselves.

330
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,964
I heard Dr. Cha got hurt. How is she?

331
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,300
Thankfully, her wound wasn't too deep.

332
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:44,970
I heard the new president is investigating
the details of the incident.

333
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,473
He must be awfully motivated already.

334
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,435
Anything else?

335
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,812
No, nothing so far.

336
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,024
What?

337
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,150
That's not right.

338
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,486
Jessie, what happened?

339
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,487
Hey.

340
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,824
Which one is the right one…

341
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:12,998
Goodness!

342
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,624
What?

343
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,669
Man, unbelievable.

344
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,384
What are you doing here?

345
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,138
You don't have to mind me.
Just go do your job.

346
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,349
I'm here to talk to Seo Woo-jin.

347
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,809
Dr. Seo, do you know him?

348
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,063
Why can't you tell them?

349
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:38,857
You can't ignore me completely like that.

350
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,984
Do you know how much you borrowed from me?

351
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,780
Did Dr. Seo take out a private loan?

352
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:46,573
A private loan?

353
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,617
I don't care what it is.

354
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,327
You cannot do this here.

355
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,412
This is a hospital. It's a public space!

356
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:55,082
Put on your shirt and leave
before I call the police!

357
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,084
My gosh, you're so scary.

358
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,585
But I have bad news for you.

359
00:22:58,668 --> 00:22:59,711
-Gosh.
-Man.

360
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,588
My pants are undone too.

361
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,215
-Gosh.
-My gosh.

362
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,549
-What?
-What's with him?

363
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,551
-Oh, gosh!
-That's awful!

364
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,511
Oh, no.

365
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,972
It's so cold.

366
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,392
People of this hospital!

367
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:17,729
I couldn't get my money back
from some darned jerk,

368
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,065
so I have no clothes to put on

369
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,943
and no food to put in my mouth!

370
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:26,571
My goodness, Pal-sik, you poor thing.

371
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,740
You can't even eat anything!

372
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,288
He was on night duty yesterday,
so he's probably not at work.

373
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:39,167
-Then please hurry up and call the police.
-Yes, ma'am.

374
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,171
Stop doing this and go, okay?

375
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:44,631
Why?

376
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:47,926
Are you embarrassed because everyone
knows you took out a private loan?

377
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,137
Then pay me back, you jerk.

378
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,596
I gave you ten million won.

379
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,265
When will you pay back the rest?

380
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,267
Doing this won't help you get your money!

381
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,269
Then bring me a signed agreement!

382
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:02,482
I need to get something out of this
after I put on this absurd strip show

383
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,650
to save face.

384
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,694
Bring the money
or the signed paper.

385
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,779
I'm not moving an inch before you do so.

386
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,784
Goodness.

387
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,327
Gosh, this is great.

388
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,412
This is good.

389
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,792
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

390
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,802
Goodness. Wow.

391
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,639
What are you going to do?

392
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,727
It definitely looks like
you picked a fight first, Dr. Cha.

393
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,606
That was after the so-called husband
assaulted his wife first.

394
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,775
Where can I see that?

395
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,616
I don't see him
assaulting anyone in this video.

396
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:55,035
Of course, it's not on this video, but…

397
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:59,414
That means you have no evidence. Right?

398
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,542
You should go ask his wife.

399
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,921
I got hurt trying to stop her
from attacking her husband.

400
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,088
You can ask her--

401
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,798
We already did.

402
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,426
But their story is a little different.

403
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,137
How is it different?

404
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:17,849
She was really shocked to see you
suddenly attack her husband,

405
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,852
so in trying to protect her husband,
she ended up using

406
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,396
that box cutter without realizing it.

407
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,397
Okay?

408
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,233
That can't be right.

409
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,360
She definitely…

410
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:31,947
What is it now?

411
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,283
Can you prove it?

412
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,205
Can you prove what you just said?

413
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:43,542
Wait.

414
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,462
Why do I have to prove this to you?

415
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,547
What?

416
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,840
You have nothing to do with this.

417
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,554
This happened in Doldam Hospital,
and it's Doldam's problem.

418
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,099
And it's now my problem too.

419
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,059
How?

420
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:05,230
Professor Park Min-gook became
the president of Doldam as of today.

421
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,901
Thanks to him,
I'm stuck in this hospital too.

422
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,903
What do you mean?

423
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,321
Yes.

424
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,448
It happened as of today, Dr. Cha.

425
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,826
Exactly.

426
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:22,497
So make sure you choose
the right side, Eun-jae.

427
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:26,793
And stop showing your hatred for me.
You're making me feel uncomfortable.

428
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:28,461
Okay?

429
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,845
Make her apologize to him.

430
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:42,225
And we'll cover all the expenses
for their son who's in the ICU,

431
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,311
including all his treatment fees
and hospital bills.

432
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:49,107
Let us settle this case quietly in peace.

433
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,192
A doctor was hurt in the hospital,

434
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,613
and it could've been
a huge emergency if it went wrong.

435
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,115
"Quietly in peace"?

436
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,284
What are you talking about?

437
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:02,245
We all saw the security footage.

438
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:06,708
Dr. Cha suddenly grabbed
the guardian's neck for no reason.

439
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,918
You need to call her in and check

440
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:12,130
if she had a reason or not.

441
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:15,175
I'm guessing you want
to blow up this case,

442
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:18,261
but only Dr. Cha will suffer if you do so.

443
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,056
What?

444
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,391
You'll never see a good ending
if you keep arguing

445
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,268
with such uneducated and ignorant people.

446
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,896
We'll only end up with a bad image.

447
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:31,358
For the hospital and Dr. Cha's sake,

448
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,069
it's best to cover it up quietly.

449
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,907
What if I can't do that?

450
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,161
It's simple.

451
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,749
If you refuse to do your job
as the chief of general surgery,

452
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,128
you can leave your job.

453
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,967
So, what's your plan?

454
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,344
What will you do

455
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,055
about Professor Park?

456
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:06,226
From now on,
no matter what we do, he will…

457
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:12,148
keep demanding us
to choose one or the other.

458
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,275
So, what will you choose?

459
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,652
Your livelihood

460
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,946
or pride?

461
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,656
What do you want to do?

462
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:22,701
Will you make her apologize
and cover this up quietly,

463
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,369
or

464
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,037
will you leave your job?

465
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,457
Then,

466
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,876
we can only do

467
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,045
either one or the other.

468
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,091
You're right.

469
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,928
Either we'll end up persuading them,

470
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,347
or

471
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,225
Doldam Hospital will shut down.

472
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,113
STAFF ROOM

473
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:02,615
Yes, Doctor Kim?

474
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,160
Is Dr. Cha there?

475
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:09,873
Yes, and Dr. Yang Ho-jun
is in the staff room too.

476
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,960
He's putting a lot of pressure on Dr. Cha.

477
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,004
Tell her to wait.

478
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,715
I'll head over right now,
so tell her to not do anything

479
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,175
like giving an apology or whatnot.

480
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:22,677
Tell her to stay still.

481
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,889
What's with him?

482
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,434
-Goodness, Dr. Seo!
-Dr. Seo!

483
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:30,852
My gosh. Goodness.

484
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:31,936
-Get out.
-My back!

485
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,315
Goodness, man. You beat people up too?

486
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:36,441
Get out of here!

487
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,358
-Goodness!
-My gosh!

488
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,070
Get out of here, you jerk!

489
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,823
Did you just hit me?

490
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:44,741
Okay, fine.

491
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:49,037
Let me take a tour of your hospital rooms
and get some settlement money too.

492
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,163
Hit me.

493
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:51,664
Hit me again!

494
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,337
Hold yourself back, Dr. Seo.

495
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,338
Let me go.

496
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,966
You don't have to step on some dung
and pay for the damages.

497
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:03,510
That's enough.

498
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:04,427
What?

499
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,722
Did you just call me dung?

500
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:08,932
Yes, I did.

501
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:12,852
What you're doing right now
makes you look like dung, sir.

502
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:15,855
You jerk!

503
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,274
Dr. Bae!

504
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,068
-Goodness!
-Are you okay?

505
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,278
-Dr. Seo!
-No!

506
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,281
Stop him!

507
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,076
Hey! You!

508
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,078
Let me go!

509
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,247
Let me go!

510
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,501
Let go of me!

511
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,299
That hurts!

512
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,342
Let me go!

513
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,975
-I said I'll do it myself.
-Hold still.

514
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:53,685
Gosh.

515
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:56,271
Why butt in out of the blue
just to get beaten up?

516
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,816
All you do is fiddle with bones.
Why get involved?

517
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:03,444
Because he stepped in and got punched,
the situation didn't escalate.

518
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,029
My gosh.

519
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,407
Did you save Dr. Seo then?

520
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,534
Gosh, don't make it sound so grand.

521
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,745
My gosh, you're so awesome.

522
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,038
Dr. Yoon.

523
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:17,166
Don't you think you say that
to too many people?

524
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,460
Yes, I know.

525
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,171
There are so many awesome people here.

526
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,465
That's why I love this place.

527
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,927
Gosh, I don't need this. Let go.

528
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:28,845
Darn it.

529
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:31,389
How does it feel to wear the white coat?

530
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,184
You should've told me sooner.

531
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,478
This is a hospital. Keep it down.

532
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,606
By the way, why do you think Dr. Seo

533
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,358
borrowed money from a man like that?

534
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,818
He could've gone to a bank.

535
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,737
Banks can be mean.

536
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,654
Gosh, forget it.

537
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,073
They never offer umbrellas
to those soaking in the rain.

538
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,161
He needed money urgently,
but had no one to turn to.

539
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,622
A loan shark must've been his only option.

540
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:59,000
I see. That's what happened.

541
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,585
I don't know the details,

542
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,379
but his situation seems pretty nasty.

543
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,131
Gosh.

544
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,052
Gosh, enough of that.

545
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,803
Just call the cops.

546
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,806
I'll tell the cops
how much this punk owes me

547
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,934
and show them my injury.

548
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,311
I'll report it all, so call…

549
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:20,188
Gosh, that hurts.

550
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,106
I must have a broken rib.

551
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:27,862
So you're saying

552
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,490
you must press charges?

553
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,408
Yes, of course.

554
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,327
I must put that punk behind bars.

555
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,205
All right, then.

556
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,623
Nurse Park.

557
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,376
-Did you call the police?
-Yes.

558
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,920
-They're probably on their way now.
-Good.

559
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:47,215
Escort them to him as soon as they arrive.

560
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:49,509
However,

561
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:54,138
we'll be pressing charges too,
so consider yourself informed.

562
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,683
Me? Why? What for?

563
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,562
You punched one of our doctors.

564
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,607
You threw the first punch, didn't you?

565
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:06,943
There's more.

566
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,822
You barged into our hospital,
hindered our staff,

567
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:13,366
unlawfully tried to collect,
and threatened Dr. Seo.

568
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:17,203
And who told you
that you could take your top off

569
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:19,247
anywhere you please?

570
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,374
This is a public place.

571
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:31,050
Goodness, look at this squirmy worm.

572
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,803
What the heck? This is a dragon.

573
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,556
Dragon, my foot.

574
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:40,018
You look like a dried-up anchovy.

575
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:40,935
Goodness.

576
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,521
What? "A dried-up anchovy"?

577
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,107
Did you just insult me?

578
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,608
Well…

579
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,820
You'd need to be respected first
to be disrespected.

580
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,822
-What?
-You thugs

581
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:56,284
are like leeches that lend money
to those who are in desperate need of cash

582
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:59,871
just to take an unreasonable amount
of interest from them.

583
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,499
Gosh. "Leeches"?

584
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,919
Unbelievable. Who are you again?

585
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,296
Are you really a doctor?

586
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,673
Me?

587
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,845
I'm a doctor to those
who need medical assistance.

588
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:20,641
But when dealing with thugs like you,
I can turn into a mad dog.

589
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,186
I tend to go back and forth.

590
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:30,443
So don't come back here
unless you're ill or injured.

591
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,403
And one more thing.

592
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,075
Don't put on a strip show like this

593
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,869
anywhere you please.

594
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,998
Have some shame, okay?

595
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,005
Yes, sir.

596
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,633
Gosh, there's a crazy doctor here.

597
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,386
I'll tell you more when I get there.

598
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,601
Woo-jin.

599
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:06,312
Follow me.

600
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,566
There are two fellows at Doldam.

601
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:14,028
One of them is being chased
by loan sharks because of his debt,

602
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,239
and the other one is a CS

603
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:19,784
who's a troublemaker that can't even enter
the OR due to her anxiety issues.

604
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:23,287
He's been running this hospital
with good-for-nothings.

605
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:26,791
That man, Doctor Kim,
is obviously not all there.

606
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,002
Good point. How on earth did he save

607
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,547
all those patients
with such good-for-nothings?

608
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,340
He's obviously not an average man.

609
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:42,723
How about you replace the fellows first?

610
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,686
Those two I mentioned
lack in so many ways.

611
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,437
Seo Woo-jin, right?

612
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,564
Yes, sir.

613
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:53,234
He's the one who stabbed Hyun-jun
in the back at Samjin Hospital.

614
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,319
He's got decent hands, though.

615
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:00,741
But you let him go yourself
at the main hospital.

616
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,077
That was before I saw him operate.

617
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:08,249
We'll keep him on the team until we have
someone else who wishes to work here.

618
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,460
These days, it's rare to find surgeons
who are that skilled.

619
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:15,214
If we must get rid of someone,
it should be Cha Eun-jae.

620
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:20,011
I mean, there's no need to keep
a surgeon who can't even enter the OR.

621
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:23,639
Understood, sir.

622
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,562
Are you anxious, Dr. Yang?

623
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:30,521
Sorry?

624
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,858
Are you worried
that Dr. Seo might replace you?

625
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:38,529
Come on. He's no match for me.

626
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,407
He's several years my junior, Professor.

627
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,660
Right, so ease up.

628
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:48,122
Considering him your competition makes it
look like you're intimidated by him.

629
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,541
STAFF LOUNGE

630
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:55,713
Gosh.

631
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:59,550
How long have they been harassing you?

632
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,306
How much do you owe them in total?

633
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,853
What is it? You don't want to tell me?

634
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,396
No.

635
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,441
Because of your pride?

636
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,486
I'm just not used to things like this.

637
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,781
I never tell others about myself.

638
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,287
Okay.

639
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,790
You can get going then.

640
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:34,710
Just like that?

641
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,296
Yes, just like that.

642
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,383
-What, then?
-I thought you'd hold me responsible

643
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,717
for what happened today.

644
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,929
What can you do, then?

645
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,722
"You could get fired."

646
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,141
I'm prepared for that.

647
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,396
If I fire you, then what about my money?

648
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:58,609
You promised to pay me back
over the course of ten months.

649
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,864
I will not let you leave
until you pay me back in full.

650
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,491
Don't even dream of it.

651
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,999
What? Got something else to say?

652
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:14,750
Why are you…

653
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,421
so nice to me?

654
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,840
When was I nice to you?

655
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:23,050
I always yell at you and scold you.

656
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,264
Right.

657
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,560
Don't think about anything else.

658
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,229
Just focus on your patients.

659
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,231
That's all I ask.

660
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:02,715
I have to say,
Doctor Kim is really awesome.

661
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:05,676
You said that to Dr. Bae earlier too.

662
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,387
I guess you like all kinds of men.

663
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:10,389
You've worked me out?

664
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:15,311
Actually, I fall in love very quickly.
Having crushes is like my hobby.

665
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:19,357
I understand that you tend
to fall in love quickly,

666
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,317
but how can having a crush be your hobby?

667
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,527
Can that be a hobby?

668
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,737
Of course, it can.

669
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,781
I fall for someone without his knowledge,

670
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:30,076
wallow in my own emotions,
and just break it off.

671
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,536
It's incredibly cost-effective.

672
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,705
It doesn't cost any money,
and you'll never be dumped.

673
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,123
I see.

674
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,627
I have to say, she has a point.

675
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,545
So?

676
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,173
Who do you have a crush on these days?

677
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,133
One of our doctors?

678
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,261
Gosh, I can't tell you that.

679
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,262
Why not?

680
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,808
Is it because your crush

681
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,227
is someone who's in the ER at the moment?

682
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,979
My gosh! Who in the ER?

683
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:00,898
Is it…

684
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:02,525
Dr. Seo?

685
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:05,611
Then,

686
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:07,822
is it Dr. Bae?

687
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,116
Don't tell me it's Nurse Park.

688
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,248
Gosh, of course not.

689
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:21,710
Why not? What's wrong with Nurse Park?
He's the face of our department.

690
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:24,380
Come on.
Take your time and think about it.

691
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:27,800
I actually think you two
would have great chemistry.

692
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:29,218
Nurse Um.

693
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,846
That being said, why don't we ask him?

694
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:33,514
Nurse Park.

695
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,307
What do you think of Dr. Yoon?

696
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:39,979
Get back to work already.

697
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,776
See? He has no interest in her.

698
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,112
Chemistry, my foot. No way.

699
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,322
You don't even know anything.

700
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,328
Nurse Park.

701
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:57,997
Are you busy?

702
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,039
Yes.

703
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:01,041
What's up?

704
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,920
Well, I was wondering how Ms. Oh is doing.

705
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,298
Is she all right?

706
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,300
Yes, she's fine.

707
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,302
I'm glad to hear that.

708
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,803
I was worried about her.

709
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:19,727
I'll be off, then.

710
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:22,771
Why not me?

711
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,150
Sorry? What do you mean?

712
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,152
You said it's just a hobby anyway.

713
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,905
It doesn't cost a thing
and you never get dumped.

714
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:37,786
But then, you said
you don't even consider me an option.

715
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,710
Am I that unattractive?

716
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:56,597
Well, I just didn't want
to put you on the spot.

717
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,558
Nurse Um and Nurse Joo were there.

718
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,894
But there's no one else here now.

719
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:04,855
Right.

720
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:07,608
You're right.

721
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,661
How about some beer after work?

722
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:20,496
Today?

723
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,122
At the pub, at 7 p.m.

724
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,834
Sure.

725
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:59,159
Wait, Dr. Cha.

726
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,327
Where are you going?

727
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:03,789
I'm on my way to apologize.

728
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:08,043
But Doctor Kim gave you orders
not to do anything.

729
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:12,423
I should just go apologize
and sort out the situation.

730
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:13,757
Please let me through, Mr. Jang.

731
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,134
But… Wait.

732
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,261
Don't. There is no need.

733
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:21,223
What would you even say?

734
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:25,102
You sided with the victim
and even got hurt.

735
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,814
Still, things got out of hand
because of me.

736
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,816
So, what are you saying?

737
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:34,445
You'll apologize
when you don't even mean it?

738
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:37,698
Why would you waste your time
and energy like that?

739
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,367
Because I don't want things to get worse.

740
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:44,997
Have you ever thought
that choices that you've made

741
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:49,376
just to put your mind at ease
could actually be making things worse?

742
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:53,839
I feel so uncomfortable knowing
that I put the hospital in such a bind.

743
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:56,008
It's okay to be uncomfortable.
Just suck it up.

744
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,009
Doctor Kim.

745
00:43:57,092 --> 00:44:00,512
People kneel down, bow, and stay silent
to make themselves feel better

746
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:03,015
and avoid problems,
thinking it's not worth the fight.

747
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:04,933
Hey.

748
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:08,354
If you make excuses and get used to that,

749
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,689
you'll end up becoming

750
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:14,109
a worthless person who deserves
to be mistreated all the time.

751
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:17,196
-Do you understand?
-You've gone a little too far, sir.

752
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,203
Goodness.

753
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,955
Then go apologize on your knees.

754
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:32,795
The experience will teach you a lesson.

755
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:41,553
Doctor Kim is just worried about you.

756
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:43,972
He can be blunt and harsh,

757
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:46,183
but he's rarely wrong, you know.

758
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,586
I just wanted to do a good job.

759
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,172
I'm sorry.

760
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,969
I didn't want to cause trouble.

761
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,642
Gosh.

762
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,978
What a rude, annoying brat.

763
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:35,858
If setting aside my pride
could sort things out,

764
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,736
I believed I should go ahead and do so.

765
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:45,409
I thought I should just let things slide.

766
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,578
I thought that was the right thing to do.

767
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:51,582
But the thing is…

768
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,918
why am I so upset?

769
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:58,964
Good job.

770
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:03,343
He's telling me that I did a good job.

771
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:06,430
You know when to swallow your pride.

772
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,224
It sounds like he's complimenting me

773
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:12,102
for dealing with it
in a mature manner, but…

774
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,939
I heard you're having a hard time
because of your anxiety issues.

775
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:18,734
It's much better now.

776
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,737
Since I started to take the medication
Doctor Kim prescribed me,

777
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,697
I've operated on two patients already.

778
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:24,740
I see.

779
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:30,913
When do you plan to get married?

780
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:34,333
Pardon me?

781
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,627
Why do you ask?

782
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,004
I want to know when you're going to quit.

783
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,257
Why would I quit?

784
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:44,384
Frankly, only a handful…

785
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:48,514
of female surgeons last in this field.

786
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:52,935
All those smart women study very hard
to get their medical license.

787
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:56,730
But many of them get married
after a year or two of hard work.

788
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:59,983
Or when they become handy enough,

789
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:02,611
they get pregnant
and go on maternity leave.

790
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:06,657
Why is it that I constantly feel
so uneasy?

791
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:10,244
If you leave for a few years
because of your baby,

792
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,038
who do you think will fill your spot?

793
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,458
Those who are left behind, obviously.

794
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:18,961
Don't you think it's so unfair?

795
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,631
Well, I--

796
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:24,842
That's why I rarely hire female doctors.

797
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:29,805
If it's someone
who has OR-phobia on top of that,

798
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,640
I certainly don't need her.

799
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:36,103
May I ask what you're trying to say?

800
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,898
I'm sure you've gotten the message by now.

801
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:50,826
Find a job at another hospital.

802
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:51,994
Dr. Yang.

803
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:54,913
Take responsibility
for the trouble you caused.

804
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:58,166
That's why I went to them
and apologized in person.

805
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,960
What about the damage you've done to us?

806
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:04,047
Don't you know that we agreed
to pay for all their medical expenses?

807
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:07,759
You caused all this trouble
on President Park's first day,

808
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,554
so you have to take responsibility.

809
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,807
Right then and there, I learned my lesson.

810
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,893
It's okay to be uncomfortable.
Just suck it up.

811
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:19,771
People kneel down, bow, and stay silent
to make themselves feel better

812
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,274
and avoid problems,
thinking it's not worth the fight.

813
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:24,151
Hey.

814
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:27,613
If you make excuses and get used to that,

815
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,531
you'll end up becoming

816
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:33,327
a worthless person who deserves
to be mistreated all the time.

817
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,661
Do you understand?

818
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,706
We'll give you a month.

819
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:40,125
Leave quietly before the month is over.

820
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:48,759
I've basically turned myself

821
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:52,471
into someone who deserves
to be treated that way.

822
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,573
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

823
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,046
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

824
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:55,325
DOLDAM HOSPITAL, PRESIDENT

825
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:05,669
YEO UN-YEONG

826
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:20,475
It looks like Dr. Cha went to apologize.

827
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:24,521
However, I don't think it went well.

828
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:09,649
MOM

829
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:48,438
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

830
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,817
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

831
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:02,244
Good. Open up a little wider.

832
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,038
He was eating a cutlassfish.

833
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,332
He was enjoying it,
but a bone suddenly got stuck.

834
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:08,500
Oh, there it is.

835
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:09,709
-Forceps, please.
-Okay.

836
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:15,632
Wait! Just a second.

837
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:16,758
What's wrong, ma'am?

838
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:21,555
I read that you shouldn't pluck out
fish bones stuck in the throat.

839
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,723
-Says who?
-I read it on the Internet.

840
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,310
Then why did you even come here?

841
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:28,270
Pardon?

842
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:32,399
Sorry, you're right.

843
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,234
-Go on, please.
-Open your mouth.

844
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:36,653
Good.

845
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,741
The Internet is the problem.

846
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:44,995
It's full of misleading information.
Some people even come with diagnoses.

847
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:47,914
Why don't they just have
the Internet treat them, then?

848
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:51,334
Thank you, doctor.

849
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:52,878
No problem.

850
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:55,213
Be careful so it doesn't happen again.

851
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:57,299
Bye. Make sure you always chew well.

852
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:58,884
Will do. Goodbye, doctor.

853
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,343
Bye.

854
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,475
I miss my dear Byeol now.

855
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:08,810

NURSING DEPARTMENT

857
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:12,480
This is Doldam Hospital's ER.

858
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:14,399
Yes, go on.

859
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,026
I see.

860
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:20,822
What's wrong?

861
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,366
What now?

862
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:43,637
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

863
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,352
-What's wrong?
-The saturation suddenly dropped.

864
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:51,603
The saturation?

865
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:52,938
SATURATION: BLOOD OXYGEN LEVEL

866
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:54,439
The lungs don't sound good.

867
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:57,108
LUNG SOUND: SOUND OF BREATHING

868
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:59,194
The chest wall is retracting too.

869
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:00,487
Should we intubate him?

870
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:03,198
How much does this kid weigh?

871
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:04,366
He weighs 20 kg.

872
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:05,909
We have Broselow tape, right?

873
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:07,160
-Yes.
-Get it now.

874
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:10,247
BROSELOW TAPE: COLOR-CODED TAPE
FOR PEDIATRIC EMERGENCIES

875
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:11,248
It's blue.

876
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:14,292
Get a 5.5 mm endo tube now.

877
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,543
Uncuffed?

878
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:25,637
PRESIDENT YEO UN-YEONG

879
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,520
Ms. Oh.

880
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:36,564
A patient with terminal renal failure
is coming in.

881
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,149
And?

882
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:39,985
But the thing is…

883
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:47,993
Do you think it's pulmonary edema?

884
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:50,662
PULMONARY EDEMA: EXCESS FLUID IN THE LUNGS

885
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,164
What's the urine output?

886
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,458
The input and output is 150 ml, positive.

887
00:54:56,459 --> 00:55:00,171
Then I don't think it's edema.

888
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:02,966
It's more likely pneumonia with ARDS.

889
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:07,220
Run a full lab, from CBC and CRP to ESR.

890
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,473
Also, put him on
a third-generation cephalosporin.

891
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:13,101
Okay, will do.

892
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:22,110
And carefully explain
his condition to his parents.

893
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,489
Okay?

894
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:32,871
What's wrong? Is something bothering you?

895
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,666
No, sir. It's all good.

896
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:37,667
I'll do it.

897
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:38,918
STAFF ONLY

898
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,211
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

899
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:41,713
-Doctor Kim.
-Yes?

900
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:44,382
You need to go to the ER now.

901
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,134
The ER?

902
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,845
Where? Who called?

903
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:51,556
We got a call from a prison.

904
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:53,892
One of the inmates got hurt.

905
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:56,644
He's on dialysis
for terminal renal failure.

906
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:58,229
But the thing is…

907
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,359
What is it?

908
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:05,070
He's serving a life sentence for murder.

909
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,877
Dr. Seo, were you called to the ER?

910
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:22,253
Yes.

911
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,839
I'll drop this off
at Doctor Kim's office and join you.

912
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:26,841
Wait.

913
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:33,056
Thank you for earlier.
You stopped me from hitting back.

914
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:37,769
When dealing with people like that,
you only lose if you get angry.

915
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:41,022
Do you know a lot about such people?

916
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,399
Well…

917
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:43,858
Just a little.

918
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:46,611
Get going. I'll join you shortly.

919
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:50,031
TREATMENT ROOM 2

920
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:13,972
THE FULL STORY ON THE FAMILY SUICIDE

921
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,683
FAILED MAN IN HIS 40'S COMMITS FAMILICIDE

922
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:21,229
THE FULL STORY ON THE FAMILY SUICIDE

923
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,732
STARTED HIS BUSINESS IN THE MID-90S

924
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,027
WHY SUCH AN EXTREME DECISION?

925
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:40,331
Have you seen the boy's parents?

926
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:41,875
Well, let me think.

927
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:44,002
I think they were here earlier.

928
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:54,471
Mr. Jang.

929
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:56,556
You're here, Dr. Nam.

930
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:57,640
What happened?

931
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,893
I heard a lifer is coming in.

932
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,352
He'll be here in 20 minutes.

933
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:03,813
Doctor Kim and Professor Park
are actually having

934
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,065
a heated argument about it right now.

935
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,108
A heated argument?

936
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,986
Call the ambulance right now.

937
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:12,363
Tell them we won't accept that patient.

938
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:13,948
Wait, hang on.

939
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,493
It's not like the ER is packed.

940
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:18,369
We have empty rooms as well.

941
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:21,206
And we have available ORs too, so why?

942
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:22,874
Why can't we take this patient in?

943
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:25,543
He could be a threat to other patients!

944
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:36,763
Ms. Oh, what are his vitals at the moment?

945
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:38,598
He's at 80 over 40, 110 BPM.

946
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:40,016
And he's bleeding heavily.

947
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:41,184
Did you hear that?

948
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:45,522
A terminal renal failure patient
is in shock due to excessive bleeding.

949
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,815
How could he be a threat to anyone?

950
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:50,485
He's a lifer who killed two people!

951
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:52,737
He's in shock due to excessive bleeding!

952
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:27,689
Look, Dr. Bu Yong-ju.

953
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:29,857
What?

954
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:32,402
I guess you enjoy the thrill,

955
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:33,319
but I don't.

956
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:38,783
I want this hospital to be a safer place.

957
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:43,871
Who told you that being selective
about which patient to accept

958
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:45,790
will make this hospital a safer place?

959
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:48,668
In any case, he's a lifer
who committed murder.

960
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:52,797
It's not like we're well-equipped enough
to be able to accept such a patient.

961
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,968
We must avoid the possible risks.

962
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:58,511
That's my principle as a doctor.

963
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:03,850
Shouldn't we also think about
the safety of our patients and staff?

964
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:10,231
Do you realize
that you're contradicting yourself?

965
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:13,359
If you're that concerned
about the safety of our staff,

966
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:15,570
why didn't you do anything

967
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:18,156
when our fellow got attacked
and tried to cover it up?

968
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:23,244
They're two different cases.

969
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:24,203
What?

970
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:27,582
That was clearly an accident,

971
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:29,000
and Dr. Cha apologized

972
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:32,420
because she felt partially responsible
for what happened!

973
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,006
What?

974
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,342
It was clearly an accident?

975
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:39,385
Darn you.

976
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:43,348
What?

977
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:47,560
Look!

978
01:00:50,938 --> 01:00:52,231
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

979
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:53,524
My goodness.

980
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,116
Doctor, please help me.

981
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,037
Sir.

982
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,538
Sir!

983
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,583
-Hurry. Quick.
-Hurry!

984
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:14,003
Get me some gauze. Quick!

985
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,588
Unbutton his shirt.

986
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:17,548
Hurry. Hurry up.

987
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:19,092
Hurry!

988
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:49,997
I'll check for rhythm first.

989
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:53,251
Nothing.

990
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:54,752
I'll take over.

991
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:02,510
Take a good look.

992
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,138
Domestic violence is never an accident.

993
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:10,768
Eun-jae got hurt while trying to help.

994
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:13,563
And you,
as the president of this hospital,

995
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,941
you should've tried to stop
this vicious cycle if anything,

996
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:18,651
but you swept it under the rug.

997
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:23,614
Had we called the police that day,
this would've never happened.

998
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:26,284
"Principle"?

999
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:27,618
Give me a break.

1000
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:30,621
You don't want to risk
ruining your reputation,

1001
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:32,749
so you're just trying to avoid problems.

1002
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:35,793
Doctor Kim, the paramedics just called.

1003
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:38,463
Take him to the hybrid room immediately.

1004
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:39,839
Got it.

1005
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,632
What? Got objections?

1006
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:50,516
Checking for rhythm.

1007
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,441
Still nothing.

1008
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:20,463
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

1009
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:34,560
SEO AND HIS WIFE WERE FOUND DEAD

1010
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:46,447
What do we do,

1011
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:49,158
Jessie?

1012
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:14,475
It looks like a brain issue, right?

1013
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:17,019
Could surgery treat it?

1014
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:18,896
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1015
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:22,692
Shouldn't the hospital be restructured
so that it centers around you, sir?

1016
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:25,069
Tell everyone to be well prepared.

1017
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:27,738
Who'd donate their kidney
to a murderer like me?

1018
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:30,032
A transplant for a patient
who's not even next in line?

1019
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,827
The paramedic who's about
to be declared brain-dead…

1020
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:35,454
-I can't agree to this.
-Not because he's a lifer?

1021
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,832
Is it wrong to want to save him
while we can?

1022
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:39,584
We must pay our respects.

1023
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:41,544
Don't treat him as just an organ donor.

1024
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:43,045
Treat him like a person.
