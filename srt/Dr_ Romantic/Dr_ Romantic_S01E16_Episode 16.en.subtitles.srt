1
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:22,856
Are these people

2
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,860
the staff members who will
participate in my surgery?

3
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,613
-Yes, Chairman Shin.
-I see.

4
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,366
They all look trustworthy.

5
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,411
Don't you think so?

6
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:38,371
Yes, I agree with you.

7
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:41,791
I was discussing

8
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,336
your surgery with them.

9
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,088
That's good.

10
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,050
Actually, I came down here

11
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,470
to talk about it.

12
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,686
-Teacher Kim.
-Yes?

13
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:03,813
Let us

14
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,318
stick to our original plan.

15
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:09,944
Pardon?

16
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,531
Let's proceed with the surgery

17
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,117
as we planned.

18
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,411
Chairman Shin.

19
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,543
I think Geosan Medical Center needs

20
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:29,088
a young chairman at this juncture.

21
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,300
So I'd like to have you

22
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:36,304
as the next chairman of the foundation.

23
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,972
Watch what you say about that.

24
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,849
My father

25
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,060
is still in good condition.

26
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:44,229
I know

27
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,105
you wouldn't be comfortable
talking about it.

28
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,733
But it wouldn't be amiss

29
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,527
to plan for what's ahead--

30
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,653
He said

31
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,822
he is going to have the operation.

32
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,993
-Is he going to have the operation?
-Yes.

33
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,997
Chairman Shin wants
to proceed with it no matter what.

34
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,377
Did you

35
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:10,380
make your decision
after due consideration?

36
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,048
Of course I did.

37
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,344
It is a matter of life and death.

38
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,431
I know I am old

39
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:24,644
and I've lived long enough.

40
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,523
But it doesn't mean
that I don't cling on to life.

41
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,402
Rather, the contrary.

42
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,197
Because I don't have long to live,

43
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,285
I desperately want to live longer.

44
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,163
But this is

45
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,708
just not right.

46
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,587
Should I wait until I die

47
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,173
doing nothing?

48
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,177
That doesn't sound like me.

49
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:03,725
It's not a simple operation
where we just replace batteries.

50
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:07,896
We are talking about replacing
the artificial heart itself.

51
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,565
It won't be easy

52
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,067
to go through the operation.

53
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,278
I know.

54
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,282
Do you still want

55
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,200
to proceed with the operation?

56
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,453
Even if I have one day left to live,

57
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,749
I want to live a decent life.

58
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,959
I want to die like that.

59
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,880
Teacher Kim.

60
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,133
I want you

61
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,844
to respect my decision.

62
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,387
Okay?

63
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,601
What did Bu Yong-ju say?

64
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,019
Did he say

65
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,813
-he'd perform the operation?
-I'm not sure.

66
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,943
What if he says yes?

67
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,320
Who in the right state of mind
would do such a thing?

68
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,365
He knows Chairman Shin's condition
better than anyone.

69
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,824
He's Bu Yong-ju after all.

70
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,787
He's the type that
enjoys challenging himself

71
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,497
with an operation that seems impossible.

72
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,793
He's more likely to proceed with it
than to refuse it, don't you think?

73
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,754
If so,

74
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:19,425
he will be digging his own grave.

75
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,602
What do you think he is doing?

76
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,731
Is he considering whether

77
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,733
to proceed with the operation?

78
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,112
It seems like he is.

79
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,240
Is he going to do it?

80
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,372
Or is he giving up?

81
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,665
I don't think so.

82
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,625
I agree with you.

83
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,419
You think? I knew it.

84
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,171
Teacher Kim wouldn't
give things up so easily.

85
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:01,050
If so, what is he trying to decide?

86
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,136
Maybe he is busy

87
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:06,472
making plans for the operation.

88
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,474
What you say is very plausible.

89
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,979
Is he making plans for the operation?

90
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,316
What kind of plans

91
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,192
is he thinking about

92
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,737
to make the operation successful?

93
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,523
Give him hydration.

94
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,234
Once he gets better,
send him to an outpatient department.

95
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,028
Dr. Woo, I need to talk to you.

96
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,328
Why did you call a surgeon for this?

97
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,663
-Pardon?
-He doesn't have severe symptoms,

98
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,956
and he even passes gas.

99
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,168
You should be able to handle this much
in the emergency room.

100
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:19,378
He has a history of operation,

101
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,423
and I found ileus on the x-ray.
So I called just in case.

102
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,259
I know there is no real boundary
between ER and GS in this hospital,

103
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,054
but don't you think you shouldn't
call a surgeon just for everything?

104
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,390
Woo Yeon-hwa. No, Dr. Woo.

105
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,352
I heard you were a first year
resident of General Surgery.

106
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:38,481
Then you are supposed to know
when to call a surgeon and when not to.

107
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,317
-I'm sorry, Doctor.
-Don't be sorry and do...

108
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,532
Just do better.

109
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,334
What's the matter?

110
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,753
I guess he is upset with me.

111
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,380
Why?

112
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,632
Probably because I did something wrong.

113
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,600
You jerk.

114
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,689
Dr. Woo, did you just ignore my order?

115
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,568
I told you to assist the operation,
not Dr. Kang.

116
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,112
Dr. Kang insisted to do that.

117
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:29,073
Are you saying Dr. Kang's order
takes priority over mine?

118
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,285
How am I supposed to trust you
when you're being like this?

119
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,328
I'm sorry, Doctor.

120
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:37,081
-I should've given it more thought.
-Don't even be sorry.

121
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,917
Just make sure to do your job right.

122
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,640
Are you saying we should shorten the time?

123
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,351
-Do you think it's impossible?
-Are you really going to

124
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,937
proceed with the operation?

125
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:05,193
I'm just thinking it may be manageable.

126
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,405
Only if we can finish
the whole process within six hours.

127
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,949
Within six hours?

128
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,165
That's ridiculous. Six hours?

129
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,502
This surgery usually takes
at least nine to ten hours,

130
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,463
and we already shortened it
to 7 hours and 30 minutes.

131
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,758
You want to shorten it
by an hour and a half again?

132
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,511
That's why I'm asking you.

133
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,013
How much more time can you save from that?

134
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,475
Ten minutes.
No, even five minutes is good.

135
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,769
Do you think you can do that?

136
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:40,978
Are you

137
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,357
seriously considering finishing
the operation in six hours?

138
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,443
Can you do it or not?

139
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,655
-Six hours?
-Six hours?

140
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,824
So that's what he's been trying
to figure out.

141
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,576
In order to finish in six hours...

142
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,453
Hold on.

143
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,830
That means we can't afford
to touch a single artery

144
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,667
while excoriating the tissue through
sternotomy and cannulation.

145
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,545
Even then, we'd barely be able
to finish in time.

146
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,297
Even if we do that, we won't be able
to finish in six hours.

147
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,926
Excoriating the tissue
without touching the artery is impossible.

148
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,428
Don't you think it could be possible
for Teacher Kim?

149
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,390
It's not like he's been specializing
in heart surgeries.

150
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:20,309
It'll be difficult even for Teacher Kim.
It can't be done.

151
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,852
My thoughts exactly.

152
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,605
Besides, doing the surgery

153
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,482
will not benefit Teacher Kim whatsoever.

154
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,610
He will be criticized regardless of
his success or failure.

155
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:33,030
-Do you think so?
-That won't be all.

156
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,909
In the case he fails,
he'll take all the blame.

157
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,036
I doubt that.

158
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,455
Do you think President Do
will leave Teacher Kim alone?

159
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,874
He's been waiting for an opportunity
to get rid of him.

160
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,668
If the operation fails,

161
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:50,298
he'll quickly grab that opportunity
to hold Teacher Kim responsible.

162
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,925
Which is why we can't afford a failure.

163
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,763
Failure?

164
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,807
We shouldn't let that happen, then.

165
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,601
Don't you think so, Dong-ju?

166
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:05,146
The patient is a 72-year-old man
with terminal lung cancer.

167
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,607
Putting him under anesthesia
for a long time alone

168
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,609
is a great risk.

169
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,778
Which is why we shouldn't
go over six hours.

170
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:16,866
You know better than us
that it's impossible.

171
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,285
So what? You can't do it?

172
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:22,413
No. I'm opposing it.

173
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,165
Okay.

174
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,501
One person opposes.

175
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,421
What about you, Dr. Nam and Ms. Oh?

176
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:35,468
Okay. You two are on hold.

177
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,095
And you, Dr. Yun?
Are you against it as well?

178
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,473
No. I'm in favor of it.

179
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,559
-Seo-jeong.
-Okay.

180
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,269
One person in favor.

181
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,147
All right.

182
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,486
You two can let me know
once you make up your mind.

183
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,488
If possible,

184
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,532
I'd like you to be in favor.

185
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,826
Until then.

186
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,585
I guess he's really going
to perform the surgery.

187
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,671
He was going to do it in the first place.

188
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,053
We should be stopping him.

189
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,972
How could you support his decision?

190
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,475
Because it's Teacher Kim's decision.

191
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,852
Will you die if he tells you to?

192
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:30,356
I told him that I'd at least pretend.

193
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,737
What's the reason behind it?

194
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,948
What's the reason behind
your implicit faith in him?

195
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,032
Respect?

196
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:43,160
If you respect him,
you should've been more rational.

197
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:47,498
The doctor you respect is about to perform
a very risky surgery.

198
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,250
Not only Teacher Kim himself

199
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,169
but he could put everyone
at Doldam Hospital in trouble.

200
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,172
The fact that Teacher Kim is so confident

201
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,175
must mean that he's gotten it
pretty much figured out already.

202
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,387
What if he actually finishes
the operation in six hours? What then?

203
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,930
It's absolutely impossible.

204
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,557
I think trying to finish under six hours

205
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,393
will more likely to lead us into mistakes.

206
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:11,230
Even after taking every variable
into account,

207
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,024
I really want to be

208
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,610
a part of that operation.

209
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:22,116
It might be an operation

210
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,617
of my lifetime.

211
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:27,037
This is a very rare case of an operation.

212
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,833
More importantly, when do you think

213
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,336
I'll get another chance to witness
Teacher Kim performing a surgery?

214
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,337
Don't you think so?

215
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,756
But still, the risk is too high.

216
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,719
I think it's a risk worth taking.

217
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:42,970
And what if he fails?

218
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,017
I don't even want to think about it.

219
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,728
But even if he does fail,

220
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,438
I'll be grateful

221
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,608
for that I could be part of the process
with Teacher Kim.

222
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,320
I think that alone has meaning.

223
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,172
That lunatic.

224
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:22,009
So are you saying
he's pressing on with the operation?

225
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:24,803
Okay.

226
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,389
Get me the list of the staff members.

227
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,768
Has Bu Yong-ju decided
to perform the surgery?

228
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:33,812
Yes, apparently.

229
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,106
With how things are panning out,

230
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,778
you'll need to come up with
a plan in case of an emergency.

231
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,240
-What kind of emergency?
-Chairman Shin

232
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,326
is 72 years of age. Furthermore,

233
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,495
he has terminal lung cancer.

234
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,375
He'll have to withstand
an eight to nine-hour-long surgery

235
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,294
under general anesthesia.

236
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:01,840
That alone puts the operation
at a very high risk.

237
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,467
The operation might be successful.

238
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,761
Regardless of its success or failure,

239
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:10,599
the mere fact that he's undergoing surgery
is meaningless

240
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,601
with the condition he's in.

241
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,062
But

242
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,648
you shouldn't worry too much.

243
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,151
I have a plan.

244
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,035
I'll go to Doldam Hospital

245
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,038
and offer him two propositions.

246
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,128
I told you not
to come down here ever again.

247
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,256
Have you forgotten about what I said?

248
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,717
Why come here? For what purpose?

249
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,094
I just heard
about Chairman Shin's surgery.

250
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,095
And?

251
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,681
Are you going to try to stop me again?

252
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,434
That won't be possible

253
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:54,977
with Chairman Shin being so stubborn.

254
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,063
I'm thinking about supporting you

255
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,399
so you can do it properly.

256
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,612
-Support me?
-Let's start by

257
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,031
replacing all of your staff members.

258
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:18,250
What is this gibberish I'm hearing?

259
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,002
Just to be clear,

260
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,504
this wasn't my order.

261
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,632
It's a request made by Director Shin.

262
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,592
Consider yourself informed.

263
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,386
What are you talking about?

264
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,598
The staff members are to be replaced
with the staff from Geosan Medical Center?

265
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,475
President Do came down here
to say that in person?

266
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:37,269
Yes. On top of that, he said
that it wasn't his order.

267
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,229
It was a request made
by Chairman Shin's daughter.

268
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,440
The staff members will be replaced?

269
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,526
With the staff from Geosan Medical Center?

270
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,696
Yes. President Do came here
and said that in person.

271
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,366
I understand. I'll get down there.

272
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,242
Okay.

273
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,796
You too know

274
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,924
that Geosan Medical Center is famous
for its thoracic surgery department.

275
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,301
Do you want experienced personnel?

276
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,180
Or young and skilled fellow doctors?

277
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,307
Right.

278
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,476
You'll need an anesthesiologist as well.

279
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,021
I took a look at the list
of your staff members.

280
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,565
I saw Dr. Nam's name on it.

281
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,652
Letting someone in a medical lawsuit
to be in charge of

282
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:30,155
Chairman Shin's anesthesia is...
How should I say this?

283
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,782
I don't like it.

284
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,827
It's not like it was
a simple medical accident.

285
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,165
It involved someone dying.

286
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:50,467
Oh, there's something else.
I'll also send you

287
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,177
two skilled scrub nurses.

288
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:55,472
They're on a whole another level

289
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,433
compared to nurses at a cottage hospital.

290
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,479
Look at you all yapping about.

291
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:06,900
Will you shut your mouth
before or after I punch you?

292
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,277
Right now,

293
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,739
I'm doing you a favor out of kindness.

294
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,198
I'm sorry to tell you this,

295
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:17,161
but nobody else other than
my own staff members can be in my OR.

296
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,164
A request made by Director Shin?

297
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:24,001
What a joke.

298
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,796
Go back and tell her
that I don't give a damn.

299
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,342
Your staff members

300
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,471
are all a bunch of people
with disqualifications.

301
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,515
In case the operation doesn't go well,

302
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,185
you wouldn't want room for controversy.

303
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,686
Hey, President Do.

304
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,147
I just need you to stay out of my way.

305
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,191
Then, there won't be any problems.

306
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,651
If you can't change the staff members,

307
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,739
you have to accept another offer.

308
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:55,824
Are you sure you'll be okay?

309
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:57,534
Another offer?

310
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,080
What another offer?

311
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,831
Live surgery.

312
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,417
LIVE SURGERY: SURGERY PERFORMED
FOR DEMONSTRATION

313
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,839
Live surgery?

314
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,509
What?

315
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,846
They'll perform my surgery
in front of an audience?

316
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,640
Yes, Father.

317
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,935
Whose idea is this?

318
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,062
Is this from President Do?

319
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,439
The ones watching the surgery will be

320
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,233
people from the hospital, me,

321
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,778
and cardiothoracic surgeons
of Geosan Medical Center.

322
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,196
I think I'd feel better

323
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,950
if I watch and see
how your surgery is going.

324
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,077
Please, say yes.

325
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,665
Choose one.

326
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,750
Change your staff members

327
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,545
or choose to go with live surgery.

328
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,713
If you choose to do the live surgery,

329
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,676
all the cardiothoracic surgeons
from the main hospital will come

330
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,845
and observe the operation.

331
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,471
Unbelievable.

332
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,141
What will you choose?

333
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,602
Will you change your staff members?

334
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,441
Bu Yong-ju

335
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,486
won't change his staff members.

336
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,407
Will you choose to do a live surgery?

337
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,119
What happens

338
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,996
if he chooses to go live?

339
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,622
Like I said,

340
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,708
it'll be like digging

341
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,710
his own grave.

342
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,671
Which one will you choose?

343
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,007
Will you change your staff members?

344
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,387
Or will you do a live surgery?

345
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,936
What kind of an awful man is he?

346
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,981
How can he ask you to choose
between the two?

347
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:55,027
What kind of a threat is this?
Isn't that right, Teacher Kim?

348
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,655
Well, we can't say
that it's just a threat.

349
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,657
This operation is so rare

350
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,660
that the main hospital would
want to take part in this.

351
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,663
But his intention isn't so innocent!

352
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,165
Honestly speaking,

353
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:12,002
that just means he wants to keep
his eyes on our operation.

354
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,671
Also, why did he have to pry

355
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,382
into Dr. Nam's medical litigation?

356
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,550
On top of that,

357
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,553
he called me an old nurse
who works at a cottage hospital.

358
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,472
He didn't say you were old.

359
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,681
Calm down.

360
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,268
Anyway, I am

361
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,395
deeply offended, Teacher Kim.

362
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:34,524
I believe you should turn down
both conditions from President Do.

363
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,360
I have another idea, Ms. Oh.

364
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,445
This can be a chance for us.

365
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:39,821
This isn't a chance!

366
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,907
Is this our chance to be angry?

367
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,825
It's a chance for us

368
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,411
to show the world how good
of a surgeon Teacher Kim is.

369
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,121
What do you think, Teacher Kim?

370
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,379
I don't know. Well...

371
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,048
Why don't you change your staff members?

372
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,387
Like President Do mentioned,

373
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,472
we shouldn't leave any room for a dispute.

374
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,391
The verdict isn't out,

375
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:11,019
but it is true that I am
in the middle of a litigation.

376
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,814
If the surgery goes wrong by any chance,

377
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,190
my situation

378
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,361
can affect you in a bad way.

379
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,238
Dr. Nam.

380
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,908
We can't be a burden
to Teacher Kim, Ms. Oh.

381
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,577
Right now, let's just focus on

382
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,455
how we can help Teacher Kim.

383
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,976
I'll reduce five minutes from my part.

384
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,146
Do you think that'll help?

385
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,736
You are in.

386
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,779
Two of you agreed including Dr. Yun.

387
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,368
What about Dr. Nam and Ms. Oh?

388
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,748
Oh, my goodness.

389
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,666
Are you still undecided?

390
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,711
Teacher Kim, please hear me out--

391
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,797
Stop talking nonsense.

392
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,716
Let's do what we always do.

393
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,384
That's how you can help me.

394
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,510
But Teacher Kim--

395
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:29,389
I have no one else to depend on
if you are not there.

396
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:32,350
If I have someone else
in the operation room,

397
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,479
I won't be able to focus
because I'll be more nervous.

398
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,980
If I can't focus,

399
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,775
the operation time will be delayed.

400
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,444
I can't even miss a minute now.

401
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,030
Do you think I should
waste my time like that?

402
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,992
And you too, Ms. Oh.

403
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,370
Why are you getting so angry

404
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,955
at President Do's nonsense?

405
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,124
The only scrub nurse

406
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,960
who can work up to my speed is

407
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,338
just you, Ms. Oh.

408
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:04,841
And you already know that.

409
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,135
Well, yes.

410
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,346
That's true.

411
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:14,184
I thought I could do this under six hours

412
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,602
because I knew

413
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,354
I would be doing the operation

414
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:20,023
with the staff right here.

415
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,735
My gosh.

416
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:27,405
Do-il, did you have to make me

417
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,075
state the obvious like this?

418
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,079
Should I be doing this, Ms. Oh?

419
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:39,876
It sounds heartwarming and nice.

420
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,089
What will you do?

421
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,590
Dr. Nam and Ms. Oh.

422
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,718
Will you join the operation or not?

423
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,012
What can I do?

424
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:52,973
I'll be there.

425
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:56,309
I'm the only scrub nurse
who can work at your speed.

426
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,734
Dr. Nam.

427
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,320
-What about you?
-Are you really okay

428
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,322
with doing this live?

429
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,659
You make me so frustrated.

430
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,874
President Do.

431
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,793
Let's do the live surgery.

432
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,587
Satisfied?

433
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,340
Satisfied?

434
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,228
It's just as I thought.

435
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,938
Yes.

436
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,857
He has

437
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,734
chosen to do a live surgery.

438
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,320
Our next step is

439
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,572
to destroy him for good.

440
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,208
So

441
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:05,629
when is the operation?

442
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,130
In five days.

443
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,424
We'll start at 9 a.m.

444
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,384
I see.

445
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,556
I heard my daughter

446
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,892
asked for something troublesome.

447
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,978
I don't mind.

448
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:25,523
It doesn't matter if I go live or not.

449
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,235
I'm only concerned

450
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,445
about reducing the operation time.

451
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,072
That's my only concern.

452
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,122
Thank you, Teacher Kim.

453
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,499
You should thank me

454
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,669
after the operation is over.

455
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,851
You have made a difficult decision.

456
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,646
I will count on you.

457
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:07,399
Of course, I'm sure you'll do a good job.

458
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,236
Is there

459
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:14,364
anything that Chairman Shin
has not shared with me?

460
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,535
Why do you ask?

461
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:19,577
Well,

462
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,748
it seems like he's hiding something.

463
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:27,836
I was wondering if that has
something to do with the operation.

464
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,338
Do you know anything, Manager Ju?

465
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,550
I'm sorry.

466
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,970
He has told me not to say anything to you.

467
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,266
So there is something.

468
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,560
You can hear it from him

469
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:45,145
after the operation.

470
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,913
We only have five days

471
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,332
to prepare.

472
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:08,877
Meanwhile, our task is to figure out

473
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,504
how we can shorten 1 hour and 30 minutes.

474
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,506
It's 1 hour and 25 minutes.

475
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,551
I already shortened
five minutes from my part.

476
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,181
-Dr. Yun.
-Yes, Teacher Kim.

477
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:23,016
Make sure you study his CT scan

478
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,977
and find out where you will
perform cannulation.

479
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,062
Wait, no.

480
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:30,648
Put the CT scan in your head
and memorize it.

481
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:31,775
Will do.

482
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,568
Ms. Oh and Mr. Park.

483
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,404
Could you check and see
if we can shorten more time

484
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,198
by making changes
to the surgery procedure?

485
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,657
-Yes.
-Yes, Teacher Kim.

486
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,451
-Dr. Kang.
-Yes?

487
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,913
Make sure you finish
your part within 25 minutes.

488
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,707
-Keep your time, okay?
-Yes, Teacher Kim.

489
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:48,792
Okay.

490
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,668
Dr. Nam.

491
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:59,260
Let's prepare this thoroughly
for the next five days.

492
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,554
-Yes.
-Yes, Teacher Kim.

493
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,228
Tell all cardiothoracic surgeons
to be here in 30 minutes.

494
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,980
-No exceptions. All of them!
-Yes, President Do.

495
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:23,410
The aorta is close to the sternum.
Do you see that?

496
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,120
The space is too small.

497
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,540
One false move,

498
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:31,543
and you could cut the heart or the aorta.

499
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,045
What should we do

500
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,381
in case we can't cannulate the aorta?

501
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,174
Go for the femoral artery.

502
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,259
That's right.

503
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,971
Once the operation begins,
make sure to disinfect the femoral region.

504
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,097
Yes, Doctor.

505
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:06,953
Dr. Shim.
Liaise with the live shooting team.

506
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,664
-Yes, President Do.
-It starts at 9 a.m.

507
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,917
So you should be there
at least an hour before.

508
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,419
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

509
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,629
DOCTOR'S OFFICE

510
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,618
Bring me the suture set.

511
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,036
Okay.

512
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,042
You are not busy, are you?

513
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:39,087
Pardon? Were you talking to me?

514
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,923
-Do you see anyone else?
-Okay.

515
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,175
If you are not busy,
come assist me with the suture.

516
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,260
Okay.

517
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,722
Short for subcutaneous
and long for skin, you know that, right?

518
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:50,974
Yes, I know.

519
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,103
Cut.

520
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,526
Were you really a resident in GS?
You are not doing it right.

521
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:04,237
I'm sorry. I was too nervous.

522
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:12,412
Cut.

523
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,456
Gosh. Make it shorter.

524
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:18,960
Okay?

525
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:22,171
-I'm sorry.
-I told you to be better, not sorry.

526
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,966
Wipe the blood, too.

527
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:26,509
Am I bleeding?

528
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,595
Please don't move.

529
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,096
Blood gathers

530
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,724
when the needle goes into the wound.

531
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,142
Okay.

532
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,271
Let me do that.

533
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,529
Please go check the other patients.
I can take care of this.

534
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,325
What are you doing?

535
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,161
He just asked you
to go check the other patients.

536
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,746
Yes, Doctor.

537
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:10,845
Cut.

538
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,059
EMERGENCY ROOM

539
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:18,853
Hey.

540
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,564
What?

541
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,777
Did something happen
between Teacher Kim and you?

542
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,406
You are not attending the meeting,

543
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,367
and Teacher Kim isn't looking
for you either.

544
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,244
Did something happen after we fought?

545
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,413
You even left the team.

546
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,123
Nothing happened.

547
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:42,293
I just told him
that I didn't want to join.

548
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:46,547
Gosh. You begged Teacher Kim
to let you be the first assistant.

549
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,342
Why did you change your mind?

550
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,510
When did I do that?

551
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,762
I didn't beg him
to let me be the first assistant.

552
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,263
Did Teacher Kim tell you that?

553
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,932
I just overheard it.

554
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,477
Why did you change your mind?

555
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:02,313
I told you. I just don't want to do it.

556
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,940
I don't want to bother.

557
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:07,694
I thought the operation was
about replacing batteries,

558
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,570
but it became too complicated.

559
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,240
And it's not like
I had an important position.

560
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,700
What if you can change the position?

561
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,452
Do you want to join the team again?

562
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,745
What do you mean?

563
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,915
I have to cut the surgical time
down from 30 minutes to 25.

564
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,333
If I do that with you,

565
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,627
I think we can save five more minutes.

566
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:28,548
I will replace the batteries
and you will replace the controller.

567
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:29,632
What do you think?

568
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,969
Are you asking me a favor?

569
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,221
-Why?
-Well,

570
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:38,307
I just want to cut down the surgical time.

571
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,308
Listen.

572
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,102
For a general surgeon,

573
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,187
it is a great chance
to expand your experiences.

574
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,024
Just having your name
on the operation chart will have

575
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,775
a huge influence on your career.

576
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,320
It will be even better
if it ends successfully.

577
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,197
What do you think?

578
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,616
Do you want to join me?

579
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,590
I will replace the batteries
and you will replace the controller.

580
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:13,509
I'm in.

581
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,219
Okay.

582
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,805
In-beom.

583
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:44,373
Are you sure you can do that
in 20 minutes?

584
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,666
I want you to have

585
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,835
In-beom join the team again.

586
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,129
If we work together,

587
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,548
we can finish it in 20 minutes.

588
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,884
It includes suture process, too.

589
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:55,927
Of course.

590
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,346
Okay. In-beom is in.

591
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,893
Yes!

592
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,491
I will have the same.

593
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,081
I heard an interesting rumor.

594
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,584
Is Dr. Bu Yong-ju coming back?

595
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,669
Yes.

596
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,462
I'm afraid so.

597
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,923
Do you think it's okay?

598
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,176
I tried to stop him,

599
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,888
but Chairman Shin was too firm about that.

600
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,474
Is he replacing
Chairman Shin's artificial heart?

601
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,311
If the operation proves to be a success,

602
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:51,774
you will be in trouble.

603
00:35:57,446 --> 00:36:00,241
How can such an immoral person
like him succeed?

604
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,493
That's just ridiculous.

605
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,579
It will just dispirit

606
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:08,207
innocent, hard-working people like us.

607
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:13,254
That's not how the world
is supposed to work.

608
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,300
Why don't you

609
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,261
take the opportunity

610
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,389
to realize justice?

611
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,528
Where are you going?

612
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,947
I'm just going home.

613
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,574
-What about you?
-I'm going home, too.

614
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,367
Why? Is there a problem?

615
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:47,288
You don't have to go home together though.

616
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,333
What's the matter?
We are going the same way.

617
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,667
Do you live nearby?

618
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:52,960
We live in the same house.

619
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:57,548
In the same house? Do you live together?

620
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,384
Yes. We live together
in the company house. Why?

621
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,595
You should have told me that.

622
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,138
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

623
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,474
I thought you already knew.

624
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,227
Most of the hospital employees
live in the company house.

625
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,772
Didn't you know that?

626
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,065
No, I didn't.

627
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:16,651
Where did you think I was staying?

628
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,611
I didn't even think about that.

629
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:22,490
And I didn't even imagine
that you two would sleep together.

630
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,035
Seo-jeong, wait for me.

631
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,203
I'm going home with you.

632
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,538
Why? You don't like the company house.

633
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,082
You like the staff room better.

634
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,125
I changed my mind.

635
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,543
Wait for me.

636
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,879
Don't move an inch.

637
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,258
Are you two going home?

638
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,051
Yes. Are you going home, too?

639
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,971
I'm a little nervous
about the operation tomorrow.

640
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,640
I'd better go home early
and get some rest.

641
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:48,891
Me, too.

642
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:53,980
What is that? Is it the prayer book?

643
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,231
There will be

644
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,650
Wednesday service tonight.

645
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,819
For the historic operation tomorrow,

646
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:02,321
I should say my prayers.

647
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,573
Gosh. Since when did you do that?

648
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:05,992
Since last Sunday.

649
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,619
I may not look like that,
but I'm a believer.

650
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,208
Dr. Yun.

651
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,919
Do you want to grab a bite to eat
at Dr. Nam's restaurant?

652
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,838
A glass of beer will be nice as well.

653
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,172
Beer?

654
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,633
I'm afraid I'll have to say no
since the operation is coming up.

655
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,760
Let's drink after everything is over.

656
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:28,347
Instead, why don't we go to
Dr. Nam's place for some ramen?

657
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,474
-Ramen?
-That's good, too.

658
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,477
I forgot to do something.

659
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,313
Go on without me.

660
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,565
-Let's go, Seo-jeong.
-Okay.

661
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,736
With the weather so cold,

662
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,780
some ramen will be so good.

663
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:48,326
And a glass of beer.

664
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,703
Where did she go?

665
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,330
Did she leave already?

666
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,584
Manager Jang. Have you seen Seo-jeong?

667
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,378
I know where she went.

668
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,214
PRAYER BOOK

669
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,301
Follow me.

670
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,388
What?

671
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,101
-For Teacher Kim!
-For Teacher Kim!

672
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:59,313
-For the artificial heart!
-For the artificial heart!

673
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,025
This is...

674
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,152
I feel really bad.

675
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,114
I happen to be the only one
who doesn't need to operate.

676
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,954
Instead of a blessing from the above,

677
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,372
you're celebrating with beer.

678
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:19,625
Gosh, don't talk like that.

679
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,627
I thought you didn't go to church.

680
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,131
Did you start going lately?

681
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,092
The last time you went to...

682
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,469
Oh, that's right.

683
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,388
There was that newly possessed shaman.

684
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,557
That lustful female shaman.

685
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,268
Gosh, stop intervening

686
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:38,519
in my religious life.

687
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,146
That's private.

688
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,814
Sure, whatever you say.

689
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:46,152
All right. Here is your order of
budaejjigae with extra noodles.

690
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,237
Ramen is coming soon as well.

691
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,239
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

692
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,699
Thank you.

693
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,621
By the way,

694
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:02,001
I've never heard
about Dr. Nam's medical litigation before.

695
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:06,422
Can I ask you about it?

696
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,097
Later.

697
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,433
You have a big surgery tomorrow.

698
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:19,727
Let's talk about that
some other time, Dr. Kang.

699
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,229
Okay. I understand.

700
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,148
By the way,

701
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:27,151
Dr. Kang and Dr. Yun

702
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,778
look beautiful together
every time I see you.

703
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,948
Aren't they like a cute hospital couple?

704
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:36,660
You know?

705
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,164
I'm asking just to be sure.

706
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:43,042
I know the possibility is like
the Earth colliding with

707
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,794
a planet in the Andromeda Galaxy,

708
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:49,048
but I'm only asking just to be sure.

709
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,508
Are you two

710
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:52,468
dating?

711
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,896
Is it true?

712
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,486
It's not like that.

713
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,404
We're not.

714
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:15,658
We're really not.

715
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,743
Why would you think that?

716
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:24,208
I've known him for a long time.
That's why we seem close.

717
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,002
Didn't I tell you?

718
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,713
When he came to work as an intern
at the ER five years ago,

719
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,173
he used to be my underling.

720
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,383
Isn't that right, Dong-ju?

721
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:38,889
It is true.

722
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,642
You were the arrogant,

723
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,769
-untouchable intern.
-I love you, Seo-jeong.

724
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,946
I love you, Ms. Oh.

725
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,906
Me?

726
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,367
I love you, Manager Jang.

727
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,497
Dr. Nam. I love you.

728
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,711
Gosh.

729
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:11,380
You know how it is.

730
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:14,800
We love each other
and care for each other.

731
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,635
What we have as Doldam Family

732
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,804
is thicker than water.

733
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,599
Isn't that right, Seo-jeong?

734
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,270
Dr. Nam. Ramen please!

735
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,022
Right. Okay.

736
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,523
Oh, I forgot kimchi.

737
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,650
I should drink some more beer.

738
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,111
I don't know why I feel so thirsty.

739
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,989
I love you.

740
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:41,910
-What do you think you're doing?
-It's thrilling, isn't it?

741
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,078
You can expect more of it.

742
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:45,331
There will be more.

743
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,958
Do you want to die from the cold
or from my beating?

744
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,086
It's too cold to die outside.

745
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:55,174
And it'll hurt to get beaten by you.

746
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,136
I love you.

747
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,388
Gosh, please.

748
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,307
They are dating for sure.

749
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,059
They really are.

750
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,478
-I'm pretty sure.
-I agree.

751
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,192
I love you.

752
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,583
What are you doing here?

753
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:33,837
I've been waiting for you.

754
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,674
-Why?
-I will be

755
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,343
joining the operation tomorrow.

756
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:43,180
So I've heard. And?

757
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,809
This time, it's not because of my father.

758
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:50,854
Based on pure intentions
to shorten the surgical time,

759
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,689
Dong-ju asked me to.

760
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,483
That's why I'm doing it.

761
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:57,403
I don't want you

762
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:58,904
to take things the wrong way.

763
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,281
You have 20 minutes.

764
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,786
If you fumble

765
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,038
or if you don't finish in 20 minutes,

766
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,374
I'll chop your hand off.

767
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,334
Consider yourself informed.

768
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:09,850
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

769
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:36,919
Manager Jang.

770
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,757
Hello, President Do.

771
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,884
Is everything ready and good to go?

772
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,887
Of course. We didn't schedule
any appointments today.

773
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:50,307
The walk-in patients
will be sent to the emergency room.

774
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:53,560
-What about Chairman Shin?
-He's still in his room.

775
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,646
Teacher Kim went to see him just now.

776
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,409
They are here.

777
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:37,479
Chairman Shin. How are you feeling today?

778
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:39,523
You know how it is.

779
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,275
I literally feel like

780
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,403
being on an operating table.

781
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,116
Don't be so nervous, Chairman Shin.

782
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,536
We will try our best.

783
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:53,912
Of course you should.

784
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,836
Hello, Chairman Shin.

785
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:02,921
Well.

786
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:06,008
What brings you here, President Do?

787
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:08,176
How could I not come

788
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,095
when you're about to
undergo a big operation?

789
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,430
I see.

790
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,682
How thoughtful of you to come.

791
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:15,892
I hope I can see you
in a healthy condition

792
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:17,436
after the operation.

793
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:21,481
Thanks. I hope so, too.

794
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:32,826
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

795
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,714
NO OUTPATIENT TREATMENT TODAY
THE EMERGENCY ROOM IS AVAILABLE

796
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,221
Let's take him to the operating room now.

797
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,265
Okay. I'll go with you Chairman Shin.

798
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:56,558
All right.

799
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,144
-Mr. Gu.
-Yes?

800
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,858
We'll take him to the OR.

801
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,488
I wish you luck.

802
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,201
I don't know about that.

803
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:16,662
I'm just not sure

804
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:19,331
which outcome you are wishing me luck for.

805
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:21,958
Which outcome would it be?

806
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:32,344
Today will be a long day for us.

807
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,889
Ms. Eom, you're in charge in my absence.
You know that, right?

808
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:37,641
Yes, Ms. Oh. Please don't worry.

809
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:41,561
Every surgeon in this hospital
will participate in this surgery,

810
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,063
but Dr. Kang and Dr. Do

811
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:46,525
will be out once they're done
removing the battery.

812
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:50,153
So in case of an emergency,
call the operating room.

813
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,571
Yes, I will.

814
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:54,950
Let's make it through today safely.

815
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:56,910
Dr. Jeong, please take care
of the emergency room.

816
00:49:56,993 --> 00:49:59,371
You have nothing to worry about
since I'm here.

817
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:02,666
I am the one who protects
the emergency room.

818
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,670
Chairman Shin is coming down.

819
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,964
-Ms. Oh, let's go.
-Okay.

820
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,132
See you later, guys.

821
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:12,718
I'm getting nervous.

822
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:14,678
I can do this.

823
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:16,388
-We can do this.
-We can do this.

824
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:18,056
We have an emergency patient.

825
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,727
He appears to have abdominal pain.

826
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,603
That's early.

827
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,106
Dr. Woo, what are you doing?

828
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:27,149
Yes, Dr. Jeong.

829
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,402
Aren't you checking the patient?

830
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:34,197
I always give young doctors a chance
to examine patients first.

831
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,825
What a nice way to make an excuse.

832
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:39,202
Who will ever understand
my true intention?

833
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:42,539
Hey, honey.

834
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,417
Sir, what's troubling you?

835
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,918
I have a heartburn.

836
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:50,088
-How long have you had it?
-I have had it once in a while

837
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,966
since a couple of months ago.
I had a drink last night

838
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:54,634
and my stomach started hurting
this morning.

839
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,762
Did you vomit or have diarrhea?

840
00:50:56,845 --> 00:51:00,098
I felt nauseous, but I didn't throw up.

841
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:02,100
I'll examine your abdomen first.

842
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,943
He has severe oppressive pain.

843
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,362
His abdomen is too hard, too.

844
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:17,657
Is it ulcer perforation?

845
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,201
ULCER PERFORATION: PERFORATED ULCER

846
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:23,079
Sir, we'll give you an analgesic
and take an X-ray.

847
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,666
Inject 1 ampule of pantoprazole
and 1 ampule of tramadol, please.

848
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,001
Yes, Dr. Woo.

849
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:30,545
Chairman Shin, we'll put you
under anesthesia now.

850
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,964
Think it as a good, long nap.

851
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,383
It will be after the surgery is over
by the time you wake up.

852
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,429
Everyone,

853
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,349
thank you in advance.

854
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,271
Please inject 120mg of propofol

855
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,981
and 40mg of rocuronium.

856
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,233
Yes, Dr. Nam.

857
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:11,878
Has it begun?

858
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,797
Yes, they just put him under anesthesia.

859
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:28,520
For those who haven't had breakfast yet,

860
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:31,731
we prepared refreshments
such as bread, coffee, and drinks.

861
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,859
Please raise your hand if you'd like some,

862
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:35,902
and I will serve you.

863
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:38,446
Who would like some coffee,
tea, bread, or drinks?

864
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:40,991
Thank you.

865
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:48,290
By the way, I heard that your son

866
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:50,834
will also participate in this surgery.

867
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:52,919
I'm sure he'll just observe it.

868
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:54,963
What would he be able to do?

869
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:58,091
Start from an incision to the cannulation.

870
00:52:58,174 --> 00:53:00,719
And set up the heart-lung machine, too.

871
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:03,054
Our target time for all these procedures
is two hours.

872
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:07,142
Be on standby and come in
once I call you, okay?

873
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,268
Yes, Teacher Kim.

874
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,873
-That really is Bu Yong-ju.
-That's him.

875
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:32,250
-I haven't seen him in ten years.
-Exactly.

876
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:35,170
I think he's been working here ever since.

877
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:36,379
He's starting the surgery.

878
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,434
You finally showed up.

879
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:50,894
Dr. Bu Yong-ju.

880
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:57,859
We'll conduct a time-out.

881
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,696
Shin Myeong-ho. 72-year-old male.

882
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,157
With a median sternotomy,

883
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:07,827
we will begin the artificial heart
replacement surgery.

884
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:12,040
I'm the lead surgeon, Teacher Kim.

885
00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:15,919
The first assistant is Dr. Yun Seo-jeong.

886
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:19,297
Scrub nurses are Ms. Oh Myeong-sim
and Mr. Park Eun-tak.

887
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,216
The anesthesiologist is Dr. Nam Do-il.

888
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:23,718
The perfusionist is Mr. Park Jong-cheol.

889
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:25,845
Everyone, are you ready?

890
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:29,015
Let's make it work.

891
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:31,601
Scalpel.

892
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:33,770
Gauze.

893
00:54:58,795 --> 00:54:59,879
Wire holder.

894
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,220
Why is it tied so tightly?

895
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,769
Needle holder.

896
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:19,899
Saw, please.

897
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:32,078
-Needle holder again.
-Needle holder.

898
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:39,586
-Let's open it now.
-Retractor.

899
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:59,439
The adhesion is more severe
than I expected.

900
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,080
Clamp.

901
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:16,873
Hold this.

902
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,929
It'll be difficult to tell them apart
because of the adhesion,

903
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:32,388
but this is the aorta.

904
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:37,018
-It seems weak, so pull it gently.
-Yes, sir.

905
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,167
Teacher Kim, his SBP dropped to 60s.

906
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,169
His cerebral oximetry
is dropping below 40.

907
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,879
I'll increase it and start
transfusing blood.

908
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:07,048
-Okay.
-I'm sorry.

909
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:08,758
I'm very sorry, Teacher Kim.

910
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,718
It's okay. Stay calm.

911
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,178
I'm sorry.

912
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:14,597
Dr. Yun.

913
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,518
Dr. Yun, look at me!

914
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:22,480
It's okay.

915
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:26,401
We still have enough time. Don't panic.

916
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,071
In order to finish in six hours...

917
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,907
That means we can't afford
to touch a single artery

918
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:35,660
while excoriating the tissue through
sternotomy and cannulation.

919
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:38,746
Even then, we'd barely
be able to finish in time.

920
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:42,834
Dr. Yun, stay focused.

921
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:46,296
Focus.

922
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:48,423
Yes.

923
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:51,468
Prolene number four.

924
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:12,322
He still has amazing techniques.

925
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:17,785
Did I see wrong?

926
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:19,829
My eyes are getting old.

927
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,418
-Cut.
-Cutting.

928
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,254
How many minutes did we lose?

929
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:30,840
At least 10 to 12 minutes.

930
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:36,429
Dr. Kang, we have an emergency.

931
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,931
You need to come take a look at this.

932
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:41,601
I think it's ulcer perforation.

933
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:43,728
-Ulcer perforation?
-Hey.

934
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:46,523
If that's the case, shouldn't we undergo
an operation right away?

935
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,193
Suction, please.

936
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,696
Six hours.

937
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:59,077
I have to finish
the operation in six hours.

938
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:02,330
How much time do we have until we go in?

939
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,124
About an hour to an hour and 20 minutes.

940
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:08,002
Can we finish an operation

941
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:09,712
for ulcer perforation in an hour?

942
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:47,292
No matter what happens,

943
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:50,336
I have to finish in six hours.

944
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:01,514
