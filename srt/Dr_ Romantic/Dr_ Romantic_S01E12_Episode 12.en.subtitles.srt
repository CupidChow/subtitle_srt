00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,773
MEDICAL CERTIFICATE OF DEATH

2
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,819
PARK JU-HYEOK, DOB: OCTOBER 31, 1995

3
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:30,697
DEATH FROM DISEASE

4
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:33,491
DR. KANG DONG-JU

5
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,952
What...

6
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,622
-is this?
-Just sign the paper.

7
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:42,041
And submit it.

8
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:45,962
This patient is still alive.

9
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,213
He's alive.

10
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,092
-I don't understand.
-His vital signs are dropping,

11
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,260
and there's no urine.

12
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:54,971
He's in arrest with no stem sign.

13
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,598
It means he is about to have brain death.

14
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,851
Patients may have no stem sign
right after the ROSC.

15
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:03,063
We have to wait at least for one
to two days before making any decision.

16
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,275
And death from disease?

17
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:10,195
This is his medical record
from the military hospital.

18
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,572
It says he has been treated

19
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,741
for diverticulum for some time.

20
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,284
I thought you should know.

21
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:19,412
It was not about diverticulum.
It was definitely trauma hemoperitoneum.

22
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,623
I cut his abdomen open
and saw it with my eyes.

23
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:22,791
He is a run-away soldier.

24
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,753
A violent death for a man like him?

25
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:29,047
Don't you think

26
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,590
it can be a sensitive issue?

27
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,592
What if

28
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,011
the fact becomes public?

29
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,679
Much noise will be

30
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,641
raised all about it
on the internet and everything.

31
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,310
And they will end up

32
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,938
firing some middle managers for no reason.

33
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,024
It'd be so irresponsible of us to do that,
don't you think?

34
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,112
So...

35
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,949
you want me

36
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,077
to lie about the patient?

37
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,291
I want you to make a rational decision.

38
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,584
So

39
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,756
are you telling me to lie

40
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:16,094
about a patient who is clearly still alive

41
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,264
by signing the death certificate?

42
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,517
There are times

43
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,271
when silence can be better than the truth.

44
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,190
And I think this is the time.

45
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,114
I'm sorry,

46
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,033
but I'll pretend I wasn't here.

47
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,245
Kang Dong-ju.

48
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,552
Don't be childish

49
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,679
by demonstrating your bravado.

50
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,808
You are a grown-up.

51
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,727
As a doctor,

52
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,604
and as a member of the society,

53
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:12,150
I want you to act more responsibly, okay?

54
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,111
Let's stay quiet

55
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,947
and make it simple, Dong-ju.

56
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,048
What is going on?

57
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,884
What are you doing here?

58
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,810
What are you all doing together?

59
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,981
What are you conspiring about?

60
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,117
President Do.

61
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,146
Yeong-gyun.

62
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,067
What happened to my boy?

63
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,319
Where is Ju-hyeok?

64
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,341
My boy.

65
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,929
Ju-hyeok.

66
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,973
Ju-hyeok.

67
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:13,938
Ju-hyeok.

68
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:18,818
Gosh.

69
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:21,988
Ju-hyeok.

70
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,408
My goodness.

71
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,537
Gosh.

72
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,167
He is in arrest, Dr. Yun.

73
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,295
Page Dr. Kang, Ms. Oh.

74
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,715
Can you give us some space, please?

75
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,676
-Please, ma'am.
-Ma'am.

76
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,802
Excuse me.

77
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,554
Ju-hyeok.

78
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,228
Ju-hyeok.

79
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,606
Doctor.

80
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,024
EMERGENCY ROOM

81
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,030
Yes, I'm on my way.

82
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,248
-What is it?
-He is in second arrest.

83
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,125
Bring the defibrillator now.

84
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,512
MEDICAL CERTIFICATE OF DEATH

85
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:31,849
200J.

86
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,395
Move.

87
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,564
Clear.

88
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,484
Commencing compression.

89
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,735
Let me do it.

90
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,453
Checking his pulse.

91
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,084
Let's try again. Charge 200J.

92
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,294
Ready, Dr. Kang.

93
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,506
Clear.

94
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,933
Come back.

95
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,477
You're still young.

96
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,646
You have to come back.

97
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,155
DEATH FROM DISEASE

98
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,410
Come back.

99
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,001
Dr. Kang.

100
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,192
Time of death.

101
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,154
8:48 p.m.

102
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,591
DR. KANG DONG-JU

103
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,531
-Is this the one?
-It's the one behind it.

104
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,782
Okay.

105
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,331
Excuse me.

106
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,584
How do I get to Doldam Hospital from here?

107
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,837
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

108
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,973
Our deepest condolences

109
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,308
for the outcome of the circumstances.

110
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,186
The funeral procedure

111
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,772
will be arranged by the military forces.

112
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,440
Thank you.

113
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,860
I'm sorry that he ran away from his base.

114
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,489
I appreciate you doing this.

115
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,535
Let us know if you need any help.

116
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:39,996
Goodbye.

117
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,835
Ju-hyeok was murdered.

118
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,676
What?

119
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,848
What are you talking about, Yeong-gyun?

120
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,558
Three of his senior corps

121
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,768
beat him and punished him
every day for no reason.

122
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,396
That's why he didn't go back to his base.

123
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,398
That's why he died.

124
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:08,524
Shut it.

125
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,077
You can't say those things
without any proof.

126
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,956
The parents of Private Park Ju-hyeok

127
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,917
must be very confused right now.

128
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,295
Even the doctor who operated
on him said that.

129
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,632
He said Ju-hyeok's injuries
were result of an assault.

130
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,509
I heard him saying that to you.

131
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,682
I heard him say it, Mr. Park.

132
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,102
Go ask the doctor.

133
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,438
He'll tell you what really happened.

134
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,024
The doctor.

135
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,235
Where can I find him?

136
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,947
I'll take you to him.

137
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,993
Would you come with me?

138
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,453
MEDICAL CERTIFICATE OF DEATH

139
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,914
You've got to do it.

140
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,541
Do you think

141
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,252
that I like doing this for President Do?

142
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,339
I just don't want to get
on the wrong side of him.

143
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,341
I'm not intending
on living my life as a minority.

144
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,344
I want to be part of mainstream.

145
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,972
You're too young to realize
how important this is.

146
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,974
Once you get to my age, you'll see.

147
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:29,021
The way you see in life changes
once you get in your 40s.

148
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,023
The world becomes
a completely different place

149
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,401
depending on whether you join
the mainstream or not.

150
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:40,741
President Do is the only person
you have to kneel down to.

151
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,285
If you do that,

152
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,122
your whole life will be changed.

153
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,165
Do you understand?

154
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,006
Dr. Kang.

155
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:01,303
Park Ju-hyeok's parents
want to ask you something.

156
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,222
Are you free right now?

157
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,476
Please come in.

158
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,569
Hello.

159
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,197
I'm Ju-hyeok's father.

160
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,700
Did you say

161
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,746
that Ju-hyeok was beaten?

162
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,416
Is it true?

163
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,844
Please, Doctor.

164
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:49,518
He was healthy and well
just until two months ago.

165
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,147
How did he end up like that?

166
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,984
We have to know.

167
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,073
Please tell us

168
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,368
what you know.

169
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,121
Please, Doctor.

170
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,877
Doctor.

171
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,341
What are you doing, Dr. Kang?

172
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,885
Answer them.

173
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,018
I...

174
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,980
need to look over the records.

175
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,443
I have to check

176
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:43,447
his medical records
from the military hospital.

177
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,243
It may take a little while

178
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,704
until I can write
a medical certificate of death.

179
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,543
Goodbye, then.

180
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,333
Where are you going?

181
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,378
I just need some air.

182
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,463
Why did you do that?

183
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:45,259
-What?
-You knew about his bruises

184
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,679
and you saw the enterobrosia
during the surgery.

185
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:51,098
Why didn't you tell them anything?

186
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,435
Are you listening?

187
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,186
Hello?

188
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:01,025
Are you listening to me, Dr. Kang?

189
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,444
I'm just tired.

190
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,446
I'll talk to you later.

191
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,748
What's with him?

192
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,416
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

193
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,186
Welcome.

194
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,230
Dong-ju.

195
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,033
I'm sorry if I am interrupting something.

196
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,161
You're not interrupting anything.

197
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,538
Come in.

198
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,333
Are you here to grab a drink

199
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,542
or to have dinner?

200
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,835
I need a bottle of soju.

201
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,545
Sure.

202
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,973
MEDICAL CERTIFICATE OF DEATH

203
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,603
MOM

204
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:24,942
Taxi.

205
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:41,917
Here.

206
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,544
It's on me.

207
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:45,838
Drink.

208
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,059
Drink.

209
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,229
If you can't drink it,

210
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,064
you don't have to.

211
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,525
No.

212
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,318
I can.

213
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,326
Do you want another round?

214
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,162
Sure.

215
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,089
Are they chugging drinks?

216
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,507
Teacher Kim and Dr. Kang?

217
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:31,925
Chugging drinks?

218
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,677
He says so.

219
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,637
How much did they drink?

220
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,098
They are on their eighth bottle of soju.

221
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,475
Eight bottles?

222
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,404
When did you find out?

223
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,574
-What?
-About me.

224
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:01,455
That I am the boy
who turned the ER upside down.

225
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,209
Since when did you know?

226
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,710
Let me ask you a question, too.

227
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,671
Why did you become a doctor?

228
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,926
Do you remember what you said?

229
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,179
"If you want revenge,

230
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,098
pay them back with your capability."

231
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,184
That's why.

232
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,771
I wanted to show everyone
that I am not a pushover.

233
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,234
I no longer wanted

234
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,279
anyone to look down on me.

235
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,076
I wanted to show them

236
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,621
that I am different from them.

237
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,248
But...

238
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,252
look at the choices you make.

239
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,046
You are no different from them.

240
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,048
Because I can't end up here.

241
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,759
I have to go up the ladder.

242
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,803
That way, I can

243
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,472
at least stand up against
President Do or someone else.

244
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,058
Is that why

245
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,728
you were keen to take
15-percent increase in salary

246
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,606
with 100 million won
of research fund annually?

247
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,275
If you accept that,

248
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,528
does that make you go up that ladder?

249
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,072
You serve President Do

250
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,908
and promise him your loyalty.

251
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,828
Then you'll become the chief surgeon.

252
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:26,123
Your name will be
all over the academic journals.

253
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,584
Is that

254
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,795
the success you've been running after?

255
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,547
That's how the world is.

256
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,887
This world calls that a success.

257
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,848
If I don't make it

258
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,976
into the mainstream, I become a nobody.

259
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,188
Is that why you want to abandon your pride

260
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,190
and your conscience?

261
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,817
No shame

262
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,277
and no pride?

263
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,404
If you live as a nobody,

264
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,325
does that keep your pride?

265
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,662
If you have no power,

266
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,917
how can you keep your conscience?

267
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,302
Do you know how much it hurts
to be humiliated

268
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,514
because you have no power and no money?

269
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,267
Do you know?

270
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,103
That's right.

271
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:34,274
Greed is often

272
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,735
self-justified.

273
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,279
They say it couldn't be helped.

274
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,324
That it was the only choice
they could make.

275
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,496
Hey, Dong-ju.

276
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,249
It looks like

277
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,086
you are sick with greed,

278
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,004
not your conscience.

279
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:02,177
Can you read my mind now?

280
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,097
-Is that it?
-I do know a little bit about

281
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,225
the dilemma your kinds face

282
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,644
between reality and ideals.

283
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,274
But

284
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,194
a surgeon who has
someone's life in their hands

285
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,864
should also live with the responsibility

286
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,242
as heavy as a person's life.

287
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,204
Do remember that.

288
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,926
This is the video footage
of Private Park's operation.

289
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,053
You can do whatever you'd like.

290
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,432
You can keep it, throw it away,

291
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,100
or do whatever else you wish.

292
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,520
But it's on you.

293
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,739
Do-il, keep the bill on my tab.

294
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,823
Okay.

295
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,976
-Excuse me.
-I'm sorry, we're closed.

296
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,312
I'm not here to get treated.

297
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,022
Are you here to pay your bills?

298
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,857
Then please proceed
to counter number three.

299
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,609
I'm looking for Dong-ju.

300
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,324
Dr. Yun, where are you going?

301
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,910
It's about that jerk, Dong-ju.

302
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:52,788
He's at On Your Way and completely drunk.

303
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,165
Gosh. He's so annoying.

304
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,626
I knew he had no self-control.

305
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,586
Excuse me, Dr. Yun.

306
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:02,964
Or he could have gone home
and had a couple of drinks.

307
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,966
-Dr. Yun.
-I'm too old for this.

308
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,927
Do I have to go out
at this hour, in this weather

309
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,386
to go get my drunk younger colleague

310
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,056
instead of working?

311
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,474
Isn't that right, In-beom?

312
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,101
Isn't that right, Manager Jang?

313
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,270
What's wrong?

314
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:20,273
This is Dr. Kang's mother.

315
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:30,492
Hello. I'm glad to meet you.

316
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,915
She is Dr. Yun Seo-jeong
of Emergency Medicine.

317
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,250
I see.

318
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,127
It's nice to meet you.

319
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,224
I guess Dong-ju lives here, right?

320
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:57,060
Yes. We have a company housing nearby,

321
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,270
but Dong-ju...

322
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,439
Dr. Kang feels

323
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,776
more comfortable in this staff room.

324
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,822
As you know, Dong-ju is... Gosh.

325
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:10,699
Dr. Kang

326
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:15,829
gets very stubborn once he decides to be.

327
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,122
Tell me about it.

328
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,999
He is just like his father.

329
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,461
But at the same time, I think

330
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,339
he could study so hard
because of his stubborn streak.

331
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,216
You are right. I think so.

332
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,138
Would you like to have something to drink?

333
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:44,316
You don't need to feel so nervous
and uncomfortable around me.

334
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,444
Okay.

335
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:52,532
Let's just have one more round.

336
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,411
Let's go to a karaoke room. It's on me.

337
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,455
What's wrong with him?

338
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,581
-Dong-ju.
-It's on me.

339
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,459
Why did you drink so much?

340
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:05,003
Dr. Kang Dong-ju!

341
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,171
What?

342
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,381
It's Seo-jeong.

343
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:14,095
Come on, my precious Seo-jeong.

344
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,684
What are you doing? Get off me.

345
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:20,727
Get off.

346
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:25,065
Stop it. Why are you doing this to me?

347
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,151
Your mother is here. Get off me.

348
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,248
Hey.

349
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,917
Do you know

350
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,712
how much I like you?

351
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,136
Hey. Pull yourself together.

352
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,347
I told you to let go of me.

353
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,684
Didn't you hear me?

354
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,435
I said

355
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:06,606
I like you a lot.

356
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,192
Gosh.

357
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,872
Get off of me!

358
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:24,833
Dong-ju.

359
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,630
Dong-ju, are you okay?

360
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,716
I'm sorry, ma'am.

361
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,261
Hey, Dong-ju. Are you all right?

362
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:37,637
Hey, Dong-ju.

363
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,939
It's hot.

364
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,249
Well, where is Dr. Kang?

365
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,461
What's wrong, Dr. Yun?

366
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,212
Did something happen?

367
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:16,760
I just want to sink deep under my feet.

368
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:34,694
Dong-ju.

369
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:39,574
Dong-ju?

370
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:44,037
The doctor named Seo-jeong.

371
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,456
Do you like her?

372
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,376
I do.

373
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,295
I do like her.

374
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,049
I like her.

375
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:15,110
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

376
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,461
KANG DONG-JU IS NOT A DOCTOR
HE IS A MURDERER

377
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,425
Kang...

378
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,301
Who did this?

379
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,680
Oh, my goodness.

380
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:47,684
Who did this stupid thing? Gosh.

381
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,785
KANG DONG-JU IS NOT A DOCTOR
HE IS A MURDERER

382
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,121
KANG DONG-JU IS NOT A DOCTOR
HE IS A MURDERER

383
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,209
KANG DONG-JU IS NOT A DOCTOR
HE IS A MURDERER

384
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:17,797
I searched through the whole building

385
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,758
and collected all the flyers in sight.

386
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,801
Oh, gosh.

387
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,472
There you are.

388
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:28,933
Wait.

389
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:32,020
Who in the world is doing this?

390
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,981
I'm wondering the same thing.
The staffs are working on it.

391
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:38,067
Is Dr. Kang here yet?

392
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:44,240
What should we do? His mother
came here to see him yesterday.

393
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,048
KANG DONG-JU IS NOT A DOCTOR
HE IS A MURDERER

394
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,267
Mom?

395
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,561
Dong-ju.

396
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:15,730
You are up.

397
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,565
What are you doing here?

398
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,818
I came here to see you.

399
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,570
-When?
-Last night.

400
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,617
Why did you drink so much?
Don't drink too much.

401
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,912
Do you want some water?

402
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,874
Do you have some honey here?

403
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,252
-I guess you don't.
-No.

404
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,628
Okay.

405
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,172
I will send you some honey

406
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:44,509
as soon as I go back to Seoul.

407
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,302
Drink it.

408
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,305
Drink.

409
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:50,890
Wait.

410
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,309
Is there anything you can have?

411
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,436
Let me see.

412
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,024
Gosh.

413
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,006
KANG DONG-JU IS NOT A DOCTOR
HE IS A MURDERER

414
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,178
Who are you?

415
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,180
What are you doing there?

416
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,017
What do you think you are doing?

417
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,394
KANG DONG-JU IS NOT A DOCTOR
HE IS A MURDERER

418
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,856
What on earth are you doing?

419
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,025
I'm demonstrating against him.

420
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,027
Stop it, or I will call the police.

421
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,111
Call the police.

422
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:47,238
You should protect him.
You are a doctor like him.

423
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:48,990
Just do it.

424
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:53,286
-What?
-I will do this again and again

425
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:55,330
even if I get arrested.

426
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,373
I will keep giving out the flyers
no matter what

427
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,709
until he gets kicked out
from the hospital.

428
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,836
Just bring it on.

429
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,144
Who are you?

430
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,189
Why are you

431
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,359
posting up the flyers here?

432
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,402
Did you forget it already?

433
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:30,031
You killed my father.

434
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:37,080
You postponed my father's operation
for some former senator

435
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,082
called Go Man-seok or something.

436
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,542
Don't you remember?

437
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,093
What do you mean
the operation has been postponed?

438
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:53,221
Is there something wrong with my dad?

439
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,806
We'll wait for a few more days

440
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:57,809
and decide on the date
of the operation again.

441
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:58,935
Doctor.

442
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,857
Are you...

443
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,068
Mr. Seo Myeong-hun's daughter?

444
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,445
You remember the name at least.

445
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,657
Did he pass away?

446
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,368
Yes. He died.

447
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,496
After you postponed his operation,

448
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,792
they kept changing his doctor and
the operation kept being postponed.

449
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,462
After that, he passed away
from acute sepsis.

450
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,094
Why did you postpone the operation?

451
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,638
His operation was scheduled first.

452
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,060
Is it because the other man was a VIP

453
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,313
and my dad was a nobody?

454
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,192
How can you...

455
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:51,279
You can't be discriminating
with people's lives at stake.

456
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,906
Do you call yourself a doctor?

457
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,451
You're not supposed to be like that!

458
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,828
How can you play with people's lives?

459
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:01,706
Doctors aren't supposed to be like that.

460
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,916
My dad was there first.

461
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:07,086
My dad was there first.

462
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,838
My dad was here first.

463
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,173
My dad was

464
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,133
here before that person!

465
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,218
You have to treat my dad first!

466
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,395
I will never forgive you.

467
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:27,440
I will never forgive doctors like you!

468
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:32,403
I will bring shame to your name.

469
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,864
I swear I will stick my neck out

470
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,241
to disqualify you.

471
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,805
KANG DONG-JU IS NOT A DOCTOR
HE IS A MURDERER

472
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,613
Hey, Dong-ju.

473
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:17,573
Don't let it get you down.

474
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:20,409
I'll contact the police
and sort this mess out.

475
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,702
You don't need to worry at all.

476
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,539
No. Don't help him with that.

477
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:28,292
Let's just see how things pan out.

478
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,627
But Teacher Kim.

479
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,838
If we don't do anything,

480
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:35,133
Dr. Kang's reputation will be tarnished
and so will the hospital's.

481
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,343
There's nothing to worry about.

482
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:41,472
People forget after some time.

483
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,558
For now,

484
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,893
you just have to go through with it.

485
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,938
The hospital will clear your name later.

486
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,482
He has to go through with it.

487
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:55,570
If someone solves this problem for him,

488
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,656
he'll never learn from it.

489
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,449
But his mother is here to see him.

490
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,909
Don't worry about your mother.

491
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,037
I'll make sure that
she doesn't get the wrong idea.

492
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:08,666
Being a doctor is harder
than people can ever imagine.

493
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,210
Your mother has to know that.

494
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,674
Did you hand in
the medical certificate of death?

495
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:19,969
You just

496
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,638
get that done and over with.

497
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:25,808
I'll take care of the rest.

498
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,685
Got it?

499
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,521
This man killed my father.

500
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,356
His name is Kang Dong-ju,
and he's a doctor here.

501
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,734
This man killed my father.

502
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,527
His name is Kang Dong-ju,
and he's a doctor here.

503
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,364
This man killed my father.

504
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,158
His name is Kang Dong-ju,
and he's a doctor here.

505
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,077
MEDICAL CERTIFICATE OF DEATH

506
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,999
DEATH FROM DISEASE

507
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,381
DEATH FROM VIOLENCE

508
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,761
Kang Dong-ju.

509
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,263
Did you not hand in
that medical certificate of death?

510
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:08,726
Private Park's parents
were up all night waiting.

511
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,113
Hey, Dr. Kang.

512
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,615
I have to think things through.

513
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:23,866
About what?

514
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,620
It's a medical certificate of death.
There's no need to think.

515
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,372
You just need to put down the facts.

516
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,375
It's not that the truth is always right.

517
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:36,295
Where is this coming from?

518
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,049
He's a deserter.

519
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,218
Can you imagine how messy it'll get

520
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,845
if we declare him death from violence?

521
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,808
I can't stop thinking about

522
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,560
the consequences that will bring.

523
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:54,355
And why in the world
do you have to think about that?

524
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:57,733
You're just the doctor
who operated on the patient.

525
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,695
The doctor's job is to convey the facts.

526
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,201
Is it included

527
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,997
under that incredible offer

528
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,959
with 15-percent increase in salary

529
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,752
and 100 million won's worth
of research funding?

530
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,093
I told you this might happen.

531
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,221
I told you that you might
end up betraying your conscience.

532
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,181
It's not like that.
Don't jump to conclusions.

533
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,266
Are you sure?

534
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,562
Can you just

535
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,398
leave me alone for a moment?

536
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,490
Disregarding the truth
isn't right on its own,

537
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:50,161
but when it comes to death certificates,

538
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,999
you shouldn't disregard the truth
because of the external pressure.

539
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,208
You know that, right?

540
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,920
In any case

541
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,549
you are tempted by those things,

542
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,137
I'll be

543
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,474
immensely disappointed in you.

544
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,983
Dr. Kang. The police have arrived.

545
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,485
This man killed my father.

546
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:24,528
This is illegal what you're doing here!

547
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,239
-Let go!
-This is a privately owned property.

548
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:30,451
If you're going to protest,
you need permission by the police first.

549
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,577
This man killed my father.

550
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,454
His name is Dr. Kang Dong-ju.

551
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,122
-Please take a look!
-That's enough, Miss.

552
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,332
This man killed my father.

553
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,958
-Dr. Kang Dong-ju.
-Stop it!

554
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,877
I'm not going anywhere. Let go!

555
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,324
I apologize.

556
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,201
What are you doing?

557
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,662
Why are you apologizing?

558
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,252
This man, Kang Dong-ju,

559
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,756
is my son.

560
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,558
My son has committed a grave sin.

561
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,310
This is all my fault.

562
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,438
It's all my fault.

563
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,065
I apologize.

564
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,025
Please forgive him.

565
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,527
I apologize.

566
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:52,783
I'm really sorry.

567
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,328
-Mom.
-Save it.

568
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,788
You've done wrong.

569
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:58,998
Apologize to her.

570
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,256
Don't you remember how your father died?

571
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:10,050
How could you do this?

572
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,136
You shouldn't have.

573
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,477
Apologize to her
until she can forgive you.

574
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:22,563
Do it!

575
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:33,866
KANG DONG-JU IS NOT A DOCTOR
HE IS A MURDERER

576
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,079
Please

577
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,917
-leave her alone.
-What?

578
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:46,378
But we received a report.
We have to deal with this.

579
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,546
It's all right.

580
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,133
Let her be

581
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:53,719
and leave her alone.

582
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,740
No words

583
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,451
can justify my actions.

584
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,412
I wish I could go back in time

585
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:23,707
and make things

586
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,127
right again.

587
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,923
I'm filled with regrets

588
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:34,552
and shame.

589
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,431
You are a horrible man.

590
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:46,855
My deepest

591
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:49,984
apologies.

592
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,073
You horrible man!

593
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,246
Bring my dad back!

594
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,290
You horrible man!

595
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,834
Bring my dad back!

596
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:12,131
Bring him back.

597
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,597
Dad.

598
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,023
Dad.

599
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:36,488
Dad.

600
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,326
Dad.

601
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,496
Dad.

602
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:51,795
Dad.

603
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,383
Dad.

604
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:06,977
Dad.

605
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,155
Isn't that Dr. Bu Yong-ju?

606
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,407
Is he Dr. Bu Yong-ju?

607
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,660
That's him. He's Dr. Bu Yong-ju.

608
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,078
What is he doing here?

609
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,124
President Do, it's me.

610
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,377
What did you say?

611
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,878
Who showed up in this hospital?

612
00:44:57,194 --> 00:45:00,447
You can't do this.
I said, you can't do this.

613
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,326
I'll call you back.

614
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:08,747
What a surprise.

615
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:13,794
What brings you all the way here?

616
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,004
I have something to tell you.

617
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,341
You could have just called me.
Why did you--

618
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:24,638
How dare you!

619
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:33,188
Never come to Doldam Hospital again.

620
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,482
Also, stop taking advantage of
young people

621
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,152
to satisfy your selfish interests
and desires.

622
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:41,113
Let Dong-ju and Seo-jeong go.

623
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:43,323
Stop confusing them!

624
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,411
From now on,

625
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:51,832
I won't let you do that to them.
Is that clear?

626
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,213
MEDICAL CERTIFICATE OF DEATH

627
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,177
Do you not even feel ashamed?

628
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,264
How could you

629
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:09,516
try to make young people
do such a thing at your age?

630
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,062
You pathetic jerk.

631
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:21,945
MEDICAL CERTIFICATE OF DEATH

632
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:37,419
This is your son's

633
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:40,464
medical certificate of death.

634
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:51,850
DEATH FROM EXTERNAL CAUSES

635
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,413
And this is

636
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:16,667
the video of your son's surgery

637
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,043
performed by me.

638
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,338
This will be enough evidence.

639
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,048
If...

640
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,927
you need me to testify

641
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,221
in order to prove the truth,

642
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,057
please contact me any time.

643
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,234
My wife says

644
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,530
that she's grateful.

645
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,213
I am sorry

646
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,509
that it took so long, ma'am.

647
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,389
Please don't say that.

648
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:17,978
You let us know what truly caused
our son's death.

649
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:20,647
We can't ask for more.

650
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:22,983
Thank you.

651
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:25,819
Thank you.

652
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:52,554
What's this?

653
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:55,098
DEATH FROM EXTERNAL CAUSES

654
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,976
Dong-ju must be out of his mind.

655
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:02,898
Dong-ju, stop there!

656
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,234
Are you completely out of your mind?

657
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,196
What are you trying to do?

658
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:11,323
I just did what I learned.

659
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,493
A medical certificate of death is

660
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:18,080
the last thing that a doctor can do

661
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,499
for the patient and the family.

662
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:22,501
Why don't you get it?

663
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:27,798
President Do ordered not to leave
anything that can cause controversy.

664
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:31,468
Don't you know what will happen
if you go against him?

665
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:32,719
I do know.

666
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,055
Also,

667
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:38,850
I know how shameful it is
to follow that order.

668
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:41,895
Is it that hard to ignore
the feeling of shame just once?

669
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:44,523
I just

670
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:47,609
didn't want to get caught.

671
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:49,569
What?

672
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:51,738
Also,

673
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,324
I came to think

674
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:59,246
that this might be a place
where I can pretend to be a nice person.

675
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,957
The thought came across my mind.

676
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:07,587
I think Doldam Hospital is
that kind of place.

677
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:10,549
Are you saying

678
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:14,511
that you wouldn't mind if you can't return
to Geosan Medical Center

679
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,012
forever?

680
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,266
Are you sure you won't regret it?

681
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:23,395
Maybe.

682
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:46,710
I'm sorry that you had to
see me like that.

683
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,171
Did you expect

684
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:52,090
it would be easy to save people's lives?

685
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:56,011
Unexpected things happen when you work.

686
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,515
I don't think

687
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:03,894
I can return to the main hospital
for a while.

688
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:05,020
That's okay.

689
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:08,398
The hospital you're working at now
doesn't seem so bad.

690
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:13,862
I also like the lady
who is your older colleague.

691
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,323
My older colleague?

692
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:18,325
You know.

693
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:21,578
The lady you call Seo-jeong.

694
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:23,705
The doctor in the emergency room.

695
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:27,209
How do you know Seo-jeong?

696
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:31,296
Do you really not remember anything?

697
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:35,383
Did you completely black out?

698
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:37,219
What happened?

699
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:42,516
If you want to know, go ask her.

700
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,434
Even though you're my son,

701
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:47,729
it's embarrassing to say it myself.

702
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:52,234
Why are you laughing? Why?

703
00:51:58,156 --> 00:51:59,866
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

704
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:29,479
Did you see your mother off?

705
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:31,481
Of course.

706
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:35,193
Did you give the death certificate
to the parents?

707
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,612
Yes, I surely gave it to them.

708
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:46,329
About last night...

709
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:49,833
You shouldn't talk about what you did
while you were drunk.

710
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:54,129
That's the manner you should keep
if you know how to enjoy drinking.

711
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:04,055
Anyway, you lost the 15-percent
increase of salary,

712
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:07,976
and the annual research fund
of 100 million won.

713
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:11,605
Since you got on the wrong side
of President Do,

714
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:15,609
you won't be able to return to
the main hospital for a while.

715
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,111
Poor you.

716
00:53:18,194 --> 00:53:22,032
You will have to stay
at this awful hospital a little longer.

717
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:24,701
I guess so.

718
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,038
I lost the chance to get a good raise

719
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:31,082
and a chance to return to
the main hospital.

720
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:36,171
I have to spend a long winter
in this awful hospital.

721
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:39,007
It's already so frustrating.

722
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:43,929
That's why I'll ask you this.

723
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:46,306
Go out with me, Seo-jeong.

724
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:52,228
Are you serious?

725
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:58,860
Is that a no?

726
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,073
Can I not

727
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,368
date you?

728
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,371
No.

729
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:10,956
You can't.

730
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:18,421
What's the reason?

731
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,467
I want to know why you're avoiding me.

732
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,970
Can't you tell me?

733
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,223
No, I can't.

734
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,561
You like me, too.

735
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:35,855
Don't you?

736
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,527
Don't you?

737
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,782
Did you say you'll ask me out three times?

738
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:48,868
One more to go.

739
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,410
What are you doing here?

740
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:33,079
What?

741
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:34,873
Well, I was

742
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,125
on my way to the emergency room.

743
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,100
Hello, Father.

744
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,311
You have to do something for me.

745
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:00,523
What did you say?

746
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:03,026
Do you have a date for me
to get hospitalized?

747
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:04,402
Yes.

748
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,404
We finally have the date.

749
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,281
You can come in

750
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:11,743
tomorrow afternoon whenever you want to.

751
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:12,869
Then

752
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,663
are we doing the operation right away?

753
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,874
I'll check your condition

754
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:20,001
for two to three days

755
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:21,336
after you're hospitalized.

756
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:24,798
Will you do that with
the machines I got you?

757
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,510
Yes. I'll do with those machines.

758
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:31,221
If nothing is out of the usual,

759
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:34,265
your operation will be held
early next week.

760
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:36,810
It's a simple operation.

761
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:40,188
You won't have to be
in the hospital for long.

762
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:45,235
Make sure you are

763
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,403
part of that operation.

764
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,906
I'm just a general surgeon. How could I--

765
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:51,032
You have to come up

766
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:52,784
with a way to get inside
that operating room.

767
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:54,369
You can use your brain for once.

768
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:58,039
Tell me everything which happens

769
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:00,416
in that operating room.

770
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:02,752
I need

771
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:04,879
to know everything.

772
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,481
Really? Did Seo-jeong do that?

773
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:24,774
After that day,

774
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:27,527
she's been reading
all of the related articles.

775
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,363
I thought you should know.

776
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:34,617
Do you have
an operation team in your mind?

777
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:37,579
I do have a vague picture.

778
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:45,628
I will sleep on it for a couple more days

779
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:49,257
until I am completely decided.

780
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,383
I see.

781
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:55,430
I hope Dr. Yun gets a chance this time.

782
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:57,807
It's just

783
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:00,018
my wish, though.

784
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,228
Goodbye, Ms. Oh.

785
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:07,400
What brings you here?

786
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:16,242
Why? What is it? Tell me.

787
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,123
It's about

788
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:24,375
Chairman Shin's operation.

789
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,795
It's not much of an operation.

790
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:30,173
We're just changing the batteries
of his artificial heart.

791
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:31,382
May I be

792
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:34,427
the first assistant?

793
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:42,435
Why? You're a general surgeon.

794
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,770
When I was an intern,

795
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,356
I have participated
in a heart transplant operation once.

796
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:48,316
I've also been

797
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:50,109
in an aortic dissection once,

798
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,111
in a cardiovascular
bypass operation four times,

799
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,530
ECMO operation once,

800
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,282
and VAD operation twice.

801
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,618
If you take the first assistant,

802
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,954
that will exclude Dr. Yun.

803
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,164
Do you understand that?

804
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:04,832
Is there

805
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:06,960
any way I can participate?

806
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:17,595
Don't you look forward to this?

807
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,099
Who will become

808
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:23,393
part of Teacher Kim's operation?

809
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,104
I'm not sure.

810
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:28,314
Whoever that may be,

811
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:31,317
it would mean he or she
is a very lucky person.

812
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,002
