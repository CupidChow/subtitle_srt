1
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,363
What's your name?

2
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,115
Yun Seo-jeong.

3
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,658
Seo-jeong.

4
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,660
You must be in shock.

5
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,261
How did you end up calling me?

6
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,984
If something happens to me,

7
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:54,614
call Vice President Do
at Geosan Medical Center.

8
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:59,202
He will take good care of you.

9
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,745
Are you...

10
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,707
my father by any chance?

11
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,004
Are you...

12
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,133
my father?

13
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:19,430
President Do of Geosan Medical Center
is his father.

14
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,643
Thank you

15
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:26,062
for introducing me
when I didn't ask you to.

16
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,690
How is President Do doing?

17
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:31,651
Is he doing well after kicking me out
to Doldam Hospital?

18
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,028
Of course he is doing well.

19
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,738
You are nothing to him.

20
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:39,242
I know. I just don't understand
why he let me kill a VIP patient

21
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,828
when I meant nothing to him.

22
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,413
Do you know why?

23
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:46,332
Whom are you trying to blame?
You're the one who made the mistake.

24
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,793
There was no way I could avoid it.
It was all set up.

25
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,837
It's your call to say if you can

26
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,171
handle it or not.

27
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,841
The system doesn't allow individuals
to make a call

28
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,009
at Geosan Medical Center.

29
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,343
Are you criticizing my father?

30
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,889
If you don't like it, don't come here
to get on my nerves.

31
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:02,891
It's been a long time.

32
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,145
Do you not remember me?

33
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,024
Do you know him?

34
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,984
It's been a while since we met.

35
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,779
You met him before?

36
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,283
Hi.

37
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,287
I'm Yun Seo-jeong. Nice to meet you.

38
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:27,040
She is your sister now.

39
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,124
Okay?

40
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,343
I'm sorry, but I don't remember you.

41
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,722
I understand.
I almost didn't recognize you either.

42
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,724
How is President Do?

43
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,559
I haven't talked to him for a long time.

44
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,729
I also barely meet him
because I am too busy.

45
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,731
I see.

46
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,318
Anyway, I'm surprised
that you have become a doctor.

47
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,280
Where is the way out?

48
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:03,243
I will call President Do later.

49
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,912
Please don't tell him
that you saw me here until then.

50
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,538
Okay?

51
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,916
What is going on?

52
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,170
When and how did you meet him?

53
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:18,841
Did you meet him
on a blind date or something?

54
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,514
You must be tired.

55
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,849
What? Seo-jeong.

56
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,726
Stop talking nonsense and get some sleep.

57
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,895
Tell me. I will take a nap
if you tell me the truth.

58
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,063
Stop it.

59
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,150
Are you not going to tell me?

60
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,906
You better give up on that operation.

61
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,450
President Do will do anything to stop you

62
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,785
from operating on him.

63
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:51,207
Now that you are settled here
with a new name,

64
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,501
just try not to rock the boat

65
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,337
and live in obscurity and peace.

66
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,257
That's what is good for you.

67
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,260
What do you think is good for a doctor?

68
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,220
It's simple.

69
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,431
Make a living with a medical license.

70
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,141
It's not just making a living.

71
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,310
You can also get people's respect
and practical interests.

72
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,229
It's good for your face
and social position.

73
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,315
Like pursuit of profits
without conscience?

74
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,525
Putting performance first without a goal?

75
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,485
Unjustifiable rationalism?

76
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,781
Right. If you are talking about them,

77
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,200
I was once good at those things, too.

78
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,494
-Exactly--
-That's why

79
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,872
I can't give up on this operation.

80
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,042
-What?
-He's the foundation chairman.

81
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,085
It will be perfect for my comeback.

82
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,963
-Yong-ju.
-Go.

83
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,840
Go and tell Do Yun-wan.

84
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,969
Tell him that I will do
something lucrative from now on, okay?

85
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,856
Times of valuelessness.

86
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,860
Hey, Dong-ju.

87
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:02,945
Why are you still here?

88
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,289
People are lost

89
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:15,124
in an ideology called success.

90
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,251
PRESIDENT DO YUN-WAN

91
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,130
People lose their value

92
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,841
to be recognized by others.

93
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:33,309
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

94
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,938
-Seoul, please.
-Pardon?

95
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,607
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

96
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,905
Yes, sir.

97
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,159
What's life all about?

98
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,745
People are too busy making a living

99
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,124
that they don't even know
what life is all about.

100
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,126
Gosh.

101
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:03,047
This is really good for my sore muscles.

102
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,800
Get off me.

103
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:13,850
What is that?

104
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,603
I need one more ultrasound device
for the emergency room.

105
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,481
And I want a new CT scanner, too.

106
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,860
Also, I will buy
another chest portable machine.

107
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:27,697
Why is it so complicated and messy?

108
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,908
We already made a deal and it is over.

109
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,704
You are the chairman of the
foundation of Geosan Medical Center.

110
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,372
So what?

111
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,791
You chose a man like Do Yun-wan
for the president of the hospital

112
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,627
and extorted money from sick people.

113
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,337
This isn't enough for you.

114
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:47,425
This is my good chance
to make the most out of it.

115
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,136
What makes you so confident?

116
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,597
There isn't anything
that make me confident.

117
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,682
I do have

118
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,352
a plan in mind.

119
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,870
How do you feel?

120
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,125
We need to get
your personal information here.

121
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,712
Your name, resident registration number,
and your phone number.

122
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,844
Bring him to me before I raise my voice.

123
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,679
What is the matter?

124
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,098
They are the guardians of
the bike accident patients.

125
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,392
They want to move the patients
to a hospital in Seoul.

126
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,520
-You can't do that.
-Why not?

127
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:44,690
I don't want to keep him
in this lousy hospital even for a second.

128
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:48,027
The patient must be kept in absolute rest
right after the operation.

129
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,323
Who told you to operate on my brother?

130
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,116
I'm sorry.

131
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,119
I agreed because I heard
he was in a critical condition.

132
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,080
Just stay quiet.

133
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:02,291
I have some close friends

134
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,126
at the Ministry of Health and Welfare.

135
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,338
If something goes wrong,
there will be no way

136
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,423
you can get away with it. Okay?

137
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,052
Excuse me.

138
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,556
Do you think we operated
on the patients for fun?

139
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,557
What are you, young lady?

140
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,308
I'm a doctor.

141
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,520
Your brother was
in a very critical condition

142
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,273
because of hemorrhage in the spleen
which required an operation.

143
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,316
So did you operate on my brother, lady?

144
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,901
I'm not a lady. I said, I'm a doctor.

145
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,237
Is that you who operated on my brother?

146
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,114
If not, get out of my sight.

147
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,950
Bring me a real doctor. Now!

148
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,035
-You are being--
-Wait.

149
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,662
We want the guardians to stay outside.

150
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,331
You are in the emergency room
and we have patients here.

151
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,293
-Please wait outside.
-How dare you touch me?

152
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,843
Did you just hit me?

153
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:00,349
Right. I hit you.
What are you going to do with that?

154
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:04,395
How dare you order me to wait outside?

155
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,522
Do you even know who I am?

156
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,274
Hey!

157
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:12,945
As soon as I give a call to my friend

158
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,531
at the Ministry of Health and Welfare,

159
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,743
you will be doomed. Do you understand?

160
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,329
Is that so?

161
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,707
Of course it is.

162
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,834
I see.

163
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,549
-Give him a call.
-What?

164
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,636
Call your friend
at the Ministry of Health and Welfare

165
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:41,849
and put me on the phone with him now!

166
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,481
I need to talk to
the civil servant who has

167
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,566
an irrational and ill-mannered
friend like you.

168
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,277
I will find out who he is

169
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,112
and file a complaint

170
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,740
to the Prime Minister's Office
and what else?

171
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,493
-The Public Service Center.
-Right. The Public Service Center!

172
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:03,663
I will file a complaint about your
friend so that they will fire him!

173
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,916
Call your friend right now!

174
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,339
Why are you hesitating?

175
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:17,259
You said you have a close friend

176
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,595
at the Ministry of Health and Welfare!

177
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,305
Call him right now!

178
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,935
I can press the number for you.

179
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:28,854
Do you want me to?

180
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,654
Move away.

181
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:40,199
-How dare you little rat...
-Oh my goodness.

182
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,700
I will make a call.

183
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,536
Go easy.

184
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,874
There are always weird people like him.

185
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,459
That was out of nowhere.

186
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,878
But

187
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,547
I shouldn't have yelled.

188
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,632
If you haven't, I would have.

189
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,634
Who does he think he is?

190
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,678
And his lines were so tacky.

191
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,723
-Where's Dr. Kang?
-A chief general surgeon came from Seoul

192
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,142
to see him.

193
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,436
Is Dr. Kang not in the building?

194
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,187
No, he's away.

195
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,397
What should we do?

196
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,274
Should I call Teacher Kim?

197
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,526
He's not here.

198
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,529
-Pardon?
-Teacher Kim isn't here, either.

199
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:21,532
He left thinking Dr. Kang was here.

200
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,242
Then what about the emergency room?

201
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,462
OH MYEONG-SIM

202
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,592
Is he picking up?

203
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,260
No. What about Dr. Kang?

204
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,221
Why aren't they picking up?

205
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,557
This tastes great.

206
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,516
Is this made here?

207
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,351
Here. Have a glass.

208
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,228
I have to go back to work.

209
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,688
I have a patient to look after.

210
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,440
Then just take the glass.

211
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,071
When did you find out
that Teacher Kim is Bu Yong-ju?

212
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,741
Bu Yong-ju?

213
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:07,369
That Bu Yong-ju? The legendary surgeon?

214
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:08,662
When did you know?

215
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,332
Right before

216
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,791
I talked to you on the phone.

217
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,213
Do you know why he was
kicked out of Geosan Medical Center?

218
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,797
Was he kicked out?

219
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,342
Didn't he leave by himself? Why?

220
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,011
He killed someone.

221
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,847
And it was a pupil of his.

222
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,937
He is a failure as a doctor.

223
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,022
And he's a failure as a human.

224
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,691
He was so crazy about surgery

225
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,778
that he cut open any patients

226
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,530
he got his hands on.

227
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,448
Simply put,

228
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,577
he's a psychopath.

229
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,050
Hey, what's wrong?
Are you angry about something?

230
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,513
A plan?

231
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,765
Are you saying

232
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:13,102
that you want me to build you a hospital?

233
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,230
If I ask you, will you build me one?

234
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,232
You are so brazen.

235
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,776
Find yourself another doctor then.

236
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,570
You're a rich man.

237
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,530
Look at him.

238
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,285
Watch it, will you?

239
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,412
Welcome.

240
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,796
Why are you telling me this?

241
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,047
To be honest,

242
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:45,926
when I heard you saying
Bu Yong-ju is your teacher,

243
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,469
I was worried about you.

244
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,596
I thought...

245
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,141
I may lose one of my dear colleagues.

246
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,060
Dong-ju.

247
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,939
I truly know how you feel.

248
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,900
But be careful.

249
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,985
Teacher Kim is

250
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,820
barely a human.

251
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:09,450
Your life will end in a minute
if you get on his bad side.

252
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,663
This is weird. Why isn't he picking up?

253
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,833
Maybe something happened.

254
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,961
Look at this.

255
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,505
Teacher Kim left his phone.

256
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:25,841
Maybe

257
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,927
Dr. Kang left his phone, too.

258
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,887
I doubt that.

259
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,849
I want to doubt that.

260
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,100
Don't worry.

261
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,061
It's not like we have emergency patients.

262
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,604
We have an emergency patient.

263
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,401
Did you hear that?

264
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,986
I did.

265
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,120
-What happened?
-Man in 40s collapsed suddenly.

266
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,872
He's sweating and has a fever.

267
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,459
-In-beom.
-He was my taxi driver.

268
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:06,674
Sir, can you hear me? Sir?

269
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,640
-Vitals?
-It's 80 over 40, pulse 130

270
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:15,766
and a fever at 39.8.

271
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:16,976
Is this a septic shock?

272
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,311
I checked his stomach
and his muscle guarding is bad.

273
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,857
What are you doing? Give us an order.

274
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:30,489
But, I can't allow you
to treat patients yet.

275
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:34,118
I need to be sure if I can let you
be with the patients or not.

276
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,000
What's your order?

277
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,211
Dr. Yun.

278
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,934
ON YOUR WAY RESTAURANT

279
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,519
Will you really not

280
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,229
operate on the chairman?

281
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:05,107
That's up to him.

282
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,776
I thought you had a plan.

283
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:12,865
You should at least make him
stand on your side.

284
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,785
If he's in, he's in.

285
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,581
I don't go around making teams and sides.

286
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:24,585
If you give up on his surgery,
the only one who will be most glad is

287
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,630
President Do. Isn't that right?

288
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,675
I don't care.

289
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:37,181
This is next year's operating plan
which President Do turned in.

290
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,142
I wonder

291
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,771
if you can stay careless
after seeing this.

292
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,699
I have to go.

293
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:56,909
Already?

294
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,619
Hey, Dong-ju.

295
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,832
Have a safe trip back.

296
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,672
Think it over, Dong-ju.

297
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,636
Think hard about

298
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,596
which is a legit opportunity

299
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,682
and which is not.

300
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,658
13 MISSED CALLS

301
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,209
Seo-jeong, it's me.

302
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,586
Dong-ju, where on earth are you?

303
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,296
Why didn't you pick up?

304
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,840
Why? What's going on?

305
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,508
We have a patient with stomach pain.

306
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,803
His vitals are dropping and has a fever.
I think it's peritonitis.

307
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:58,887
What should we do?

308
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,808
It'll take me at least
40 minutes to get back.

309
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:03,934
No.

310
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,603
If you don't come in 10 minutes,
the patient and I will both die.

311
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,314
You have to fly if you can.

312
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,651
Where's Teacher Kim?

313
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,153
Isn't he at the hospital?

314
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,655
He left thinking that you were here.

315
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,616
So, can you get here in 10 minutes?

316
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,785
This is driving me crazy.

317
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,245
Hello?

318
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,621
Hey, Dong-ju.

319
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,748
Did he just hang up? Hello?

320
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,375
Hello?

321
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,419
You have to do this.

322
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,504
What are you saying? I'm not...

323
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,136
I'm not in a situation to do that.

324
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,596
What are you supposed to do?

325
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,805
Teacher Kim and I aren't there.

326
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,515
You are the only one there.

327
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,184
Do you want the patient to die?

328
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,685
Don't even say that.

329
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,770
Let him die?
We're not going to let him die.

330
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,689
That's why you need to treat him.

331
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,817
You are in charge of the ER anyway.

332
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,865
Give me 30 minutes. I'll be there
in 30 minutes no matter what.

333
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,617
Keep him alive until then.

334
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,456
Taxi.

335
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,046
Dr. Yun.

336
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:15,839
Dr. Yun.

337
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,383
What are you doing?

338
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,593
Your patient is here.

339
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,971
Can't you see he's getting worse?

340
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:28,602
Hey.

341
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,103
Aren't you a doctor?

342
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,898
You're a doctor, aren't you?

343
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,068
You have hurt yourself.

344
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,778
I can't let you be with a patient.

345
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,949
You are disqualified
from this hospital as of today.

346
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,284
That's why you need to treat him.

347
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,411
You are in charge of the ER anyway.

348
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,884
Oxygen mask, 7L.

349
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,845
Set up IV lines and execute a full drop.

350
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,847
-I need a C-line, too.
-Yes, Dr. Yun.

351
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,516
Let's take a sonogram, too.

352
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:12,896
C-line is ready.

353
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,690
Administer 32mg of norepinephrine

354
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,359
and mix ODW.
After that, inject 10cc per hour.

355
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,152
-Foley, please.
-Yes, Dr. Yun.

356
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,035
Dr. Yun, the rates are dropping.

357
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,037
It just needs to be fixed.

358
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,166
It's an arrest. Prepare CPR.

359
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,502
Dr. Do, can you help me
with the compression?

360
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,630
Do me a favor. I hurt my wrist.

361
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,260
Give me 1mg of epinephrine
every 3 minutes.

362
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,553
Please prepare for intubation.

363
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,070
Checking heart rhythm.

364
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,073
Wait. Hold on.

365
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,243
He's back. It's ROSC.

366
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,579
The blood pressure is 80 over 50.

367
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,997
Please hurry with the norepinephrine.

368
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,956
Yes, Doctor.

369
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,005
What's that junk?

370
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,384
Is that the gallbladder?

371
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,095
It is.

372
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,764
It's going to burst.

373
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,348
Is it an empyema?

374
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,143
That means...

375
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:36,021
Mr. Park, he needs an emergency operation.

376
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,315
-Page Dr. Nam.
-Yes, Doctor.

377
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,243
Teacher Kim. I received an ER call.

378
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,496
Dr. Kang must be
on an emergency operation again.

379
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:53,955
Aren't you going?

380
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:59,753
Remember to turn the heat off
after 10 minutes.

381
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:03,215
Don't boil all the broth away
like last time.

382
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:09,012
Dr. Kang is destined
to work a lot in life.

383
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,515
He's not getting a moment of rest
ever since he got here.

384
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:12,682
I'm going now.

385
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,943
He's planning something.

386
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,239
About what?

387
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,496
Chairman Shin, President Do is here.

388
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,916
-Welcome.
-Did you ask for me, Chairman Shin?

389
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:44,172
I'm sorry to bother
a busy man like you all the time.

390
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:48,009
It's fine. It's Saturday evening
and I'm not that occupied.

391
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:52,264
I know you're a busy man,
so I'll make it short.

392
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,100
I'll get right to the point.

393
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,440
It's a list of equipment

394
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,360
I want you to prepare for Doldam Hospital.

395
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,863
This is all high tech
and top of the line equipment.

396
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,490
This is too much for
a small hospital to handle.

397
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,367
Why would Doldam Hospital be
in need for these?

398
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,620
My doctor says he needs them. Just do it.

399
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,124
Are you talking about

400
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,169
Bu Yong-ju?

401
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,212
Yes. Why?

402
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:27,841
Chairman Shin.

403
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,510
Bu Yong-ju was

404
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,180
thrown out of the industry
a long time ago.

405
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,724
Ethically and medically speaking,

406
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,559
he's not a man to be trusted.
Why would you--

407
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,270
Shut your mouth and just do as I say.

408
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:44,399
It's not even your money.
Stop whining already.

409
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,359
-I don't want to hear it.
-But Chairman Shin.

410
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,487
Should I go down there
and deliver them myself?

411
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,572
Would you like that?

412
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,575
No, sir.

413
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:56,703
I'll do as you wish.

414
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:03,126
Please feel free to order
anything you like.

415
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,336
It's on me tonight.

416
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,840
I didn't think I'd find someone
as broad-minded as you here.

417
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,927
I appreciate you saying that.

418
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,473
By the way,

419
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,727
what business do you have with Dr. Kang?

420
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,521
That's not for you to worry about.

421
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:26,942
Of course not. Right.

422
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:30,028
I can't even begin to express my gratitude

423
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,364
for sending a great doctor like him
all the way out here.

424
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,367
Here.

425
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,329
Yes, President Do?

426
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:42,249
What? At Doldam Hospital?

427
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,793
Yes! Come here right now!

428
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,645
-What's going on?
-Sir.

429
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,438
Please help my husband.

430
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,816
You need to save him.

431
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,568
Please! He's dying!

432
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,529
Oh no.

433
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:16,533
My husband needs help!

434
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,159
Please!

435
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,578
Please save him!

436
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,580
Ms. Eom.

437
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,499
Can you call Dr. Kang one more time?

438
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:26,835
I want to know how much longer
it'll take for him to get here.

439
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:30,088
I tried to reach him just now,
but he's not answering.

440
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,841
What do you mean he's not answering?

441
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,759
I called him twice, but he didn't pick up.

442
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,144
My goodness.

443
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,062
Please, honey.

444
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,355
The pelvis needs to be fixed.

445
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,274
Bring me sheets and elastic bands.

446
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,818
Wake up.

447
00:26:58,616 --> 00:26:59,659
What's going on?

448
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,036
I got the consent from the guardian.

449
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,662
Should we move him to the operating room?

450
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,127
Isn't there another general surgeon
other than Dong-ju?

451
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,504
There is one, but he's absent, too.

452
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,673
Can't you do an intervention
for the gallbladder?

453
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,258
We don't have the equipment here.

454
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,135
Then transfer the patient
to a different hospital.

455
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:20,305
A hospital that can treat him is
at least two hours away from here.

456
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,600
With the condition he's in,
he won't make it that long.

457
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,018
Dr. Yun.

458
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,604
The blood pressure is still low.

459
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:30,315
Let's increase the norepinephrine
injection by 20.

460
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,403
Is there a laparoscope here?

461
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:41,284
We purchased a used one
from a closed hospital last year.

462
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,703
Why do you ask?

463
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,747
I'll take over.

464
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,167
I'll take over

465
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:50,835
that patient's operation.

466
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,547
I'm sorry, but unauthorized
doctors are not allowed

467
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,299
to perform surgeries
according to regulations.

468
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,637
-Is it not possible?
-It can't be done.

469
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,224
Do you have any other way
to save the patient?

470
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,895
That patient could die
if you don't operate on him now.

471
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,148
Do you have any other choice besides me?

472
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,909
Who's that?

473
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,703
He's a general surgeon
from Geosan Medical Center, Dr. Do.

474
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,206
I didn't know there was a doctor
on invitation today.

475
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,251
The patient went into
cardiac arrest and septic shock

476
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:32,669
from gallbladder empyema.

477
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:35,547
Neither Dr. Kang or Teacher Kim
answered to our calls.

478
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,216
His condition was too critical to be
transferred to somewhere else.

479
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:41,177
-But this is--
-Please, Dr. Nam.

480
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,973
We can talk about this
after saving the patient.

481
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,352
If the laparoscope doesn't work,
I'll open him up.

482
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,395
Okay.

483
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,207
Just a second.

484
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:14,753
Dr. Yun. You got a call from Dr. Kang.

485
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:17,881
Put him on speaker.

486
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,550
Seo-jeong. It's me, Dong-ju.

487
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,430
I was on my way,
but there's been an accident.

488
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,557
I heard you're in the operating room.

489
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,727
Hold on for just a little longer.
I'll get there as soon as I can.

490
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,439
Seo-jeong?

491
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,816
Do you hear me?

492
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,445
-Dr. Yun.
-It's too late, Dr. Kang.

493
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:43,531
We put the patient under anesthesia.
We can't wait any longer.

494
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:44,949
Let's get started.

495
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,746
Commencing operation.

496
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,040
Do In-beom?

497
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,708
I'll handle the laparoscope.

498
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,003
Scalpel.

499
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,763
Laparoscope.

500
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,149
The gallbladder's almost
melted down completely.

501
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,193
How could he endure the pain up until now?

502
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,278
He had to in order to make a living.

503
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,113
Poor man.

504
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:29,035
It'll have to do with two incisions
since we're short-handed.

505
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,373
But it's an empyema.
Are you sure about this?

506
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:34,791
I'll have to see how it goes.

507
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,626
Trocar.

508
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:47,720
Honey. Wake up, honey.

509
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:54,435
Honey. Please wake up.

510
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:08,950
Grasper.

511
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,120
Dissector.

512
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:23,631
It'll end smoothly
if the dissection goes well.

513
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,801
-What about his vital signs?
-Not that bad.

514
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,996
It's a cultivator accident.
He was under it for 30 minutes.

515
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,498
He's bleeding very much.
Send up two packed RBCs.

516
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,001
Prepare four more.
Also, inject four doses of FFP as well.

517
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,461
It looks like his pelvis is fractured.

518
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:04,255
Don't undo his bandage
and give him a CT scan as is.

519
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,090
-Please, Ms. Eom.
-Yes, Dr. Kang.

520
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,134
Bring transfusion packs. This way.

521
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,061
IN OPERATION

522
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,146
OPERATING ROOM

523
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,736
Teacher Kim.

524
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,073
What are you doing here?

525
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,700
I'm sorry.

526
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,453
I thought you were in, so I was out.

527
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:38,539
Then who is in the operating room?

528
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,960
If it's not you, who is it?

529
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,809
Dissection is complete.

530
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,478
We just have to tie up
his cystic duct and artery.

531
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:01,521
Hemoclip.

532
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,528
How much have you done?

533
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:15,910
He went in a septic shock
and an arrest because of GB empyema.

534
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,829
We just cut his GB,

535
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,998
and now we're tying
his cystic duct and artery.

536
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,042
Hey.

537
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,962
Hey, who are you?

538
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:29,465
I am Do In-beom, a general surgeon
of Geosan Medical Center.

539
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,970
Both doctors here at Doldam Hospital
couldn't be reached,

540
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,180
so I had to step in.

541
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,141
I called you.

542
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,559
I called you twice.

543
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,857
-Take it out.
-Taking out.

544
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,528
Scope.

545
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,119
No bleeding.

546
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,288
His duct is perfectly tied.

547
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,959
Dr. Nam. How are his vital signs?

548
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,795
It's 100 over 75. He's slowly stabilizing.

549
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,631
We'll put in hemovac and finish.

550
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,924
Let's wrap up.

551
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,092
Give me the hemovac.

552
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,178
Please prepare for suture, too.

553
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,071
President Do.

554
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,032
President Do, you're here.

555
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,450
What brings you here?

556
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:39,786
Are you drunk?

557
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,080
Hello, President Do.

558
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,874
I am Jang Gi-tae,
the head of administration here.

559
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:45,958
Hello, sir.

560
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,421
I told President Yeo that you were coming.

561
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,881
This way, please.

562
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,257
Where's Bu Yong-ju?

563
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,844
I need to meet him first.

564
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,638
OPERATING ROOM

565
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,432
How's the cultivator case?

566
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,726
The CT scan shows he has
an open book pelvic fracture.

567
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,561
He also has an open femur fracture.

568
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,730
We're looking for an orthopedic surgeon.

569
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,482
You can follow up with him.

570
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,567
You two, follow me.

571
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,118
Seo-jeong.

572
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,717
You're here, Teacher Kim.

573
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,719
What brings you here?

574
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,222
Well, Teacher Kim.

575
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,355
It's been a while.

576
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,066
How long has it been?

577
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,319
I think it's been around 14 to 15 years.

578
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:00,992
I don't think we are in a situation
to share warm regards.

579
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,785
Should we have a talk?

580
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:12,795
President Do.

581
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,302
Father.

582
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,940
My goodness.

583
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,109
What a great timing.

584
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:38,029
President Do, your son has
put himself into a trouble.

585
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,614
What are you talking about?

586
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,991
Dr. Do just performed

587
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:44,410
a surgery in my operating room.

588
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,746
An unregistered doctor

589
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,915
performed a surgery in this hospital

590
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,250
without consent.

591
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,379
Did you do that?

592
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,342
I asked you, did you do that?

593
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,765
I'm sorry.

594
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:08,476
We had an emergency. I asked him for help.

595
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:12,939
I'll take over.

596
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:16,984
I know I shouldn't have, but there was
no choice in order to save the patient.

597
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,028
Do you have any other choice besides me?

598
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,864
I knew it was wrong,
but I had to ask him. I'm sorry.

599
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,204
Stop talking.

600
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:29,497
Follow me.

601
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,979
Yun Seo-jeong. Did you do this?

602
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:56,524
Did you ask him to operate?

603
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,151
-Yes, I--
-I said I'll take over.

604
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,405
This place only has two qualified doctors

605
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,448
and both didn't respond.

606
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:08,369
The closest hospital is two hours away,
so I had no choice.

607
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,288
That's why I took over.

608
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,458
-Who's telling the truth?
-I am.

609
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,210
I asked him to do this.

610
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,547
Stop taking the responsibilities
for what you haven't done.

611
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,215
You're making me uncomfortable.

612
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,009
It's on me.

613
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,553
No, I asked him.

614
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:29,515
Dr. Do stepped in
because we had no other choice.

615
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,767
I don't appreciate it.

616
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,561
Stop acting so nice.

617
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,813
I will take the responsibility.

618
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:36,897
My goodness.

619
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,274
How long did it take?

620
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,735
Laparoscopy, I mean.

621
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,987
It didn't take
as long as I thought it would.

622
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,031
It took about 50 minutes
after he was anesthetized.

623
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,993
If you had better equipment,
it would've been five minutes shorter.

624
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,291
Okay.

625
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:59,879
I will talk to Geosan Medical Center
and tell you about what we should do.

626
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,465
Get out, both of you.

627
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:07,053
May I ask what you have in your mind?

628
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,971
It's against the rules to operate

629
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:12,099
in an unregistered hospital
without consent.

630
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,895
You'll be punished for what you have done.

631
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,273
His gallbladder was about to burst.

632
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,193
He was under an arrest.

633
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:25,446
But still, how can you let
an outsider to take over?

634
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,573
And you're just an orderly.

635
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,618
Since when does an orderly

636
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,454
have the authority to give orders?

637
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,917
I'm sorry.

638
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,879
I'm sorry I made such a decision
as a mere orderly.

639
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,257
And I am sorry again.

640
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,595
I wanted to take full responsibility
as a mere orderly.

641
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,766
I'm sorry for everything.

642
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:55,976
However,

643
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:59,438
if I were put in the same situation,

644
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,275
I would have made the same decision.

645
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,446
Are you saying what you did was right?

646
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,658
It means I will do
whatever I can for the patients.

647
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,495
Whether you acknowledge me or not...

648
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,289
Whether I'm capable or not...

649
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:19,667
In the end,

650
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:21,419
I am

651
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:25,923
a doctor.

652
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,070
Teacher Kim, it's me.

653
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,613
I'm coming in.

654
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,703
Excuse me, Teacher Kim.

655
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,913
President Do is

656
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,166
waiting for you. What should I do?

657
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,881
Excuse me, Teacher Kim.

658
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,512
President Yeo has prepared

659
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,473
a very special tea for you.

660
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,312
Oh gosh.

661
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,190
What do I do?

662
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,983
I must have been out of my mind.

663
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,319
What was I thinking?

664
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,070
What should I do?

665
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,697
What am I going to do?

666
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:35,326
Gosh. What should I do?

667
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,870
Gosh. I can't believe this.

668
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:48,547
I'm not good at reading
Chinese characters.

669
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,467
Are you Chinese?

670
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,220
I see.

671
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,847
Can't you speak Korean at all?

672
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:59,141
Just a little.

673
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:03,312
I can speak basic Korean.

674
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,022
Thank goodness.

675
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,608
I was afraid you might not
speak Korean at all.

676
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,777
Actually...

677
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,867
I have a favor to ask of you.

678
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:21,205
What? She can't afford the treatment?

679
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,581
That's right.

680
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,960
So is she asking us to let her go?

681
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,212
No. She's asking us to give her
some odd jobs

682
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:30,339
such as cleaning that she can do

683
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,132
instead of paying for the treatment.

684
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,551
That means she won't pay for it.

685
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,970
She said everything she had in possession
had been robbed.

686
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:38,973
I offered to pay for her treatment,
but she refused.

687
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:47,523
You're not

688
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,401
helping her because you're
interested in her, are you?

689
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,027
No.

690
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:54,905
I'm helping her
in the spirit of philanthropy.

691
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,327
PRESIDENT OFFICE

692
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:03,581
Please have some tangerine tea.

693
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,667
It has a nice scent.

694
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,961
I should have been more cautious.

695
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:10,546
You even changed your name

696
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:12,756
and you have been hiding
right under my nose.

697
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,092
You caught me off guard.

698
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:18,554
That's your specialty.

699
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:27,104
I'm sure you earned a lot of money
from all your projects.

700
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,441
I guess you're still obsessed about
making more money.

701
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:33,611
What?

702
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,195
A sanitarium?

703
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,823
THE PERSPECTIVE VIEW OF
GEOSAN NURSING HOME

704
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:42,369
The air is fresh, and the location
is perfect. Why wouldn't I open it?

705
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,788
The patients' rooms are empty
in this hospital.

706
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,583
It's better than wasting the space.

707
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:50,919
Do you know how many highways
that pass through here?

708
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,129
Why should I know that?

709
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:55,507
There are five highways
including the one near here.

710
00:43:56,717 --> 00:44:00,054
About 8,500 people
come to this area every day

711
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:03,349
from across the country to go
to the casino. We have between

712
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:06,644
30 and 40 car accident patients every week

713
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,520
who are carried into our emergency room.

714
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:11,774
During the peak season,
we have more than 60 patients.

715
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:12,900
Now think about it.

716
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,528
If you open a sanitarium here,

717
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,864
where do you expect
all those patients to go?

718
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,491
That's not my problem.

719
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,453
How could you say that
as the president of a hospital?

720
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:27,748
An unproductive discussion
with a person with inefficient ideas

721
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:29,583
makes me sick.

722
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:31,335
Is that so?

723
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,387
Are you aware

724
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,348
that it's against the law

725
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:46,684
for a doctor to treat a patient
in another hospital?

726
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,103
He had no choice
as it was an emergency patient.

727
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,854
Treating an emergency patient

728
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:54,775
at the affiliated hospital
isn't a big deal.

729
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,485
Right.

730
00:44:56,568 --> 00:45:00,948
It's not a big deal as the patient
was going to die.

731
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:05,744
But it's not impossible
to turn it into a problem.

732
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,329
If you mess with my son,

733
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,332
you will be finished, too.

734
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,750
Gosh.

735
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,377
That's so scary.

736
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,796
I'm sorry to tell you this.

737
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,757
My career was ruined 14 years ago.

738
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,635
I have nothing to fear.

739
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:23,887
But your son just started his career.

740
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:27,683
You have become ruthless and underhanded.

741
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:30,936
You made me like this.
Don't pretend you don't know that.

742
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,355
What do you want?

743
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:39,319
As our hospital is quite old,

744
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,989
we have a lot of things to be improved.

745
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:45,284
We'll get new medical equipment

746
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:48,203
thanks to Chairman Shin's help.

747
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:52,583
However, he's rich,
but he doesn't know much about doctors.

748
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,670
So what do you want from me?

749
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:01,008
Send your son to our hospital.

750
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:09,933
Are you

751
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:13,729
threatening me using my son?

752
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:15,772
If he works here,

753
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,734
it would be really helpful.

754
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,280
I'll teach him well.

755
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:24,364
Send him here.

756
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,618
You're out of your mind.

757
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,620
Don't be so surprised.

758
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:32,623
I haven't even started yet.

759
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,311
President Do.

760
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,649
Seo-jeong, what's your dream?

761
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,444
What do you want to be

762
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:03,987
when you grow up?

763
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:07,574
He was the first grown-up

764
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:11,328
who had asked me about my dream

765
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,455
for my future.

766
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:14,957
A doctor.

767
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,961
I want to be a good doctor like you.

768
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:24,091
It wasn't true. Actually, my dream was

769
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:28,011
to be acknowledged by him,
not becoming a good doctor.

770
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:29,972
I see.

771
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,432
But...

772
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:39,898
I'm sorry.

773
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:42,568
I didn't mean to

774
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,946
cause you trouble.

775
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,364
I apologize.

776
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:48,740
How could you

777
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,454
disappoint me like this?

778
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,142
You fool.

779
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:41,627
Teacher Kim, are you sure
you're going to be okay?

780
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,089
It smells really nice.

781
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,716
You said it's tangerine tea?

782
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,093
Thank you for the tea.

783
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:57,017
Listen to me. I told you
he's an emergency patient.

784
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,769
He has an open book pelvic fracture.

785
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:01,104
He needs an emergency operation.

786
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:04,107
I told you we don't have
an orthopedic surgeon.

787
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,987
Do you really not have
any bed left in the ICU?

788
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:11,073
Are you telling the truth?

789
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:15,744
Are you saying that you don't care
if the patient dies or not?

790
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,666
Forget it. I said, forget it!

791
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:23,752
What did they say?

792
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:26,004
They refused saying they can't
operate on him right now.

793
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,757
Which hospitals are left?

794
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:44,064
Hello, this is Teacher Kim
from Doldam Hospital.

795
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:46,066
You must be busy.

796
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:48,485
That's right.

797
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:51,238
We have a patient with
an open pelvic book fracture.

798
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:54,908
He needs an emergency orthopedic surgery.

799
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,328
I see. Thank you.

800
00:49:58,412 --> 00:49:59,705
I'll see you soon.

801
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:03,667
Get ready and move the patient.

802
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,976
-Thank you for your help.
-Sure thing.

803
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:22,227
Have a safe flight.

804
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,544
What will happen to Seo-jeong?

805
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,632
Please tell me what you'll do with her.

806
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,551
What am I supposed to do?

807
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:59,514
As you said, you and I are the only
surgeons in this lousy hospital,

808
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,808
but none of us were in the hospital.

809
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,102
She did a great job in such a situation.

810
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,562
What more can I expect from her?

811
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:10,776
From now on, check if I'm in the hospital

812
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,652
before you step out, okay?

813
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:17,824
I'll do the same from now on.

814
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,745
It was much easier when I was alone.

815
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:25,582
I was such a fool for being excited
to have one more surgeon here.

816
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,002
You should be careful.

817
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:31,254
He's a psychopath.

818
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:34,216
Your life will end in a minute
if you get on his bad side.

819
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,184
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

820
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,602
May I help you?

821
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,523
I came to see Choi Gyu-sik.

822
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,775
Okay. Put on the mask

823
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,652
and disinfect your hands, please.

824
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,614
Honey, it's me.

825
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,616
Are you all right?

826
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,994
My goodness.

827
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:04,704
You poor wretch.

828
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,206
I told you to go to hospital.

829
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,625
Why would you take a long drive instead?

830
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,587
I don't care about money.

831
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,548
I just can't live

832
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,967
without you.

833
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:18,718
You know that.

834
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,638
Please hang in there.

835
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,890
I love you.

836
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,143
Okay?

837
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,032
It's okay.

838
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:43,827
That's enough.

839
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:48,957
I did the right thing.

840
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,376
I did.

841
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,760
-See you.
-Goodbye.

842
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:07,142
Excuse me.

843
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:08,727
Yes?

844
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:11,021
Eat it when you are hungry.

845
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:17,235
See you tomorrow.

846
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,127
-Do we have the CT scan yet?
-Yes.

847
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:47,891
Darn it.

848
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,685
How could you do that?

849
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:54,230
I asked you to turn off the gas
before the broth got boiled away,

850
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,857
but you burned it up.

851
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,485
I tried so hard

852
00:53:58,568 --> 00:53:59,986
for this broth.

853
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:03,073
Chicken delivery.

854
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:05,158
You should pay, Teacher Kim.

855
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:08,411
Thank you.

856
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:11,957
Why did you order fried chicken?

857
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,125
I thought we're having chicken kalguksu.

858
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:15,627
Ask Teacher Kim about it.

859
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:25,178
How is Seo-jeong doing?

860
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:27,138
She's okay.

861
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,641
What? Did something happen?

862
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:31,393
For the first time,

863
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:33,937
she told me her opinion

864
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:36,106
looking me in the eye.

865
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:39,234
She talked back to me.

866
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:40,944
Did Seo-jeong really do that?

867
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:42,696
She has changed a lot.

868
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,990
I told you. She's very clever.

869
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:48,243
You will see.
She will do much better than that.

870
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:49,869
Well, I don't know.

871
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,164
You will see.

872
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:55,625
Wait.

873
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,669
Count me in.

874
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:25,108
Bu Yong-ju.

875
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:28,653
Damn you.

876
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:37,620
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

877
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:40,748
Teacher Kim. Where is Teacher Kim?

878
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:42,584
Why? What's the matter?

879
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:45,378
We have an emergency.
Where is Teacher Kim?

880
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:52,093
-Teacher Kim!
-What?

881
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:54,471
This is not the time for a nap.

882
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:57,599
This is huge.
Something serious has happened.

883
00:57:58,266 --> 00:57:59,851
What are the vital signs?

884
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:13,781
What is going on?

885
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,408
They are from Geosan Medical Center.

886
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:17,577
Geosan Medical Center?

887
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,194
Hello,

888
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:53,321
staff of Doldam Hospital.

889
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:57,408
We have been dispatched
to Doldam Hospital as of today.

890
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:59,536
I'm the chief of General Surgery,
Song Hyeon-cheol.

891
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:02,413
I will appreciate your help and support.

892
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,646
