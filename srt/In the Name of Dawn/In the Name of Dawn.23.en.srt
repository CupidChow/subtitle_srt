1
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,200
Never expected

2
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:58,560
This is Jiang Shangshu

3
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,759
How dare you plan to rebel under His Majesty's nose

4
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:02,960
Even though Your Majesty punishes him to jail

5
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:05,480
Haven't convicted of death

6
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,319
Isn't it easy to kill someone in prison?

7
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,959
Not everyone is like our Minister Zhou

8
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,959
What can turn the world around

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,519
Yes

10
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:16,359
Yes Yes Yes

11
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,560
I don't care when something happens

12
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,519
Now I'm flattering and beating

13
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:22,840
Mr. Zhou's misunderstanding

14
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:24,079
That's all a misunderstanding

15
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,439
Only when you can bend and stretch, will you be a real man

16
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,439
Please bear more in the future

17
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:32,599
Sure certain

18
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,680
Now that I've come to my home

19
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,200
It is better to choose a day than to hit the day

20
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:39,200
How about having a few drinks

21
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:42,519
OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK

22
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,200
Go and call Jiang Yue over to pour wine

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,280
yes

24
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,319
Jiang Shangshu was guilty

25
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,799
Unexpectedly, Mr. Zhou

26
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,920
It can also keep his daughter in the mansion

27
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,319
Really kind-hearted

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,400
Be kind to the house

29
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,280
Be kind-hearted

30
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,120
Madam, come out

31
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,439
The husband entertains guests today

32
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,599
Call me, Madam, you go pour wine

33
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,479
The lady offended

34
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,280
Why haven't you come out after calling for so long

35
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,080
Where is the person

36
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,680
Madam, she doesn't want to come out

37
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:40,520
Yue'er

38
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,000
Jiang Yue

39
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,560
Your father is not dead yet

40
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,560
What annoyance to me

41
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,000
Jiang Yue

42
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,639
Don't pretend to be a ghost here

43
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,479
come out

44
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,960
Unjust

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,120
Jiang Yue, daughter of Shangshu Jiang

46
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,120
Dangling the beam to commit suicide

47
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,360
Resent for the father

48
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,159
Jiang Yue, daughter of Shangshu Jiang

49
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:42,280
Dangling the beam to commit suicide

50
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:46,439
Resent for the father

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Unjust

52
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,080
Where is Xian'er

53
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,319
Where exactly did you go

54
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,080
Where is Qiu Xianer

55
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,840
Found it

56
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,080
Small incompetent

57
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:02,879
Go and find it

58
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,360
You have to find out if you dig three feet of the ground

59
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:05,360
yes

60
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,159
who

61
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,479
Get out

62
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,000
Who is it

63
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,600
Who is it

64
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,600
Who is waiting to see my joke

65
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,480
I know you're watching me

66
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,079
You've been watching me

67
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,879
Can be done

68
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,279
Get out

69
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:41,759
Zhou Shilang

70
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,439
Your Majesty has something to ask you

71
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:46,319
I'll take you into the palace

72
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:58,519
Your Highness

73
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,199
How much do you eat

74
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,079
Take the last emperor's will

75
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,600
Can

76
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,160
Get it

77
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,439
yes

78
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,199
Everyone knows when the father left

79
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,959
I once left a decree for me

80
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,759
So I'm afraid of me

81
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,160
But no one knows what the edict says

82
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,600
It's actually

83
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,800
A blank space for me to write

84
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,160
Zhou Junlan

85
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,680
You're not going to die

86
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,199
Jiang Shangshu

87
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,639
Saiwen lost his horse

88
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,639
What a blessing

89
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,279
I kill you

90
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,480
Zhou Junlan

91
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,079
You killed my daughter

92
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,560
You're not going to die

93
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,279
You beast, I'll kill you

94
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,199
You're not going to die

95
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,920
I'm going out

96
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,879
I know you want to seek revenge

97
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,319
But recently, there has been a mess in the city

98
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,920
You're inconvenient to move

99
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,000
I have something to do, too

100
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,480
How can I feel assured to let you go out alone

101
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,240
Then you send someone to accompany me

102
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,839
You should take care of yourself first

103
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,560
Wait until I finish cooking the city affairs

104
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,600
Capture them both alive

105
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:56,480
You will seek revenge on them then

106
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,360
All are left to you

107
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,839
Is that my revenge for them

108
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,959
You've done a good job

109
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,319
Have you

110
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,160
Only now I am

111
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,480
I'm just a dying person

112
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:22,879
No

113
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:23,920
Yunchao

114
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,000
I'll always be with you

115
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,120
Ji Xiao works so hard to cure you

116
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,600
If he heard you like this

117
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,959
Maybe what are you going to shout about again

118
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,839
OK, you unscrupulous Ji Yunchao

119
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,519
Return my magic pills quickly

120
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,680
I'm leaving now

121
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,240
Don't go out

122
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,519
What's wrong

123
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
Even though the orders are eleven

124
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,480
good

125
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,360
Then be careful

126
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,120
good

127
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:25,680
Where is Zhang Zhao

128
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,120
I want to see him

129
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,920
Why should I tell you

130
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,200
With this

131
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,840
What does Your Highness want to write

132
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,759
Grant military power

133
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,320
Qingjun side

134
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,200
Rebel Pei Yan

135
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,240
Do you know the sin

136
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,000
Punish evil

137
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:44,759
What crime is there

138
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,679
You deceive the king and the emperor

139
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,679
Great rebellion

140
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,759
Collusion with bandits

141
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,759
The following is wrong

142
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,200
The crime should be punished

143
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,320
kill

144
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,759
kill

145
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,840
What's wrong with Madam Ji

146
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,200
I've been waiting here for seven days

147
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,879
I'm going out

148
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,919
Although Your Majesty has retreated

149
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,320
But blood flows outward

150
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,639
Please wait a little longer

151
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,799
I'm walking around this yard

152
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,480
Always OK

153
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:38,120
Where did the cricket come from here?

154
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,840
This insect is brave and aggressive

155
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,840
The high-ranking officials and nobles in the capital compete to capture and raise

156
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,080
Fighting each other

157
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,840
Maybe it was raised by someone else

158
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,360
Escape to our yard

159
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,759
It's about to die

160
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,360
You see if you live

161
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,440
Everything has a spirit

162
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,080
Why are you here

163
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:02,360
The fun of fighting crickets lies in playing games

164
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:04,159
If the outcome is too early

165
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,840
How are we spectators happy

166
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,799
If you take your life at this moment

167
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,320
It's not interesting

168
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,200
Just for fun

169
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,399
I want you to go to me

170
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,159
To everyone

171
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,720
A performance that is unparalleled

172
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,159
so

173
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,320
It can't die

174
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,360
yes

175
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,480
It can't die

176
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:31,960
This will definitely win or lose

177
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,200
The spectators scattered

178
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,240
No one supports it

179
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:35,360
Nothing fun

180
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,080
Just a fun

181
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:39,919
Very relieved

182
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,919
I figured it out

183
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,639
Qiu Xian'er, come out

184
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,480
I said I figured it out

185
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,639
Have you heard it

186
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,480
Qiu Xian'er, come out

187
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,279
Qiu Xianer

188
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,240
I'll get you medicine

189
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,039
I'll serve you another bowl

190
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,240
etc.

191
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,960
Open the door

192
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,120
I'm going out

193
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,200
The Marquis has ordered

194
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:47,679
Can't be broken

195
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,080
Then I'll die in front of you now

196
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,840
Open it quickly

197
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:55,159
really

198
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:57,639
really

199
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,759
The Marquis also ordered

200
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,600
If Mrs. Ji insists on going out

201
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,080
Let you be free

202
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:08,600
But I have to follow you

203
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:10,080
good

204
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:15,960
Go and get a fur coat for me

205
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,399
sun

206
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,240
It's going to fall

207
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,679
It's sunset

208
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:54,559
Day 49

209
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,919
It's over

210
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,320
Xuan Yinghou

211
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:22,960
You're coming just right

212
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,840
99th Pieces

213
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,039
Take it

214
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,759
My illness is gone

215
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,039
Xuan Yinghou

216
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:45,200
Are you not happy for me

217
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,360
Birth, old age, sickness and death are the norm in the world

218
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,559
Why bother

219
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,519
That's the norm for you mortals

220
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:55,080
I'm different

221
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,240
I'm the son of heaven

222
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,879
Long live the emperor

223
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,799
I'm only sixty-three

224
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,039
I must never grow old

225
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:06,000
Dishested teeth

226
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:08,039
White hair

227
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,960
The emperor is also an ordinary person

228
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:11,720
Will get old too

229
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,799
Nonsense

230
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,279
I'm sick

231
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:17,279
Taoist Ye said

232
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,320
I have evil spirits

233
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,279
He can't cure me

234
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,679
I killed him

235
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,399
I'll treat it myself

236
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,080
Eat this 99th Immortal Pill

237
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,440
My illness

238
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,279
Congratulations to Your Majesty

239
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,440
Your disease

240
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,240
alright
