1
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:01,840
You're awake

2
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,719
I didn't expect we really survived

3
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,040
Thanks to Xuan Yinghou let us hide

4
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,560
Behind the big rock on the roadside

5
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,280
Avoid mudslide

6
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:19,640
We're spared

7
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,840
But from now on this world

8
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,599
There will be no more you and me

9
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,719
That's good

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,760
gentlemen

11
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:35,480
Thanks to your help along the way

12
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,400
I'm going to say goodbye here

13
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,200
Xuan Yinghou didn't let you and me

14
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,680
Go to the Medicine King Valley together

15
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,000
where are you going

16
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,319
I'm going to Xiliang

17
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:49,319
Xiliang is my border

18
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,040
Wars happen frequently there

19
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,480
The situation is unstable

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,319
What do you do there

21
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,200
I want to join the army

22
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,760
I have never done anything bad in my life

23
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,400
Why did it end like this in the end

24
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,519
I want to join the army

25
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,640
I want revenge

26
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,039
I want to let those damn people

27
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,280
All are blood debts and blood compensation

28
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,400
Where to go

29
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,240
Receive someone

30
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,639
Of course I know

31
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,319
It's just what you want to pick up

32
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,479
Which one is it

33
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,000
you guess

34
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,159
You call me here

35
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,879
Just to accompany you to listen to the rain

36
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,280
Listen to the rain and boil tea and burn the fragrance

37
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,319
How comfortable

38
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,280
My favorite rainy days

39
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,360
I don't like it

40
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,280
Why

41
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,199
If the rain continues

42
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,599
Floods will surely come

43
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,840
People are hungry and eat each other

44
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:42,479
I just don't feel happy all day long when I see you

45
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,280
I want you to relax

46
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,039
You're born with fine clothes and food

47
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,120
Don't know the sufferings of the world

48
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,319
Don't feel ashamed

49
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:51,520
Don't leave

50
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,479
I don't like rainy days anymore

51
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:05,800
Ding Dynasty

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,800
いました

53
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,839
I'll pick you up home

54
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:56,879
Niangzi Ji

55
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,160
What advice does Mr. Zhou have?

56
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:03,360
Do you like rainy days

57
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,839
certainly

58
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,439
Good rain knows the season

59
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,480
I know there is a teahouse

60
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,920
You can listen to the rain and burn incense to make tea

61
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,639
pain

62
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:12,079
you can

63
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:12,680
No need

64
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,720
Walk

65
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,120
The swallows on the beam flew away

66
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,480
This place is cold

67
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,240
They flew south to spend the winter

68
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,079
When will they come back

69
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,040
Let's have a spring

70
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,759
When will your husband come back

71
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,000
I dare not speak nonsense

72
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:13,120
Have the soup in the kitchen been cooked?

73
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,439
You go and see again

74
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,680
yes

75
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,160
Husband

76
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,480
Husband

77
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,079
I thought you weren't here anymore

78
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,000
Do you like rainy days

79
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,600
I don't like it

80
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,560
Say you like it

81
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,399
But I didn't

82
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,000
good

83
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,839
I like

84
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,600
Very angry

85
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:00,879
Your people that day

86
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,720
Seeing Ji Yunchao and Pei Yan's disagreement

87
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,519
It's just that they both played the show

88
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,199
Ji Yunchao had known Pei Yan

89
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,120
Hot potatoes that will take over the North and South list cases

90
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,560
But I can't help him

91
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,480
I will approach you by protecting the Gu family

92
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,399
Make me turn against Pei Yan

93
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,160
Calculated that collapse

94
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,480
Now Pei Yan's bitch

95
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,519
Turning against the truth again

96
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,759
Not thanks to you

97
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,560
Yue'er, go out first

98
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,240
Faster

99
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,199
What kind of man is hesitating to a woman

100
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,160
If you want to blame, blame yourself

101
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,319
Not doing well enough

102
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,399
Not good enough

103
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,319
Not good enough

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,360
Not doing well enough

105
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,800
Not good enough

106
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,439
Not good enough

107
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,199
Not good enough

108
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,720
Not good enough

109
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,120
You're still not good enough

110
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,920
Not good enough

111
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,720
Not good enough

112
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,480
Not good enough

113
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,519
You're still not good enough

114
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,439
Why is it so bad

115
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,120
Not good enough

116
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,680
You can't compare to Pei Yan, you can't compare to him

117
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,160
Not good enough

118
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:11,759
I'm not good enough

119
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:15,360
you tell me

120
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,680
Tell me

121
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,480
What exactly is good

122
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:27,839
Don't touch me

123
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,000
You're injured

124
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,120
I'm injured

125
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:36,559
I'm bleeding

126
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,000
injury

127
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,559
It's all my fault

128
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,679
I'm blaming me for not doing well enough

129
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,519
I'm not as good as Pei Yan

130
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,159
If you want to say this, that's all

131
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,200
roll

132
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:56,679
I found it

133
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,039
It's okay

134
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,240
I will help you in the future

135
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,519
Win him once

136
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,679
I'll never again

137
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:05,639
Can no longer suppress the throbbing in my heart

138
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,679
The whirlwind of love swept me

139
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,240
I want to tell you

140
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,919
I like you

141
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:17,000
My trembling fingertips

142
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,679
Sweat on the forehead dodging eyes

143
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,240
All are talking

144
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,960
I like you

145
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,600
Does it hurt

146
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,480
No

147
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,600
That's

148
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,639
Can you go out

149
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:35,120
I

150
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:35,879
yes

151
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:38,279
I'm writing a letter

152
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:38,919
Go out to write

153
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,960
Stop yelling here

154
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,120
What do you know

155
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,600
Uncle Master

156
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,840
I remember

157
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,639
What's going to do today

158
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:50,360
Yes

159
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:51,679
Then I'll go out first

160
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,480
Be careful when you are away

161
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,759
Don't worry, I'm here

162
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,759
Bon Voyage

163
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,480
Qiu Xianer

164
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,600
What did she tell you

165
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,399
She turned her hands to make the clouds turn to make the rain

166
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,039
Everything that happened in my life was because of her

167
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,480
life

168
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,879
It's all in your hands

169
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,759
Never control others

170
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,039
Can I

171
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,000
Ask you another question

172
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:53,679
If you don't want to answer

173
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:54,960
I'm Gu Chaochao

174
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,320
After all, I'm a woman

175
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,279
Although there is no reality between men and women

176
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,879
but

177
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:08,120
It's reasonable that you have something to worry about in your heart

178
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,480
If you want revenge

179
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:11,799
I'll make your knife

180
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,159
But there is no knife in this world who is afraid of blood

181
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,159
Your timid therapy has done a good job

182
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:30,240
I'm no longer afraid of blood now

183
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,000
now

184
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,399
Then there is

185
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:55,840
Still a stupid knife

186
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:06,679
You can't wait a moment

187
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,240
My subordinates have been waiting for a long time

188
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,799
how long

189
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,000
from

190
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,720
You want revenge

191
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,360
I'll start to make your knife

192
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,440
Say it

193
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,679
What's wrong

194
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,039
Follow the orders of the marquis

195
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,600
The subordinates have already collected Zhao Peng's account book

196
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,600
All reviews have been completed

197
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:25,879
Will be in the army that year

198
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,759
The names of soldiers who had money dealing with him were recorded

199
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,320
The list is here

200
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,440
All are there

201
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,080
Xiliang

202
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,240
There was also an urgent report from the palace this morning

203
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,519
The Hu people led their troops to attack Xiliang overnight

204
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,759
The Hu people have lived in barbarian places for a long time

205
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:55,360
In the past, every winter

206
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,840
They lack winter supplies

207
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,799
Everyone wants to drive the horse across the river to steal it

208
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,200
Fortunately, the old marquis

209
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,480
Fortunately, some people led their troops to fight

210
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:05,159
The Hu people returned home in a defeat

211
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,360
Set a rule of non-invasion with the Hu people

212
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,559
Unexpectedly

213
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:10,360
They broke the contract and made a comeback

214
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,559
Really shameless

215
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,120
The Hu people led three thousand cavalrymen

216
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,559
Surrounded by 6,000 people from Xiliang Mountain Gate

217
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:22,840
I want to cede 45,000 acres of good land

218
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,480
Exchange hostages

219
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:26,360
Take control first

220
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,759
Later, it is made by others

221
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,840
I am willing to lead five thousand cavalry to the mountain gate immediately

222
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,559
Exit the Hu people from Xiliang

223
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:35,879
Zhou Shilang

224
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,399
What do you think

225
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,039
Xuanying Hou's heart of worrying about the country and the people

226
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,200
I admire you very much

227
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,799
Just spending 5,000 elite troops to rescue 6,000 civilians

228
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,320
Are there some

229
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,840
Not worth it

230
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,200
Mr. Zhou’s doubts

231
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,840
Not without reason

232
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,759
lady

233
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,320
Gu Lang

234
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:05,200
lady

235
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,000
Gu Lang

236
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,639
lady

237
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:09,759
I heard you died of that mountain collapse

238
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,679
I wanted to follow you

239
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,480
Fortunately, the little master visited in time

240
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:17,399
Tell me about your hiding in the Medicine King Valley

241
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,919
And brought me here

242
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,000
At home

243
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,639
As the little master said

244
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,799
All servants have been dismissed

245
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,159
Someone asked

246
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,919
I said I wanted to go out for a relaxing time

247
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,120
That's good

248
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,720
Little Master

249
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,399
Thank you

250
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,600
Please get up for two

251
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,200
This is not my own contribution

252
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,679
No need to thank me like that

253
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,159
All the shops are ready

254
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:44,120
It's sold all night as you say

255
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,279
All the money is in this baggage

256
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,279
Little Master

257
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,200
What are the instructions of the lady

258
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,240
Suwen Yaowang Valley is famous

259
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:58,840
But no one in the world knows where it is

260
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,679
Now we are fleeing here

261
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,440
Leave your daughter alone in Beijing

262
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,159
After all, blood is thicker than water

263
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,240
I can't worry about her

264
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I don't know the little master

265
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:08,519
Can you make an exception

266
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,039
Tell her where we are

267
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,840
Qiu Xian'er is your goddaughter

268
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,440
Then this daughter who is thicker than water

269
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:19,679
Who is it

270
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,759
I'm confused

271
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,840
Since the death

272
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,799
I always thought she was by my side

273
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,919
Little Master

274
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,320
These silver notes are for you to transfer

275
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,480
As a thank you

276
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,279
Who should I hand over to

277
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,360
She's here in the future

278
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,919
It's not too late to say it

279
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,879
Rest assured, both of you

280
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,159
I'll deliver it to you

281
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,080
I'm sorry for you

282
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,919
Tens of millions

283
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,559
Take care of yourself

284
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,599
Didn't sleep well last night

285
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,119
Within half an hour

286
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,559
You've yawned thirteen

287
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:13,720
いました

288
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:16,440
I had a dream last night

289
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,240
Hundreds of thousands of cavalry set foot on Runan

290
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,759
Sea of blood

291
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
Broken bones

292
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:24,640
Maybe it's a nightmare

293
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,559
I'll help you find some medicines to calm the mind.

294
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,039
Sometimes I have dreams

295
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,079
Sometimes I dream of the future

296
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:36,559
But recently I've been increasingly confused

297
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,559
Which one is a dream

298
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:38,480
Which is the future
