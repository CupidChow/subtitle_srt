1
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,159
Qingyang thought about the old love

2
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,320
Can't bear to kill you

3
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,120
Evicted from the capital

4
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,319
Never return to Beijing

5
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,879
You came back to find me

6
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,000
You're very brave

7
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,200
Mrs. Qiu

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,879
The princess's words and deeds over the years

9
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,079
Likes and dislikes

10
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,879
I've told you all

11
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:22,200
It also blocked the disaster for you

12
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:24,640
I'm here to remind you

13
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:26,760
Remember to fulfill your past promises

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,000
You said

15
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,640
if only

16
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,760
shut your mouth

17
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,640
I guarantee you wealth and glory for half your life

18
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,079
I've got the carriage and horse ready

19
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,439
You'll leave the city tonight

20
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,599
Mrs. Qiu is so anxious

21
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,680
Is it a guilty thief

22
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,719
You said I

23
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,359
Being a thief is guilty

24
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,200
On that day, Mrs. Ji believed that you were applying poison on your cuffs

25
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,120
Intentionally harming Princess Qingyang

26
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,680
If I want to testify for Mrs. Ji

27
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,079
Don't know

28
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,120
How much will she give me

29
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,560
Tell me straight

30
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,199
How much more do you want

31
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,039
Want me out of town

32
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,280
You should prepare a house where I stay

33
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,800
Have a house

34
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,680
Then you should hire three or five more servants

35
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,159
Clean up my living room

36
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,520
There must be servants

37
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,400
There is a constant stream of money in your hands

38
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,000
Forgot to tell you

39
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,800
I have very little patience

40
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,039
Not even half a stick of incense

41
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,000
What's wrong

42
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,479
Husband

43
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:04,400
Stupid gourd

44
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,080
What's the point of doing

45
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,719
You're awake

46
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,039
I'm awake

47
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:10,400
I'm tired

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,080
Tell me a joke

49
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,400
Have you ever eaten lotus root box

50
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,240
Lotus root meat

51
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:18,680
Fry it in oil

52
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,280
Taste is pretty good

53
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,960
Then do you know how it came about

54
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,879
have no idea

55
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,879
how come

56
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,599
A long time ago

57
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,879
Nezha offended the Dragon King

58
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,039
Self-destruction and crime

59
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,159
Taiyi Zhenren is looking for lotus root

60
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,680
Made his body

61
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,680
King Zhou cooked and killed Bo Yikao

62
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,759
Made into meat soup

63
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:40,680
Give it to his father, King Wen of Zhou

64
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,080
This day

65
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,120
Bo Yikao and Nezha had a quarrel in the Heavenly Court

66
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,240
Fight a ball

67
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,960
Turned into a lotus box

68
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,280
I will never eat lotus root boxes again

69
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,879
I have a story about lotus cakes

70
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:53,879
alright

71
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,360
Let's talk about something serious

72
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,759
How do you plan afterwards

73
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,360
Go to Suizhou

74
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,879
Suizhou has frequent rain and floods in summer

75
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,120
You're going there

76
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,039
My father was falsely treasoned and engaging in the enemy

77
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,360
Execute to death

78
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,360
None of my confidants are spared

79
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:11,960
When I go to collect the body

80
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,879
Only one person can't be found

81
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,919
The body of a young man named Wang Bowei

82
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,759
I suspect he knows the inside story

83
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,040
Find its whereabouts for many years

84
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,000
But nothing has been found

85
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:23,600
But in recent days

86
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,959
I've received a secret report

87
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,639
He is in Suizhou

88
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,040
He has long been hiding his name

89
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,399
Makeover

90
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,199
If you want to go to Suizhou

91
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,319
You have to be famous

92
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,160
Disaster Relief

93
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:42,680
Many counties and counties in Suizhou have broken dams

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
People are displaced without food

95
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,240
Major issues of people's livelihood are urgent

96
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,480
I hope your Majesty will send someone to you

97
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,319
Three years ago

98
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:56,360
I have appointed Song Hongjian to provide disaster relief

99
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,920
Less than half a month

100
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,360
He then stolen himself

101
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,800
Leave only one confession

102
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,680
The water depth of Suizhou is unfathomable

103
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,720
Jiang Shangshu

104
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,600
In your opinion

105
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,839
Who can do this job

106
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:18,720
Zhou Junlan is now at the peak of his life in the court

107
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,240
I'm afraid the imperial envoy

108
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,959
It's already his belongings

109
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,360
but

110
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,639
The water is full and overflows

111
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,439
The moon is full and the loss

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,040
Young and powerful

113
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,680
Instead, it will cause His Majesty's concern

114
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,879
You're uncomfortable

115
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
I'm just thinking

116
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,360
If you want to go to Suizhou

117
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,079
Then I'll go too

118
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:47,920
Why

119
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,600
An imperial envoy died in Suizhou before

120
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,959
You go alone

121
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm a little worried

122
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,040
Thank you

123
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,800
What are you thanking

124
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,800
Niangzi Ji Zhong Lingyuxiu

125
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,720
Ice and Snow Smart

126
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,800
Don't abandon me, a stray dog

127
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,600
I'll do you to work hard

128
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,680
Help me always

129
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,879
The Marquis is so serious

130
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,360
I did this

131
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,759
Not to save you

132
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,920
Just save yourself

133
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,240
Wish you know the details

134
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:23,319
Junlan

135
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,199
The past cannot be pursued

136
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,040
Why bother to mention it again

137
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,959
The Marquis just needs to remember

138
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,399
I'll help you gain power, but there's another idea.

139
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,240
Not for you

140
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,120
But you use it for me

141
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:42,879
It's me who said nothing

142
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,720
Xian'er

143
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,560
Isn't this a gift you gave to Qingyang?

144
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,040
yes

145
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,439
She's back

146
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,480
Why

147
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,040
Maybe it's because of Ji Yunchao

148
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,079
Have a grudge against me

149
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,240
Don't you care

150
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:11,079
Didn't you say that she had the imperial edict in her hand?

151
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:13,000
Maybe it will help us in the future

152
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,399
why are you laughing

153
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,600
Can't laugh

154
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,600
One hour ago

155
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,399
You killed Qingyang's maid on a whim

156
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,839
I'll help you with good deeds

157
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,519
You're not afraid of the news.

158
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:27,800
Not afraid of unjust souls seeking life

159
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,120
You can still laugh

160
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,920
My good husband

161
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,639
Don't I know you yet

162
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,279
The Secretariat of the Court

163
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,879
How could the life of an ant be chaotic

164
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,680
You're just afraid

165
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:48,240
Pei Yan robs you of your disaster relief worker

166
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,040
Your Majesty is afraid that I am too powerful

167
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,199
But the disaster relief in Suizhou is urgently needed

168
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,759
No one in the court

169
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,639
He should have to send me there

170
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,319
Just as Pei Yan came out

171
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,120
Can't you understand the future

172
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,360
Tomorrow's face

173
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,399
Who can go to Suizhou to provide disaster relief by me or Pei Yan?

174
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,680
I can understand the future

175
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:12,720
But what I know is deviating

176
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,279
Offset

177
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,639
Why

178
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,560
Butterfly effect

179
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,800
What does it mean

180
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,000
A butterfly shakes its wings

181
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,519
It may cause a storm thousands of miles away

182
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,639
A small change

183
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,519
It will cause unexpected developments

184
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,519
Who changed

185
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,480
Gu Chaochao

186
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,080
I'm that butterfly

187
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,879
She was created by me personally

188
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,399
storm

189
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,000
Enough

190
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,879
Stop laughing

191
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,039
You're ordering me

192
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,320
I'm just

193
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,120
lol

194
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:02,799
Xian'er

195
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,639
Laugh until I'm satisfied

196
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,000
I have to teach you everything

197
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,799
Do I need to teach you how to laugh

198
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:28,879
Kneel down

199
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:38,799
good

200
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:40,799
Come

201
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,600
Open your eyes

202
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,960
You said you were a dog of a family

203
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,200
Not as good as

204
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,639
Let me join forces

205
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,000
Join forces

206
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,639
What can you give me

207
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,279
いました

208
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,639
As long as you and I join forces

209
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,759
I will help you get what you want

210
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,200
Going forward

211
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,080
interesting

212
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,279
I want to go to Suizhou

213
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,480
No way to go

214
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,000
How can you help me

215
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,240
Suizhou disaster relief urgently needs talents

216
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:34,000
But Shangshu Jiang would not recommend Zhou Junlan

217
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,480
Because this

218
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,519
Your Majesty will suspect that he is in contact with powerful officials

219
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,519
He won't shirk responsibility

220
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:42,480
Because in this way, Your Majesty will suspect that he is disobedient

221
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,279
He will only recommend those in the Korean Central

222
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,519
The least powerful person

223
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:46,519
What a coincidence

224
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:48,080
You are one of them

225
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,679
What's more coincidental is

226
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,080
Jiang Yue, his daughter

227
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,639
Owe me personal affection

228
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,480
He recommends me

229
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:57,279
Your Majesty may not use me, either

230
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:00,120
Master Hou

231
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,440
Your Majesty summons you to the palace to meet you tomorrow

232
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,039
As long as you can meet the saint

233
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,200
There is a chance

234
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,039
Who gave the opportunity

235
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:14,080
Zhou Junlan, Secretary of the Secretariat of Xuanzhong

236
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,519
Xuanying Hou Pei Yan meets

237
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:38,720
I'm paying homage to your majesty

238
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:47,720
As long as you can meet the saint

239
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,440
There is a chance

240
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,039
Who gave the opportunity

241
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,240
Prince

242
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:52,679
Prince

243
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:53,559
Have you forgotten

244
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:54,879
Your Majesty doesn't know

245
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,320
You saved the prince's life

246
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,320
what would you like

247
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,159
I'll help you to rise to the top

248
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,720
You are my ladder to climb the sky

249
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:07,679
Why climb to the sky

250
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,799
Climbing the sky

251
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,240
The god

252
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,039
Just flat

253
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:21,519
Father

254
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:22,279
It's him

255
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,799
He is the son minister's benefactor

256
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,679
Give it to him

257
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:33,879
Why

258
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,039
You're angry

259
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,039
So cute

260
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,519
Why

261
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,879
It's always Pei Yan

262
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,360
good

263
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,559
Suizhou is a dragon pond and tiger cave

264
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,919
This trip will definitely call him

265
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,720
Go but never return

266
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,440
What are you giggling stupidly

267
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,960
Ji Yunchao

268
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,200
What's wrong

269
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:44,120
Why did he follow

270
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,440
He has excellent medical skills

271
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:51,000
The critical moment can solve the urgent problem

272
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:57,759
That's it

273
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,759
The hardships of the boat are very boring

274
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,759
いました

275
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:03,600
Do you have any jokes

276
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,240
he

277
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,360
Can tell jokes

278
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,679
Doctor Ji

279
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,559
Do you like eating lotus root boxes

280
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:11,879
like

281
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,279
By the way

282
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:16,279
I've brought a few more

283
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,720
Come to Yunchao

284
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,759
Eat while it's hot

285
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:19,919
I won't eat it anymore

286
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:22,519
Then I'll eat it

287
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,240
By the way

288
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:29,759
What jokes did you say you were going to tell

289
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,399
Legend

290
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,679
A long time ago

291
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:36,919
Nezha offended the Dragon King

292
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,679
Self-destruction and crime

293
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:46,120
I will never eat lotus root boxes again

294
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,720
Master Hou

295
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,399
A little bit simple

296
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:03,120
There are places where care is not done

297
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,360
Please forgive me, marquis

298
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,639
I'm here to help Zhao County Magistrate

299
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:06,799
Master Hou

300
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,519
Is there anything to do

301
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:11,080
Just tell Ah Yuan to do it

302
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:14,639
please

303
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,080
Where did the people come?

304
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,919
Hurry up

305
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:45,960
Open the door

306
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:47,000
Open the door

307
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,440
Fire-fighting water

308
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:50,320
Open the door

309
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,279
Is anyone

310
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,480
Where is the person coming

311
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:54,799
On fire

312
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:55,759
Come here, where are you

313
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,159
Put out the fire quickly

314
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:01,759
Open the door

315
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:04,279
Open the door

316
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,480
Put out the fire quickly

317
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,120
A few more people go there to help

318
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,679
Hurry up and get water to help

319
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:28,879
Go there quickly

320
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:29,799
Hurry up

321
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:31,440
Yunchao

322
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:32,360
Master Hou

323
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,639
Yunchao cannot enter

324
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:34,360
You let go

325
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,519
An imperial envoy has died in Suizhou

326
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:38,600
You can't tell me to leave here too

327
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,440
Let me go

328
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,919
No, Mr. Hou

329
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,159
Yunchao

330
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,120
Master Hou
