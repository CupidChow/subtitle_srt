Ding Dynasty

2
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,200
I was waiting to die in a mass grave back then

3
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,120
You saved me

4
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,879
Your dad and my mother treat me as her own

5
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,319
Now you're going to get married

6
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,840
Can I ask you something else

7
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:22,159
certainly

8
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,480
As long as I have

9
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,319
I want

10
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,079
Your life

11
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,000
Ding Dynasty

00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:41,599
Junlan

13
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,319
You're poisoned

14
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,319
I'm not seriously poisoned

15
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,239
I just released blood

16
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,560
Take me to the clinic quickly

17
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,159
good

18
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,079
Xian'er

19
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,719
God won't bless me

20
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,719
My life cannot be controlled by me

21
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,120
But I'm a gu Chaochao

22
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,439
Even if the body dies and souls are destroyed

23
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,719
Turn into a ghost

24
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,639
I will never let you go

25
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,680
Hurry up

26
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,039
Congratulations to Zhou Sheren for being promoted to the Secretariat of the Secretariat

27
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,919
Only one step away from the Central Secretariat

28
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,120
Zhou Sheren

29
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,960
No, no, no, no,

30
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,639
Now I am deeply loved by the holy people

31
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,759
I also have a deep love with my wife

32
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,840
We really envious

33
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,800
Yeah yeah

34
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,240
Thanks to the Lord's grace

35
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,599
Helping colleagues

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,039
Zhou should do his best to serve the country

37
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,159
Live up to expectations

38
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:04,919
Please

39
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,120
Zhou Shilang

40
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,560
The wine is coming

41
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,159
Where is this jar placed

42
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,080
yes

43
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,199
Please use it slowly

44
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,639
Thank you very much

45
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,039
Dear nobles, please use it slowly

46
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,759
OK OK OK

47
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:21,840
Please please please please please

48
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,680
Fang Shopkeeper

49
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,159
Master Hou

50
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,680
What are the two oasis of frost moon white that I ordered?

51
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:34,879
Thank you, marquis

52
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,919
Today, the Japanese Pavilion Frost Moon White has been sold out

53
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,960
We've been here for a whole day

54
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,400
You're just saying it's sold out now

55
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,800
What's more, you also charged our deposit

56
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:43,840
How can you turn your back on your word

57
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,199
Small ones can be returned twice

58
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,199
you

59
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,719
never mind

60
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,159
Let's go

61
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,319
Today should be the old marquis's taboo day

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,319
Marquis Xuanying is going to worship the old Marquis

63
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,000
Zhou Shilang

64
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:04,960
I heard that the old marquis loved to drink frost moon white most during his lifetime

65
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:05,960
Just right

66
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,360
There is still a jar left in the house

67
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:09,159
I'd like to give it to Mr. Xuan Ying

68
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,560
Talk about your feelings

69
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,079
Sorry, Mr. Hou

70
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,120
What a pity

71
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:30,680
However, the old marquis colluded with the enemy and asked to kill him

72
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,160
I'm afraid I've become an enemy ghost

73
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,639
This wine sprinkled on the land of this dynasty

74
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:38,839
I'm afraid the old marquis won't be able to drink it

75
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,600
There is still some leftover wine here

76
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,639
Let's take it by Xuanying

77
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,480
Not taken

78
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:56,040
The Marquis was dissatisfied with Mr. Zhou's blunt advice.

79
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,199
The crime of impeaching the old marquis

80
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,279
Or convict your Majesty of the Old Marquis

81
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,000
Feeling unfair

82
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,560
Your Majesty is kind

83
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,480
Thinking of the past achievements of the Pei family

84
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,720
Parliament Pei Lang inherits the title

85
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,959
This grace can be said to be high and thick

86
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,800
How could Xuan Ying Hou be unfair

87
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,319
People are filial

88
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,319
Don't joke, husband

89
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,439
Then thank Mr. Zhou for giving the wine

90
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,639
The sound of the piano is as quiet as crying

91
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,720
Like a ghost complaining about the wrong

92
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,319
As firm as golden spears intersect

93
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,000
There is a sound of unfairness

94
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,319
Sharp and exciting

95
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,959
There is a momentum of both jade and stone burning

96
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,839
Gu Chaochao

97
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,000
Xian'er

98
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,199
This lady is so strange

99
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,079
I don't want my own veil

100
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:50,600
Master Hou

101
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,199
There is a customer who has a pot of frost and moon white

102
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,600
Ask Xiao to hand it over to Master Hou

103
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,680
Very good

104
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,800
No need

105
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,000
Can find out the details

106
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,079
The woman's name is Ji Yunchao

107
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,000
Opened a medical clinic in the suburbs of the city

108
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,799
Sister Chaochao is really

109
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,120
I thought I had a name

110
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,639
I just met each other and didn't know each other

111
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,000
Just right

112
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,320
I've missed her a little lately

113
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:44,960
Xian'er

114
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,159
You're simple-minded

115
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,039
Be careful of her

116
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,000
Be careful about what

117
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,480
I haven't harmed her

118
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,399
It was Sister Chaochao

119
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,399
I've run away from marriage with a foreign man

120
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,480
Sister Chaochao

121
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,039
This doesn't hurt

122
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,360
Don't struggle

123
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,960
Stop hurting

124
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,440
Don't come here

125
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,039
Ding Dynasty

126
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,720
Junlan

127
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,320
You're poisoned

128
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,600
Take me to the clinic quickly

129
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,120
good

130
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,840
Xian'er

131
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,320
Junlan, you

132
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,159
Very nice hair bun

133
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,080
From now on, you can comb for me every day

134
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,240
good

135
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,039
Not good or bad

136
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,519
The bride regrets marriage

137
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,320
What's wrong

138
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,519
Eloped with the outsider

139
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,240
What did you say

140
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,080
Why did you elope

141
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,519
Lang Jun

142
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,200
You're okay, Langjun

143
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:34,360
Five years of wind and frost sharpen bones

144
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,200
Return to Beijing this time

145
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,120
New hatred and old hatred

146
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,759
Vow to flatten

147
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,759
This is our signature pearl milk tea

148
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,639
It is exclusively developed by our boss Mrs. Qiu

149
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:56,879
Please use it slowly

150
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,759
Your boss invites me here

151
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,200
What exactly is

152
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,200
The boss said he wanted to talk about the old friends

153
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:05,840
My first time in Beijing

154
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,600
What's the old story

155
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,919
This little one is not clear

156
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:10,919
Please use it slowly

157
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,360
If it weren't for your father's forced

158
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,120
How could I see you

159
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,799
Let the Lord be guilty

160
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,679
The Marquis made no achievements

161
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,879
Even disliked by the emperor

162
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:23,480
Therefore no one dares to marry you

163
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,159
Niangzi Jiang is the jewel of Jiang Shangshu

164
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,240
Pei has no choice

165
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,159
The royal family is indeed a matter of no matter how far away from the family

166
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,840
But although Zhou Junlan, Zhou Langjun came from a poor family

167
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,399
Rely on nothing but work hard

168
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,720
The Queen of Xuanying is the royal relative

169
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,639
Pampering life

170
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:43,960
But nothing happened

171
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,399
Pei received teaching

172
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,240
Mr. Zhou is indeed young and promising

173
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,519
nature

174
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,759
I Jiang Yue

175
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,799
Need a man of such an outstanding one

176
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,919
Just a man like that

177
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,919
Naturally, there are better women with red sleeves to add fragrance

178
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,159
What are we doing here

179
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,519
Watch the show

180
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,080
Gu Chaochao

181
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,559
You've actually returned to Beijing

182
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:26,720
The young master recognized the wrong person

183
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,919
You ran away with me when you were married.

184
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:31,080
how

185
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:33,799
Have you forgotten your old lover

186
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,799
After you're elopement with me

187
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,480
The person next to the pillow has changed one after another

188
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,080
Come back now

189
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,440
Do you still want to be your branch back

190
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,080
A slut who abandoned Zhou Shigong

191
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,360
There is still face to come back

192
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,360
Wild grass in the mud

193
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,519
How to compare with Mrs. Qiu

194
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:56,799
Non-goods

195
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,120
What are the high and low

196
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,600
Yeah

197
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,639
But I'm not good enough

198
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,360
Clouds and cypresses show in the forest

199
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,159
Can be my opinion

200
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,080
Lying in the mud through the cold winter

201
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,720
Wild grass that can burn the prairie

202
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,080
Not inferior to the vitality of spring

203
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,639
I'm not Gu Chaochao

204
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,679
If what you said just now is true

205
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,360
According to our court laws

206
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:23,879
A good girl elopes

207
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,600
Fifty whip

208
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,320
Enfessed guilty in the blue sky

209
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,879
It's for arrogance and ignorance

210
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,960
Slandering the Fame of Women

211
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,360
It's for despicable deeds

212
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,639
So what you said just now

213
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,159
Do you still dare to recognize it

214
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:38,919
I

215
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:48,600
I dare

216
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:49,279
good

217
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:51,200
Then let's go to court to confront each other

218
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,159
I'm just being beaten

219
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:54,159
And you

220
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,639
As a woman, she will be executed

221
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:57,519
Do you dare

222
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:58,879
I'm not her

223
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,159
What dare I not

224
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:02,039
How do you prove that you are not

225
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,600
It's you who offends for no reason

226
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,000
You are also slandering out of thin air

227
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,480
Why do I prove myself

228
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,559
Now you need to show evidence

229
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:12,440
Or you can kneel down and beg me for forgiveness

230
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,679
Otherwise you will have another serious crime

231
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,480
What sin

232
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:18,840
A frivolous and beautiful girl

233
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,759
Twenty rods

234
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,240
If this woman is engaged

235
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,559
One hundred ridge sticks

236
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,120
you

237
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,159
How could you have an engagement

238
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,200
My fiancé

239
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,159
No matter talent, appearance, character

240
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:33,240
All are first class

241
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,080
Compared to him, others are all

242
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,279
Toad

243
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:45,600
My parents have found so many talented guys for you

244
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:46,679
What do you call someone

245
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,039
Toad

246
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,120
Such a talented man

247
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,720
Who do you think it is

248
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,080
Let's lie

249
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:03,799
It's indeed a lie

250
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,080
Don't be fooled by her

251
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:09,840
Xuanying Hou Pei Yan
