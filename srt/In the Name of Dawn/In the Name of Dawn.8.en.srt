1
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,600
Marquis let me go

2
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:00,240
Yunchao

3
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,039
I'm here

4
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:28,760
Nightmare

5
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:44,200
When is it time

6
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,599
Five minutes of the Yin hour

7
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,359
You've been sleeping for an hour

8
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,319
Someone seems to have promised me

9
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,879
Will wake me up after half an incense stick

10
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,920
I didn't break my promise

11
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,879
I've called

12
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:58,079
But you slept soundly at that time

13
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,040
In my dream, I still fist and kicked him

14
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,120
And he's harsh to me

15
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,239
Scream

16
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,359
roll

17
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,639
Fortunately, Xuanying Hou didn't have a good dream to kill someone

18
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,280
Otherwise, I will be with Yunchao

19
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,120
It's going to be broken in Suizhou

20
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:14,919
Feel sorry

21
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,919
I'm in a hurry

22
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,560
Thanks to her

23
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,439
Wake up

24
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,560
Wake up

25
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:34,919
Wake up

26
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,639
Don't sleep

27
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,319
Come with me

28
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,199
Master Hou

29
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,199
Master Hou

30
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,479
Two doctors

31
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,800
You guys are fine

32
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,960
Last night, the fire in the prefecture

33
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,360
I'm going to pay for it.

34
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,319
Not as good as

35
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,319
Let's talk about the main thing first

36
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,199
The yamen has a lot of things to do

37
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,400
Don't know the Marquis

38
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,360
Which important thing to talk about

39
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:19,000
Then talk about the fire last night

40
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:20,840
Suizhou has rained for several days

41
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,759
Houses are wet and not dry

42
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:26,240
A fire broke out on the day I stayed

43
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,759
This is not a natural disaster

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,599
But

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,080
It's a man-made disaster

46
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,439
reasonable

47
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,439
The county government gate opens at the Mao hour and closes at the Xu hour and closes at the Xu hour and

48
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,599
There are yamen runners on duty at night

49
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,479
Anyone who enters and leaves must report

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,759
And fire

51
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,919
It's from the hour of Hai

52
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,080
Someone was in and out of the county yamen last night

53
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,680
Never

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,280
It's noon now

55
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,599
The county government gate has not opened

56
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,520
No one came in and out of the county yamen last night

57
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,719
The fire-making man is in the yamen

58
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,479
Just now, the official ordered someone to search carefully

59
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,520
No outsiders hiding in the county

60
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,520
That is to say

61
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,680
Here is

62
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,479
Insider

63
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,439
Get it

64
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,240
Thanks

65
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,240
Slower

66
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,399
Thanks

67
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:27,959
Get it

68
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:28,839
Thanks

69
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,319
What's wrong

70
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,800
A woman fainted from hunger at my clinic

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,879
I'll get a bowl of porridge

72
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:38,040
Disaster relief food allocated by the imperial court

73
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,879
Enough to support the people of Suizhou

74
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,639
At least half a month's rations

75
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,920
Why are there still people

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,800
Babies

77
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,560
You dare to grab the porridge

78
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,319
You've drunk three bowls

79
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,279
These gangsters are domineering

80
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,360
Even though I have enough porridge, I still have to grab someone else's

81
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,600
The county magistrate told us before

82
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,319
Only one bowl a day

83
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,439
But

84
00:04:58,839 --> 00:04:59,759
Give only one bowl of porridge

85
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,079
They want to grab someone else's porridge to drink

86
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,920
The heart of the magistrate of Zhao County

87
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,959
But there are few thunder methods

88
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,639
Kill the chicken to scare the monkey

89
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,439
That's all

90
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:16,920
Who is it

91
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,480
Come out for me

92
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,240
I'll do it

93
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:21,439
Trust me

94
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,639
Is it you

95
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:24,759
It's me

96
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,439
Your dart is poisonous

97
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,920
You'd better not act rashly

98
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,439
Why should I believe you

99
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,519
Do you feel you've started to have abdominal pain

100
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:44,920
I was wrong

101
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,439
Can you save me

102
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,480
Move after fullness

103
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,240
You will definitely have abdominal pain

104
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,319
It will be fine in a while

105
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,879
You dare to fool me

106
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:58,240
If you dare to cause trouble again

107
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,439
I can't guarantee

108
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,040
Will your porridge be poisonous?

109
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,480
You wait for me

110
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,519
This is a good porridge

111
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,600
Why do you want to mix sand in it?

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,040
I thought this lady was a good person

113
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,560
Unexpectedly

114
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,079
He doesn't matter how

115
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:55,399
yes

116
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,360
Master Hou

117
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:58,600
You are

118
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,240
Disaster Relief

119
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,079
When you wake up, drink a bowl of porridge

120
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,000
Thanks

121
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,120
The bride regrets marriage

122
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,279
Eloped with the outsider

123
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,639
you

124
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,639
What's wrong

125
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:27,879
Who are you

126
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,199
I'm Ji Yunchao

127
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,639
Doctor of Ji's clinic

128
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,600
Ji Yunchao

129
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,519
What else do you feel uncomfortable

130
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,720
I'll give you another pulse

131
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,240
there is none left

132
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,600
No need

133
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,720
The rest

134
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,160
Then I'll have some hard work

135
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,439
Don't worry

136
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,360
I'll handle it

137
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,480
Long time no see

138
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,679
You wake up

139
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,000
I dreamed

140
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,840
abdomen

141
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,879
Stomachache

142
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,320
What a crazy thing you do

143
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,679
Not sleeping in the middle of the night

144
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:10,840
It's her

145
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:12,440
She's back

146
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,799
She's back

147
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,480
Thanks to the doctor

148
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,080
She mixes sand into the porridge

149
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,080
Those who drink full of gangsters find it troublesome to vomit sand

150
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,960
Then it scattered

151
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:24,879
People who couldn't get the porridge before

152
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,440
There is porridge to drink

153
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,200
If I'm tired, you can step down

154
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,879
And the arsonist

155
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,759
I've found a way to test him

156
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,200
This method is called "Snake Lie Testing"

157
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,519
Just get a jar

158
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,519
Yan'er

159
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,360
Dad is tired

160
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,159
You retreat

161
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,000
yes

162
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,960
First time

163
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,399
Then he showed his sharpness

164
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,639
Doesn't it seem like my county magistrate is incompetent?

165
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:13,080
Not only is your ultimate foolish

166
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,960
Still jealous of the virtuous

167
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,519
Who

168
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,480
Of course it is

169
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:30,600
Great beauty

170
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:33,279
Come

171
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:35,720
Stay in the place where the spring flowers are

172
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,879
Twenty-seven taels

173
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,519
Feast for the King of the King

174
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,600
County Magistrate Zhao is really old

175
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,360
Monthly sleeping

176
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,120
Thirteen times

177
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:52,480
No wonder this kidney deficiency

178
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,840
Give me the account book

179
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,399
Give me my account book

180
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,799
Scream more

181
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,120
Let the son come in and listen

182
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:25,879
Listen to his father's yin and yang account book

183
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,279
Who are you

184
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,279
Why is it here

185
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,000
How could you know these things

186
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,039
you guess

187
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,759
I've remembered

188
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,600
I've seen you

189
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,720
You are Mr. Zhou’s wife

190
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,080
you

191
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,679
I

192
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,080
It's God

193
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:05,799
absurd

194
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:09,120
How could there be a god in this world

195
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,399
If there is no God

196
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,799
You dreamed of it at midnight

197
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,159
The ghost of the old marquis and Song Hongjian

198
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,559
When you come and take your life

199
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:05,360
Who blessed you

200
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,639
Where did you know these things

201
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,240
God knows everything

202
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,840
omnipotent

203
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:21,159
Then tell me

204
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:23,519
Official

205
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:26,240
What to do

206
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,120
Why not use the same trick again

207
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:46,879
All the sand and gravel in her belly have been spit out

208
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,840
Don't feed again

209
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:48,960
Thanks

210
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,799
Thank you, Doctor

211
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:50,960
Thank you, Doctor

212
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,080
Come slower

213
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:59,240
Save me

214
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,840
Don't panic at the auntie

215
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,200
Tell me about your illness

216
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:03,960
Years ago

217
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,120
I accidentally encountered a murderous case

218
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:07,559
For self-protection

219
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:09,399
Just now, I'm accused of a tiger

220
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:12,799
Now it's hard to sleep and eat every night

221
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,639
Injury

222
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,679
You're suffering from hysteria

223
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,519
Need to take pills to calm the mind

224
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:21,000
It's me that was wrong

225
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:23,080
I had no choice but to

226
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,879
Chaihu Codonopsis and Scutellaria baicalensis

227
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,879
You recognize me, right?

228
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,759
That's why you poison the porridge

229
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,720
Give me abdominal pain

230
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,279
Force me to come to you

231
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,480
I am coming

232
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,759
Guizhi Fuling

233
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,200
Take it in water

234
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,840
How could you understand medical skills?

235
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,480
You're not Gu Chaochao

236
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:00,320
Who is Gu Chaochao

237
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:04,600
nothing

238
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,039
Thank you, Doctor

239
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:07,799
etc.

240
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,639
The wounds on your face need medicine.

241
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,159
Remember

242
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,480
This medicine cannot be taken internally

243
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,960
There will be life-threatening

244
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:23,519
besides

245
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,879
Your abdominal pain is gone

246
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,519
I don't feel much pain now

247
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:32,720
That's just right

248
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:34,919
Today's pain relief medicine has just been delivered

249
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:37,399
You can pick it up at this time tomorrow

250
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:44,320
doctor

251
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,559
My stomach is uncomfortable

252
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,919
Please help me see

253
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,159
I heard that the rice prices in Suizhou have suddenly soared recently

254
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:56,799
Does Zhao County Magistrate know why?

255
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,679
I'm very surprised, too

256
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,960
I hope the marquis will give me some advice

257
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,519
Your Majesty sent me to the south

258
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,240
I guess someone is secretly causing trouble

259
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,159
Join forces with local wealthy gentry to raise the price of rice

260
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:10,000
Want to take the opportunity to be with His Majesty

261
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,279
Refer to my book

262
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,679
Who dares to act so boldly

263
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,919
Who is it

264
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,639
Zhao County Magistrate

265
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,000
Xuan Yinghou

266
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,639
County rice prices soar

267
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,000
People can't eat

268
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,720
I am afraid

269
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,360
Retreat

270
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,080
But

271
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,399
Didn't see the Marquis and me

272
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:28,840
Are you talking about something important?

273
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,720
Retreat

274
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,600
This little yamen runner is a kind and righteous man

275
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,799
Master Hou

276
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,679
This is the price of rice

277
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,720
What can you do

278
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,399
That will make it rise

279
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,679
Master Hou

280
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:53,039
People are now in dire straits

281
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,759
Do you have the heart to refuse to save me when I die

282
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,159
I have no choice but to do anything

283
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,519
If you die, you will die
