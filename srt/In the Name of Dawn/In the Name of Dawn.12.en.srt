1
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,159
Zhao Peng's mouth was too hard

2
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,960
We've been here for five days

3
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,240
But I can't pry it open

4
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:01,640
now

5
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:02,840
Can only hope for Niangzi Ji

6
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,000
Come back quickly with evidence

7
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,359
You can convict the corrupt official

8
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,359
Prose the Marquis

9
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:10,040
A woman asked for a meeting in front of the county government office

10
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,000
Yunchao

11
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,280
People come and see guests

12
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,480
I went to Jiangnan to get incense for my sister Qingyang

13
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,239
Passing through Suizhou

14
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,920
Come and report a murderous case

15
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,680
A murder case

16
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,799
Ji Yunchao, doctor at Ji's clinic

17
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:46,680
Take care of the lives of two people and kill them in a row

18
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,239
If you are loyal to me

19
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,280
I'll let her go

20
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,480
Alarming

21
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,199
Ji Yunchao, the wife of the Marquis of Xuanying

22
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,280
Take care of the lives of two people and kill them in a row

23
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,159
The wife of the Marquis of Xuanying, Ji Yunchao, takes human life into consideration

24
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:18,919
Killing in a row

25
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,199
Do you have evidence

26
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,039
Niangzi Ji

27
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,039
Where is Xuan Yinghou

28
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:33,919
He went out just now

29
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,159
Where have you gone

30
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,439
let go

31
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,039
Are they afraid

32
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:58,840
Close your eyes if you are afraid

33
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,879
If you join forces

34
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,879
Help Ji Yunchao destroy the evidence of crime

35
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,039
Then you hide behind someone else

36
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,639
But looking at this courtyard

37
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,319
Only you, Marquis

38
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,879
It's best for me

39
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,240
After Ji Yunchao was imprisoned

40
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,759
I'll help you

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,759
how

42
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,639
Long time no see

43
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:29,400
Yunchao

44
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,120
There seems to be a corpse here

45
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,800
The murderer

46
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,840
What should sin be

47
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:45,199
etc.

48
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,800
Just a dummy

49
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,120
Are you planning to frame me

50
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,000
Qiu Xian'er, don't think about it

51
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,399
Don't put away the knife quickly

52
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,120
How are you

53
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:06,839
Ji Xiao

54
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,639
Ji Xiao

55
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,120
Ji Xiao drinks medicine

56
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,920
Sure enough, he's a prodigal

57
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,319
Lanfu

58
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,560
I want to chop firewood

59
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,560
How did you come in?

60
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:50,439
Your son is on duty tonight

61
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:53,160
I told him that I can clear your grievances for you

62
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,040
He let me in

63
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,639
What's the deep love between father and son

64
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,399
Is Ji Yunchao's affairs done?

65
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:04,319
Good news and bad news

66
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:06,000
Which one do you want to listen to first

67
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:08,879
Good news

68
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:11,160
Then I'll tell you the bad news first

69
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:13,279
Ji Yunchao murder case

70
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,800
It's impossible to do it

71
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:18,839
This time she took the lead and destroyed the evidence of crime

72
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:21,199
Then wasn't my suffering in vain?

73
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,120
Are you not a god

74
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,879
Aren't you omnipotent

75
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:25,759
God God

76
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,879
I almost got calluses in my ears

77
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,879
Things change rapidly

78
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,360
There will inevitably be omissions

79
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,600
Ask again

80
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,040
Then he pulled your tongue out

81
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,199
What's the good news

82
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,000
This time, the case was filed for his Majesty.

83
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,240
It's my husband

84
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,279
I guess your evidence of sin is now

85
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,040
In his hands

86
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,439
I'll try to ruin it then

87
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,319
You will never admit it again

88
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,000
Your death book

89
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,759
I sent it to Beijing early again

90
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,800
No physical evidence

91
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:06,759
What crime do you have

92
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,519
Then if it is not destroyed

93
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,480
Court hearing tomorrow

94
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,639
Look at me

95
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,120
Touch the right earlobe

96
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,959
What's going on

97
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,879
Don't know

98
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,120
How many people doshita?

99
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,839
The imperial envoy Song Hongjian left his orphan

100
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,120
Song Ruwan

101
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:49,839
Beat the drum and make injustice

102
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,600
What's going on

103
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:55,199
Three years ago, my father was ordered to go south to Suizhou to provide disaster relief

104
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:58,800
Suizhou County Magistrate Zhao Peng was found to have embezzled and accepted bribes

105
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,439
Collude with local gentry

106
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:01,800
Raise the price of rice

107
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,680
Enjoy your personal bag

108
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,240
How many people have been seized?

109
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,319
Want to report

110
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,279
Zhao Peng asserts the way

111
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,839
Slaughter my Song family

112
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:13,040
Torch many guilty evidence

113
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,319
Lord Zhao has such a thing

114
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,720
Zhao Peng

115
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,839
Do you know the sin

116
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,639
The officials are loyal to the emperor and patriotic to the country

117
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,639
Heart to the whole life

118
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,839
What crime is there

119
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,839
It was clearly Song Hongjian

120
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,959
In private, one pound of rice is exchanged for four pounds of bran

121
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,399
Ming Dynasty to release food for disaster relief

122
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,440
In fact, earn the difference in secret

123
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,679
This was discovered by the officials

124
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,799
Want to submit a report to the court

125
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,720
Song Hongjian realized that death sentence could not be escaped

126
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,120
Burn the mansion

127
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,159
Take poison and commit suicide

128
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,879
Dog official

129
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,200
Don't swear by it

130
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:45,840
I'm squirting

131
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:47,960
Everyone present

132
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,600
Does anyone still remember three years ago

133
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:53,080
Disaster relief food delegated by imperial envoys

134
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,440
Is it rice or bran

135
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,039
It's indeed bran

136
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,679
It turns out there is rice

137
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,879
It's all that Song Hongjian doesn't give us food

138
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,120
One pound of rice for four pounds of bran

139
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,519
The remaining three kilograms of rice

140
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,840
Filled all your pockets

141
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,159
That's the dog official

142
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,720
That's the dog official

143
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,440
It's the dog official

144
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:09,919
That's it

145
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,399
Rice prices surged that year

146
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,399
Suizhou is full of misery

147
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,799
My father asked for help from neighboring counties to exchange rice for bran

148
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,039
It's for more people to fill their stomachs

149
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,080
joke

150
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,639
Nothing to say

151
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,559
You said that I am corruption and bribery

152
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,559
Framed Zhongliang

153
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,559
There may be evidence

154
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:25,639
evidence

155
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,159
The evidence has been ruined by you

156
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,039
Unreasonable

157
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,399
No evidence

158
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:32,480
You're framed me

159
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,320
yes

160
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,159
What about the evidence

161
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,840
Yes, where is the evidence

162
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,039
There is no evidence, where is it

163
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,919
Dear fellows

164
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,720
More than that

165
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,759
Now the imperial envoy of the court

166
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:04,679
Engage with this orphan girl from the Song family

167
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,799
In fact

168
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,600
No evidence

169
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:11,039
Beat me up to this point

170
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:15,519
What is this not a slander

171
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,960
You're too much

172
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,440
How could they treat Lord Zhao like this

173
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:19,480
No evidence

174
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:19,879
How miserable

175
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:21,039
How can you make a mistake?

176
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,600
You said I have no evidence

177
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,000
If there is evidence

178
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,399
Why not take it out

179
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:39,799
Propaganda Witness Ji Yunchao

180
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,480
Michelle Ji Yun pays homage to Marquis Xuan Ying

181
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,320
Present the evidence

182
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,480
This evidence is not in my hands now

183
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:55,759
But in

184
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,039
Ji Yunchao actually asked you for help

185
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:13,559
What about the evidence

186
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,320
Destroy it

187
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,440
Master Hou

188
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:41,080
Where is the evidence

189
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,080
Yes, what's the evidence

190
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,600
Where is the evidence

191
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,080
You take out the evidence

192
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,919
Take it out for us to show

193
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:44,320
What about the evidence

194
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,159
Yes, where is the evidence

195
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,320
The evidence is here

196
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,919
Present

197
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,480
You saw it with your own eyes last night

198
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,679
I've destroyed the evidence in your face

199
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,080
Prepare horse

200
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,360
I'm going to sue in front of the emperor

201
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,960
Never let others take the lead

202
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,840
Uncle Master

203
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,960
You and I will set out together

204
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,600
Before departure

205
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,559
We change suits

206
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,200
good

207
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:36,799
Have to change

208
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,279
Then change it completely

209
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,240
You are the one who enters the palace

210
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,120
You go with fake evidence

211
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,679
You let me take the real evidence

212
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,639
I have no token to enter the palace

213
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,120
Not a close minister's family

214
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,279
Can't enter the palace

215
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:55,480
Even if you can't meet the Lord

216
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,759
Does Pei Yan have no token?

217
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,840
The Pei family's token has long been deprived of it

218
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,879
Then how can you enter the palace

219
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,039
Find Zhou Junlan

220
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,799
I know that his ambitions are hard to fulfill his virtues and lack talent.

221
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,480
I can convince him

222
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,759
Half a tooth

223
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,600
Just half a tooth

224
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,480
How can it be considered evidence

225
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,639
Therefore, those who leave cannot speak

226
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,679
But his remains will be wronged

227
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:34,320
Zhao Peng

228
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:36,799
You said Song Hongjian committed suicide by taking poison

229
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,480
I opened the coffin and examined the autopsy

230
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,559
Discovering it in his mouth

231
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:41,480
All thirty-two teeth turned black

232
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,840
Then remove it and cut it open one by one

233
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,559
It was found that both inside and outside were black

234
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,120
This is not a worm-eater

235
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,200
But poisoned

236
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,759
This official has already said

237
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,919
He committed suicide by fearing sin and taking poison

238
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,840
This poison is called the third and a half update

239
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,480
If someone drinks this poison

240
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,360
Venom will follow saliva into the stomach bag

241
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,399
Infiltrate blood again

242
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,759
Invade the whole body through the meridians

243
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,320
His teeth and bones

244
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,679
It will be as dark as night

245
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,399
Do you know this

246
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,480
This poison is notorious

247
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,159
How could this official not know

248
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,159
But when I was having an autopsy

249
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:18,799
I found that although Song Hongjian's teeth were black

250
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,279
But he has two hundred and six bones all over his body

251
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,399
It's pale

252
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,519
And his skull ribs

253
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:28,120
pubic radius femur

254
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,039
A total of fifty-nine bones

255
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:32,960
There are cracks after being hit by heavy objects

256
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,679
How miserable

257
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:41,200
It's really miserable

258
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,679
How tragic is this

259
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:43,720
How miserable

260
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:46,279
so

261
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:49,039
Song Hongjian was beaten to death

262
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,799
The murderer forced poison after his death

263
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,399
Then he faked his illusion of committing suicide by taking poison

264
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,000
Therefore, this poison is only on the teeth

265
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:00,080
Not in the bone

266
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,799
He was beaten to death

267
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,159
What is the relationship with me?

268
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,559
I'm still in his coffin

269
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:09,320
I found several wax sealed pieces of paper

270
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:11,159
If you piece it together

271
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,279
The content of the book can be seen vaguely

272
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,320
It's you and the local gentry

273
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:17,559
A page in the letter

274
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,519
There is also your Zhao Peng's seal on it

275
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:21,480
impossible

276
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:22,879
Absolutely impossible

277
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:23,840
How can you

278
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,399
Maybe it's a thief who is guilty

279
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,840
You ordered someone to harm Song Hongjian after you

280
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:30,600
The man dared not burn the body immediately

281
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,360
Instead, he ordered people to nail his limbs into the coffin

282
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,039
Burial in the woods of the city

283
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,159
He will not be able to turn over after his death

284
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:39,960
That's why

285
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,320
The paper in his belly was retained

286
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,840
God has eyes

287
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,639
Heavy rain falls

288
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,559
His coffin will be discovered

289
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:49,679
nonsense

290
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,000
It's you

291
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,320
It must be you

292
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:54,039
I found a corpse

293
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:55,159
Forged evidence

294
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,559
Framed me

295
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,759
Song Ruwan

296
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:02,000
I remember you said

297
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,559
Ling Zun is born with six fingers

298
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,279
yes

299
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,799
His coffin is in the county government

300
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:13,240
Xuanying Hou sent someone to find out after testing

301
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:14,919
Wait a moment

302
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,159
Everyone knows

303
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,360
You are the fiancee of Xuan Yinghou

304
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,799
Let him find someone to see

305
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:22,960
It's hard to convince everyone

306
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:25,679
Zhao Yan

307
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,399
you go

308
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,120
yes

309
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:02,440
Master Hou

310
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:04,279
The bones in the coffin

311
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,480
There may be six fingers

312
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,200
It's exactly

313
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,000
No one can believe what he said

314
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,400
What the son said

315
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,279
Can there be any fakes?

316
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:15,440
That's definitely true

317
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:16,640
His son said so

318
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,599
Can my son talk nonsense

319
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,200
It's true

320
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,599
Zhao Peng and Zhao Qian Wang Wu Fang Daxin

321
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,720
Thirteen rural gentry

322
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,400
Raise the price of rice

323
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:31,799
Search for folk cream

324
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,920
Concealing this matter of killing people to silence

325
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,920
Framed by Zhongliang

326
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:36,880
Conclusive evidence

327
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:38,599
Can there be objections

328
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,720
Go quickly to get it

329
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,480
Thirteen squires on this list

330
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,559
Take it to the dungeon

331
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,440
Ask for the death of autumn

332
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,240
yes

333
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,160
Zhao Peng

334
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,559
You know the law breaks the law

335
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:56,400
No crime to be punished

336
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,160
It should be asked after three days

337
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,119
And slow

338
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,799
Then she

339
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,920
Shouldn't you behead me?
