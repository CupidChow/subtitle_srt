1
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,879
I worked hard to win half a tael of silver

2
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:16,000
You buy this little rice

3
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:19,239
Half a tael of silver is only enough to buy these

4
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,599
You're lying

5
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,879
I could buy three bags of rice two days ago

6
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,760
Have you given the silver again

7
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:25,439
No

8
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,879
Are you ignorant again

9
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:27,719
I don't

10
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,439
Just like when you hid the gold ingots

11
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,480
If I don't find out

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,040
You won't take it out until you die

13
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,680
You won't take it out until you die

14
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,120
I really don't

15
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,920
The gentry in the country raised the price of rice overnight

16
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,319
Only buy these

17
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,079
You're still talking back

18
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,359
You're still talking back

19
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:47,799
You're still talking back

20
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,159
It hurts

21
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,560
The porridge is ready

22
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,000
I'll serve some porridge

23
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,280
Remember

24
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,719
This medicine cannot be taken internally

25
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,000
There will be life-threatening

26
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,960
Can't see, is it

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,919
Cry and cry

28
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,280
All blessings make you cry

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,280
Why are you listless

30
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,439
fine

31
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,680
By the way, Dr. Ji

32
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,960
How is Ah Yuan she

33
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:19,719
Still unconscious

34
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,840
But the physical condition is much better

35
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,240
That's good

36
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,560
What's blushing

37
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,960
How do you like her

38
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,080
I don't

39
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,120
I just care

40
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:39,240
By the way, I will teach you the lie detection method

41
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,439
How did it work

42
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,159
I found everyone in the county yamen that night the fire broke out

43
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,520
Tell them there is a poisonous snake in this jar

44
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,800
If you lie

45
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,840
Put your hand into the jar

46
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,639
Will be bitten to death by a poisonous snake

47
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,280
There are no venomous snakes in the jar

48
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,520
It's exactly

49
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,879
If someone is a thief, he feels guilty

50
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,439
To disperse the poisonous snake

51
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,000
Apply sulfur to your hands in advance

52
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,759
Just put the person's hand in herb water

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,599
It will appear slightly red

54
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:04,639
So

55
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:05,919
The hand of a lie

56
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,240
It turns red in the potion

57
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,000
Right

58
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,759
right

59
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,919
But I put everyone in the county yamen

60
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:11,680
All tested

61
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,520
No one lies

62
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,039
All tested

63
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,959
Yes, it's all

64
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:21,879
wrong

65
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,319
Another person

66
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,319
Who is it

67
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,600
Father

68
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,560
presumptuous

69
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,759
How dare you

70
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,079
I have a poisonous snake in this jar

71
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:39,800
Very human

72
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,480
The lying man puts his hand into the jar

73
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,519
Will be bitten by him

74
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,680
Death from poison

75
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:49,240
Do you dare to give it a try

76
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,240
Where are you going again

77
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,600
I'll go to deliver medicine and go back later

78
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,959
You suspect that I set the fire

79
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,319
Yan'er

80
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:42,959
It's really not me

81
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,240
Do you dare to try

82
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,399
No wonder she must come to Suizhou

83
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,480
It turns out you are here

84
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,279
The show is about to begin

85
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,800
What are you doing

86
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:06,199
I don't know him

87
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,639
He wants to kill someone and steal rice

88
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,279
I'm just

89
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,160
You dead woman

90
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:19,600
no

91
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,279
Who are you

92
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,199
Dodge it for me

93
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,879
Otherwise, I'll cut it together

94
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,839
how

95
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,759
Have your heart disease been cured

96
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,000
alright

97
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,519
All ready

98
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:54,439
Doctor Ji, you are such a wonderful way to return to the spring

99
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,720
Say less nonsense

100
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,920
How to deal with him

101
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,839
There is a dry well in the yard

102
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:20,560
Really no

103
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:21,680
Yan'er

104
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,560
Stop making trouble

105
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,480
There must be fish that misses the net

106
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,960
I'm still alive

107
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,120
Finally got rid of this bad gambling

108
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,600
More than just heart disease

109
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:11,360
Even my poor illness was removed

110
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:15,159
No need to pay off debts

111
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,200
No need to be beaten

112
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,600
Don't be afraid

113
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,559
His house

114
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,080
His field

115
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,679
His money His rice

116
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,159
It's all mine

117
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,159
It's all mine

118
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,159
It's all mine

119
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,679
The story broke out in the future

120
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,960
You won't take all the crimes

121
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,120
All are on my head

122
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,120
No, no

123
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,080
Absolutely not

124
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,039
I swear

125
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:43,879
It hurts so much

126
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:45,519
Why do I look at him?

127
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,600
Can still move

128
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Bitch

129
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,039
Wait for me to go up and kill you

130
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,360
It doesn't matter

131
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,600
It doesn't matter

132
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,279
Cover the manhole cover later

133
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,799
No one will notice

134
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,360
The last question

135
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:06,360
What

136
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,919
What's more lingering than love

137
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,879
What are you doing

138
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:13,519
It's hatred

139
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,039
Hate is a thousand times more lingering than love

140
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:19,960
Just like I'm to you

141
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:22,279
Missing day and night

142
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,320
you

143
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,919
You, you are

144
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,320
Don't be fine

145
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,799
Sun Fengxi

146
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,559
Gu Chaochao

147
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,799
On the wedding day

148
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,399
You won't help me if you die

149
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,480
He also acted as accomplice to the tiger and pushed me down the cliff

150
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,120
I still remember you standing on a cliff

151
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,399
The face of counting money

152
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,519
Smile

153
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,399
Why don't you smile?

154
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,639
But I think

155
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,360
You're like this now

156
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:51,360
Better than you smile

157
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,639
They forced me

158
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:53,919
They forced me

159
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,120
Then you deserve to die even more

160
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:57,480
If someone asks you will say it

161
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,679
I forced you to murder your husband

162
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:00,600
No

163
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:01,879
I can testify for you

164
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:02,919
I can return your innocence

165
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:04,039
I can tell the world

166
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,320
I can tell them

167
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,639
You didn't elope with the outsider

168
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:08,879
What I want is not all that

169
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:11,200
Then I can give you whatever you want

170
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:15,639
What I want is the best way of heaven

171
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,679
Evil will be rewarded

172
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,039
Slut, stop hitting me

173
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,080
You've come down, too

174
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,000
Save me Gu Chaochao will kill you now

175
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,240
I've saved me by mistake

176
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:36,399
I will take you to cushion your back even if I save me to death

177
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:29,879
What are you doing here

178
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,240
Call me easy to find

179
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:34,960
I'll come here to deliver medicine

180
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:36,639
What are you doing

181
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,480
I'll give the medicine to the person who gave the medicine

182
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,080
Shelter from wind and rain

183
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:43,840
Not a small tone

184
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,519
Pei's kitten

185
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,120
Pei's kitten

186
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:50,919
Don't come over

187
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:53,000
I'll kill you

188
00:12:59,039 --> 00:12:59,799
You're afraid

189
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:02,679
No

190
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,360
I thought

191
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,200
A brave man like you

192
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,480
There is nothing to scare you

193
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,279
So fierce

194
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:17,720
Then you give up

195
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,759
You win

196
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,919
