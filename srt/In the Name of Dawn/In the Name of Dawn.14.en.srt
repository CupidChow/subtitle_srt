1
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,000
Please help me ask her what she thinks

2
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,719
He asked what you thought

3
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,119
Get the account book

4
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,039
Find someone

5
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,359
She told you to think of a solution

6
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:06,359
Don't bother her

7
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,799
She clearly didn't say that

8
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,640
I've been withstood for a long time

9
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:12,920
We're all sitting together

10
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,439
Do you have to let me pass the message?

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,319
It's been back for so long

12
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:17,480
Still angry here

13
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,599
At the reception later

14
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:21,120
Don't show off your face, you two

15
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:23,959
Welcome banquet

16
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:25,760
It's just the birth of Qingyang

17
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,200
Mid-Autumn Festival

18
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,079
Just bring you and me

19
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,120
Uncle Master

20
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,760
Why do I feel like your tone

21
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,159
Showing happiness

22
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:38,400
He was injured by arrows

23
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,680
It's the beautiful maid in the house who saves the hero

24
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,280
He secretly agreed to others' hearts

25
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,359
It's not me who likes

26
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,760
She is her friend's sweetheart

27
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,920
Wish you know the details

28
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,159
What about this

29
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,599
A long story

30
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,519
The wind is bright and beautiful.

31
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,200
Birds singing and fragrance of flowers

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,480
Tell the point

33
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,920
She fell in love with a prodigal son

34
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:06,920
Have to ask me

35
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,919
Time is here

36
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,120
It's time for us to go out

37
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,599
How do you say half of it?

38
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,439
Uncle Master

39
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,280
Zhou Shilang

40
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:36,000
The Queen Xuan Ying made great achievements in this trip to the south

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,120
I really look at it with admiration

42
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,960
Then look at me

43
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,520
Don't look at other

44
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,960
Look again, it's digging your eyes

45
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,439
If you feel uncomfortable

46
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,000
I happened to bring you your daily use

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,159
I'm worried about it

48
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,240
I'm just thinking

49
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,639
How much land should the people cultivate in this life

50
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,439
Only by earning the tip of this iceberg

51
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,560
The wine and meat smell

52
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:09,960
There are bones frozen to death on the road

53
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,400
Xuan Yinghou

54
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,520
Jiang Shangshu

55
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,520
Xuan Yinghou Thunder Method

56
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,199
This time, the tumors in Suizhou were removed

57
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,639
How happy

58
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,039
Shangshu Jiang is so serious

59
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,240
This trip is not my own

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,439
Thanks to my two

61
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,000
friend

62
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,479
This lady looks so familiar

63
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,759
I am Ji Yunchao, a doctor at Ji's clinic

64
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:38,960
I visited your house last time

65
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,199
Give medicine to Mrs. Jiang

66
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,960
right

67
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,439
She is mine, too

68
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:43,280
not yet

69
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,280
Jiang Shangshu

70
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,319
Xuan Yinghou

71
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:54,080
The banquet is about to begin

72
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,080
please

73
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,199
How many

74
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,560
Please

75
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,439
Come and sit here

76
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,480
Why don't I tell it

77
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,040
say what

78
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,439
Say you are my wife who has not passed away

79
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:39,920
Why don't you say it

80
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,519
You are my never-before-seen husband

81
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,600
good

82
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,680
Say it next time

83
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:46,639
say what

84
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:51,279
Say I am your husband who has not passed the door

85
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,240
All right

86
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,600
It sounds much more pleasant

87
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,920
OK OK OK

88
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,120
Everyone

89
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:04,920
My father is ill

90
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,000
I specially ordered me to come and reward him on his behalf

91
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,519
Xuan Yinghou

92
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:14,560
I'm here

93
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,600
My father remembers that you have made contributions to disaster relief during this trip

94
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:19,079
Then return the Pei family token to you

95
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,360
Reward another hundred taels of gold

96
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,079
Eighty pieces of brocade

97
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,399
All the ministers should follow the law

98
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,959
Anyone who asks for the people

99
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,360
I will not treat you badly

100
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,720
I'm so proud

101
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:31,439
Thank you, the emperor

102
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,079
Xuan Yinghou is really young and promising

103
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,759
yes

104
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
Trustful advice

105
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,360
Passing mountains and far

106
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,800
I'm obviously in my position

107
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,759
But he was the one who showed up

108
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,600
Sour teeth

109
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,000
Get the token

110
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,480
He can enter the state to participate in politics

111
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,639
Your Majesty is afraid that I am too powerful

112
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,240
Shangshu Jiang was very fond of Pei Yanqing again

113
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:53,120
They clearly want to support Pei Yan

114
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,800
Check with me

115
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,839
What do you want to do

116
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,680
In order to prevent the Pei and Jiang family from joining forces

117
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,240
I've thought of a countermeasure

118
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,000
Now I will think of my own way

119
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,480
Let's listen

120
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,199
You told me

121
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,279
The clinic needs repairs urgently

122
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,319
The money His Majesty rewarded

123
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,680
Leave it to you to cook

124
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,759
Even if you buy Ji's Medical Center

125
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,040
There is no need for so much money

126
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,439
Then I'll collect it myself

127
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,639
But the Marquis is very kind

128
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,519
I'll accept it with a smile

129
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:46,759
But what about me

130
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:47,839
Don't like to owe favors

131
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,360
Just think I borrowed you

132
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,360
Then what do you plan to deal with

133
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:52,839
What's this money

134
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,040
No matter how much it is, it is not enough

135
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:56,720
Of course, we have to find a way to make money

136
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,839
In addition to the money for repairing the clinic

137
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:01,160
I'm also planning to sell a batch of new drugs

138
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,519
If there is still surplus

139
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,240
All for you

140
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,600
Count the interest money

141
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,680
Three cents a year

142
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,920
Or you are the boss directly

143
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,079
What's wrong

144
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,199
Just feel

145
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,439
Strange

146
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:20,120
It's strange to say

147
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,160
I just think it's strange

148
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,720
It is clearly said that he is the maid in the house

149
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,720
She didn't see her all night

150
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:29,439
Excuse me

151
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,639
Your house

152
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,680
But there is a lady named March

153
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,519
Be less at ease

154
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,720
Maybe he is the maid next to the princess

155
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,879
Want me to say

156
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,000
This princess is too big affair

157
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,720
It's been slow to come yet

158
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,160
The birthday of someone

159
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,319
What's wrong with spending some time dressing up

160
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:53,399
Princess Qingyang is here

161
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,279
Why is he here

162
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,600
Aunt, what's wrong

163
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,680
This palace is a little cold

164
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,199
I'll add some clothes

165
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,879
How do you know I'm here?

166
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,919
It's stupid

167
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,679
Why didn't I see you at the banquet just now

168
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,799
I am Princess Qingyang's maid

169
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,600
I was looking for clothes for her just now

170
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,600
Princess Qingyang's eyebrows and eyes

171
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,320
It's a bit similar to you

172
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,000
Not one ten thousandth of yours

173
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:14,919
She is not good at treating people

174
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,240
You're very good

175
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,960
nonsense

176
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,360
Princess Qingyang is very good

177
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,879
She is the best woman in the world

178
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,519
How good is she

179
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:25,720
Fortunately, she is there

180
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,799
she

181
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,639
never mind

182
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:30,519
Don't talk about her anymore

183
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,360
I'll look for you today

184
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,039
I have something to say to you

185
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,080
I

186
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:39,519
Princess Qingyang must have her advantages

187
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,159
You let me think about it

188
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:45,639
She, she is very

189
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,000
Come quickly

190
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,039
Someone fell into the water

191
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,519
Come and save people

192
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Save her quickly

193
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,279
Save her

194
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:14,720
Give up and give up

195
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:16,759
Yue'er

196
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,200
What happened to Yue'er

197
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,240
Why did you fall into the water

198
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,759
I'm watching the moon in the lake

199
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,159
Crowds

200
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,519
I don't know who pushed me into the water

201
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:30,159
Fortunately, Mr. Zhou rescued him

202
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,240
Although Mr. Zhou is kind-hearted

203
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,279
But this move is against the great defense of men and women

204
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,480
Mrs. Jiang ruined her reputation

205
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,919
But what should I do

206
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,879
They've been rumored before

207
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,080
Now

208
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,080
Which family will dare to marry her in the future

209
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,360
Shut up all

210
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,759
No need for you to pretend

211
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:50,759
Worry about me here

212
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,879
I will ask Your Majesty

213
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,000
Let him give marriage to Yue'er and Zhou Shilang

214
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,399
I didn't expect Mr. Zhou to sacrifice his life to save him.

215
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:07,399
I don't know if Mr. Zhou can do it

216
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,120
I'm willing

217
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,159
really

218
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:12,639
really

219
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,639
You instructed him to do this

220
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,960
What's wrong

221
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,600
Really despicable

222
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:49,960
Want me to say

223
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,200
You should push Princess Qingyang to fall into the water

224
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:55,320
Become a marriage with her

225
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,840
After all, she was holding the imperial edict in her hand

226
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,720
Even though I don't know what the edict says

227
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:05,720
But it's better than Jiang Yue

228
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:08,279
how

229
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,519
It's obviously your own decision

230
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:11,679
Design Jiang Yue falls into the water

231
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,759
Plot her to marry into the Zhou family

232
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,559
I haven't gotten angry yet

233
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,879
You dare to show me a look

234
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,919
I'm talking to you

235
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,480
What’s wrong with you

236
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,480
What's wrong with me

237
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:34,919
I want to ask you what's wrong

238
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:37,200
Finally got married to the Jiang family

239
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,799
Better than Pei Yan and the others

240
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,679
If you don't thank me,

241
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,559
Still sarcastic at me everywhere

242
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,360
You promised me

243
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,080
Never take a concubine

244
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,039
If Pei Yan hadn't shined

245
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,840
How could I have this problem

246
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:53,000
Now I have the upper hand

247
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,159
You're looking for a new reason to attack me

248
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,279
You think I'm living a peaceful life

249
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,039
Am I helping you deal with Pei Yan

250
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:00,039
Yeah

251
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,159
Sometimes I really want to know

252
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,000
Are you helping me deal with Pei Yan

253
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,159
Still helping Pei Yan deal with me

254
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:09,919
It was you who said you wanted to give Ji Yun a look at him.

255
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:10,840
Coming

256
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,200
You are the one who loses her by chance

257
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,200
Are you mindless

258
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:17,759
Still interested

259
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,639
Still one piece missing

260
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:27,919
Why didn't I see it?

261
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,600
This is strange, too

262
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,120
Fifty-one tribute men on this list

263
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,679
Why are they all from the south?

264
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:36,279
We southerners are naturally talented

265
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,039
That may not be

266
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,480
You are from the south, the examiner of the imperial examination.

267
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:42,399
It must be your Southern People's Party's common deeds

268
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:43,679
What to say against justice

269
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,960
I'll go to yours

270
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,320
Take action

271
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,600
Take action on you

272
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:50,200
Stop calling

273
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,159
Calm down

274
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:53,799
Stop calling

275
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,080
It's insulting

276
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,559
Walk

277
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,279
We'll go and complain to the emperor

278
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:01,759
Take the lawsuit against the emperor

279
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:02,679
Walk

280
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,039
Unreasonable

281
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:15,519
Stop your anger

282
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,519
This may be a misunderstanding

283
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,559
More than 300 northern scholars were blocked on the way to the palace

284
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,039
Distribution of the Case

285
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,279
Force me to investigate this matter thoroughly

286
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,039
But what do you show me

287
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:31,320
Weisun specially appointed as a bachelor's student

288
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,120
Eleven other top scholars in Jiaxu Case thoroughly investigated this matter

289
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,799
Sleepless

290
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,120
Nearly a thousand test papers have been reviewed

291
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,000
It's true

292
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,639
I'll ask you to check

293
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,480
You will find out that a northern scholar is not good at literature and science

294
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:46,039
It's true that the Southern scholars are better

295
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:48,440
I dare not speak so rudely

296
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:49,919
Just to judge the matter

297
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,240
This test

298
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,879
Northern scholars are indeed a little inferior

299
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:54,519
OK

300
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,240
You retreat

301
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:01,480
Let Xuan Yinghou come in

302
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,000
His Majesty

303
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,720
In this test

304
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:23,759
Fifty-one tributes selected

305
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:26,559
There are also ministers Zhou who came to investigate the case

306
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,960
The eleven civil officials

307
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,799
Check it out for me

308
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:35,679
Subject:

309
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,559
Have you ever bribed the examiner for fraud?

310
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,320
I

311
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,240
Never

312
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,559
Ask you again

313
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,000
Have you ever bribed the examiner for fraud?

314
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:54,960
explain

315
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,160
Dead

316
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,759
Daddy
