1
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,679
How do you want to check

2
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,840
How to check

3
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,600
But you have to bring me with you

4
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:02,039
Why

5
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,079
No reason

6
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:06,560
Ji Xiao

7
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:08,640
Not on the yellow list

8
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,280
Uncle Master

9
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:10,680
Only insects

10
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,200
I picked it up and threw it out

11
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,640
Who is on the list

12
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:23,840
Zhao Yan

13
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:25,480
no

14
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,920
Who is that

15
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,200
No one

16
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,519
Yunchao

17
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,359
You know when you lie

18
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,480
Always like to look straight into people's eyes

19
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:35,319
Just like now

20
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,799
You said it wrong

21
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,159
Only the panic

22
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,719
Don't dare to look someone in the eyes

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,879
You are Ji Yunchao

24
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,719
You know this well

25
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,359
Only then can you do the opposite

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,840
I'm so sure

27
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,200
You've hidden something from me

28
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,840
I'll tell you when the time is right

29
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:55,799
When was that

30
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,079
Like in Suizhou

31
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,000
When a person dies before me

32
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,200
Maybe

33
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,799
This is unfair

34
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,640
You know everything about me

35
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,000
And I'm to you

36
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,919
But don't know much

37
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:14,120
Yunchao, you can have a secret to me

38
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,159
Can lie to me

39
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,479
I won't force you to pass it all

40
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,319
Tell the plate

41
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,280
I just want to know

42
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,400
Do you have to take this muddy water

43
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,400
On the list of tributes

44
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,080
I have my benefactor's name

45
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,639
Is it just a benefactor

46
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,479
no

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,120
That's a marriage

48
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,439
Once was

49
00:02:58,719 --> 00:02:59,400
Can't go

50
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,319
Nepotism is the most taboo in investigating cases

51
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,039
What about Zhao Yan

52
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,599
Zhao Yan is also on that list

53
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,759
You forgot what you promised Zhao Peng

54
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,719
If Zhao Yan is on the dead end one day

55
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:10,599
You'll help him

56
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,400
Help him get away with it

57
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,400
Helps too

58
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,759
The clouds assure you to me

59
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,560
I'll do it impartially

60
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,080
But you must also assure me

61
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,719
You won't get into this muddy water

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,599
Feel sorry

63
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,039
I can't do it

64
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,960
where did you go

65
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,439
Go find a boat to ferry

66
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,800
knew

67
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,840
Get out

68
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,879
yes

69
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,280
Is it true that what Xian'er said

70
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,120
She's really Gu Chaochao

71
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:02,919
impossible

72
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,680
Lang Jun

73
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,759
Ji Yunchao asked for a meeting in Ji's clinic

74
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:07,759
Please come in

75
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,120
yes

76
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,680
No matter what, you won't go to the Three Treasures Hall

77
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,959
I don't know what it is for Mrs. Ji to do

78
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,399
I'm here

79
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,040
It is to discuss a deal with Mr. Zhou

80
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,240
Tea instead of wine

81
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,399
Talk about your feelings

82
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,439
Wish you know the details

83
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,160
The husband has orders

84
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,279
A visit from a distinguished guest today

85
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,319
The rest of the people are not allowed to enter

86
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,959
I'm the rest of the way

87
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,160
The little one is just doing things impartially

88
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,519
What a fair work

89
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,439
He's what he said is a sir

90
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,360
My mother can't listen to my words

91
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,879
Madam, you can't

92
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,040
lady

93
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:02,560
Sister Qiu

94
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,319
Sister Jiang is from a noble birth

95
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:08,079
How can I bear your sister

96
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:10,240
I'm here to deliver soup

97
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,279
Please get out

98
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,240
It was obviously I came first

99
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:18,959
Yue'er

100
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,120
She just entered the door

101
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,360
He is the daughter of the Shangshu

102
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,920
Why bother her so harsh

103
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:32,399
Beautiful soup

104
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,399
Husband is so lucky

105
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,680
You didn't say you couldn't drink it

106
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,600
Too

107
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,000
I didn't ask you to drink the soup

108
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,079
You didn't let you marry Jiang Yue

109
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,279
Didn't ask you to meet Ji Yunchao in private

110
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,639
You'll be sure to tell me.

111
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:46,800
You monitor me

112
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:47,839
You are mine

113
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,680
I'm going to take good care of my things

114
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,560
What's wrong

115
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,399
Say it

116
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,560
What did she come to you for

117
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,560
Several civil officials who have been with me

118
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,519
Just like Gu's family, he was involved in the North and South list case

119
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,279
She wants to investigate with me

120
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,480
Gu family

121
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,680
She clearly wants to tell you

122
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,720
She's Gu Chaochao

123
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,720
She doesn't even want home

124
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,600
Do you think she really cares about the life or death of the Gu family

125
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,639
She just wants to get close to you

126
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,560
Just break my minions

127
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,879
She said she was not Gu Chaochao

128
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,879
Just have a little marriage with Mr. Gu

129
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,040
Just a little similar

130
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,560
What she says, what do you believe

131
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,079
Why don't you marry her into the house

132
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,399
I believe in you

133
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,079
I'll follow your advice

134
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,160
And now I'll tell you

135
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,000
I have nothing to do with her

136
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,920
Do you believe it or not

137
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,759
In your heart

138
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,120
How do I say how do I think

139
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,000
Never important

140
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,079
What matters is yourself

141
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,000
You can do whatever you want

142
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:35,920
Why

143
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,839
I know the future very well

144
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,319
But don't you miscalculate?

145
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,920
That's because you haven't done well enough

146
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,040
I'm not doing well enough

147
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,360
You've always made the decision

148
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,120
Why don't I make the decision once

149
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,600
If Ji Yunchao

150
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,920
Can you really help me protect those people

151
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,399
What's wrong with working with her

152
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,240
drink

153
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,199
I won't drink

154
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,560
drink

155
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,519
OK

156
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,439
Disobedient things

157
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,720
If it is changed, it is

158
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,519
Fifty-one tribute

159
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,639
One examiner

160
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,399
Eleven Investigation Officers

161
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,959
A total of sixty-three people

162
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,680
Pei Yan wants to investigate between them

163
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,920
Is there any interest connection

164
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,000
At least you have to check the accounts of sixty-three households

165
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,240
Then we will visit before him

166
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,759
Find out the account

167
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,959
That's what it means

168
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:47,600
I just don't know which company to start

169
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:50,279
Is the Gu family

170
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,240
Mr. Zhou doesn't have to worry about me

171
00:07:59,079 --> 00:07:59,959
Pei Yan didn't know

172
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,439
I have a marriage relationship with Gu family

173
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,199
From what I know about him

174
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,199
He should check the official title in turn

175
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,399
Now

176
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,720
Xu Ying has checked three or four households

177
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,519
We started checking from the fifth household

178
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,839
how

179
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:15,399
good

180
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,199
The Minister of Law Zhou invited him

181
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,839
But my account book

182
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,639
Has been confiscated by Xuan Yinghou

183
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,279
Finally, he was one step later

184
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,279
We have to take two steps first

185
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,320
That's how he can be one step faster

186
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:46,759
What a coincidence

187
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,759
Just now, Marquis Xuanying made an appointment with me

188
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,240
Take the account away

189
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,240
Just now, the lord Xuanying took the account

190
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,399
I'm really sorry

191
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,720
It's obviously disrupted the order

192
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,320
Why can he take the lead

193
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,639
Someone helps him

194
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,120
This person can know the future

195
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:11,200
What you said is

196
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,360
Your wife

197
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,159
No need to go around in circles

198
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,600
Let's go to Gu's house

199
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,679
They may be waiting there

200
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,840
She's waiting for us

201
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,360
Maybe I thought I snatched her

202
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,320
She wants to steal mine, too

203
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,120
It's not enough to hold it in your palm

204
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,799
Have to hang up high

205
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,039
Let me watch it

206
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,000
Zhou Shilang

207
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,320
You have a lofty ambition

208
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,279
But trapped in this small place

209
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,559
Don't you want to find another way out

210
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,440
Find another way out

211
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,559
Life is like a carving of stones and seeing fire

212
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,320
When will it be possible to live in the world

213
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:45,360
Zhou Shilang

214
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,840
Think twice

215
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:56,960
Walk

216
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,360
It seems she is more anxious than I thought

217
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:12,480
Niangzi Ji

218
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,600
What a coincidence

219
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,879
There are many restaurants in the capital

220
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
I chose to meet in my restaurant

221
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,000
I don't know if it's a coincidence

222
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,799
Still some idiot

223
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,240
A bad trick that deliberately attracts attention

224
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,120
Qiu Xianer

225
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,240
Which idiot is right?

226
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:30,600
As far as I know

227
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,279
This restaurant also has shares

228
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,080
It's not appropriate to say it's yours

229
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,279
No family members

230
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,600
I am the only goddaughter that Gu's mother recognized

231
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:41,799
Now the Gu family is still the Gu family

232
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,720
Maybe it won't be the case in the future

233
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,679
I've been to Gu family

234
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:51,480
You two don't have to go again

235
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,559
Fang Shopkeeper

236
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,399
Clean up the box

237
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:01,879
I want to treat the guests well

238
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,279
OK

239
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,039
Walk

240
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,279
Where to go

241
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:07,960
Go to Gu's house

242
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,039
But

243
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,559
Don't worry, I'll have everything

244
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:14,919
Zhou Shilang

245
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,200
Niangzi Ji

246
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,679
Please come back, two

247
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,200
Gu's account book

248
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,320
All have been handed over to the Marquis of Xuan Ying for review

249
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,240
As far as I know

250
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:24,799
The Gu family has been doing business for generations

251
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,919
Mr. Gu has always been cautious in doing things

252
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,039
Everything must be traced

253
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,039
Even if it is a book, you have to keep two copies

254
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,720
Where did you hear it from

255
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:36,919
The market rumors

256
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,639
Could it be that my Xian'er told Shi Lang Zhou

257
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:44,639
Mr. Zhou told you again

258
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,159
Why did the lady say this

259
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,000
Niangzi Ji has made an engagement with others

260
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,919
How can I be inseparable from Xian'er's husband

261
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,440
Xuan Yinghou is your fiancé

262
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,600
You should be optimistic about him

263
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,840
How could he let Xian'er get closer and closer

264
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,000
And Mr. Zhou

265
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,399
Couples are bound to be discontent

266
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,080
You should be more tolerant

267
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,200
Give them

268
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,679
Don't worry, madam

269
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,000
Just check the account

270
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,639
I'm sitting upright

271
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,200
Covering

272
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,279
It's suspicious

273
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,039
People want to check

274
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,480
Give it to

275
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,039
Too

276
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,600
I'm confused

277
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,759
There have been many misconduct just now

278
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,720
Please two more waives

279
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,159
The lady is so rude

280
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,879
Please wait for a moment.

281
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,080
Niangzi Ji

282
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,039
Please follow me

283
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:56,559
That's it

284
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,799
Yunchao has another question to ask for advice

285
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,080
Speaking

286
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,240
Mr. Gu has a successful career

287
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,360
Why do you have to get a good exam?

288
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:11,600
You can see what this is

289
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:19,600
Wind chime

290
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,639
There is a girl at home

291
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,720
Named Chaochao

292
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,159
She was naughty when she was a kid

293
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:28,480
Often beaten by mother

294
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,000
Afraid of pain

295
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,519
It hurts as soon as you hit

296
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,679
Cry when it hurts

297
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:38,399
I'm crying so hard that I'm one head and two big

298
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,799
Can't drink tea

299
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:43,519
Can't see the account

300
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,960
I had to think of a way

301
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,080
Get all kinds of gadgets for her to coax her

302
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,000
Later I found out

303
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,840
She likes wind chimes the most

304
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,399
The ringtone rings

305
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,720
She just smiles

306
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:01,440
I forgot the pain when I smile

307
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:03,639
A sloppy smoke

308
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,279
She ran away

309
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:12,120
Where did she go

310
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,120
I don't know either

311
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,039
I'm going to find her

312
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,360
But everyone says

313
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:19,639
She just ran away

314
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,879
On the wedding night

315
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,360
Running into sex with a man

316
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,840
Lost all the face of the Gu family and Zhou family

317
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:31,519
Why bother to find it

318
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,440
Mr. Zhou doesn't want to find her

319
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,159
I won't go either

320
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,639
How dare I not follow

321
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,840
I'm ashamed of the dynasty

322
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,720
So say

323
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,840
Mr. Gu entered politics because he was looking for a girl

324
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,240
If I am powerful

325
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,279
Can protect her

326
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:56,759
She will not be allowed to wander and helpless

327
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:01,200
It's hard to go home

328
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,320
The officialdom has fallen

329
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:06,559
Fox and rat are good at a cave

330
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:07,919
Tiger, snake, nine kids

331
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:09,960
Mr. Gu is straightforward

332
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,360
It's better to watch it on the wall

333
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,159
Niangzi Ji practiced medicine for many years

334
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,080
Have you ever seen someone who looks similar to you

335
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,639
A woman named Chaochao

336
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,879
If seen

337
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:25,279
she

338
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,159
Is she good

339
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,799
Many people have told me

340
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,919
I'm very similar to her

341
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,000
But I've never seen her

342
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:41,279
I don't know if she's doing well

343
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:45,600
Too

344
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,240
The world is big

345
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,279
If we meet one day

346
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,080
Mr. Gu has something to say

347
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,399
Let me convey it on my behalf

348
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,440
Just say

349
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,480
My mother and I miss her

350
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,559
good

351
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,279
I've written it down

352
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,200
This account book

353
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,080
I will send someone to the Zhou family later

354
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,279
Thank you

355
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,200
Say goodbye
