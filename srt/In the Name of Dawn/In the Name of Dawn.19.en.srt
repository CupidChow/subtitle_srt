1
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,359
I heard Ji Xiao say you went to the dungeon

2
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,920
I heard from the prison guards that you went to your residence

3
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,480
Your injury hasn't healed yet

4
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,599
It's not easy to catch you

5
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,439
What are you busy with

6
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,560
Pei's kitten

7
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,319
Why don't you open your eyes

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,079
Qiu Xian'er has a fight with you

9
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,560
You meet her today

10
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,640
I want to use your temper

11
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:27,079
It should be a white knife

12
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,239
Red knife comes out

13
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,359
Then what's wrong

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,359
I'm afraid of blood

15
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:42,280
Look at me

16
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,799
Is there any

17
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:47,760
Nothing

18
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:50,159
She is here to plead with me today

19
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,599
Ask me what I want

20
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,120
I said

21
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,439
I want your life

22
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,439
for you

23
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,040
My life

24
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,960
Then bring it

25
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,000
Is it satisfying

26
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,560
I'm just making a small plan

27
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:24,039
She fled in panic

28
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,599
I wanted to give her a knife.

29
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,919
Think carefully

30
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,080
As long as Zhou Junlan is not dead

31
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,039
That's her life-saving talisman

32
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,520
Just make a long-term plan

33
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,360
How are you

34
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,639
Go to Runan

35
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,080
The whereabouts of the other half of the drawings can be found

36
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,120
Not only did I find a clue

37
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,840
It was also found

38
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,639
The culprit behind the scenes

39
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,199
You want to report to the Lord

40
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,360
No

41
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,560
I want that person

42
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,240
He handed the evidence to His Majesty himself

43
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,039
Your Majesty's Oral Order

44
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,719
The Secretariat of the Court

45
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,639
Public bribery

46
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,960
Deadly guilty

47
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,240
I remember his hard work and great achievements

48
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,000
Death crime is spared from death

49
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,400
All his property is fined

50
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,039
Small punishment and big warning

51
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,240
Take a warning to others

52
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,919
I'm here

53
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,400
Zhou Shilang

54
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,680
You can't escape death

55
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,039
Your Majesty will spare your life after thinking about the old love

56
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,599
It's been the end of kindness

57
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,080
You're doing this

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,599
That's more sinful

59
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,360
I don't mean to resist the order

60
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,759
It's just that the injury is too serious

61
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,319
Not convenient to thank Shengxiang

62
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,000
Where are these rough people

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,959
Don't know the importance

64
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,439
It's time to hit

65
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,279
but

66
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,240
Zhou Shilang

67
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,399
Even if you are injured

68
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,000
You must not lose your etiquette

69
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,720
I hope Mr. Zhou will kneel down to thank the sage

70
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,639
Don't make things difficult for our family

71
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,240
minister

72
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,120
Thank you Lord Long

73
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,079
Tap

74
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,959
Not seen for a few days

75
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,920
Why are you so pretentious

76
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,319
I've been hurt like this

77
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,240
Can't you spare me with your mouth

78
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,240
Heartless stuff

79
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,920
Is this also called heartless?

80
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,560
To protect you from coming out

81
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,160
How many people have I begged

82
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,000
How many knee pads have you broken?

83
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,040
It's always just someone else's share

84
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,040
In your eyes

85
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,920
I'm just a dog

86
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,839
That's my dog, too

87
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,199
good

88
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,439
Wait for you to recover from the wound

89
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,639
I'll pick you out

90
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,879
Let you bite

91
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm afraid I'll let you down

92
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,240
What

93
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,560
Isn't it that the official has been restored?

94
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,639
There are many conflicts in the officialdom on weekdays

95
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,040
It is also normal to deal with the upper and lower levels

96
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,519
How could Your Majesty not know

97
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,160
He turned a blind eye to others

98
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,120
So decisive to me

99
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:06,199
So what if you restore an official position

100
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,920
But to find an excuse to fill the treasury

101
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,519
Old and immortal things

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,879
He's old

103
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,600
The sunset in the west

104
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,600
That's

105
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,079
Long night

106
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,920
Zhou Junlan

107
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,680
Get out

108
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,160
Why is Pei Yan coming

109
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,279
It's very here

110
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,920
You can recognize this

111
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,120
It's so stinking

112
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,399
Pulling from the dead

113
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:42,040
Isn't it just a stinking

114
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,199
really

115
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,600
You know

116
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,600
The city defense map is a total of two volumes

117
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:51,040
A roll in His Majesty's hands

118
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,160
A roll in the hands of the old marquis

119
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,279
The old marquis was stolen to prevent the drawings from being stolen

120
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,399
Tie the drawings on two soldiers

121
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,360
Destroy the original scroll in your hand

122
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,040
These two have been found by me

123
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,720
Zhao Peng, the magistrate of Suizhou County

124
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,279
Beheaded

125
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,920
General Zhang Zhao of Xiliang

126
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,240
Has been taken to heaven prison

127
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,720
then

128
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,600
My father was accused of treason

129
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:15,879
But I don't believe it

130
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,360
Have been searching for the truth for many years

131
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,920
Until I met Zhang Zhao

132
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,120
I know the whole picture

133
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,079
It's you

134
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,160
Deceiving the superiors and hiding the subordinates

135
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,480
Framed by Zhongliang

136
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,439
Zhang Zhao tells you

137
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,240
In order to prove his innocence, the old marquis

138
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,079
Take two soldiers to me in different places

139
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,720
Tell me how to preserve drawings

140
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,759
I'm asking to investigate this case

141
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,319
Report to Your Majesty truthfully

142
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,240
I've kept this from hiding it

143
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,959
Instead, frame the old marquis

144
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,720
No word difference

145
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,759
It's you indeed

146
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,480
You really believe it

147
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,560
What Zhang Zhao said just now

148
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:57,920
But it was me who made it up

149
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,879
How could I guess so accurate

150
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:03,639
There is still a face to argue

151
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,199
いました

152
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,480
You're so simple

153
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,600
You've been fooled

154
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,920
Why don't you dare to kill me

155
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:27,759
I'll take you to the holy place now

156
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,000
Safeguard my father's injustice

157
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,360
Let the world know

158
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,919
My father is loyal to the emperor and patriotic to the country

159
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,960
This life

160
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,639
Be honest and upright

161
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,720
No

162
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,399
You won't

163
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:42,519
What do you mean

164
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:43,960
Because you're scared

165
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,320
You found out

166
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,879
Who made your father die in vain

167
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,799
The culprit behind the scenes

168
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,720
In the past, I wanted to ask for my life for the people

169
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,720
But no Bole recommendation

170
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,679
I once recommended myself to Your Majesty

171
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,159
Your Majesty is at the Empress

172
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,000
You'd better go back

173
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,039
The war in Xiliang continues

174
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,480
Even though I'm a little bit

175
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,399
But I have been familiar with the martial arts of famous masters since I was a child

176
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,840
Wish to petition His Majesty

177
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,240
Follow the old Marquis to the west

178
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,120
Suggestions for him

179
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,480
Making great contributions

180
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,320
I'll send a message to you on behalf of you

181
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,440
Your Majesty is doing everything every day

182
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,000
Already rested

183
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,919
You let our family communicate about this little thing

184
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,879
Wouldn't we make His Majesty angry?

185
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,639
You're a courtier

186
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:41,120
Why not recommend yourself in court

187
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,320
I said

188
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,960
But Your Majesty said that the news of Xiliang is frequent

189
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,440
The old marquis is the only husband

190
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,320
Don't open ten thousand men

191
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,480
It's enough to have him

192
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,399
yes

193
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,840
There is old marquis here

194
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,600
What's the rush you're in?

195
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,320
Until I met her

196
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,120
You said

197
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,159
If I kill Gu Chaochao and marry you as my wife

198
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,759
It will help me get what I want

199
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,320
What do you want

200
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,639
Go to Xiliang

201
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,759
Make merit

202
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,320
Added to the title

203
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,879
Fu Zhengyu

204
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,240
How fastest to go from the capital to the Hu people's territory

205
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,360
About one month

206
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,519
I'm going to send a riding technique

207
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,360
People with good archery skills go to Xiliang

208
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:24,720
Send an urgent letter to the Hu people's territory

209
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,360
No need to go deep into the enemy camp

210
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:28,039
Attach the letter to the arrow

211
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,240
Cum at will

212
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,120
It's enough for the soldiers patrolling the Hu people

213
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:32,799
If this happens

214
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,240
Less than seven days

215
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:37,000
Your Majesty will entrust you with important tasks

216
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,080
What letter

217
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,519
Why should I believe you

218
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,480
Haven't you seen it with your own eyes

219
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,600
I can understand the future

220
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,879
As for what letter

221
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,279
This is the secret of heaven

222
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,679
Not to be revealed

223
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,879
You only need to remember two things

224
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,279
What's up

225
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,720
When one of the senders returned to the capital

226
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:58,879
Kill it

227
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,600
Second, the east wind will blow on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month

228
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,759
You want to offer advice to General Zhang Zhao before this

229
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,960
Let him raid the enemy camp at this time

230
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,080
Attack with fire

231
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,639
You can win a great victory

232
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,720
I will help you reach the top

233
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,559
You can trust your words

234
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:19,759
After seven days

235
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,960
The Hu people defeated the Xiliang army

236
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,200
Captives who escaped from the enemy camp

237
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,080
Tell Your Majesty that the old marquis colludes with the enemy and treason

238
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,879
Because he discovered the city defense map in the enemy camp

239
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,320
Later I offered advice to Zhang Zhao

240
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,840
Burning the enemy camp on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month

241
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,120
Zhang Zhao returned in triumph indeed

242
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:40,559
Therefore, Your Majesty favors me more

243
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:42,879
I'll investigate the old marquis case thoroughly

244
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,200
The old marquis proves his innocence

245
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:49,000
Take his two soldiers to see me

246
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,000
I'll tell His Majesty truthfully

247
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,720
All evidences are there

248
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,879
I think

249
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:13,600
How about this word

250
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,080
Powerful through paper back

251
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,120
Pen to sweep the army

252
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,840
Then I will reward you with it

253
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:26,320
By the way

254
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,200
You just said what should I do about this case

255
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,960
The old marquis colluded with the enemy and treason

256
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,200
Unforgivable sin

257
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:37,960
good

258
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,759
Pass my will

259
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,799
Capturing General Weiyuan and his subordinates

260
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:42,840
Twelve Heads

261
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,639
Ten days later

262
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,240
Hang it on the wall

263
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,440
Thousands of knife to pieces

264
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:52,720
Subject:

265
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,120
So the letter is

266
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,960
I know everything

267
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,080
omnipotent

268
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,440
What's the difficulty of drawing a city defense picture

269
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,360
My father is brave and good at fighting

270
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:22,840
Respectful

271
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,279
Your Majesty is suspicious

272
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,240
Therefore, I have a murderous heart

273
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,320
But what about you

274
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,159
Known truth

275
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:32,279
Why don't you tell me

276
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:35,519
Strange and mock me all day long

277
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,799
Watch me rush around for this

278
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,000
I have never had any grudges or grudges with you

279
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:44,440
Why

280
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,639
daughter

281
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,080
Have you seen it

282
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,600
I've won

283
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,840
Beat me and scold me

284
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,879
Hot me and pinch me

285
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,639
Tie my neck with a thick rope

286
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,519
Force me to crawl around in the yard

287
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,000
Isn't it because I haven't beat Pei Yan?

288
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,679
Now I've won

289
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,799
daughter

290
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,200
Have you seen it

291
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,720
Why are you the second time this time

292
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,360
Why is it second again

293
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,000
That's not

294
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,399
Can't you beat him once

295
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,399
Lan'er

296
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,000
Do you know

297
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:33,559
I was once the most favored female official beside Weiyuanhou

298
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,879
If it weren't for your father's drunk that day

299
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,720
I have you

300
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,679
I've already married Weiyuanhou as my wife

301
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,120
Why stay in this broken house

302
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,120
Also watch

303
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,559
Also watch

304
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,159
So unrepentant

305
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,159
Don't listen to discipline

306
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,639
This is the cheap man born to your Zhou family

307
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,039
If I marry into the Hou's Mansion

308
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,240
I gave birth to Pei Yan

309
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,039
Mom, don't worry

310
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,919
I must

311
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:15,679
Win him once

312
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,320
My father fought on the battlefield for many years

313
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,240
There has never been a female official beside her

314
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,440
Let your father fart

315
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,840
He is very loving to my mother

316
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
There was once a maid who was greedy for him but could not get it

317
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,240
Trying to seduce him after drinking

318
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:38,879
But accidentally hit

319
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,080
Going into my father's soldier's tent

320
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,759
Shut up

321
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:43,679
I won

322
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,159
I won

323
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,600
The soldier knew that he had missed something after drinking

324
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,360
So I resigned from my father's position in the military

325
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,399
Go back to your hometown to plan things

326
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,559
His name is Zhou Yi

327
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,679
Keep two horoscopes

328
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,480
return

329
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,039
Enough

330
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,279
You won me for the rest of your life

331
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,799
Can't I win once

332
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:05,399
I

333
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,759
Why did I beat you for the rest of my life

334
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,200
Ji Yunchao

335
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,159
I'll marry you

336
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,080
will you marry me

337
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:14,879
I don't want to

338
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,639
What if it was Pei Yan

339
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,600
Shut up

340
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,919
So what if they have all the evidence and evidence

341
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:22,919
No way to seek justice

342
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,879
The old marquis is destined to bear the reputation of this life

343
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,440
We won

344
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,840
Don't cry

345
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:43,360
Stop crying

346
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,360
daughter

347
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,720
Did I win

348
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,320
Lan'er

349
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:02,639
You won
