1
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,000
Ah, you're awake

2
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:06,400
What are you doing

3
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,719
This is Dr. Ji Xiao

4
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:08,879
A lie tester that I taught me

5
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,599
There must be internal ghosts when the county government fires this time

6
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,640
But I've been searching for a long time but haven't found the suspect

7
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,159
No need to look for it

8
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,439
It's me

9
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,079
This is the evidence you said

10
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:53,879
yes

11
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,120
But Miss Ji has no grudges and no grudges with you

12
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,359
Why

13
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,640
I had no intention of hurting Niangzi Ji

14
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,680
I wanted to kill him

15
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,640
Three years ago

16
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,000
Many counties and counties in Suizhou have broken dams

17
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,159
People can't eat

18
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,520
Displaced

19
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,400
Major issues of people's livelihood are urgent

20
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,159
Your Majesty sent my father Song Hongjian to provide disaster relief

21
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,599
River dam collapses

22
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,360
People are living in miserable life

23
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,319
But he and the gentry raised the price of rice

24
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,879
Enjoy your personal bag

25
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,280
Prepare horse

26
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,280
I want to go to Beijing to report to the emperor

27
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,639
Daddy

28
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,400
father

29
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,719
As I wish

30
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,479
Dad can't leave

31
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:49,840
Walk

32
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,280
there

33
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,280
quick

34
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,159
Walk

35
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,319
Walk

36
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,319
What about that little one

37
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,080
search

38
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:20,400
father

39
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,520
There's something here

40
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:29,400
It's an individual

41
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,560
Carry in quickly

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,439
He stays in the East Courtyard on weekdays

43
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,919
That night I set fire in the East Courtyard

44
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,039
Unexpectedly, he actually gave the East Court to the imperial envoy

45
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,280
Stayed in the West Courtyard by myself

46
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,800
Escaped just now

47
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,360
he

48
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,680
Is it my father

49
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,159
It's exactly

50
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,879
Ah Yuan

51
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,199
Why do you want to repay your kindness and revenge?

52
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,040
What a kind of kindness will repay the revenge

53
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,040
Zhao Yan

54
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,199
Your father Zhao Peng embezzled and bribed bribes to form a clique for private affairs

55
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,279
To silence

56
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,600
He slaughtered me all over the house

57
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,240
You're talking nonsense

58
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,199
My father is a good official

59
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,920
I was going to wait for the imperial court to arrive

60
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
I'll set fire to kill him

61
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,800
Then surrender to the imperial envoy

62
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,439
When I beheaded

63
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:48,279
I'll tell you about this

64
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,680
Ask for my father

65
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,160
Now the plan is out

66
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,839
I won't let him go, either

67
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,120
The young girl Song Ruwan

68
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,439
Complaints of the county magistrate Zhao Peng

69
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,759
The young girl Song Ruwan

70
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,160
Complaints of the county magistrate Zhao Peng

71
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,360
The young girl Song Ruwan

72
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,720
Complaints of the county magistrate Zhao Peng

73
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,920
Say it

74
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,639
What's wrong

75
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,240
Song Hongjian

76
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,160
The imperial envoy who died in Suizhou back then

77
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,680
He should have been destroyed by me

78
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,480
But his daughter

79
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,800
Come to the door

80
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,199
How do you know

81
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,160
I know everything

82
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,720
omnipotent

83
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,399
I've ordered someone to lock her up

84
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,920
Unexpectedly, the Marquis of Xuanying and the doctor came back

85
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,319
Already know this

86
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,560
Now in the dungeon

87
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,879
Listen to the naughty complaining

88
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:08,240
What do you think I should do

89
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,000
write a letter

90
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:11,920
What letter

91
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:15,000
Imperial envoy Pei Yan lets rice prices rise sharply

92
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,639
Neglect of duty

93
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,199
This letter is urgent

94
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,360
Must be sent to the palace

95
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,040
If he was dismissed before you

96
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,360
How to reverse the case

97
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,120
How to judge you

98
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,480
in this way

99
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,439
I can rest assured

100
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,360
Where is Song Hongjian's corpse?

101
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,160
Aren't you omnipotent and omnipotent?

102
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,600
Don't ask me a second time

103
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,160
Do you know

104
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,680
Your account book has been sent to my husband

105
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,439
As long as I want

106
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:54,480
I can make you damn it anytime

107
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:03,199
Under the trees in the suburbs

108
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,879
Knowing that it's rainy in Suizhou

109
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,879
Dare to bury it under a tree

110
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:10,800
You'd better pray that you're lucky

111
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,759
Don't find any evidence of crime by them

112
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,439
If they know

113
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,439
Then what should I do

114
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:21,319
If they find evidence of guilt

115
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:22,800
By then

116
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,800
Kill it

117
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,560
Open the coffin and autopsy

118
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:32,639
What's wrong

119
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,920
I'm a doctor

120
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,319
Not coroner

121
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,120
The dead are followed by the living are

122
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,160
What's the difference

123
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,839
Uncle, you're scared

124
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,319
Who said I'm scared

125
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:45,600
I just don't want to

126
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,360
Digging out the ancestral tomb

127
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:48,680
Digging a coffin

128
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,279
Loss of blessings

129
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,160
You don't have to worry about this

130
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:55,079
It was this thunder that struck the forest in the eastern suburbs

131
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,360
Flip the roots

132
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,399
Take it out together with the coffin

133
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:01,199
Now the coffin has been carried to the county government

134
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,759
Where is it

135
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,279
Why didn't I see it

136
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,480
What you're shooting now

137
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,360
I'm going to make a break, I'm going to make a break

138
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,439
Unintentionally disturbed

139
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:15,600
Peace of the Dead

140
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,199
Sorry Sorry Sorry

141
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,480
Then wouldn't I die young

142
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,639
Sword

143
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,679
Start to lose your life

144
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:50,200
Report

145
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,080
There was a traitor among us and he was about to run away

146
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:54,480
I've also made an appointment

147
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,679
Have something to do

148
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,399
Can you come back to life later?

149
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,360
Please approve the Chief

150
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,840
Accurate

151
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,399
Master Hou

152
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,679
What about money

153
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,679
Half of your possessions are in the bag

154
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,000
The Marquis has other instructions

155
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,960
Very few

156
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:33,879
but

157
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,200
It should be enough

158
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,639
What's your name

159
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,960
Gou Pei

160
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,440
Brother Gou Gou

161
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,000
Since he is also a businessman

162
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,559
Be brighter

163
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,159
I heard you want to collect our rice

164
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,279
How many plans do you plan to do this

165
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,799
Two thousand texts

166
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,480
Two hundred texts

167
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,799
ridiculous

168
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Two hundred texts

169
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,720
On weekdays, you have to sell rice for 180 cents a bucket

170
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,440
A bucket of 20 yuan earns

171
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,519
Isn't it good

172
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,399
Flyhead small profit

173
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,320
It's better than losing money

174
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,720
All money is gone

175
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,440
Now the people have been eaten up by you

176
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,159
How to have money to buy rice

177
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,360
If Suizhou continues to do this

178
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,879
Your Majesty will not sit idly

179
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:36,879
Disaster relief food

180
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,120
Your rice is even less valuable

181
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,519
1,000 100

182
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,600
If you don't buy it, you'll lose it

183
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,159
Suizhou humid and heat

184
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:53,600
Everyone has stocked up so many meters in the warehouse

185
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,840
But be careful to take care of

186
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:57,960
In case of mold

187
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,799
I forgot

188
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,519
Your rice is so much that you can't put

189
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:07,080
Now it's piled up in that yard

190
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,120
Eight hundred texts

191
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,360
Scarcity is precious

192
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,200
You're not bad

193
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:16,639
But I'm short of money

194
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,639
Everything needs to be paid attention to

195
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,440
Six hundred texts

196
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,000
Didn't you just say don't go down

197
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,399
Didn't you pay the price down just now?

198
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:27,440
Five hundred texts

199
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,039
Why are there another five hundred documents

200
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:30,600
You lower the price first

201
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,960
You think it through before you talk

202
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,320
This person

203
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:32,840
Really

204
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,000
Don't cut off your money, I'll tell you

205
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,159
Didn't we agree?

206
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:38,080
If you dare to write four hundred words, I will dare to write three hundred words

207
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,279
Song Hongjian did not commit suicide by taking poison

208
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:48,039
But he killed

209
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,200
What do you plan to do next

210
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,000
There is a Shangfang sword in the palace

211
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,159
Behead the tyrant ministers

212
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:56,360
I'm going to get it

213
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,159
Speak with others

214
00:11:59,440 --> 00:11:59,960
Prepare horse

215
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,480
I'm going to sue in front of the emperor

216
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:04,200
Never let others take the lead

217
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,480
You will go to the Wang family to get food later

218
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,240
Send it from house to house

219
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,919
But tomorrow

220
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,879
What's the day after tomorrow

221
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,080
If you continue to buy rice at this high price

222
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,120
I'm afraid the Marquis' Mansion doesn't have to

223
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:18,039
Within three days

224
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,440
Rice prices will fall

225
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,720
Isn't this your carriage?

226
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:27,919
Niangzi Ji

227
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,600
where did you go

228
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,080
Evidence found

229
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,559
I'm going to enter the palace

230
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,639
good

231
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,360
Be careful on the road

232
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:49,039
Stop stop stop don't run

233
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:02,360
Don't move

234
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,840
The person is gone

235
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,440
Along the blood mark

236
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:21,960
Chase

237
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,440
Go to ask the city traditional Chinese medicine center again

238
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,360
But a woman injured by an arrow came to ask for treatment

239
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:25,759
yes

240
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:38,879
Who are you

241
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,799
Do you know this is the Princess's Mansion

242
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,519
May I ask the house

243
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,759
But there is a maid who is very favored by the princess

244
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,039
Ask her to save me

245
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,080
Go! Go! Go

246
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,519
Who is at the door

247
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:57,200
Such a big noise

248
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,200
There was a door just now

249
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,679
Suspicious person seriously injured

250
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,399
He said he wanted his beloved maid to save him

251
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,000
Who are you

252
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,879
Who are you

253
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,000
Ji Xiao

254
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:26,240
you

255
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,360
Why do you wear women's clothes

256
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,320
I like to steal women's clothes

257
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:34,639
No

258
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,720
What a strange hobby

259
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,120
but

260
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:39,879
Can accept

261
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,639
Then why are you wearing princess's clothes

262
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,360
I like to steal princess's clothes

263
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:49,399
No

264
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,600
What a strange hobby

265
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,559
but

266
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,559
very beautiful

267
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,840
Come

268
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,639
Save people

269
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,159
I'll look for a stretcher

270
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,200
Where is the stretcher on the house

271
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,240
What to do

272
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,360
Hug him

273
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,480
No, no

274
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:11,360
Wouldn't my lady be ruined

275
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,120
what to do

276
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:13,639
It hurts so much

277
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,879
Lanfu

278
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,679
superior

279
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,440
Come on Lanfu

280
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,120
Come on Lanfu

281
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,559
Come on, come on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go

282
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,320
come on

283
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:37,440
Come on, come on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go
