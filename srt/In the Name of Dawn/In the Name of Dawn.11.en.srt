1
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:58,840
Pei Yan went south to provide disaster relief

2
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,320
Let rice prices surge

3
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:01,719
The hungry people's neck

4
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:02,520
Countless dead

5
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,560
People's grievances arise everywhere

6
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,239
This handle

7
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,359
It's a pity not to hold it in your hand

8
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:10,560
Just have a clear idea in your heart

9
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:12,159
When to use it

10
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,400
How to use it

11
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,719
I don't worry

12
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,000
Don't let me down

13
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:19,120
Qiu Damei Book

14
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:23,959
Zhou Junlan

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,799
Who are you looking for

16
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,040
Zhou Junlan, come out

17
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,400
Ji Yunchao

18
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,040
What are you going to do

19
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,000
Come up

20
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:39,959
Why

21
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:41,480
I'm going to enter the palace

22
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,159
No token

23
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:43,560
But you can

24
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,239
What to do when entering the palace

25
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,480
Complaint against the emperor

26
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,439
You want me to sue you for your complaint

27
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,719
good

28
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,040
No evidence

29
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,959
Where can I sue for the imperial examination

30
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,239
Corrupt officials are rampant

31
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,159
Loyal minister dies with hatred

32
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,479
People can't eat

33
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,360
Now it is important to win or lose between you and me

34
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,560
It is still important for the survival of the people in the world

35
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,599
It's your red tape important

36
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,599
Justice that needs to be promoted is important

37
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,719
You believe me

38
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,439
Don't believe it

39
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:29,840
Why then

40
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,199
Just give it a try

41
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,479
That's all

42
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,439
What are you betting on

43
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,560
The road to saving the people is right in front of you

44
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,360
I dare you

45
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,840
Will hold the slightest

46
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,120
Walk straight

47
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,400
Give me your hand

48
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,400
Sit firmly

49
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:02,840
What did you say

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,800
Let you and me

51
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,319
Open the way for the world

52
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:26,159
You said there was something wronged in Suizhou

53
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,759
I will draft a handwritten order

54
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,639
Fei Ge's message

55
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,599
He ordered Xuan Ying to investigate the matter

56
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,560
So good

57
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,560
Birds are one step ahead of others

58
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,240
Your Majesty is thoughtful

59
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,479
So very good

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,400
As for Shangfang Sword

61
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,199
You personally delivered it to the hands of Mr. Xuanying.

62
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,879
The rest of the affairs in the court will be temporarily handled by Secretary Jiang.

63
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,879
The minister obeys the order

64
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,719
Get out

65
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,080
When to use it

66
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,159
How to use it

67
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,199
Don't let me down

68
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,400
What else

69
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,360
Nothing wrong

70
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,680
The Wei-Minister surrenders

71
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,959
Hopefully

72
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,199
I've bet right, too

73
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,199
Follow the orders of the marquis

74
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:41,319
In the past three days, my subordinates visited the city

75
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,240
Rice prices have gradually returned to normal

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,160
Pass on His Majesty's order

77
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,839
I'm going to investigate the case of Song Hongjian

78
00:04:58,879 --> 00:04:59,560
Everyone

79
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:00,879
Follow the order

80
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,800
yes

81
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,759
General Zhao Peng, the magistrate of Suizhou County, and his accomplices

82
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,240
Arrested

83
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,959
A dream of yellow beams

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,279
Wake up

85
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,079
The universe is not yet determined

86
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,199
In saying

87
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,360
It's early

88
00:05:59,199 --> 00:05:59,639
this

89
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,480
This is the death-free gold medal you gave me

90
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,199
Dissatisfied

91
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,240
satisfy

92
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:06,680
Satisfied

93
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,279
Xuan Yinghou and Na Ji Yunchao are engaged

94
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,800
She killed two people in a row just a few days after she arrived in Suizhou

95
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,600
Your Majesty ordered him to judge me

96
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,839
I took the lead in holding his life

97
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,040
God really helps me

98
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,439
God helps me too

99
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,199
There is a command in heaven

100
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:24,920
May God fulfill his will

101
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,399
No matter how torture you endure

102
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,600
Before I speak

103
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,160
You are not allowed to reveal this matter in half a word

104
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,480
remember

105
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,480
How will he judge you tomorrow

106
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,480
The story broke out in the future

107
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,879
You can force him to judge his woman

108
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,879
What a kill of two birds with one stone

109
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,439
Revenge of severe torture

110
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,040
Relieve the hatred of replacing the pillars

111
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,639
Wonderful

112
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,120
but

113
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:53,800
put

114
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,720
Xuan Yinghou is now trying to examine me

115
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,639
Lack of physical evidence in hand

116
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,279
Need to get my confession again

117
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,480
If Ji Yunchao comes back with physical evidence

118
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,879
He doesn't need to examine me

119
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,680
You can go to the court to convict

120
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,560
It only takes five days to get from Suizhou in Beijing

121
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,079
If you don't say it for five days

122
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,879
Five days later I was sent to the guillotine

123
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,040
So you plan

124
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,000
When will I say it

125
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,199
you guess

126
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,399
I guess

127
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,399
Your riddle is too long

128
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,920
I forgot as I listened

129
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,600
Could it be shorter

130
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:32,839
I said

131
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,360
I have a friend

132
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,560
She is of noble origin

133
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:38,879
Decent appearance

134
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:41,879
But she fell in love with one

135
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,160
The erratic prodigal son

136
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,319
you say

137
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:49,360
How could she make the prodigal son fall in love with her

138
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,519
I dare ask you, my friend

139
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,839
What are the conditions of this prodigal son

140
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,439
Everything is OK

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,480
But he likes to dress up as a woman

142
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,399
The family seems to be a little struggling

143
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,480
Like to dress up for women

144
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,879
I think he doesn't like women

145
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:10,600
You're talking nonsense

146
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:16,199
He hugged me the first time he saw me

147
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:19,240
Touch my face with my hands

148
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,279
That would be even worse

149
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,839
When you first meet, you can touch your feet

150
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,120
A person's character is worrying

151
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,199
but

152
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,079
You said to me just now

153
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,240
A friend of mine

154
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,559
No need to explain

155
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,200
I see

156
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,200
You got it

157
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,600
This person teased your friend first

158
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,360
Then come to tease you again

159
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,639
It can be seen that he is a big radish in a fancy way

160
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,840
Next time you see him

161
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,279
I must kick him up

162
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:54,919
Then punch him again

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,879
Slap him again

164
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,639
Where are you going

165
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:01,559
firewood

166
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,039
I have something else

167
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,480
What's the matter

168
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:07,639
May I have your name

169
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,879
March

170
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,360
We've been on the way for three days

171
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:25,399
You will be able to arrive in Suizhou in one day

172
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,200
It's late now

173
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,159
Not suitable for rushing

174
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,559
We'll take a break here

175
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,720
Depart tomorrow

176
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:33,720
I have something to understand

177
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,159
But it's okay to say

178
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:37,360
Mr. Zhou is very good at hand and eyes

179
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,919
Rice prices in Suizhou skyrocket

180
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,440
Xuan Yinghou sits silently

181
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,679
This thing

182
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,320
You've known it a long time ago

183
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,080
yes

184
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,159
Then why don't you study his book in front of His Majesty

185
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:51,360
How do you know

186
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,120
What if Your Majesty is dissatisfied with Mr. Xuanying

187
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,600
It's impossible to kill you

188
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,679
Hand over Shangfang's sword to him

189
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,879
If Xuan Yinghou really sits alone

190
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,559
There will never be a wife like you

191
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
Just fiancée

192
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,320
Many variables in life

193
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,039
Maybe the next moment

194
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:11,080
I've died

195
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:19,840
You like

196
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,720
like

197
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,440
County Magistrate Zhao is really old

198
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,720
Or should I call you

199
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,600
Wang Bowei

200
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,440
The Marquis forgets many things

201
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,159
It is inevitable to remember the name of the official incorrectly

202
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,759
How could I remember it wrong

203
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:06,480
I collected the body for my father's confidant back then

204
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,639
All the corpses were counted into the coffin

205
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:11,720
Only the coffin prepared for Wang Bowei

206
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,639
Empty

207
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,519
Maybe that person

208
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,600
Threshed into pieces

209
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,440
Suppress or

210
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,480
Being taken away by a wild dog

211
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:24,960
I still remember

212
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:26,960
That guy has a habit

213
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,240
Whenever a mistake is made in the army

214
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,639
When my father questioned

215
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,639
Always press your thumb against your index finger

216
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,519
To relieve tension

217
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:43,720
As you are

218
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,480
A person can change his name

219
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,600
Make face change

220
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,080
Can get used to it

221
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,200
But it will accompany you for life

222
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,320
Indelible

223
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,039
As the marquis said

224
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,240
People in the world who have this habit

225
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:04,000
They are all those defected generals

226
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,360
I discovered it when I first met you

227
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:12,799
Your salute is different from others

228
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,039
Just bent your knees slightly

229
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:16,240
Master Hou

230
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,080
You and the two doctors are fine

231
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:23,480
The soldiers in the army were wearing armor and were inconvenient to perform their rituals

232
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,080
Then he bent his knees slightly to show respect

233
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,720
You've been in the army

234
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,039
This time, I'm not just the case of Song Hongjian

235
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:44,519
besides

236
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,279
What happened back then

237
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,679
Mr. Zhou is just a civil servant

238
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:00,000
Not good at skill

239
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:00,960
It's reasonable

240
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,759
I guess you must be thinking now

241
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,159
It's my luck

242
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:06,960
Right

243
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:08,960
It's too dark

244
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,639
I can't see clearly

245
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,159
Then what if we fight another game

246
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,200
No need

247
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,679
You like to win

248
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,200
Then I'll teach you

249
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,200
Niangzi Ji has a marriage contract

250
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,879
Don't think about taking an arrow

251
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:02,759
put

252
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,360
Get it again

253
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,399
put

254
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:21,399
in this way

255
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:22,960
Even if you win, I'll

256
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,000
Since I like it

257
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,240
Why kill it

258
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,120
People like it

259
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,759
It's because of its skin

260
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,360
Its meat

261
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:40,840
And its bones

262
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,639
Like it

263
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,799
It's because it's weak and can be bullied

264
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,799
Because it's profitable

265
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:51,799
Because it can fill the belly

266
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,639
Isn't Mr. Zhou the same?

267
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,000
You see

268
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,080
This is the rabbit I bought from the vegetable market today

269
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,039
Be cute

270
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:13,879
It's so thin

271
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,399
You've been cheated by vendors again

272
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,240
I don't buy it to eat it

273
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,759
I'm trying to raise it

274
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,759
Raise it

275
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,879
It's also one of the dowry I'm going to marry

276
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,720
When we get married the next day

277
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:28,840
I'm going to bring it here

278
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:30,960
I also gave it a name

279
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,720
Call it a little monster

280
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,320
Because it likes to eat vegetables and leaves more than carrots

281
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,559
Steamed and braised

282
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,600
Or fry it

283
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,679
Now she is dead

284
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,919
Why do you kill all of you

285
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,080
She's dead

286
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:55,039
How can her relics be lived

287
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,080
Eat

288
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,159
Rabbit legs are the essence

289
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,320
The most meat

290
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,080
Your eyebrows look like mine

291
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:24,600
An old friend

292
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,320
Behavior is very different

293
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:29,960
Who is it

294
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,919
I forgot my name

295
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,879
Eat pepper

296
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,159
You have a bad spleen and stomach

297
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,159
I put the peppercorns in it one by one

298
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,200
Pick it all for you

299
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:00,200
No peppercorn meat

300
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,279
What else to eat it

301
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:03,360
Just eat it

302
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,200
I won't eat it anymore

303
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:06,599
You eat it yourself

304
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:08,359
good

305
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,839
I'll eat

306
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,160
Junlan

307
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:14,559
Sorry

308
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:15,720
I've poured it

309
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,759
Make it for you again

310
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:19,359
I'll eat

311
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:22,519
I'll eat
