1
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,799
Parents

2
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:00,640
You're here to stay

3
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:01,960
I'll go find them

4
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,920
Uncle, be careful

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,840
Daddy

6
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,480
haven't seen you for a long time

7
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,120
It's you

8
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,480
It's you right?

9
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,599
It's me

10
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:30,799
Ding Dynasty

11
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,079
I miss you so much

12
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:36,879
I'm going to kill you

13
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,200
I'm going to kill you

14
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,640
Is this what you want most now?

15
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:42,480
good

16
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,519
Then I wish you

17
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,280
Get what you want

18
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,599
I kill you

19
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,520
Don't look at me with such a pitiful expression

20
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,360
I want you to hate me

21
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,039
madman

22
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,599
madman

23
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,479
That's right

24
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,840
Why don't you kill me

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,400
If you take your life at this moment

26
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,039
It's not interesting

27
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,120
Just for fun

28
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,840
you guess

29
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,400
It's our Gu family

30
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,240
Do you have any deep hatred

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,759
Guess again

32
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,840
That's for Zhou Junlan

33
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,319
Just for one man

34
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,759
Just push you into a desperate situation

35
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,479
This is the ridiculous reason I have ever heard of in my life

36
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,759
That's why

37
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,400
Why

38
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,759
I don't even have the patience of half an incense stick of

39
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,960
But for your comeback

40
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,560
I've been waiting for seven days

41
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,479
But what about you

42
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,919
Confused by the false beauty in front of you

43
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,960
I'm willing to do it for the rest of my life

44
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,360
How dare you

45
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,439
Do you still remember that day at the Princess's Mansion

46
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,319
What I've said to you

47
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,879
My favorite thing to peel your skin

48
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,039
Pull out your tendons

49
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,960
Knock your bones

50
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,000
You have to get up over and over again, too

51
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:17,680
Now I just need to move my fingers

52
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,600
You can easily kill

53
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,839
But I will never

54
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,560
I want you to go to me

55
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,120
To everyone

56
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,920
A performance that is unparalleled

57
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,800
A shocking orgasm

58
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,399
Come

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,040
To me

60
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,600
revenge

61
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,240
You're a crazy person

62
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,720
Yunchao

63
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:55,560
いました

64
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,959
Meet next time

65
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,839
Don't let me down

66
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:04,519
Yunchao

67
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,240
いました

68
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,680
いました

69
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:08,639
いました

70
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,079
Yunchao

71
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,240
いました

72
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,079
How are you

73
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,480
My parents and uncle are all inside

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,800
Save them Pei Yan

75
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,079
Yunchao

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,800
Parents

77
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,959
Uncle Master

78
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,319
Fang Sheng Fang Sheng Zhen Zhen

79
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,079
Just die and live

80
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,920
It's okay, uncle

81
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,199
Not tight

82
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,959
Are you hungry

83
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,120
Feel sorry

84
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,720
Thirsty

85
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,120
Drink a little water

86
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,279
I couldn't save your parents

87
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,480
All the medicine in the valley was burned

88
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,399
We went to the clinic and there

89
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,920
Arrive in the capital soon

90
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,000
It will definitely be cured

91
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,800
Do you understand

92
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:38,879
never mind

93
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What does it mean to forget it

94
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,560
I finally saved you

95
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,000
How can I forget it

96
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,480
Yunchao

97
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,439
I want to see her

98
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,199
I know I'm almost out of reach

99
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,000
But that letter

100
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,560
I haven't sent it yet

101
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:05,839
good

102
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,839
Then go see you

103
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,959
He won't come

104
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,079
He will come

105
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,399
He won't come

106
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:26,480
He will come

107
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,800
Your Highness, he

108
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,319
Your Highness is here

109
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:29,959
He's here

110
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:30,959
real

111
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,040
but

112
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,079
But he

113
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,399
But what happened to him

114
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
He is Ji Xiao

115
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,480
What's wrong with him

116
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,879
Doctor Xuan

117
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,639
Go quickly

118
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,639
Your Highness

119
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,439
They're going to be a crime

120
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,040
If we were discovered in the palace,

121
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,600
Just say that this palace has a sudden illness and goes quickly

122
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,879
Husband

123
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,199
Is it good looking

124
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,120
Wedding clothes from eight hundred years ago

125
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,199
What to move out

126
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,680
So beautiful

127
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,240
Am I not pretty

128
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:34,720
Don't you want me anymore

129
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:36,559
You asked me to kneel down before

130
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:37,600
I'm not willing to kneel

131
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,879
Now I'm kneeling

132
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,919
I'm wearing my most beautiful clothes

133
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:43,480
You can do whatever you want me to serve you

134
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,960
I will punish you for being confined to murder your husband

135
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,759
It's the end of kindness

136
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,200
Don't you want a child

137
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,679
right

138
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,679
We want a child

139
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,080
No matter how fat or ugly I am, it doesn't matter

140
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,639
As long as you are willing to let my dad go

141
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,120
Please

142
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,080
Your daughter of a minister

143
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,440
What kind of system does this work become

144
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,080
Come

145
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,399
Put the vase and dishes in her room

146
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,320
And the hairpin on her head

147
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,039
Put them all away

148
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,159
Watch the door

149
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,399
She is not allowed to take a step

150
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,039
yes

151
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,120
Please

152
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,919
I beg you

153
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,840
Madam please let my dad go

154
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,399
Zhou Junlan

155
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,879
You're back

156
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,600
Don't kill my dad

157
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,240
Please

158
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,279
How did he

159
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,360
I am afraid of incompetence

160
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,440
Can't hold on for long

161
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,360
You can't treat him

162
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,080
This palace lets you be buried with you

163
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,759
Your Highness, you killed my whole family's life

164
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,159
Can't save him anymore

165
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:49,639
roll

166
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,720
yes

167
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,360
Ji Yunchao

168
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,120
Don't you have any medical skills?

169
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,840
I must have thought of a way to save him, right?

170
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:04,320
I

171
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,200
Right, please

172
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,000
March

173
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,200
March

174
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,960
Ji Xiao, listen well

175
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,919
I'm not a maid

176
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,240
I'm a princess

177
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,399
The Emperor's Little Sister

178
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,039
This palace will definitely think of a way to treat you

179
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,120
How to tell me

180
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,600
Sorry Sorry

181
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,279
I didn't mean to lie to you

182
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:30,720
Others like me

183
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,320
It's all because I'm Princess Qingyang

184
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,080
Only you are different

185
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,519
Can see you again

186
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,399
I have no regrets

187
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,919
I'm very painful

188
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,080
Please help me

189
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:57,919
What do you want me to do

190
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,440
help me

191
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,399
relief

192
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,360
Uncle Master

193
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,519
Please

194
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,360
I'm so painful

195
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:24,720
Come

196
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,840
Go and get the Pure Land Soup

197
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:27,960
Are you crazy

198
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,600
Do you want to watch him die

199
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,320
I don't allow it

200
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,080
Yunchao

201
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:40,919
いました

202
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:41,240
Yunchao

203
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:41,840
いました

204
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,399
Pei Yan, please help me

205
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,080
Please calm down

206
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,240
Please stop them for me

207
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:48,399
Yunchao

208
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,120
Yun Chao, you help me stop them

209
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,960
Yunchao

210
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,559
Do you want to see Ji Xiao hurt like that

211
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,679
No no

212
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,919
This palace lets him die happily

213
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,759
Always better than living in pain

214
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,600
Uncle Master

215
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,559
You guys retreat first

216
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:26,120
I don't want it, I don't want it

217
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,919
Uncle Master

218
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,200
Uncle Master

219
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:35,159
This bowl

220
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,720
It's a poison that can paralyze the nerves

221
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:40,080
Only half a stick of incense is needed for poisonous hair

222
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,879
Drink it

223
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,039
You won't hurt that much

224
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:48,600
I know

225
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,000
But can you please stop drinking

226
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,559
Can you stay with me for a while

227
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
sorry

228
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:02,039
I'm so painful

229
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,559
Feed me

230
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,559
OK

231
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,799
Don't look at me

232
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,600
You said

233
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,639
You like handsome guys

234
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,559
You're handsome

235
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,679
A handsome guy who is loved by everyone

236
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,519
Liar

237
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:11,840
How ugly I am now

238
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,200
The beauty and ugliness of the world

239
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,279
Others look at it with their eyes

240
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:18,919
I'll watch it with my heart

241
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,320
In my opinion

242
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,720
You are more handsome than all the world

243
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,480
All are a hundred times handsome

244
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,879
1,000 times

245
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,440
Isn't this what I said

246
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,480
My identity is noble

247
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,960
You and I will get married

248
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,320
You're a son-in-law, of course

249
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,600
Since you are the son-in-law

250
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,919
Yours is mine

251
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,879
What you said

252
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,200
Of course I can say

253
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,039
You're in

254
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,559
Propose to me

255
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,039
Then why are you crying

256
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:01,399
Marry me

257
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,799
Shouldn't you be happy

258
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,799
I'm not crying

259
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,879
I'm crying with joy

260
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,799
I wrote a love poem

261
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,039
It should have been given to you long ago

262
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,279
But that day

263
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:23,000
It's raining too much

264
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,360
I had to carry it with me

265
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,080
actually

266
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:36,240
That rain was my excuse

267
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,600
I

268
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,919
Sorry to show it to you

269
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,679
Then you're so embarrassed again now

270
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:47,840
fool

271
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,200
Read it to me

272
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,159
Read it to me, okay?

273
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,320
Read it to me

274
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,000
Is that good

275
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,120
I can no longer suppress the throbbing in my heart

276
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,879
The whirlwind of love swept me

277
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,200
I want to tell you

278
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,360
I like you

279
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,399
My trembling fingertips

280
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,480
Sweat on the forehead

281
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,960
Dodging eyes

282
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,319
Everyone is talking about me and I'm happy with you

283
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,079
Ji Xiao Ji Xiao

284
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,720
Can you read it to me?

285
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,960
I'd like to read it to me

286
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,440
Ji Xiao
