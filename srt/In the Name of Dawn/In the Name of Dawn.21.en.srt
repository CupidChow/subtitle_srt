1
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,200
lady

2
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,240
Shangshu Jiang and Langjun Zhou had important matters to discuss

3
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:00,600
Let's go find them now

4
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,799
Isn't it bad?

5
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,719
Is Shangshu Jiang in there?

6
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,680
Is he finished working?

7
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,640
Report to Mrs.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,519
Shangshu Jiang has just left

9
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,480
Why is my father here

10
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,359
Leave without saying hello to me

11
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,760
Maybe there is something urgent

12
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:19,879
Lang Jun

13
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,519
I see what Jiang Shangshu said is not unreasonable.

14
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,079
Now is the weakest time for the rebels

15
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,599
Why don't you take advantage of the victory and chase

16
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,599
Kill them all

17
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,359
Your Majesty will surely be happy

18
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:30,680
What do you know

19
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,599
There is no one in the court right now

20
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:33,920
The bandits are in trouble

21
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:36,120
If I destroy them all

22
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:37,519
Will he use me?

23
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,560
But if Your Majesty wants to appoint Jiang Shangshu

24
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,719
How did the old marquis die?

25
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,040
How could he die

26
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,319
So what if I deprive me of my power

27
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,000
The death of Jiang's surname

28
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,519
Who can still take on the heavy responsibility

29
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,599
But Shangshu Jiang is highly respected

30
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,439
I'm afraid it's not easy to frame him

31
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,159
His daughter is in my hands

32
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:55,920
Father and daughter

33
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,680
One will die anyway

34
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,799
Guess how he would choose

35
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,680
Father

36
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:25,919
This lady

37
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,680
This is not a place you can come

38
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,240
I'm looking for Song Nanfei

39
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,800
I advise you to leave quickly

40
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,960
Song Nanfei rolls out

41
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,759
Zhao Yan

42
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,599
Do you still remember who it is

43
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,080
Did your family die?

44
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,680
Are you not the same as them

45
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,879
Don't be ungrateful

46
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,000
I wanted to protect your father

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,520
But he tried his best

48
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,639
Just been blocked by a traitor

49
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,080
But now

50
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,159
Xuan Yinghou has become a fugitive

51
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:06,080
He and Ji Yunchao fled to the Medicine King Valley overnight

52
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,879
This is the best time for you to take revenge

53
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,520
You want to take revenge

54
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,680
I can lead the way for you

55
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,960
The old emperor wants to live forever

56
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,520
Even he doesn't know where the Medicine King Valley is

57
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,120
What's more, you're just a woman

58
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:23,319
I know everything

59
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,360
Why should I believe you

60
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,199
Song Ruyuan's kite is a swallow pattern

61
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,199
There is a small hole in it that you accidentally poked

62
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,800
Then it's made up

63
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,879
Why did you know

64
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,400
Knowing means knowing

65
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,520
As I know

66
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,680
You're not angry

67
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,960
Know where they are escaping

68
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,479
Know how you want to take revenge

69
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,879
What do you want me to do

70
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,399
I really didn't expect

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,519
I can still enjoy it in my life

72
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,920
What about the medicine that the Marquis personally feeds

73
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,319
yes

74
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:27,399
So you have to get better quickly

75
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,240
Oh well

76
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,720
After I'm done

77
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,120
I'll repay you well

78
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,079
How to repay

79
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,000
Yunchao

80
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,680
Take a good rest first

81
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,680
I'll wash the medicine bowl

82
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,199
Stop Ji Xiao yelling there again

83
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,959
Xian'er

84
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,399
Why did you come here

85
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,399
You've left for more than a month

86
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,000
I miss you

87
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,600
you say

88
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,079
You miss me

89
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,720
You are my fucking mother

90
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,160
Of course I miss you

91
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:23,040
This is my purpose

92
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,560
The tea I asked someone to bring you

93
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,360
Named Huangliang Yimeng

94
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,879
It is said that the tea water made from it

95
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,199
Very beautiful

96
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,120
The one who drank it

97
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,759
I feel sad and lost

98
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,560
It's like a big dream

99
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,879
Try it

100
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,040
This tea

101
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,879
Do you have to drink it?

102
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,800
daughter

103
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,639
Does your husband still have a headache

104
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,399
I've decocted the medicine for you

105
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,759
Do you want to drink

106
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,040
Take it

107
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:30,959
good

108
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,240
What's wrong

109
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,160
nothing

110
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,439
I

111
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,839
Looking at Sister Qiu

112
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,720
She didn't know where she's been in the past few days

113
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,519
Only you and me are left at home

114
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,600
Isn't it good

115
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,399
Naturally good

116
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,000
Yue'er

117
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,759
We can start over

118
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:12,639
good

119
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,240
Husband, I'll feed you medicine

120
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,600
It's not good to get cold in a while

121
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,240
What's wrong

122
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,120
Why don't you drink

123
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,320
Drink the poison you gave me

124
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,360
Why did you know

125
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,039
One wrong step

126
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,360
Step by step

127
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,480
Do you repent

128
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,720
What's wrong with me

129
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,879
No regrets or regrets

130
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,720
There's something for mom

131
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,559
Haven't told you

132
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,279
You are my biological daughter

133
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:37,240
I'm a good woman

134
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,039
Being caught by bandits

135
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,440
To survive

136
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,159
Have to greet them

137
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,360
then

138
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,240
Then you

139
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,679
Then a caravan passed by and saved me

140
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,799
I fell in love with the businessman

141
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,480
But I'm afraid he thinks I'm an unclean body

142
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,039
Let you

143
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,440
Leave it in the cottage

144
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:01,000
Go back to Beijing with him

145
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:05,039
He also became Gu Chaochao's cheap stepmother

146
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,639
Gu Chaochao's biological mother died of dying

147
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,000
When you see her

148
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,120
She's only three years old

149
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:17,799
I thought you were her biological mother

150
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,799
You're living a life of luxury

151
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:26,120
Until I saw me in the slavery market

152
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,000
You recognized my birthmark

153
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,159
Suddenly feeling guilty

154
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:34,320
But I don't dare to save me

155
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,919
So you design

156
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,639
Let Gu Chaochao feel pity for me

157
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,919
Buy me

158
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,919
Be her maid

159
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,320
You know everything

160
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,759
Unforgettable forever

161
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:56,840
I'll do it

162
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:59,360
It is to set fire to the valley

163
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,240
Force Ji Yunchao to return to Beijing

164
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,799
Walk on the road to climb the sky that I paved for her

165
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,679
Less than half an hour

166
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,159
This will be a sea of fire

167
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,360
I'll give you a big show

168
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,399
Talk about filial piety

169
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,919
You've laughed

170
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:29,840
I'm smiling

171
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,399
It's because I'm doing well

172
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,840
All conditioned laws

173
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,320
Like a dream bubble

174
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,480
Like dew and electricity

175
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,600
This should be viewed

176
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,600
It's you

177
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,120
What do you want to do

178
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,240
I want you to taste it too

179
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,759
The taste of being separated from the life and death of the beloved person

180
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,840
What do you mean

181
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,320
Yunchao
