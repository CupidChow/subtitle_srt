1
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,239
This is a prescription carefully prepared by the young woman

2
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:19,799
Wet once a day

3
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,079
It takes three days to recover

4
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,760
Go down to receive the reward

5
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,079
Thank you Your Highness

6
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:28,359
Xian

7
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:30,959
Xian'er

8
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,599
Your mouth is so pouting that it can hang an oil pot

9
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,719
The sugar cake is cold

10
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,159
Can't drink tea

11
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:38,879
Suffocated

12
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,719
We're riding horses

13
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:42,599
good

14
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,760
Give me your hand

15
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,560
Wait for Xian'er

16
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,640
hand

17
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,200
Xian'er obedient

18
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,400
obedient

19
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,800
It's you

20
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,599
Listen to me

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,680
hand

22
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:25,960
good

23
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,680
Xian'er

24
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,639
This poison is called "Han Xiao Banzhu Epileptic"

25
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,280
You try the poison with me

26
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,919
It's colorless and odorless

27
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,479
Oral application and smell

28
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,360
It will cause rashes all over the body

29
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,560
Take the antidote and it will be eliminated

30
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,159
Why is it called "Han Xiao Half-Step" ejaculation

31
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,599
I like

32
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,800
Ding Dynasty

33
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,400
Reunited after a long time

34
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,280
I've prepared a generous gift for you

35
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:21,639
Sister Qingyang

36
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,319
This is the fragrance I brought back from Jiangnan.

37
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,360
How do you smell it

38
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,719
Pork Fragrance

39
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,680
Beautiful natural

40
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,800
Look, I'm so nice to you

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,639
I lost to you yesterday's silver

42
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,439
No talk

43
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,120
The princess's time is almost done

44
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,280
Let's prepare to uncover the medicine

45
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,840
good

46
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,560
Qingyang Qingyang

47
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,120
My good sister

48
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,520
The money for horse riding yesterday is not discussed

49
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,639
Who wants to ask for money from you

50
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,280
I'll help you remove the medicine.

51
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,479
not good

52
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,599
I'll let my husband

53
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,639
Let me introduce you to some handsome colleagues

54
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:01,840
good

55
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,680
This incident is not a child's story

56
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,479
Nothing tolerate nonsense

57
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,120
You just teach me

58
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,400
Princess Qingyang

59
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,879
Niangzi Ji's medical skills are superb

60
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,520
Have you here and I feel at ease

61
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:27,680
Then let's start

62
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,800
After wet the surroundings

63
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,879
Just remove it gently

64
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:42,959
Sister, your face

65
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,000
My face

66
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,319
Why are there so many rashes

67
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,959
Oh my God, that wasn't yesterday

68
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,199
My face is peeling

69
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:51,639
It's because of peeling

70
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:52,839
My hands

71
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,079
No problem

72
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,480
Is Madam Ji suspicious of me?

73
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,279
It's clear that your medicine is not clean

74
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,199
If so

75
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,519
On my face and hands

76
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,600
It should also be covered with red rash

77
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,920
Maybe you took the medicine first

78
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,079
I think you just want to give

79
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,399
A fiance in prison

80
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Let's exclaim

81
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,000
you

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,759
Where is the person coming

83
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,720
Take Ji Yunchao down

84
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,040
yes

85
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,160
There is something wrong with the princess

86
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,600
Princess

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,800
Princess Princess

88
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:24,480
open

89
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:25,680
Princess

90
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,519
Can poison the incense burner

91
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,279
The easiest thing to show your feet

92
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,959
That husband thinks

93
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:35,720
Where should this poison be?

94
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,000
Xuan Yinghou is in prison

95
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,360
You're not as good as you

96
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,000
Husband and wife follow

97
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,279
You two are quite matched

98
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,160
Thank you for the praise

99
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,560
The world's vulgarity

100
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:00,879
All you have ever wanted is nothing but glory

101
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,920
Can be extravagant

102
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,120
Happy morning and evening

103
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,439
Nothing less than something that makes me happy

104
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,759
What do you guess it is

105
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,199
Repentance

106
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:15,920
Yes

107
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,399
My favorite thing to peel your skin

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,399
Pull out your tendons

109
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,160
Knock your bones

110
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,079
See you get up again and again

111
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,639
Tonight I will be sentenced to Princess Qingyang

112
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:47,680
Ask you something

113
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,240
My life

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,279
It's your broken spine

115
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,319
Someone is here

116
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,120
Don't

117
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,120
Don't cry

118
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,319
I'm most afraid of girls crying

119
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,079
Little lady

120
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,399
Do you know where Dr. Ji was locked up

121
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,160
I look like a little lady

122
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,720
certainly

123
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,279
Still a pretty lady

124
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,560
But my face

125
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,279
The beauty and ugliness of the world

126
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:30,959
They look at it with their eyes

127
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,279
I'll watch it with my heart

128
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,720
If it's like Princess Qingyang

129
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,279
Don't find out the truth

130
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,799
He arrested a doctor who saved lives and was injured

131
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,519
It's not beautiful

132
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,759
It was the man who deliberately ruined her face

133
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,200
I went out with Doctor Ji and I

134
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,080
Know her character

135
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,919
She's definitely not a dirty guy

136
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,200
Then you are planning to rob the prison now

137
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:54,320
yes

138
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,080
She has an old disease

139
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,159
I'm afraid that the princess will abuse her lynching

140
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,799
She can't stand it

141
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,320
Princess Qingyang is not such a ruthless person

142
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,240
This is not good

143
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,559
Since you are with Mr. Ji

144
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,559
Then you know how to treat the face

145
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Human life is at stake

146
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,480
You asked me to give you a face now

147
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,679
I am the most favored maid of Princess Qingyang

148
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,279
You cured my face

149
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:24,360
I'll plead with the princess for you

150
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,000
Let her go

151
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,399
It's so tolerant

152
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,799
But you can do better

153
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,720
As you wish

154
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:50,559
Sister Qingyang

155
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:51,440
I've vented for you

156
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,279
Are you happy

157
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,360
There is a hero who follows your formula

158
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,399
My face has been cured

159
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,159
He said the reason why my face peeled off

160
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:01,200
It's because your ointment has

161
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,440
The effect of peeling and changing face

162
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,200
Feel sorry

163
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,799
Before the matter is found out

164
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,200
Let you suffer from this flesh and blood

165
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,240
This palace will definitely investigate this matter to the end

166
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:11,799
in addition

167
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:14,600
The Xuanying Hou has recovered his freedom

168
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,440
Thank you Your Highness

169
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,120
Niangzi Ji

170
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,480
Please come back first

171
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:30,840
No

172
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,279
I have another person to be a doctor

173
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,279
Who do you want to treat

174
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,639
Really murderous

175
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,440
You doubt me

176
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:46,960
then

177
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:49,320
I'm under the careful guidance of Niang Zi Ji

178
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,440
The medicinal mud exposed to Sister Qingyang

179
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:52,639
Yes, Madam Ji

180
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,919
Everything used when Japanese Palace

181
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,279
All of them you've checked

182
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:01,799
What if she hides the poison on her cuff

183
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,960
cuff

184
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,559
This person applied poison to the cuffs in advance

185
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,840
After washing your hands

186
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,159
Roll up your sleeves and get poisoned

187
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,679
Touch your highness again

188
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,000
Afterwards, the girl checked the water again

189
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,679
But because there is no poison in the water

190
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,600
So no abnormality was detected

191
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,840
interesting

192
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,639
Can have certificates

193
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,080
Mrs. Qiu

194
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:31,039
What about the rash on your hands

195
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,399
Of course it's good

196
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,200
Yeah

197
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:36,960
Niangzi Ji

198
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,679
Since you are a doctor

199
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,440
You should understand that everyone has different physiques

200
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,200
Maybe I'm getting better

201
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,039
Since you doubt me

202
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,240
You should come up with a decent voucher

203
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:48,759
Let's talk about it

204
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:50,759
My sister and I are like my sister

205
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,799
Why do I harm her

206
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,559
Then can you let me check your cuffs

207
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:57,919
My wife, Secretariat

208
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,840
Why do you, a doctor, test it if you say it

209
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:02,960
Don't dare

210
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,679
It's me

211
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,240
Orchid

212
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:20,519
Why

213
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,519
Your Highness is irritable and irritable

214
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,440
Capricious

215
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,799
Always very strict with servants

216
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,279
I'm just obsessed with it

217
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,000
Just want a little revenge

218
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:31,440
Pull it down

219
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,200
Is it true that I shouldn't have

220
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,919
You shouldn't do such a confused thing

221
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:36,799
Your Highness

222
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,159
Walk

223
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:37,840
Your Highness

224
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:39,919
Your Highness

225
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:43,519
It seems that I misunderstood Mrs. Qiu

226
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,120
Since the real murderer has been found

227
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,000
Then I'll say goodbye first

228
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,320
Niangzi Ji stays

229
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:00,480
Sister Qingyang is in ill health

230
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,759
You and I are anxious

231
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,360
Mutual misunderstandings are inevitable

232
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:07,039
Xian'er respectfully asks His Highness to be a testimony

233
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:14,639
I drink this wine with Niangzi Ji and I

234
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,600
Turn swords into jade silk

235
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,039
Very good

236
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:28,440
You're afraid that this wine will be poisonous

237
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:48,559
It seems

238
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
Madam Ji doesn't want to forgive me

239
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,519
right

240
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,320
I don't want to

241
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:24,639
Liver Qi stagnation

242
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,320
Heart-to-heart disconnect

243
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,440
Your old disease has relapsed

244
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,320
Need to release blood and poison

245
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,600
Even though you have no chance of life

246
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,000
Be cautious

247
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,559
Keep personal care

248
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,480
This kid is dizzy again

249
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,840
Come and hold it

250
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,759
The door is there

251
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,799
Let's play by yourself

252
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,600
I'm clumsy

253
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,320
I'll have a doctor who went out to decoct medicine

254
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:02,720
As for blood dizziness

255
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,519
If you need help

256
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,240
Not convenient to open

257
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:32,080
Just pull the hairband

258
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,720
I've been there all the time

259
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,240
That's true

260
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:41,879
Just use timid therapy

261
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,440
Treat his blood dizziness

262
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,840
Uncle, please go out first

263
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:48,200
I'll go out

264
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,039
Doctor Ji

265
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,240
The door is there

266
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,279
Let's go play

267
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,320
Close your eyes
