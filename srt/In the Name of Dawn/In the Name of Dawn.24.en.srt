1
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,879
Qiu Xianer

2
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,280
I figured it out

3
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:15,799
You come out for me

4
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,760
Qiu Xianer

5
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:28,239
If I'm dead now

6
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,640
Are you happy

7
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:36,799
come out

8
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:40,840
I figured it out

9
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,640
The day I am getting married begins

10
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:53,760
wrong

11
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,920
We met you and I since childhood.

12
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,920
You've been manipulating me secretly

13
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,879
once Upon a time

14
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,400
You can kill me with one blow

15
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,400
You let me go again and again

16
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,759
You've pushed me to a desperate situation

17
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,560
Let's see how I resist stubbornly

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,120
So far

19
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,120
Every time I win

20
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,159
You mean it, right?

21
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:24,719
yes

22
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
So what

23
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,560
Why

24
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,360
You were only seven years old when I first met you

25
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,759
Seven years old

26
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,159
A seven-year-old child

27
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,919
How can you be so far-sighted

28
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,680
What exactly are you

29
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,919
I'm the one who holds the writing

30
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,400
You and this world

31
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:58,240
It's just a story in my writing

32
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,520
You are an outsider

33
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,159
Why does it appear in this book

34
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,759
This book is halfway through

35
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,159
I'll lose inspiration

36
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,319
I have to put my pen and sleep

37
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,479
I closed my eyes that night

38
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,360
When you open your eyes again

39
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,879
Born here

40
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,960
Become Qiu Xianer

41
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:25,159
You and I can only predict the future in the first half of the year

42
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,120
It's because I only wrote half of the story

43
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,879
Runan Rebellion

44
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,039
It's where I stop writing

45
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,280
Afterward

46
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,520
You and I know nothing about the future

47
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,599
Then why is it me

48
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,400
Why do you go against me?

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,919
Keep my relatives and friends around me

50
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,960
Everyone is killed

51
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,159
I'm a supporting role

52
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,960
You're the protagonist

53
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,280
I'm stupid

54
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,360
vanity

55
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:56,039
No shame

56
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:59,439
It is to highlight your intelligence and tenacity

57
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,719
Orchid heart

58
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,919
I'll take everything from you

59
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,520
It's to make you hate me

60
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,159
in this way

61
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,879
Only then can you and I join hands

62
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,479
Write this perfect ending

63
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,279
Pei Yan pleaded guilty to the rebellion

64
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,120
Make yourself king

65
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,040
solitary

66
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,000
Would rather die than surrender

67
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,959
Jiang Wenji was surprised to hear about the palace change

68
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,759
Entry into the palace to protect the car

69
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,600
Deadly killed

70
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,680
Prepare horse quickly

71
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:41,759
At this time, I entered the palace rashly

72
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,600
May be in danger of life

73
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,439
My husband thinks three times

74
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,759
Go quickly

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,480
yes

76
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:56,959
Very ugly

77
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,000
This is when I'm waiting for you to come back

78
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,680
A hairband that I learned to embroider

79
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,040
Like it

80
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,199
I found it

81
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:33,360
You rarely mention your hometown to me

82
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:35,360
Wait until everything is settled

83
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,560
I'll tell you again

84
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,360
One word is determined

85
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,959
One word is determined

86
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:52,839
You broke your promise

87
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,639
Zhou Junlan heard

88
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,959
Pei Yan has led the rebels to attack the city and plunder the land

89
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,439
All thoughts are gone

90
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,720
Dangling the beam to commit suicide

91
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,920
And you

92
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,959
You will witness Pei Yan becoming the throne

93
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,480
Torture me in every way

94
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,879
Revenge of that knife

95
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,160
After March

96
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,040
You're called the queen

97
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,600
But he died of illness that night

98
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,639
All of this

99
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,399
All are your destiny

100
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,720
People have a time to go against the will of heaven

101
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,079
There is no way out

102
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,399
I don't believe in any destiny

103
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,920
My life

104
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,839
Only I have the final say

105
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,040
Nirvana rebirth and return to Beijing to revenge

106
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:32,480
Hanging a pot to save the world and help the whole life

107
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,720
Run thousands of miles to fight for the war

108
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,319
Go to the meeting alone without regard for life and death

109
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:44,079
The reason why I can stand here today

110
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:45,879
Not your contribution

111
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,600
But myself

112
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:50,800
A way to break through the life of the swearing to death

113
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,759
I can change the past

114
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:56,000
What's wrong with changing the future

115
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,519
Just ant

116
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,600
Want to change your fate against the will of heaven

117
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,439
The Greatest Heaven and Earth

118
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,439
Jiugai Batu

119
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:06,720
So what

120
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,560
Jingwei fills the sea

121
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,959
Yugong moved mountains

122
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,480
I'm that little ant

123
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,839
Can also shake the world

124
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,120
Do you know

125
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,360
Your current ambition

126
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,840
It's also a part of my finale

127
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,320
The universe is not yet determined

128
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,840
Everything is unknown

129
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,320
I Ji Yunchao

130
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:44,679
Never be your slave

131
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,840
But the master of fate

132
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,440
You're crazy

133
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,279
I've won

134
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,360
Even if you die

135
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,519
I'm not as good as you wish

136
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,559
No

137
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,440
No

138
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,879
Just a little short of the perfect ending

139
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,519
a little

140
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:30,159
Ji Yun is coming to you

141
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:32,360
How dare you fool me like this

142
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:36,000
From me on the way back to Beijing

143
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,240
Now almost alone

144
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:42,919
My relatives and friends

145
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,440
A bright future for youth

146
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,960
Go away from me one by one

147
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,159
My life now

148
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,120
All of them are also given up

149
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,879
You are not allowed to die

150
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,600
I'll put all my energy into you

151
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,799
I love you so much

152
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,360
Ding Dynasty

153
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,320
You don't allow it

154
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,480
Even if you live for a lifetime

155
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,639
I will never repeat the same mistake

156
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,639
Even if you don't reach the sky

157
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,759
Can kill God

158
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,200
good

159
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,039
Very good

160
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:58,759
That knife

161
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,320
Return me to you

162
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,759
いました

163
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,759
いました

164
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:37,879
The evil spirit has been eliminated

165
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:41,080
I welcome your highness to the Supreme Lord as the Chief Executive

166
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,200
Long live my emperor

167
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,399
You have heard the story of lotus box

168
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,039
Haven't heard of the lotus cake yet

169
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,600
A long time ago

170
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:28,000
Nezha offended the Dragon King

171
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,480
Self-destruction and crime

172
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:35,080
Taiyi Zhenren is looking for lotus root

173
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,360
Be his body

174
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,840
Previously

175
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:45,919
Nezha pulled the dragon tendon of Ao Bing, the son of the Dragon King

176
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,600
Ao Bing died

177
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:51,440
This day

178
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:55,639
Nezha and Ao Bing had a quarrel in the Heavenly Court

179
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,120
The two of them fought together

180
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:02,799
Turned into lotus root cake (C)

181
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,879
You will be in the future

182
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,799
Don't you want to eat lotus root cakes anymore

183
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,000
Good causes and good results

184
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,639
The law of nature is clear

185
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,919
Why did the Marquis cry

186
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:30,679
if

187
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,440
We can all let go of our hatred soon

188
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,600
Is everything going to be different

189
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:41,759
Member Sadayoshi

190
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,480
One period of prayer

191
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,200
The wind is blowing

192
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:06,600
Yunchao

193
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,159
We're going home

194
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:29,679
The end of the play

195
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,720

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,360
Ji Yunchao

197
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,080
You did it right

198
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,519
It was you who ruined me

199
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:08,440
You come out

200
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,919
You come out

201
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:11,360
Dr. Ji

202
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:12,960
Patient with bed 6 abnormality

203
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,960
Zhou Junlan

204
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:19,679
You're not dead

205
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:21,440
We're villains

206
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,559
The villain should die

207
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:24,320
You're not a villain

208
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,200
You're just a patient

209
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:26,600
Calm down, calm down, I'm

210
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,720
I'm the one who created that world

211
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:30,240
I

212
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,200
I know everything

213
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,399
omnipotent

214
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:34,360
I am

215
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,200
Listen to me

216
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,039
You're trapped

217
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,320
In the obsession with creating a perfect story

218
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:39,399
Sit at the table day after day to write

219
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:41,159
Three years five years seven years

220
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,720
You're becoming more paranoid

221
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,440
until

222
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:44,879
Mental collapse

223
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:52,480
You are not dead

224
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,720
No

225
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:00,080
You shouldn't be here

226
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:02,480
You're the one who wants to be a queen

227
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,720
How can you survive here?

228
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,600
Give her a dose of peace

229
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,840
You shouldn't be here

230
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,519
Is it true or true

231
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,639
Not the story I wrote

232
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,720
It's true

233
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,320
You're back

234
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,120
Come on, come and take revenge on me

235
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,919
Come on

236
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,279
You come

237
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:28,279
Hold her down

238
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,360
What are you doing

239
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,240
Help

240
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,000
Help

241
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,919
This knife

242
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,000
Return me to

243
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,640
Return you
