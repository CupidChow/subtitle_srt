1
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:56,719
I've heard

2
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,039
You are the maid picked up by the Zhao family

3
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,079
yes

4
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,600
I've heard it

5
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,680
You were dying on the streets before

6
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,359
It was Zhao Yan who took you to the clinic

7
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,239
Zhao Peng pays for your treatment

8
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,159
yes

9
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,560
To be fair

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,040
How the Zhao family's father and son treat you

11
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:22,799
They treat me

12
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,560
very good

13
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,200
Zhao Peng is your master

14
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,040
It's your life-savior again

15
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,760
But you set fire in the house where he stayed forever

16
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,079
Fortunately, Zhao Peng exchanged houses with others

17
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,159
Escaped just now

18
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,359
Then you sued him in the county yard

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,159
Because of what you did

20
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:49,799
Now Zhao Peng's death is approaching

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,439
This woman will repay her kindness with her.

22
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:56,079
To bring her benefactor, son

23
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,400
Sent to the execution ground

24
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,319
The servant rebels to death

25
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,079
According to our law

26
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,200
What should sin be

27
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,519
Sin should

28
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,000
When to kill

29
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,759
Beyond the law

30
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,800
More humane

31
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,919
Here is a big solution

32
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,240
As long as the marquis can sentence him at his discretion

33
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:25,080
Let Zhao Peng make a statement

34
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,520
This way you won't have to die

35
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:35,919
I know

36
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,599
I know he is guilty

37
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,599
His sins are unforgivable

38
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,680
You can punish him for being whipped and exiled

39
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,360
Even for generations of slavery

40
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,840
I can accept it

41
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,159
Just beg you to spare their lives

42
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,719
I am willing to tie a circle in the next life

43
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:53,960
Repay your kindness

44
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,879
I'm begging you

45
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,240
Please

46
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,039
He's not a good official

47
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,840
But he is my father after all

48
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,560
You don't win

49
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,280
I'll never lose

50
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,520
Yeah

51
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,479
The current convicted daughter Song Ruyuan

52
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,520
Zhao Yan

53
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,039
Do you remember

54
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,079
The day you and I first met

55
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,319
You said you want to take me home

56
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:23,639
I remember

57
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:24,959
I remember

58
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,360
On the 18th birthday

59
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,680
I made a wish

60
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,720
You promised me

61
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,040
May you use your life's good luck

62
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,319
All my wishes will come true

63
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:38,959
did you know

64
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,519
What I want

65
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,040
Have you grown old together

66
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,079
No, Zhao Yan

67
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,439
I want to go home

68
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,160
go home

69
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:56,879
But my home is not here

70
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,439
My home

71
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
In a very far

72
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:04,959
Ah Yuan

73
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,439
Ah Yuan

74
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,639
Ah Yuan

75
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,160
Ah Yuan

76
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:12,720
Ah Yuan

77
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,560
She took poison in advance

78
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,600
This poison has no solution

79
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,680
I'm too lazy to make a comeback

80
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,759
Ah Yuan

81
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,240
That day

82
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,040
You also read a poem

83
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:59,480
Can you read it again

84
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,800
He is looking for if

85
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:10,319
Same gonoyuki

86
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,399
This life is considered a white hair

87
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,959
I Song Ru Wan

88
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:30,439
Finally got what you want

89
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,720
Ah Yuan

90
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,160
Ah Yuan

91
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,480
Zhao Peng formed a clique for private affairs

92
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,040
Corruption and bribery

93
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,639
Fish and meat

94
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,519
Destroy loyal

95
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:57,759
Illumination

96
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:00,839
cut

97
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:23,319
She won this time

98
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,399
Just win

99
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,519
You can understand the future

100
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,040
Why did he lose to her

101
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,160
What are you doing

102
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,199
Thin skinny

103
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,560
How can you say such shameless words

104
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:42,439
I'm busy traveling around in Suizhou

105
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,160
The chance to defeat Pei Yan is smashed to you like raindrops

106
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,120
It's you

107
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,199
Go away one by one

108
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,600
All the mistakes are on me

109
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:53,639
Otherwise

110
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,959
This is fresh

111
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:57,160
In the past, Ji Yunchao won you half a point

112
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,279
You yelled in front of me

113
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:00,839
Why is it now

114
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,959
I'm so idle and elegant to tease me

115
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,519
Could it be that this failure will make you

116
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,319
Great mood

117
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,240
How could it be

118
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,519
Why don't you dare to look at me

119
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:16,079
Not seeing or feeling upset

120
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,519
Meet a new love

121
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,160
Naturally, I can't tolerate old love

122
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:24,240
It's clear that you have a ulterior motive and don't want to help

123
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,439
I will lose to Pei Yan

124
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,879
いました

125
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,200
I see

126
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,600
You don't care about my life or death

127
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,759
It's already found a way out from him

128
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,879
why are you laughing

129
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,000
How stupid you laugh at me

130
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:49,080
It seems to be in your eyes

131
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,399
I just think about it all day long

132
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:53,120
Fighting for men with Ji Yunchao

133
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:57,519
Could it be money, power and fame

134
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,440
Land turtle

135
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,159
Pretend to behave

136
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:03,320
I exposed you, you rode a donkey and looked for a horse.

137
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,320
Being angry

138
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,360
Is it over or not

139
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,919
Can you find another way out

140
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,600
I'm naturally

141
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,279
Yano

142
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,080
how so

143
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,799
Just curious

144
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,399
I'm not asking about this

145
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,480
Why do you want it

146
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:43,360
Watch her die

147
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:47,159
Say you didn't

148
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:48,919
I have

149
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:49,919
You said no

150
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,600
I believe it

151
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:52,799
I have

152
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,480
You've met her privately

153
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,519
It was then that you knew her plan

154
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:02,720
When did you know

155
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,399
You were in court just now

156
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,440
I heard you say

157
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:11,120
Song Ruwan, I remember you said

158
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,399
Ling Zun is born with six fingers

159
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,279
You and her only met once in the fire

160
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,519
She was unconscious at the rest of the time

161
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:21,000
Wake up and surrender

162
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
In jail

163
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,240
When did you

164
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,919
When she rushed into the sea of fire to save me

165
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,720
Don't sleep and follow me

166
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,279
Feel sorry

167
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,399
I don't know if you live in this house

168
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,639
I know what you want to do

169
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:37,679
I can help you

170
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,159
Where did you know

171
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,799
From me

172
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:44,639
In the dream

173
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:47,600
Why not save her

174
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:50,159
Even if you try it

175
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,759
You're going to take her life

176
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,159
I'll take her life

177
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:55,240
It's because of the law

178
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,039
Contradictory

179
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:57,039
I have to take

180
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,879
But what about you

181
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:00,639
What are you doing for

182
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,720
I want you to help me defeat Zhou Junlan

183
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,559
You want me to argue for your father for you

184
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:10,000
We each have their own ambitions

185
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:12,600
All must rely on power to get what you want

186
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,120
Go up

187
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,799
There will inevitably be difficulties and obstacles along the way

188
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,200
No matter how you do everything behind your back

189
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,559
You must be open and upright in front of others

190
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,240
Killing her will make me lose the hearts of the people

191
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,759
You don't want to hinder me because of this

192
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:30,720
No

193
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,679
It's your way to heaven

194
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:37,960
You won't help her when you die

195
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,759
I'm not helping her

196
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,840
I just respect her own choice

197
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:44,320
What's wrong

198
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:47,679
This is

199
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,320
Where her heart wants

200
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:51,519
in this way

201
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,960
You can ignore life

202
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:56,759
Then what about me

203
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,200
Is it in your heart

204
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:01,240
I'm just a chess piece

205
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,919
You let me give birth

206
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:04,879
You made me die

207
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:08,360
I'll die

208
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,480
I'll help you gain power, but there's another idea.

209
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,360
Not for you

210
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,360
But you use it for me

211
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,440
Say you are not

212
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,759
I

213
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,320
have no idea

214
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,000
You're looking for me

215
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,799
Is there anything to say

216
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,000
I know

217
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:36,759
You have been working for many years to overturn the verdict for the old marquis

218
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,480
You guessed it right

219
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,960
What happened back then was indeed strange

220
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,720
Death is coming

221
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,960
I'm willing to speak now

222
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,279
I can take everything I know

223
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,320
Tell you all

224
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,440
But you have to promise me one thing

225
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,080
Let's listen

226
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,480
If it is another day

227
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,759
My son is on the dead end

228
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:10,519
Can you help me

229
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,759
I promise you

230
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,279
Two pictures of the Tianxia City Defense

231
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:26,879
One in the palace

232
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,960
One in the camp

233
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,919
The city defense map in the camp that year

234
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:34,559
It's really not the old marquis who leaked it

235
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,799
Because of

236
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,759
On me

237
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,919
This picture

238
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,519
Not seemingly complete

239
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:55,759
Except me

240
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,440
Another person

241
00:14:57,879 --> 00:14:58,519
who

242
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,320
I don't know this person either

243
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,879
I was involved in the camp.

244
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,480
The old marquis was stolen to prevent the drawings from being stolen

245
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,519
Print the drawings separately

246
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:09,879
My back and this person

247
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,679
Burn the original image again

248
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,600
Just because I'm afraid of knowing it carefully

249
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,759
Steal the full picture of the drawings

250
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:16,919
and you

251
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,960
I'm not captured

252
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:21,799
The Hu people won our army back then

253
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,440
perhaps

254
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,120
Maybe this person betrayed the old marquis

255
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,519
Then how can I find him

256
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,039
Think of that year

257
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,799
At the beginning of each month

258
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,919
All the soldiers will go out to buy them once

259
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,200
Most of them are tobacco snubs

260
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,600
Less light up in less than half a month

261
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:45,240
I'm the only one in the army

262
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:47,639
Will stock up on good goods until the second half of the month

263
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:50,480
Wait until they can use up all theirs

264
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,399
I'll sell it to them

265
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,200
Over the years

266
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,559
I'm almost all the soldiers in the camp

267
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:58,919
All money dealings

268
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,799
Nothing is too small

269
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,399
I have all recorded it in an account book

270
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,480
Where is the account book now

271
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,840
Just in the Secretariat

272
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,360
Zhou Junlan's hands
