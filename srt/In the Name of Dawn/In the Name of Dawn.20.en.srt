1
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,079
On the day of execution

2
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,280
I'm standing under the city wall

3
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,319
Father until his death

4
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,680
All are repeating a sentence

5
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,879
This heart can be seen

6
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:28,079
True love remains unchanged

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,359
The lonely minister can abandon

8
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,120
But never

9
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,480
Fold

10
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,239
His blood dripped on my face

11
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,799
Still warm

12
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,200
From now on

13
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,359
I dare not look at the blood again

14
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:53,920
Yunchao

15
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:55,959
I am here

16
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,120
I know the priest is incompetent

17
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,560
But here

18
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,040
Burying my father's loyal bones

19
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,480
I know

20
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,280
Justice always claim to be the way for heaven

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But the sky

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,120
Can you tell me

23
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,439
What exactly is

24
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,000
right way

25
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,520
Song Nanfei is Zhao Yan

26
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,240
Zhao Yan, a death row prisoner in the North and South case

27
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,039
Xuan Ying Hou didn't kill him

28
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,120
It's a serious crime to deceive the emperor

29
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:33,360
Once caught, the Dharma is corrected on the spot

30
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:34,039
Kill without mercy

31
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:34,719
yes

32
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,199
Uncle Master

33
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,039
Pack up

34
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:56,800
Walk

35
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,719
What's wrong

36
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,319
quick

37
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,240
Where to go

38
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,759
Can I call March

39
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,520
Medicine King Valley

40
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,199
escape

41
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:06,960
いました

42
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,000
いました

43
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,240
いました

44
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,800
You look at me

45
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,080
Be more awake

46
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:14,680
Live

47
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,960
Only when you survive will you turn around

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,159
Fireworks set off on rainy days

49
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,240
Which one is careless

50
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,319
General

51
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,599
The person who answered us is here

52
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,159
What about other jailers

53
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,759
I just released my cigarette

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,719
All were brought down

55
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,360
The palace is not comparable to the battlefield

56
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,680
Extremely dispersed

57
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,680
Master is stupid

58
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,719
How smart can the people below be

59
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:58,919
Zhao Yan

60
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,000
Are you still alive

61
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,919
My name is Song Nanfei

62
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,520
The other brothers have given you

63
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,360
good

64
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,599
Let's go

65
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,520
Let's go together

66
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,719
Fly south

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I actually became

68
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,879
The one you want to take care of

69
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,240
I've taken care of you for a little while

70
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,319
yes

71
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,399
Thank you all the way

72
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,959
How do you thank me

73
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,079
I have nothing to do

74
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,120
Only

75
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,160
I'm still here

76
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,000
Little Master

77
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,480
Mrs. Ji is here too

78
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,439
Daddy

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,759
Ah my mother

80
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,360
Daughter is unfilial

81
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,439
I'll know

82
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,439
I knew you were a dynasty

83
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,399
Get up quickly

84
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,360
stand up

85
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:17,560
Get up quickly

86
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,000
lady

87
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,519
Our family

88
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:25,000
Finally reunion

89
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,759
Ding Dynasty

90
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:35,639
Yunchao

91
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,759
Ding Dynasty

92
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,720
Clouds are

93
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,920
Day by day

94
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,439
What's going on Ji Xiao

95
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,240
Ding Dynasty

96
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:42,959
this

97
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,000
Yunchao

98
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,160
Ding Dynasty

99
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:02,839
What about Ji Yunchao

100
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,079
She and Xuan Yinghou escaped from the capital

101
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,120
The court is looking for

102
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,879
waste

103
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,519
Their waste

104
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,639
What did you slap me?

105
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,360
how

106
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,279
Can't

107
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,600
Your court

108
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:19,079
All you see in this world

109
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,720
Everything that cannot be reached by your eyes

110
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,879
I'm taking it to death

111
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,519
What is a slap?

112
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:29,120
Do you know if this is what Your Majesty knows

113
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,600
That's a serious crime of beheading

114
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,560
behead

115
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,319
behead

116
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,240
did you know

117
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,079
Even the rules for beheading are decided by me

118
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,600
Do you know the world

119
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,639
Why came into being

120
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,600
Michi Ichi

121
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,480
One life two

122
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,279
Two generations three

123
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,240
Three things

124
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,759
The world is naturally

125
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,759
It's me

126
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,040
How do you know

127
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,800
Although I can't predict the future anymore

128
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,959
But I know you very well

129
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,680
It's not just you

130
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,399
emperor

131
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,519
Qingyang

132
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:22,639
いました

133
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,639
Ji Yunchao

134
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:27,480
I know everything in your mind

135
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,120
You don't know

136
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,439
Even Ji Yunchao

137
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:32,800
The ability to see the future in dreams

138
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:36,800
All of them I gave to her

139
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,399
You're so crazy

140
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,360
I'm crazy

141
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:45,040
Ji Yunchao left

142
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,199
My work is not perfect

143
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:49,079
I'm in pain and going crazy

144
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,480
It's fine

145
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,879
You're sick and nightmares

146
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,360
I'll find a way to save you

147
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,600
As long as you're fine

148
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,920
Nothing else matters

149
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,279
At worst we can make a comeback

150
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,079
No

151
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,399
Can't

152
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,600
It's almost over

153
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,600
I don't need you anymore

154
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,920
Make a slut from it again

155
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,240
What exactly do you want

156
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,639
Can't you say it straightforwardly

157
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,160
Let me tell you now

158
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,360
So what else do you think

159
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,319
Everyone

160
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,759
who

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,240
But I can't see them

162
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,559
But they

163
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,200
Just sit there

164
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:43,279
good

165
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:45,519
Then I'll ask you

166
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,960
Our future and their vision

167
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,639
Which one is more important

168
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,679
them

169
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,039
Ji Yunchao

170
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,519
No matter you hide in the ends of the world

171
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:30,279
I will definitely take you

172
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,399
Catch it back

173
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,879
Isn't this in the Medicine King Valley?

174
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,799
Are you not a miracle doctor

175
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,519
That's her old poison

176
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,679
No medicine to solve

177
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,840
I can only fight poison with poison

178
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,519
I will let her blood and treat her poison every month

179
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,159
But that poison

180
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:11,240
It will eventually go into the heart

181
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,399
Then why didn't you tell me earlier

182
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,159
It's me

183
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:23,519
Ding Dynasty

184
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,240
Yunchao

185
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,159
I didn't let him say it

186
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,679
Waiting for me

187
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,799
I'll find you a better doctor

188
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,519
いました

189
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,799
I'm the doctor

190
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:35,759
This disease

191
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,279
No doctor in medicine

192
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:40,759
Can't do medicine

193
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,720
There are folk remedies

194
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:42,960
There is also witchcraft

195
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,720
Can definitely be cured

196
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,559
Then how different is I and that foolish lord

197
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,159
I'm just a waste

198
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,039
No one can save it

199
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,159
The world is alive

200
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:01,639
Father

201
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,279
And you

202
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,639
You've done a good job

203
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:28,799
Stop crying

204
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,840
Look at us Chaochao's face is now pale

205
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,759
Mother turned around and found some good rouge

206
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:41,759
Come and draw it for you

207
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,039
You must always be beautiful

208
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,960
good

209
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:21,519
Sleepy

210
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:24,120
I'll carry you back to sleep for a while

211
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,279
I'm just thinking about things

212
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,440
What are you thinking

213
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,279
I'm thinking

214
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,559
Zhou Junlan and Qiu Xianer

215
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,679
The knife I owe

216
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,000
I fell off the cliff due to a strange poison.

217
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:43,960
It's Ji Xiao who went out to collect herbs

218
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,279
Bring me back to the Medicine King Valley

219
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,559
That poison has no solution

220
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,960
He had to fight the poison with poison

221
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,519
Fifteenth of every month

222
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,639
I have to bear the pain of burning my body

223
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,320
Just like the overwhelming hatred in my heart

224
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,240
Say I'm worse than death

225
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,840
Now my deadline is coming

226
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,919
The knife they owe me

227
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,960
Just ask you

228
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,679
you

229
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,519
Want me back

230
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,600
You've always wanted to go back

231
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,320
Isn't it

232
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:23,000
You can't let go of Cangsheng

233
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,480
Just like I can't let go of hatred

234
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,559
We're just deceiving ourselves

235
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:33,519
Living in pain and dying in joy

236
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,559
What do you choose

237
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,879
Me

238
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,159
There are only two roads in front of me

239
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:47,559
Death in pain and death in joy

240
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:50,720
I can only choose the latter

241
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,279
You are different Pei Yan

242
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,440
You can live

243
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,720
Rather painful

244
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,200
Don't be numb

245
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,759
Don't be numb

246
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,440
I once wanted to die

247
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,440
God wants me to live

248
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,799
Now I want to live

249
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:13,000
God wants me to die

250
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,120
I have to think

251
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,000
Nothing bad

252
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:22,679
One day, the living will avenge me

253
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:25,120
But I'm not willing to give up

254
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,440
The Sword of Revenge is close

255
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,679
But I can't hold it

256
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,799
Fate is a mess

257
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:37,919
May there really be a god in this world

258
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:40,320
Play with me in my palm

259
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,600
But why

260
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:47,600
Who is fooling me

261
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,279
If I could stand up again

262
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,679
Even if I'm dead

263
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,519
I'll take off a piece of her meat, too

264
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,279
いました

265
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,519
what you up to

266
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,200
Just do it

267
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,600
Now I have no money or power

268
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:21,039
No soldiers or horses

269
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,399
The court wants me everywhere again

270
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,960
I can turn the world around if I am alone

271
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,480
I want to accompany you until the end

272
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,559
Change your name and surname

273
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:36,679
Entering the Western Liang Army

274
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:38,720
Rebellion

275
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,360
Fight to

276
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,639
Dead

277
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,600
Remember my knife

278
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,600
right

279
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:03,759
besides

280
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:07,120
That knife
