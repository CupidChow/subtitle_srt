1
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,319
The Marquis is waiting for me

2
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,200
Isn’t Mr. Ji’s fiancée Pei’s fiancée?

3
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,480
I thought the Marquis would be angry

4
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,680
Madam Ji's words are trustworthy

5
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:20,640
Why is Pei very angry

6
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,560
Thank you for helping me today

7
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,599
Just seeing unfairness and justice

8
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,799
I can't repay

9
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:31,040
Only

10
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,079
Give you a gift

11
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,040
What

12
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,280
A drop of blood

13
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,199
what you do

14
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,479
Dizzy when you see blood

15
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,560
At the slaughter of others

16
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,240
How did the Marquis come through these years

17
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,520
Pei is not talented

18
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,120
Have some life-saving methods

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,560
Master Hou

20
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,520
How to deal with this person

21
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,280
You send someone to watch me

22
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,800
When did it start

23
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,000
Start with you staring at me

24
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,680
You're approaching me deliberately

25
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,680
What's the intention

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,639
You forgot

27
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,439
I've told you

28
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,680
I've traveled thousands of miles

29
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,840
From the middle of winter to the beginning of spring

30
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,319
Just to come here

31
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,000
Give you a key

32
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,639
Five years ago, the 19th day of the twelfth lunar month

33
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,840
Zhou Junlan reported to impeach your father's enemy

34
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,680
The emperor was furious and sentenced to hang

35
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,120
The corpse of the old marquis

36
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:14,439
Hanging high above the city wall for ten days

37
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,439
Will be cut into pieces

38
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,319
eleven

39
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,400
You retreat first

40
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,560
since then

41
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:37,039
Zhou Junlan takes this east wind to soar

42
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,800
The rivers of the Hou Mansion are falling

43
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,560
Am I right

44
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:44,560
Xuan Yinghou

45
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,560
What exactly do you want to say

46
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,719
These five years

47
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,439
Zhou Junlan repeatedly made contributions to His Majesty's difficulties

48
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:57,759
If God helps

49
00:03:59,159 --> 00:03:59,960
But Mr. Marquis

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,840
In this world

51
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,520
Is there really a god

52
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,319
Please God Daluo

53
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,319
Save Mr. Hou

54
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,680
He is innocent

55
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,000
Please God Daluo

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Save Mr. Hou

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,159
Save Mr. Hou

58
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,039
Please God Daluo

59
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,039
Save Mr. Hou

60
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,519
He is innocent

61
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,360
Please God Daluo

62
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,040
Save the Marquis

63
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,560
If there is a god

64
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,040
The Marquis will not live in a long life

65
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,959
But in a hurry, finally in a dark prison

66
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,600
Didn't wait for that winter New Year's Eve

67
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,759
If there is a god

68
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,040
Mrs. Pei won't die of depression

69
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,000
Mid-Autumn Festival reunion night

70
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,560
In the lights of thousands of homes

71
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,199
you

72
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,040
Lost your only relative

73
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:47,720
Have you ever thought about it

74
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,199
Who is helping Zhou Junlan

75
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,480
Don't say there is no god in this world

76
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,519
Even if he is really helping

77
00:04:59,079 --> 00:04:59,879
You and I

78
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,759
Can also cause a mourning for him

79
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,720
Do you dare

80
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:36,959
Don't look down

81
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,279
Before you

82
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,800
There is an inch of moonlight

83
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,560
One inch

84
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,079
moonlight

85
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,040
Within one stick of incense

86
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,199
You go to the yamen to surrender yourself

87
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,600
Who is the person who told you to commit the crime?

88
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,879
Otherwise you will die of heartbreak

89
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,480
Don't think about it

90
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,959
Still not afraid of death

91
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,959
Then I'll get this medicine

92
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:33,759
Have it raised

93
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:36,879
etc.

94
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,079
You mean

95
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,560
The assassin was not only fine

96
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,399
I went to the yamen to identify me

97
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,839
yes

98
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,160
Words of the vicious people

99
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,160
Who will believe it

100
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,480
What's more, at this time

101
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,120
He should shut up forever

102
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,879
Husband moves so fast

103
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,319
Just a doctor

104
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,839
Why bother with it

105
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,920
Do you believe she is Ji Yunchao

106
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,240
Whether it is Ji Yunchao or Gu Chaochao

107
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,480
Just an ant

108
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,439
But she is in your opinion.

109
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,079
Come back just one step away

110
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,480
It must be prepared

111
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,759
Xian'er's ability helps me

112
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,360
What kind of storm can she make

113
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,920
The position of the Secretary of the Central Committee

114
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,480
There will be no mistake

115
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:46,120
There is a chance now

116
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,120
You have to grasp it

117
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,959
I'll report tomorrow

118
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,160
The prince will sneak out of the palace

119
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,319
Go to the Tea Horse Road

120
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,160
By then

121
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,360
Please slow down, my husband

122
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,879
Be careful not to fall

123
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,639
Lang Jun

124
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:13,879
Lang Jun

125
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:14,800
quick

126
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,120
Go and hire an imperial physician, right?

127
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,879
Quick

128
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,839
Lang Jun

129
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,279
What's wrong with you Lang Jun

130
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:19,959
What's wrong

131
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,399
Lang Jun

132
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,439
Lang Jun

133
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,079
remember

134
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,919
I can save him by what I teach you

135
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,279
How could he have Xian'er's method

136
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:53,320
Lang Jun

137
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,240
His Highness the Crown Prince

138
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,120
Are you okay

139
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,080
Are you okay

140
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,440
Thanks to Xuan Yinghou today

141
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,279
Just a matter of duty

142
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:15,000
If Mr. Zhou had discovered His Highness first

143
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,080
He will also rescue him

144
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,919
Thanks to Mr. Zhou, too

145
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:21,399
It should be

146
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,080
Lang Jun

147
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,559
I'll give you some more

148
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:44,519
Thank you

149
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,200
After today

150
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,159
I'm afraid there are many people

151
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm coming to curry favor with the prince's savior

152
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:53,960
Someone has a way

153
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,799
Xuanying Hou must have a way out

154
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:01,279
Today you ask me to come here for tea

155
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,519
Meet the prince

156
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,159
I'm afraid it's not by chance

157
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,039
Just a coincidence

158
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,399
Over the past five years

159
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,960
Zhou Junlan relies on various coincidences

160
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,679
Step by step

161
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,159
I've heard

162
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,799
It's because he's at home

163
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,399
A god who can understand the future

164
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:21,200
you

165
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,200
You can also understand the future

166
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:29,399
What you want to deal with is Zhou Junlan

167
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,559
It's still the god behind him

168
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,639
Assassinated on the night before

169
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,039
They've gotten murderous

170
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:38,759
You're so provocative again today

171
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,480
how

172
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,039
You're scared

173
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,039
I didn't hide again

174
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,200
They're looking for it

175
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,039
The first one is to seek revenge on me

176
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,360
What are you afraid of

177
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:50,639
You should be afraid

178
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,639
What

179
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,679
Not afraid of death

180
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:54,879
Not greedy for life

181
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,240
Dead men

182
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,879
But you are a woman

183
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,279
The youth is in full swing

184
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:00,720
How can you spare your life

185
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,759
Where does the youth come from?

186
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:07,159
Gu Chaochao died five years ago

187
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,440
Ji Yunchao now

188
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:12,440
It's just a lingering life

189
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,159
Restaurant that day

190
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,679
Your piano sound is definitely like a broken jade

191
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:19,759
Niangzi Ji

192
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,919
No matter who you want to take

193
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:23,559
nothing

194
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,080
Worth your life to pay

195
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:47,360
Gu Chaochao

196
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,720
Niangzi Ji

197
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,240
Who are you

198
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,799
Next week Junlan

199
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:07,799
Don't know

200
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,480
A few days ago, Mrs. Ji

201
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,200
There are many conflicts with my inner wife Xian'er

202
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,679
Zhou Shilang

203
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,440
You're here today

204
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,679
It's for your wife to send someone to assassinate me

205
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,240
Just a misunderstanding

206
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,039
That must be because

207
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,720
Xuan Yinghou has been fighting for merit with you

208
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,600
Niangzi Ji took over Xuan Yinghou

209
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:37,240
It's an obstacle to my way openly and secretly

210
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,879
Could it be that I have any grudges with Xian'er and me

211
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:47,759
why are you laughing

212
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm smiling

213
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,440
You're also the one who crawled out of the mud

214
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,519
Asking such a stupid question

215
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:57,360
You're unrestrained

216
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,120
I'll deal with you

217
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,919
Any reason to ask for

218
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:05,440
But you're blocking my way

219
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,200
What about this one of the only roads to heaven

220
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,559
If you leave, I can't leave

221
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,279
When you are trampling on others all the way

222
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,799
I never thought one day

223
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,600
Will you become a stepping stone for others, too

224
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,919
Zhou Shilang

225
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,559
We'll have a long way to go

226
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,240
Junlan

227
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,720
We'll have a long way to go

228
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:49,120
Who are you

229
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,600
I'll say the last time

230
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,879
I am the daughter of the Lord of Medicine King Valley

231
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:03,679
Ji Yunchao
