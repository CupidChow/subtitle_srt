1
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,479
pain

2
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,119
Your scars have scabbed

3
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,119
It should be getting better soon

4
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,359
Headache

5
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:14,840
Stay in the place where the spring flowers are

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,480
Spend silver

7
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,239
Twenty-seven taels

8
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,640
This is Zhao Peng's account book

9
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:20,799
I know

10
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,760
How about it

11
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,640
Any clues

12
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,079
My father was stolen to prevent the drawings from being stolen.

13
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,079
Behind the two soldiers

14
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,200
Tie the drawing

15
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,920
Destroy the city defense map again

16
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:35,680
To prevent the two from joining forces to surrender

17
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,640
The father asked the two to hide their identities from each other

18
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,280
In the camp, you should avoid contact with each other

19
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:44,680
Then put the account on

20
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,640
The soldiers who had contact with Zhao Peng were eliminated

21
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,920
Then check other soldiers

22
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,439
The remaining soldiers

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,480
I've sent someone to check it out in secret

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,680
now

25
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,079
Only those on the list

26
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,280
Not yet found out

27
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,120
They were implicated in this case

28
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,560
Staying in Xiliang for many years

29
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:06,359
A few days ago I should have led my troops to

30
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,120
But now it's too late

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,759
It should have

32
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,879
Xiliang

33
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,639
Reverse

34
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,080
Is it because Your Majesty is unwilling to send troops to reinforce?

35
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:20,919
yes

36
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,479
The Xiliang Army and the local people have a deep affection

37
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,520
The Hu people are invading

38
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,479
The court

39
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:27,759
Retreat without fighting

40
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,479
General Zhang Zhao of Xiliang

41
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:32,680
Lead local soldiers to repel the Hu people

42
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,159
Victory but not withdraw

43
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,520
But go south

44
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,800
He's back

45
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,159
I've never heard of this in the capital

46
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,120
This matters to the country

47
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:48,120
How dare the court inform the public

48
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,639
Three days ago

49
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,680
The Xiliang Army is as powerful as a bamboo shoot

50
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,319
Has attacked three cities in a row

51
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,840
Zhang Zhao is brave but not smart enough

52
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,840
Resided for a long time under the command of Mr. Pei

53
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,560
The two didn't get along because of this

54
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,439
Unexpectedly

55
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,280
Now he has grown to this point

56
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,960
It's not him that's the tricky one

57
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,439
It's Song Nanfei

58
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,120
Who is Song Nanfei

59
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:27,599
A rising star under the command of the General of Xiliang

60
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,000
He is a strategist who can be both civil and military

61
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,439
You're scared

62
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,960
I'm just afraid that your Majesty will fear that I am too powerful

63
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,400
Leave the suppression of the rebels to Pei Yan

64
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,560
Now, with the help of Ji Yunchao, he

65
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,319
The wings are getting full

66
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,159
If you have military power

67
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,080
The position in the court gradually tops me

68
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,159
How can I still make it

69
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,639
Xian'er

70
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:57,400
Let it go quickly

71
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,759
The suppression of the rebels is imminent

72
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,639
Tomorrow, His Majesty will announce the choice to quell the rebels

73
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,520
You can see the future

74
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,759
Can you tell me now

75
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,039
Pei Yan and I

76
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,680
Who can be selected

77
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,680
I have no idea

78
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,279
Since the last time I dreamed of Runan's tragic situation

79
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,839
I've never had a dream again

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,879
Maybe God has taken back its gift

81
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,560
I can't help you

82
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,839
Nothing bad

83
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:31,959
So far

84
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,639
You've done a good job

85
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,079
She is doing it

86
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,079
I'm an ant

87
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,319
Now my ability to predict is gone

88
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,439
Will it be as expected by her

89
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,399
Can she still predict the future

90
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:49,959
hand

91
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,480
Do you understand

92
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,680
this

93
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,120
Don't let me say it again

94
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:06,519
good

95
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,720
Foresee or not

96
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,199
At this moment in the palace

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,680
The candidate should be decided

98
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,199
You want to go

99
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,879
yes

100
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,079
To stabilize the world

101
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:21,560
It is also a father's case

102
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,480
But your hypoxia is not cured yet

103
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,560
I can tell the position by listening to the sound

104
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,199
I don't believe it

105
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,519
Then you try

106
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,040
How did you do it

107
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,759
Because I have a strong internal strength

108
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,199
Then I'll try it too

109
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,240
You go

110
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,720
Right

111
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,199
Your internal strength is so deep

112
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,360
Because of your heart

113
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,079
It's too noisy to dance

114
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,600
Will you be tired

115
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,160
Won't

116
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,959
Why

117
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,319
Married to you for many years

118
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:44,879
I've figured out that you're not moving

119
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,279
That makes people kneel down

120
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,759
A pair of knee pads have been customized by skilled craftsmen in the special city

121
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:50,959
Convenient to kneel down

122
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,959
With us

123
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,839
This is called kneeling easily

124
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,240
You rarely mention your hometown to me

125
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,160
Wait until everything is settled

126
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,879
I'll tell you again

127
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,959
One word is determined

128
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,079
No need to kneel down to me in the future

129
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,279
Then wouldn't my knee pad money be wasted

130
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,399
You're still addicted to kneeling, right

131
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:20,839
How could it be

132
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,360
One word is determined

133
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,519
Emperor Chengyun decree

134
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,920
Now there are rebels that cause disaster to several states

135
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,439
I have sent your troops to investigate the chaos south

136
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,360
I'm so proud

137
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,800
Subject:

138
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,680
Marquis Xuanying and Marquis Zhou

139
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,879
It's been more than half a month

140
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,040
The rebels in Xiliang have been through the battlefield for a long time

141
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,800
Sharp cannot be

142
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,959
Our army has been damaged by most of the

143
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,759
His Majesty

144
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,600
His Majesty

145
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,199
His Majesty

146
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:17,879
His Majesty

147
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,639
Master Xuan Ye

148
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,639
Your Majesty Master Xuan Ye

149
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,960
This thing can really protect me

150
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,720
Prolong life

151
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,639
Life is forever

152
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,799
It's exactly

153
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:01,159
This thing is called Guiyuan Dan

154
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,720
It is the pure blood of the world

155
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:07,240
It was made only after 49 days of fire

156
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,080
Congratulations to Your Majesty

157
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,440
Congratulations to Your Majesty

158
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:33,200
Zhou Shilang and Xuan Ying Hou defeated the Xiliang Army

159
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,960
Capturing the thief's leader won the victory and then headed

160
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,919
good

161
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,080
good

162
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:45,080
Go to Zhou's house quickly

163
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,080
Pass my will

164
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,639
This is when I'm waiting for you to come back

165
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,200
A hairband that I learned to embroider

166
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:06,600
Like it

167
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,720
Yue'er, go back first

168
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,240
go

169
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,519
Why not be happy

170
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,480
The surname Pei has shown you my face

171
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'll ask you that day

172
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,759
Who would go to Runan to suppress the rebellion?

173
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,759
What did you write in my palm?

174
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,360
week

175
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:34,919
No, no

176
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,679
You're just writing it out

177
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,480
Deliberately cheating me

178
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,440
I'll say week

179
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:40,879
He will say Pei

180
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:42,919
You're questioning me

181
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,000
If you can really predict the future

182
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,320
How could I not tell me that Pei Yan would accompany me on this trip

183
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:49,679
Why don't you tell me

184
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:51,360
Your Majesty's body is at its last moment

185
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,679
How could you not tell me about the Battle of Runan

186
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:55,440
Will almost kill me

187
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,720
You're just lying to me

188
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,799
I could have seen it

189
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,320
But now I'm fake

190
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:05,360
All are fake

191
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,240
You're like that dog Taoist priest

192
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,320
It will only be fascinating

193
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,639
I believe you can help me reach the top

194
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:11,399
I killed Gu Chaochao

195
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,120
But what about you

196
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,240
Dare to lie to me

197
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,720
lady

198
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,240
My future

199
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,759
geometry

200
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,480
Zhou Shilang

201
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,480
Zhou Shilang

202
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,480
Someone reported you to bribe publicly

203
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:36,639
Your Majesty has an order to take you back for interrogation

204
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:46,360
What a cunning rabbit and dead dog cooking

205
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,000
Who is it

206
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,799
Who reported me

207
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:50,480
take away

208
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,879
Who is it

209
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,679
Who reported me

210
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,360
Who reported me

211
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:56,720
Who is it

212
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,679
Lang Jun

213
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:58,519
who

214
00:11:58,879 --> 00:11:59,840
Who is it

215
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:11,200
How did you discover Zhou Junlan's story

216
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,840
When the North and South list case

217
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,080
I'll use the name of helping him check the accounts

218
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,279
Frequently visit and exit the Zhou family

219
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,559
Only then did I find out this

220
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:28,159
Then you will not send

221
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,919
Until he returned to the court

222
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,879
You reported to Your Majesty in my name

223
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,440
Your Majesty immediately sent someone to investigate secretly

224
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,039
Sure enough, the evidence is conclusive

225
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,759
When he is in full bloom

226
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,279
It's also the day he's sent to jail

227
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,360
I don't know what kind of gift you like

228
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,720
I'll give this to you

229
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:48,720
How about it

230
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,679
Like it

231
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,840
I like Yunchao very much

232
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,879
Where to learn sentences

233
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,679
Learn without a teacher

234
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:05,919
Sorry

235
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,879
Trouble both of you

236
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:07,960
but

237
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,720
Someone is looking for you Yunchao

238
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,000
Who is it

239
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:21,879
Rare guest

240
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,600
What do you want

241
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,600
You come to me

242
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,799
Just to ask me this

243
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:36,840
I asked someone to escape from Zhou Junlan everywhere

244
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,279
They said someone who needed to report him

245
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,759
Go to the imperial front to turn the offering

246
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:45,240
Denver was accused of bribery in secret

247
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,080
how

248
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,399
How do you like it

249
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,919
This is busy

250
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:01,399
You're helping

251
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,879
Still don't help

252
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,200
You like him so much

253
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,879
What

254
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:14,679
Zhou Junlan

255
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,480
Even willing to let go of his dignity

256
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,840
Maybe

257
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,759
Then you would like to give all your money for him

258
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,159
Say it

259
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:31,759
What do you want

260
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,919
I want

261
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,879
Your life

262
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,559
What should you call me

263
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,919
Should I call you Song Nanfei

264
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:54,720
It's better to call you

265
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,279
Zhao Yan

266
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:01,120
Zhao Yan is dead

267
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,240
Only Song Nanfei in the world

268
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,399
You shouldn't be like this

269
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,240
You shouldn't be like this, either

270
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,360
Haven't seen it for a long time

271
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,759
You actually became the dog emperor's hawk

272
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,080
Come

273
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:19,799
exist

274
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,279
Hungry him for a few days

275
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,879
It's not too late to retrial

276
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,080
Keep a living mouth

277
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:26,240
yes

278
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:30,440
The lackeys, the lackeys, the tyrants, the lackeys, the lackeys, the lackeys,

279
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:35,960
And slow

280
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,919
picture

281
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,879
It's really like

282
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,240
You are Pei Yuan's son

283
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,120
I am

284
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:57,519
Pei Yuan

285
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,600
You and I have fought for most of my life

286
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,039
Don't want you to fall into my hands

287
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,320
But

288
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,480
Falling into your son's hands

289
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,919
What do you mean

290
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,519
I'm just talking about why I can't find this thing

291
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,759
It turns out to be on you

292
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,519
But my father has always been incompatible with you

293
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,399
How could I hand this thing over to you

294
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:38,720
So put

295
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:43,240
You betrayed my father

296
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,399
No

297
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,480
Not you

298
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,120
If it was you

299
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,240
Why did you inform me of this

300
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,879
It's not me indeed

301
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,119
Who is that
