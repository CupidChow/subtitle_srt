1
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,879
You go to Jiang Mansion to hire you

2
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,040
Why not discuss with me

3
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:11,120
how

4
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,760
You're blaming me for being a good decision

5
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:14,959
How could it be

6
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:16,920
I understand you did

7
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,159
It is to help me form the Jiang family's marriage

8
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,000
only

9
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:21,159
I promised you

10
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,560
Never take a concubine in this life

11
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,760
That's what you'd better think

12
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:26,840
certainly

13
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,000
Ji Yunchao

14
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:31,719
Don't be proud of yourself

15
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,480
Next

16
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,599
It's your turn

17
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:53,760
Be careful, princess

18
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,360
It seems to be the Lantern Festival tonight

19
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,360
It will be very lively

20
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:37,759
Smell this

21
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,439
Very fragrant

22
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,639
Run slowly

23
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,199
Come quickly

24
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,159
Wait for me

25
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:45,199
Isn’t this Mr. Ji the one from Mr. Zhou?

26
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,240
Why did you talk to Xuan Yinghou again

27
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,199
Who knows

28
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,759
This woman is very messy

29
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,759
Even this kind of woman, Xuan Yinghou, also wants

30
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,479
A son of a traitor

31
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,759
A slut

32
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,159
It's a perfect match, too

33
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,120
Really matched

34
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,319
This is the Marquis

35
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,000
Didn't you listen to them?

36
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,360
us

37
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,599
A perfect match

38
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:18,000
Let the Marquis be so crowded with people to watch and discuss

39
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,719
I feel wronged of you

40
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:20,719
Nothing bad

41
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,439
These gossips

42
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,879
I've long been used to it

43
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,159
Master Hou

44
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,439
At the Lantern Festival later

45
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,800
You must

46
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,879
The glass lantern on Princess Qingyang's hand won

47
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,280
Princess Qingyang will be in danger tonight

48
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,719
You're closer to her

49
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,800
Only then can she be saved

50
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,599
good

51
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,919
You trust me so

52
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,400
Through various

53
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,199
I've long been sure you can also understand the future

54
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,400
But if you don't want to tell me

55
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,840
I won't ask more

56
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,439
Five years ago

57
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,319
My life was hanging on the line

58
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,240
Fortunately, God has mercy

59
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:04,639
In a dream

60
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,520
I can see some occasionally

61
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,919
Sporadic fragments about the future

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,120
As for what you can see

63
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,080
I can't choose

64
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,439
If Zhou Junlan is behind

65
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,240
It's really a god

66
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,720
Then I will live up to God's wishes

67
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,399
He will definitely be killed to lose his armor

68
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:23,920
Failed

69
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,199
Why did they come together

70
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,439
This is also here.

71
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,600
Rumors have not yet settled

72
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,399
The Marquis Xuanying actually took Ji Yunchao to attend.

73
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,720
I'm afraid that others won't know about your green hat

74
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,399
Mrs. Qiu's words

75
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,839
Didn’t he scold Mr. Zhou?

76
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,000
Zhou Shilang

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,279
Can you admit that you are an adulterer

78
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,160
you

79
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,160
Don't misunderstand Xuanyinghou

80
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,720
That night, Miss Ji kindly helped

81
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,879
But it hurts the reputation

82
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,399
I should have clarified this earlier

83
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,120
Hope that Madam Ji Haihan

84
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,240
Mr. Zhou’s apology

85
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,560
Both the Marquis and I have accepted it

86
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,399
Princess Qingyang is out

87
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,439
The princess is here

88
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,879
There is a lantern mystery here in this palace

89
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,360
Who is the best

90
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,680
This glass lantern is the colorful head

91
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,839
This is so beautiful too

92
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,199
What a beautiful lantern

93
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,240
Listen well

94
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,519
The puzzle is

95
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,560
The galaxy is still bright

96
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,399
Fire trees and silver flowers reflect the sky light

97
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,800
The moon shadow turns with the steps

98
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,959
Lanterns and beautiful accompaniment

99
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:10,519
I'll do it

100
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,160
Zhou Shilang

101
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,959
The clouds spread like a picture

102
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:19,079
Laughing and joyful words all over the tingfang

103
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,800
Tonight, we are drunk among the moon among the flowers

104
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,879
There is a fairy country deep in the bamboo forest

105
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,759
good

106
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,600
Your Highness

107
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,920
I want to join in the fun, too

108
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:35,600
Please, Lord Marquis

109
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:39,000
Jade leaking copper pot urges dawn

110
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:42,319
Jinwu can't help but lead the night

111
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,639
Tourists laugh like weaving

112
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,600
Enjoy good times and happiness together

113
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,720
good

114
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,639
Leweiyang

115
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,639
What a joy

116
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,680
Master Hou

117
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,800
This glass lantern is yours

118
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:39,600
My face

119
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:40,800
Xuan Yinghou

120
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,040
You're so brave

121
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:43,399
Dare to hurt Your Highness

122
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,279
Catch it

123
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:44,639
yes

124
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:45,839
My face

125
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,399
how so

126
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,319
What went wrong

127
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,319
Tonight's Lantern Festival in Qingyang

128
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,639
Don't save people

129
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,399
Xian'er noticed something

130
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,600
When you said something happened to the prince

131
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,639
Pei Yan robs your credit

132
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:25,040
I'll teach you the way

133
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,560
People in Medicine King Valley cannot know

134
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,920
Xian'er said

135
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,160
Ji Yunchao or Pei Yan

136
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,200
Have similar abilities to you

137
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:36,200
I remember the original book is

138
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,639
I've remembered

139
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,919
It's Ji Yunchao

140
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,960
I see

141
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,440
If Pei Yan continues to earn the merit tonight

142
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,519
That verified this guess

143
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,000
By then

144
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,679
We'll send him a ride

145
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,080
Xuan Yinghou

146
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,039
You want a hero to save the beauty but hurt the princess's face

147
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,000
You're greedy for success this time

148
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,399
Your Majesty is furious

149
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,159
Let me preach the holy order

150
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,000
When will the princess' face recover?

151
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,120
When will you let you out

152
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,200
The old marquis made great achievements in his life

153
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,360
Marquis Xuanying is the orphan of the old Marquis

154
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:31,080
That's how you took care of it

155
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,840
Little damn small damn small damn small

156
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:36,519
why are you laughing

157
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,919
Laughing at you

158
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,120
The beauty is so thick

159
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:44,919
Go and get the basin water

160
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,240
Help him clean

161
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,879
yes

162
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,679
How can the Queen Xuanying know that there is a way to examine people in prison

163
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,279
A hundred tests and a hundred magical things

164
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,320
Covered with prisoners' eyes

165
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,720
Cut off the wrist

166
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:08,039
Listen to blood drops

167
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:11,559
Until it collapses and dies

168
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,000
listen

169
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,559
Just a joke

170
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:23,440
Scared you

171
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:32,759
He can't stand it anymore

172
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:34,799
Bandage him again

173
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:35,559
yes

174
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,279
You're going to rob the prison

175
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,399
Visiting a clinic

176
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,600
But no one came to the door for treatment today

177
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,240
You're going to the princess's house

178
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,000
inappropriate

179
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:09,840
Treat the princess' face

180
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,600
I won't count the birthmarks before

181
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,720
Then Qiu Xian'er will definitely take advantage of the situation and play it.

182
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,039
Identify you as Gu Chaochao

183
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:18,960
Once the identity is revealed

184
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,440
Just leave it to fate

185
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:23,240
Things are in human

186
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:24,360
Not in the sky

187
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:25,799
You and Qiu Xianer

188
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,639
Already know the opponent's trump card

189
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:30,919
Be more cautious in the future

190
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,879
Dali Temple will inevitably have no Zhou Junlan's people

191
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,639
Pei Yan is in prison now

192
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:37,960
I don't know how much hardship you will suffer

193
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,799
This time I missed his attention and implicated him

194
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,080
I must save him

195
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:45,320
etc.

196
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,240
Thank you uncle

197
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:53,759
Remember to go home for dinner

198
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,559
good

199
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:10,840
Your Highness

200
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,279
Ji's Clinic Ji asked for a meeting

201
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,440
Niangzi Ji

202
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,720
Xuan Yinghou's fiancée

203
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:17,919
Ji Yunchao

204
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,039
It's exactly

205
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,919
The most rumored about Niang Ji's medical skills are high

206
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,399
Why not let her

207
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,080
Come in

208
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:28,759
Xian'er

209
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,039
Why are you here

210
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,279
I'll burn incense and cook tea with you

211
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,879
I'm covering the candy cake all the way

212
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,000
Or hot

213
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,200
fool

214
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,559
Just let the servant do this kind of thing

215
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,799
There's something even more stupid outside

216
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,360
Standing in the sun

217
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,840
Could it be that I am here to apologize

218
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,480
In this way

219
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,639
It seems that this palace is unkind

220
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,120
Master Hou

221
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,000
Master Hou

222
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,879
Zhou Junlan is full of eyeliners here

223
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,879
I can only take the opportunity to leave the others

224
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:14,840
Only then dare to let the marquis come down

225
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,919
You've suffered

226
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,240
Do the whole set of acting

227
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:18,559
Don't blame you

228
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,320
not to mention

229
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,840
You've been dormant here for several years

230
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,159
Not easy

231
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,759
Thanks a lot

232
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
I'm willing to do so

233
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:28,000
Just wait for one day

234
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,080
Can turn the case over for the old marquis

235
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,039
By the way, Mr. Marquis

236
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,039
The person you are looking for has news.

237
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:36,840
Where is it

238
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:37,440
Suizhou

239
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:39,080
However, Suizhou has suffered from floods recently

240
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,200
You're trapped here again

241
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,559
Should I send someone to go

242
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:42,120
No need

243
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,679
I want

244
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,200
Go to find him in person

245
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,799
Madam

246
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,840
Please go back

247
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:08,799
I see

248
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,840
You can't go in

249
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,200
The young lady Ji Yun pays homage to His Highness

250
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:18,519
A civilian woman practices medicine for many years

251
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:19,279
Learn a good recipe

252
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,759
Can solve your highness's urgent need

253
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,759
Can you cure my face

254
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:35,720
Madam Ji is really amazing

255
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,240
The imperial doctors in the palace are helpless

256
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,639
You've gotten the treatment

257
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,519
that is

258
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:41,679
Nothing to say

259
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:42,799
How do I believe in you in this palace

260
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,759
If Your Highness doesn't believe it

261
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:07,840
A young woman can cure her face

262
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,200
You can cure your highness's face

263
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,080
madman

264
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:14,399
Come here
