1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,695
But when Mizuki's hand

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,400
touched your cheek...

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,900
I was jealous.

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,700
Sakae-san, I...

5
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:08,922
Kissing is for those

6
00:00:08,947 --> 00:00:09,984
who love each other.

7
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:35,350
I...

8
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,685
I think

9
00:00:38,858 --> 00:00:40,724
I'm attracted to you, Sakae-san.

10
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,240
What's with that confusing way

11
00:00:43,256 --> 00:00:44,296
of saying it?

12
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,844
It's just that it's an emotion

13
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:47,134
I've never felt before!

14
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,110
And besides...

15
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,420
I won't be staying in Osaka forever.

16
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:51,900
Huh?

17
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,308
A year from now, I'll be

18
00:00:53,332 --> 00:00:54,371
transferring back to the

19
00:00:54,396 --> 00:00:55,372
Tokyo headquarters.

20
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,965
There's something I need to

21
00:00:57,973 --> 00:00:58,949
talk to you about.

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,380
Yes?

23
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:06,790
Sorry.

24
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,040
I need a little more time.

25
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,704
But I promise I won't run away

26
00:01:16,728 --> 00:01:17,969
from your feelings.

27
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:19,370
Can we just

28
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,290
keep things as they were

29
00:01:21,306 --> 00:01:22,602
for a little while longer?

30
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,400
I understand.

31
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,380
But

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,980
Osaka people are impatient.

33
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,310
Please remember that.

34
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,209
Well, it's been a short time,

35
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,040
but thanks for everything.

36
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:54,810
Geez.

37
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,530
If you had your own apartment,

38
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:57,788
you could have said so.

39
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,290
It's true that I'm looking for a job.

40
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,843
Well, I'll look for a place

41
00:02:04,868 --> 00:02:06,218
that seems interesting.

42
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,910
Well, then,

43
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,590
take care.

44
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:13,470
Oh.

45
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,380
You too, Sakae.

46
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,610
- Sakae-kun, I'll use the toilet.
- Sure.

47
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,470
This negiyaki is really delicious.

48
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,757
I put in sakura shrimp

49
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:36,016
because you said you like it.

50
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,370
Oh, I see.

51
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,950
It's so delicious.

52
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,970
What a relief.

53
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,960
But, you know,

54
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,920
it's lonely without Mizukichi.

55
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:49,610
Well, well,

56
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:51,700
what can you do when someone leaves?

57
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,600
He seemed to be enjoying himself.

58
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,500
Did you drive him away, Sakae-kun?

59
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:58,900
No, I didn't.

60
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,814
The punishment for being cold

61
00:03:00,838 --> 00:03:02,615
to others will come back to you.

62
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,110
Even so, I didn't do anything...

63
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,120
- Hey!
- Huh?

64
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,290
Huh?

65
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,600
Did you see that?

66
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,030
It's just a coincidence.

67
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,370
Hey!

68
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,970
I got a message from my wife.

69
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,370
Don't set your ringtone to

70
00:03:21,386 --> 00:03:22,471
something so weird!

71
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,800
- Hey!
- Hey!

72
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,520
Huh? What?

73
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,580
It's Mizukichi's curse!

74
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,890
- The curse has befallen this shop!
- Scary!

75
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:35,330
It's certain!

76
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,330
Sorry, sorry.

77
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,730
Geez, you've gone overboard.

78
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,340
- Hey!
- Whoa!

79
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,120
What?

80
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,120
- Welcome.
- Yeah.

81
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,490
Oh, right, I found this nearby.

82
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,720
- "Open sale"
- Yeah.

83
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,000
"all-you-can-eat and drink. 1500 yen?"

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,990
- That's cheap!
- How nice!

85
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,440
Don't worry, Sakae-kun.

86
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,112
Your regulars won't leave

87
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,299
just because of this.

88
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,320
- Right?
- Hmm?

89
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,210
- Yeah...
- Yeah...

90
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:09,650
They're definitely going!

91
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,310
Is it really

92
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,130
Mizuki's curse?

93
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,560
Hey! There's smoke! Smoke!

94
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,820
- Put out the fire!
- Hurry up!

95
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,870
"Although I Love You, And You?"

96
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,240
"Episode 6: It's a crisis, what now?"

97
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,340
My curse?

98
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,970
That's funny.

99
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,920
How is it funny?

100
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:12,990
Huh?

101
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,540
What do you think, Kaname?

102
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,821
Do you think Sakae and that guy

103
00:05:18,838 --> 00:05:19,730
could be happy together?

104
00:05:19,755 --> 00:05:20,325
Huh?

105
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,931
As someone who's stepped back,

106
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,962
don't you want to know that in the end?

107
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,548
They're definitely special

108
00:05:27,573 --> 00:05:28,773
to each other.

109
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,479
Sakae taught Soga-san

110
00:05:30,503 --> 00:05:31,543
how to cook,

111
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,338
Sakae took care of Soga-san

112
00:05:33,362 --> 00:05:34,642
when he's drunk,

113
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,987
Sakae surprised

114
00:05:36,012 --> 00:05:37,692
Soga-san on his birthday.

115
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,070
Seems like it's one-sided?

116
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:41,550
Huh?

117
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,740
What about the other way around?

118
00:05:46,905 --> 00:05:50,220
Even though Soga-san is bad at sports,

119
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,070
he played squash with Sakae.

120
00:05:59,290 --> 00:05:59,990
Just that?

121
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,770
Hey, I heard that

122
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,753
the customers from "Tamae" are all going

123
00:06:06,778 --> 00:06:08,395
to a new restaurant that opened nearby!

124
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,570
Yes.

125
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,478
I heard the food is pretty good

126
00:06:11,494 --> 00:06:12,386
for the price.

127
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,370
Whoa.

128
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,197
Well then, we'll have do something

129
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:17,464
to show support.

130
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,420
- Something nice.
- Ah, I thought about it too.

131
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,090
I actually

132
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,430
made something like this.

133
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,324
"Tamae New Customer

134
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:29,191
Acquisition Strategy?"

135
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,440
Oh, Sakae-san's cooking videos.

136
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,216
I thought of uploading them

137
00:06:37,232 --> 00:06:38,356
online to promote 'Tamae'.

138
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,980
I see, good idea.

139
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,990
- Yes, and...
- This way please.

140
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,840
Soga-kun, Kanda-san, and everyone.

141
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,790
Let me introduce you

142
00:06:48,911 --> 00:06:52,021
to a promising newcomer from Tokyo.

143
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,180
I'm Kojimachi. Nice to meet you.

144
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,140
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

145
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,710
This way.

146
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,423
Now, straight to the point.

147
00:07:00,431 --> 00:07:02,306
I'd like you to handle the deal

148
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:04,055
with Murasame Industries.

149
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,370
I expect the three of you can handle it?

150
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,480
Yes, understood.

151
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,770
As a sign of getting acquainted,

152
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:11,945
would you like to have

153
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:13,422
some okonomiyaki today?

154
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,500
No, thank you.

155
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,410
I'm not a fan of such mundane dishes.

156
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,230
Huh?

157
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,190
May I continue with the greetings?

158
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,960
Ah, yes.

159
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,050
Oh, Osumiya-san.

160
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,070
- Yes.
- Please guide him.

161
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,050
Oh, right away.

162
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,540
Alright, this way.

163
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,340
How annoying.

164
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,190
Sakae-kun.

165
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,631
Let's turn the crisis

166
00:07:38,656 --> 00:07:39,889
into an opportunity.

167
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,350
Alright, thank you.

168
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,115
And thank you very much for coming up

169
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:46,975
with so many ways to help out.

170
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,730
Rolling!

171
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,370
Go ahead!

172
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,420
Everyone, are you enjoying

173
00:07:53,445 --> 00:07:54,936
your sweet life?

174
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,830
Since Valentine's Day is approaching,

175
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,793
let's make some stylish

176
00:08:00,802 --> 00:08:01,981
homemade chocolates.

177
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,340
Umm, stop for a second.

178
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,340
Huh?

179
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,600
I mean, is this the right way to do it?

180
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,570
I'm not a sweets professional.

181
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,726
I want to attract a different

182
00:08:15,751 --> 00:08:17,351
clientele this time.

183
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,950
And this outfit feels embarrassing.

184
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,800
It definitely doesn't suit me.

185
00:08:22,022 --> 00:08:23,900
That's not true. I think you look cool.

186
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,210
- It will be sensational.
- How is that possible?

187
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,140
- It's possible.
- It's impossible.

188
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,590
I'll just be a laughingstock.

189
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,810
I think you look cool!

190
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,760
Ah, no.

191
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,580
I'll be watching you through the lens.

192
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,170
Why not give it a try?

193
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,400
Fine.

194
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,030
If you're that insistent, Soga-san.

195
00:08:59,090 --> 00:08:59,930
Thank you!

196
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,500
Alright, let's do it!

197
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,200
Yes, don't worry.

198
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:07,640
Go ahead!

199
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,310
Everyone...

200
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,330
(Kojimachi-kun)

201
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,170
(Kojimachi-kun)
Sorry, it's a junior from the company.

202
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,130
Sorry.

203
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:16,910
Hello.

204
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,180
Sorry to bother you during your break.

205
00:09:19,798 --> 00:09:20,813
We've hit a snag with

206
00:09:20,838 --> 00:09:21,940
the presentation materials for

207
00:09:21,965 --> 00:09:22,875
the Murasame Industries project.

208
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,298
Have you tried discussing

209
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,642
it with Kanda-san?

210
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,634
I did, but it seems like

211
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:30,859
we're not quite on the same page.

212
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:42,800
Sorry.

213
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,950
- I have to go to the office.
- Huh?

214
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,390
Alright.

215
00:09:55,752 --> 00:09:59,430
(Sorry about earlier.
I couldn't make time.)

216
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:03,990
It's fine.

217
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,380
Please don't think too much about it.

218
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:19,090
(All-you-can-eat and drink. 1500 yen?)

219
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,530
You're radiating an aura of misfortune.

220
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,391
You startled me!

221
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,032
What are you doing back here?

222
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,760
I got a part-time job at a cafe.

223
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,760
I just thought I'd report it to you.

224
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,580
Oh, is that so?

225
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,120
Let's go there now for a change of mood.

226
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:40,610
Huh?

227
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,860
(Senpai Café)

228
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,540
Alright.

229
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,580
Orange juice and ginger ale.

230
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,730
Thank you.

231
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,252
Could you speak up a bit

232
00:10:51,277 --> 00:10:52,767
when placing your order?

233
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,670
Sorry!

234
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,910
- Wait, aren't you supposed to be...
- Not 'you',

235
00:11:00,948 --> 00:11:02,380
it's 'Ryuji-senpai', right?

236
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:11,472
You can't mistake friendliness

237
00:11:11,645 --> 00:11:13,902
and courtesy.

238
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,330
- Thank you for teaching me.
- Yeah.

239
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,470
That guy really ticks me off!

240
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,146
This is my first time seeing

241
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,296
you work in a weird place.

242
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,736
If the other party is a senpai,

243
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,370
then we'll become the junior.

244
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:30,540
Huh?

245
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,560
Looks like you're starting

246
00:11:32,584 --> 00:11:33,779
to get energetic again, huh?

247
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,170
Well, life has its tough moments.

248
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,610
Mind your own business.

249
00:11:43,794 --> 00:11:45,790
What's Soga-san up to?

250
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:47,550
Huh?

251
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,590
Isn't he supposed to help you out?

252
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,570
He tried to.

253
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,800
But he's busy with work.

254
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,260
- Ah, that's a convenient excuse.
- It's not.

255
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:02,420
More importantly,

256
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,760
why do I have to tell you anything?

257
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,740
It's none of your business.

258
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,360
Sorry for the wait. Here's your meal.

259
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,580
- I'm awesome.
- Do your best.

260
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,120
That's right.

261
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,920
- Man, my home is definitely this place!
- You're right.

262
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:27,770
So, the opening sale shop is over?

263
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,100
When talking about sales,

264
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:34,600
they've gone back to regular prices.

265
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,460
It's all about cash, huh?

266
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:44,140
Well, I'm glad you've come back, though.

267
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:47,270
Sorry!

268
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,083
Well... to be honest,

269
00:12:51,115 --> 00:12:53,665
we hesitated to come back here after

270
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,530
cheating on this place with another.

271
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,029
And all the regulars were

272
00:12:59,054 --> 00:13:01,054
scattered at different places.

273
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,980
- But it was because of Mizukichi...
- Yeah.

274
00:13:04,516 --> 00:13:05,230
Mizuki?

275
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,790
He went around to different places,

276
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,547
and said

277
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:12,477
'Please go back to Sakae-chan's place.'

278
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,399
He said 'Tamae' is an important

279
00:13:14,415 --> 00:13:15,855
place for him too.

280
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:16,900
- Right?
- Yes.

281
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:17,910
Him?

282
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,719
That's why, starting from today,

283
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,117
let's rely on each other again.

284
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,500
Hey, sometimes, putting

285
00:13:23,524 --> 00:13:25,156
some distance in relationships

286
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,960
can deepen the bond, you know?

287
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,480
Yes, like helping to choose a dish.

288
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,780
What are you saying?

289
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,840
What do you think you're doing?

290
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,750
Why would you lie about that?

291
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,192
Geez, what is it?

292
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,723
Yeah, I know. You're mad about that?

293
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,630
- I'm gonna beat you to a pulp!
- There's nothing to be angry about.

294
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,240
Hey, hey, let's calm down for a moment.

295
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,430
What? You stay out of this!

296
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,290
You want a piece of me?

297
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,860
- Wait, wait. Let's break up.
- Huh?

298
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,510
Huh?

299
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,030
We managed to escape.

300
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,090
Hey, who was that guy?

301
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,593
That guy back there...

302
00:14:43,618 --> 00:14:44,866
he was my boyfriend.

303
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,070
Your boyfriend?

304
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,150
Well, ex now.

305
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,240
He found out I was two-timing him.

306
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,800
Huh? Isn't that your fault?

307
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,190
I'm hungry.

308
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,190
I need something to eat.

309
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,090
So, you're a chef, huh?

310
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,790
Running the place all by yourself.

311
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,060
No.

312
00:15:28,307 --> 00:15:28,860
Huh?

313
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,600
My mom passed away from illness,

314
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,990
so I took over.

315
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,890
But I can't replicate her flavors,

316
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,480
and customers are leaving.

317
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,600
The appearance is not a problem.

318
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,940
Information is everything.

319
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,790
It can't be helped.

320
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,280
I guess I'll help out.

321
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:57,490
Huh?

322
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,610
Since I got kicked out of my ex's place.

323
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,520
Please let me live and work here.

324
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,900
Can you even cook?

325
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,600
Nope, but

326
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,060
whatever you can't do, I can do it.

327
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,380
Oww.

328
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,040
It's Soga-san.

329
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:29,780
Hello.

330
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,090
Oh, hello, Sakae-kun.

331
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,940
I'm truly sorry.

332
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,800
I couldn't do anything after all.

333
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,620
That's okay.

334
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,990
After all, our guest came back.

335
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,650
So, you know.

336
00:16:45,069 --> 00:16:47,633
How about I treat you to a meal

337
00:16:47,658 --> 00:16:49,391
as a way of apologizing?

338
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,000
You don't need to go to that trouble.

339
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,890
No, it's not just about that.

340
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,650
I also want to see your face, Sakae-kun.

341
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,220
And there are some

342
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,280
important things we need to discuss.

343
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,470
Isn't your work a lot?

344
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,400
I'll definitely manage it somehow!

345
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,010
So, what do you say?

346
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:21,990
I got it.

347
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,300
Shall we go then?

348
00:17:25,987 --> 00:17:27,420
Yes, thank you.

349
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,830
- Still alive, huh?
- Wow, Okawara-san is so strong.

350
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,130
- Can you please review this by today?
- Yes, I understand.

351
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,220
Sorry for the trouble.

352
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,310
Alright.

353
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,990
(Let's meet at seven PM tomorrow!)

354
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,580
This is the progress so far, sir.

355
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,265
Wow, as expected, the progress

356
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:13,809
has been very fast!

357
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,360
Alright, starting tomorrow,

358
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,524
I want one of you guys

359
00:18:16,532 --> 00:18:17,703
to take a lead role.

360
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,020
Me too!

361
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,600
- Well then, I'll take my leave.
- Yeah, thanks for your hard work.

362
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,950
- Thanks for your hard work.
- Yes.

363
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,050
Umm...

364
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,980
The quotation is due today?

365
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,570
I'm sorry.

366
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,355
I thought it was due

367
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,668
by the end of this week.

368
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,950
- I'll ask them to wait a little longer.
- Oh, please no.

369
00:18:41,575 --> 00:18:42,330
You see...

370
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,411
I kind of pressed them about their

371
00:18:45,427 --> 00:18:47,285
slow response on the phone yesterday.

372
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:47,950
Huh?

373
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:51,630
Given that, we can't afford to delay.

374
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,280
For now, just wait at the office.

375
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,390
I'm sorry.

376
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,780
Yes, yes.

377
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:13,760
You see...

378
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,050
Work stuff?

379
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,660
Yes.

380
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,030
Got it!

381
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,599
No problem at all!

382
00:19:24,318 --> 00:19:25,758
So please take your time.

383
00:19:27,385 --> 00:19:28,315
I'm sorry.

384
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,020
Yes. Maybe next time.

385
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:48,580
Oh, what a relief.

386
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,530
- Good, you're still here.
- What?

387
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,527
I heard you had a date

388
00:19:53,552 --> 00:19:55,072
from Kaname today,

389
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,277
so I came to see what kind

390
00:19:56,301 --> 00:19:57,355
of face you're making.

391
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,420
I see.

392
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,550
Huh? What's with that expression?

393
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,490
Did he cancel on you?

394
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,610
Man, that's harsh, Soga-san.

395
00:20:13,177 --> 00:20:14,337
It's not Soga-san's fault.

396
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,020
How could you not feel hurt?

397
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,050
An ex being treated badly.

398
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,750
What can I say?

399
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,220
In the past...

400
00:20:37,835 --> 00:20:38,765
I've always thought that I,

401
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,735
a human being, had to live alone.

402
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,300
- What's with all this sudden talk?
- Come on, listen up.

403
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,270
That's why I don't want to

404
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,560
get too deep into love.

405
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,101
As soon as I start

406
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,859
seeing each other's flaws,

407
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,460
we break up casually.

408
00:20:59,300 --> 00:20:59,980
But still,

409
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,730
you're special.

410
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,655
No matter how selfish I am,

411
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,218
you never get tired of me.

412
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,843
Whenever I'm in trouble,

413
00:21:14,868 --> 00:21:16,116
you're always there

414
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:17,405
to help me overcome it.

415
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,630
It's a shame for me

416
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,520
and I also feel guilty.

417
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,180
I'm afraid that my life

418
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,225
and other people's lives

419
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,265
will get mixed up.

420
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,470
All those feelings kept growing, and I

421
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,180
ended up running away from you.

422
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,260
Even so,

423
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,780
maybe there were other options.

424
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,370
- The me right now...
- I understand.

425
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,560
It doesn't have to be me.

426
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:58,470
But...

427
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,580
because you're special to me...

428
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,430
I just want you to be happy.

429
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,810
I understand you

430
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,330
better than Soga-san does.

431
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,100
Sorry for the wait.

432
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:10,690
(Next episode)

433
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:11,980
I won't back off.

434
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,960
(The wall of Tokyo that separates them)
In one year I will return to Tokyo.

435
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,600
(Declaring War and Laying Siege to the Love Fortress in Osaka)
Sakae is mine.

436
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,100
Mind your own business.

437
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,710
(what will their destiny be like?)
Perhaps it's called destiny.

438
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,500
Being just friends,

439
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,670
is alright, right?
