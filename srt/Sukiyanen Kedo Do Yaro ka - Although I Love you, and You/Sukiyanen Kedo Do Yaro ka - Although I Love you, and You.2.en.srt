1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,190
A black ship from Tokyo

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,070
has landed in my heart.

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,680
Please come again anytime.

4
00:00:06,777 --> 00:00:07,410
Yes.

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,285
People, regardless of their age,

6
00:00:09,293 --> 00:00:09,988
can change.

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,590
Meeting someone like Sakae-san

8
00:00:11,598 --> 00:00:12,746
made me feel grateful.

9
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,780
Thank you very much.

10
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:14,930
Oh no!

11
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,550
I want Soga-san to like us more.

12
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,370
Both Osaka

13
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,680
and me.

14
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:24,560
Soga-san.

15
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:26,860
I like you.

16
00:00:28,686 --> 00:00:29,447
What now?

17
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,460
Huh? No. What I just said...

18
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:41,670
I mean,

19
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,680
I like you as a person, you know?

20
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:46,750
As a person?

21
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,067
Yes, there are a lot of things

22
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,090
I can learn from you.

23
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:50,970
Ah,

24
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,820
I also like Sakae-san as a person.

25
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,420
Really? That's a relief.

26
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,670
So, what should we do?

27
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,170
Huh?

28
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,410
Well, you said, 'What now.'

29
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,250
Ah...

30
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,620
Like...

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,580
Do you need anything?

32
00:01:13,075 --> 00:01:13,860
Anything you need?

33
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,350
I screwed up!

34
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,616
I didn't say anything rude, did I?

35
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:24,640
(Kaname)
Choose between talking on the phone

36
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,230
or working out.

37
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,300
Ah, sorry.

38
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,420
I got a bit flustered.

39
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,060
Anyway,

40
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,300
you let your feelings slip out, huh?

41
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,890
I told him that I like him.

42
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,420
And after that...

43
00:01:40,904 --> 00:01:42,680
I asked him "what now?"

44
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,180
That sounds like a confession.

45
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,750
So it does, huh?

46
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,770
Ahh!

47
00:01:51,624 --> 00:01:54,080
It's like you're searching for an answer,

48
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,080
either a yes or a no.

49
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,380
Hey, Kaname.

50
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,600
What do you think I should do?

51
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,420
By the way, I have a question.

52
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:04,790
What?

53
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,165
Why don't you just tell him

54
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,048
how you really feel?

55
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,150
No, that's not happening.

56
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,550
Then keep an eye on things for now.

57
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,610
Huh?

58
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,790
Keep an eye on things?

59
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,212
Continue your relationship as usual

60
00:02:20,237 --> 00:02:21,845
and figure out what to do.

61
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,165
Maybe Soga-san isn't

62
00:02:24,173 --> 00:02:25,493
too concerned about it?

63
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,680
If that's the case,

64
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,400
it might be fine.

65
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,570
What's the meaning of "what now?"

66
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,124
"What now?" is a question that

67
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,859
invites one to agree to something.

68
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,800
Then what is it

69
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,670
that I have to answer?

70
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:38,620
"Although I Love You, And You?"

71
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:40,461
"Episode 2: I've said it. What now?"

72
00:03:40,461 --> 00:03:41,700
(Estimate)

73
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,260
Yes, speaking.

74
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,130
- How is it?
- How is it? Huh?

75
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,790
Do you think the quote is all right?

76
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,410
Huh?

77
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,110
Oh, oh.

78
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,780
Yes. Thank you very much.

79
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,380
Thanks for your hard work.

80
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,873
I know it was tough,

81
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:02,185
but you two managed to

82
00:04:02,194 --> 00:04:03,715
finalize the contract nicely.

83
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,460
No, it wasn't particularly tough.

84
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,380
As expected of you two.

85
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,570
- Well, what now?
- What now?

86
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,230
What's wrong?

87
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,910
Uh, it's nothing. I'm sorry.

88
00:04:14,952 --> 00:04:16,432
Oh, right.

89
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,212
As a token of appreciation,

90
00:04:18,227 --> 00:04:19,928
I was thinking of treating

91
00:04:19,936 --> 00:04:21,545
you two to a meal.

92
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,340
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

93
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,271
For outstanding subordinates like you,

94
00:04:25,303 --> 00:04:26,826
it's only fair to show my gratitude.

95
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,450
Feel free to choose anything.

96
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,400
Soga-san, any preference?

97
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,010
- No, nothing in particular.
- Then I would like to go to...

98
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,180
Tamae!

99
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:38,450
Huh?

100
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,940
(Please forget about the 'what now'
from the other day)

101
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,570
It could have been

102
00:05:04,586 --> 00:05:05,655
something more expensive.

103
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,450
I'll pay for that myself.

104
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,507
You know, Sakae-kun there

105
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:11,556
is quite handsome.

106
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,440
Maybe you've fallen for him?

107
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,820
- Ah, Chief.
- Hmm?

108
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,150
Ah, sorry.

109
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,500
Not that kind of relationship, right?

110
00:05:23,035 --> 00:05:24,140
Am I right?

111
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,140
I did find him quite cool.

112
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,130
- Huh?
- Huh?

113
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,530
Does that mean...

114
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,690
Chief Takagi.

115
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,860
It may sound arrogant,

116
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,363
but I believe I've contributed

117
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,652
significantly to our department, right?

118
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,590
Oh, certainly.

119
00:05:41,988 --> 00:05:44,054
When you made mistakes,

120
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:47,375
I've already helped you twice, right?

121
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,880
Well...

122
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,010
In that case,

123
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,972
please tell Sakae-san

124
00:05:51,997 --> 00:05:54,253
about my good points tonight.

125
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,520
I understand.

126
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,310
Thank you very much.

127
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,750
Ah, youth...

128
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,370
Indeed.

129
00:06:06,172 --> 00:06:06,649
(Tamae)

130
00:06:06,674 --> 00:06:08,444
- And at the time...
- Yeah.

131
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,233
in an atmosphere where no one

132
00:06:10,249 --> 00:06:11,526
dared to work overtime,

133
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,730
Kanda-san boldly raised her hand

134
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,200
and said, 'I'll do it.'

135
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,250
Come on, enough of that.

136
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,580
Wow, Kazuyo-chan is awesome.

137
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,580
And then, well...

138
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,130
- About Yumi-chan.
- Oh, right.

139
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,050
This girl, Yumi-chan,

140
00:06:30,074 --> 00:06:31,875
made a huge mistake,

141
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,909
but Kanda-san covered

142
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:35,665
for her completely.

143
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,682
Saying I covered completely

144
00:06:36,707 --> 00:06:37,506
is an exaggeration.

145
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,430
Is that so?

146
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,210
- Otherwise, it'd have been terrible.
- Right.

147
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,440
- Drink up.
- Huh? Is that alright? Oh.

148
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,160
- Oh!
- Oh!

149
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,158
So many kinds of sake

150
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:47,136
I've never heard of.

151
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,710
Right.

152
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,525
I want everyone to try something unique

153
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,106
that you can't find elsewhere.

154
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,533
Then I'll try "Turn a deaf ear."

155
00:06:53,549 --> 00:06:55,366
How many cups should we get?

156
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,180
- Good choice.
- And you, Soga-san?

157
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,720
Oh, yes. I'll join you.

158
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,430
Oh, great, for five people then.

159
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,070
- Let's drink!
- Oh, let's drink!

160
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,260
Sakae, cups please!

161
00:07:06,766 --> 00:07:08,956
Thanks for your hard work, Chief.

162
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,880
Oh, oh!

163
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,800
Oh, look at how you pour.

164
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,980
- It almost overflowed.
- It runs out.

165
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,720
This is pretty good.

166
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,020
- It's easy to drink.
- Yeah.

167
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,400
- Delicious!
- Full cup.

168
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,340
Oh, nice.

169
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,760
Huh? You're leaving?

170
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,910
I have to leave now.

171
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,670
You have to leave now, huh?

172
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,940
You have to drink it all at once, okay?

173
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,240
- Chief.
- Huh?

174
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,955
What are you doing?

175
00:07:35,963 --> 00:07:36,866
There's still some left.

176
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,890
- I can't take it anymore.
- Come on.

177
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,850
Maybe we should stop at this point.

178
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:41,900
Yes!

179
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,408
By the way,

180
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:46,133
there's something I wanted to ask you.

181
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,280
Yeah?

182
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,880
Sakae-san...

183
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,440
are you dating someone right now or...

184
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,180
Huh?

185
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:55,770
Soga-san.

186
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,810
Hey, Soga-san?

187
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,480
Soga-san, are you all right?

188
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,530
- Soga-kun...
- Soga-san, pull yourself together.

189
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,290
- He's a lightweight.
- Soga-san, are you okay?

190
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,330
- Soga-san!
- This is no good.

191
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,430
Hey, Hisashi-kun.

192
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:09,760
Here.

193
00:08:12,611 --> 00:08:14,352
(Divorce Certificate)

194
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,490
Oh.

195
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,902
We're going to walk separate paths

196
00:08:17,926 --> 00:08:18,926
from now on,

197
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,450
so maybe I shouldn't say this, but...

198
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,710
Huh?

199
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,340
I...

200
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,540
Huh? Saeko-san?

201
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,530
Saeko-san.

202
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,610
Saeko-san!

203
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,750
Saeko-san!

204
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,690
Saeko-san...

205
00:08:41,234 --> 00:08:42,604
What a relief.

206
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,280
Where is this?

207
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,310
My place.

208
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:47,470
Well,

209
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,210
just up the stairs from the shop.

210
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,160
I'm sorry!

211
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,460
Ah, no sudden movements!

212
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,000
Drink some water.

213
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,340
Are you alright?

214
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,350
6 o'clock?

215
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:11,640
Did you stay up all night?

216
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,910
You have to moderate your drinking.

217
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:16,570
Yes.

218
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:25,750
- You see...
- You see...

219
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,750
- Ah, you go first.
- It's fine, please speak.

220
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,010
Well...

221
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,000
About that...

222
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:37,130
What I ask the other day...

223
00:09:37,602 --> 00:09:40,560
"What now?"

224
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,790
I like you. What now?

225
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,760
Oh, that matter.

226
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,510
You see...

227
00:09:54,472 --> 00:09:55,874
Why don't you just tell him

228
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:57,733
how you really feel?

229
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,110
You see...

230
00:10:02,114 --> 00:10:03,288
I mean,

231
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:05,923
I wonder if we could become friends.

232
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,060
Friends?

233
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,540
Yes, friends.

234
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,320
Even though there's a bit of an age gap,

235
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,931
I think we might get along well.

236
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:20,850
I'm happy.

237
00:10:23,481 --> 00:10:24,438
I've actually been

238
00:10:24,463 --> 00:10:25,572
thinking that way too.

239
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,800
Sakae-san is

240
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,070
You're kind, bright,

241
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,700
and sometimes say things firmly.

242
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,510
I really respect you.

243
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,280
I really want to

244
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,180
be your friend, Sakae-san.

245
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:49,440
Yes.

246
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,351
It's my pleasure.

247
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,080
I'm counting on you!

248
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,360
Huh? Soga-san do you believe in aliens?

249
00:11:05,024 --> 00:11:06,429
Well, there are many stars

250
00:11:06,462 --> 00:11:07,695
out there after all.

251
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:11,089
I personally don't think they exist.

252
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,400
Huh? Really?

253
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,720
It's a little complicated,

254
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,047
but I think I should be satisfied

255
00:11:16,072 --> 00:11:17,572
with this kind of relationship.

256
00:11:17,805 --> 00:11:19,095
- Ah, but...
- Excuse me.

257
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,110
Have you ever seen Upho?

258
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,640
I've only seen UFOs.

259
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,250
- You're annoying.
- You've seen UFOs?

260
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,300
- Aren't you drunk?
- Yeah but I can endure.

261
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,650
Endure?

262
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:30,650
What happened?

263
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:32,780
Huh?

264
00:11:32,805 --> 00:11:34,905
It's just you looked a bit serious.

265
00:11:36,115 --> 00:11:38,865
Oh, it's just work-related stuff.

266
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,270
- I'm fine now.
- Is that so?

267
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,600
By the way, do you believe in ghosts?

268
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,390
Huh? Still talking about

269
00:11:46,407 --> 00:11:47,734
this kind of stuff?

270
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,410
What have you been saying since earlier?

271
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,670
What is it?

272
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,270
- Hmm?
- Ghosts?

273
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,830
- Seriously?
- So annoying.

274
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,960
I'm sorry. It's nothing.

275
00:11:58,376 --> 00:11:59,696
Is it work again?

276
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,950
Yes, another matter, sort of.

277
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:03,770
It must be tough.

278
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,164
If you like,

279
00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:06,765
I can listen to your complaints.

280
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,020
It's nothing.

281
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,020
Please don't mind about my issues.

282
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,100
You seem so busy.

283
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,610
- "About my issues?"
- A bit, yeah.

284
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,310
That's a talented worker for you.

285
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,580
- You don't really have free time.
- But you've come all the way here.

286
00:12:23,232 --> 00:12:25,066
That's good, isn't it? You and Soga-san

287
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,090
have become closer.

288
00:12:27,656 --> 00:12:28,728
Yeah, well,

289
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,168
that's true, but...

290
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,761
What? Is it still about wanting to be

291
00:12:33,777 --> 00:12:34,949
in a relationship?

292
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,890
I don't really hope for that.

293
00:12:39,568 --> 00:12:40,272
But...

294
00:12:41,184 --> 00:12:42,762
I wish he would show a bit more

295
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:43,816
of himself to me.

296
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,056
Huh?

297
00:12:45,952 --> 00:12:46,816
Soga-san

298
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:49,728
hardly talks about work or anything.

299
00:12:50,984 --> 00:12:52,043
It's always about whether

300
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:52,996
there are aliens

301
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:54,525
or ghosts.

302
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,410
It's always those kinds of discussions.

303
00:12:56,528 --> 00:12:59,376
Is he still on about aliens and ghosts?

304
00:12:59,952 --> 00:13:00,800
Aliens.

305
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,375
Ghosts.

306
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,144
Sp...

307
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,820
- Space...
- I'm done with that discussion!

308
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,312
I'm sorry.

309
00:13:11,313 --> 00:13:12,099
Let's get out.

310
00:13:14,432 --> 00:13:16,576
I wonder if he doesn't trust me.

311
00:13:18,448 --> 00:13:20,032
That's not right, is it?

312
00:13:20,656 --> 00:13:22,858
He has a boundary about what to share?

313
00:13:29,712 --> 00:13:30,512
I

314
00:13:32,128 --> 00:13:34,032
want to cross that line, you know?

315
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,890
What's the point of you listening to

316
00:13:36,906 --> 00:13:38,085
the problems of a salaryman?

317
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,808
I don't know about that.

318
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,392
But I want to know more about Soga-san

319
00:13:46,016 --> 00:13:48,240
and be of help if I can.

320
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,392
I see.

321
00:13:54,112 --> 00:13:55,952
Well, even if I want to do that,

322
00:13:57,328 --> 00:13:58,426
I don't really know

323
00:13:58,451 --> 00:13:59,747
what I can do for him...

324
00:14:04,384 --> 00:14:05,408
Right.

325
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,104
About aliens and ghosts...

326
00:14:13,105 --> 00:14:15,029
Enough about that already.

327
00:14:25,136 --> 00:14:27,952
Hey, Soga-kun, why the long face?

328
00:14:28,624 --> 00:14:29,200
Ah.

329
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,616
Sorry, it's nothing.

330
00:14:31,968 --> 00:14:32,960
Really?

331
00:14:40,128 --> 00:14:40,864
Soga-san,

332
00:14:41,472 --> 00:14:42,987
If you have something on your mind,

333
00:14:42,995 --> 00:14:43,815
I'm all ears.

334
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,816
Actually...

335
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,690
I've been consciously trying to adopt

336
00:14:50,706 --> 00:14:52,965
the Osaka style of communication lately.

337
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,339
Emphasizing the importance

338
00:14:54,363 --> 00:14:55,362
of the moment,

339
00:14:55,387 --> 00:14:57,128
not killing the flow of conversation...

340
00:14:57,328 --> 00:14:58,160
That sounds good.

341
00:14:58,528 --> 00:15:00,960
But it seems to be backfiring on me.

342
00:15:01,408 --> 00:15:02,544
Isn't that right?

343
00:15:02,832 --> 00:15:04,120
Once you're here,

344
00:15:04,144 --> 00:15:05,801
you'll end up eating takoyaki, right?

345
00:15:05,825 --> 00:15:06,581
Yes.

346
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:08,784
It's like soul food.

347
00:15:08,848 --> 00:15:11,182
Then, you've probably cooked

348
00:15:11,207 --> 00:15:13,901
takoyaki at home too, right?

349
00:15:14,386 --> 00:15:14,752
Huh?

350
00:15:15,136 --> 00:15:16,672
Are you good at it?

351
00:15:16,673 --> 00:15:17,651
Yes.

352
00:15:17,652 --> 00:15:19,565
I'm getting the hang of it gradually,

353
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,629
and now, I'm quite...

354
00:15:22,224 --> 00:15:23,344
Oh, Soga-kun,

355
00:15:23,536 --> 00:15:24,800
how about coming to

356
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:26,198
my home party next time

357
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,030
and cooking some takoyaki?

358
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,624
Huh?

359
00:15:29,008 --> 00:15:30,893
Who came all the way from Tokyo

360
00:15:30,918 --> 00:15:32,114
and can cook well!

361
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,829
I think it'll liven up our employees.

362
00:15:34,884 --> 00:15:36,804
- Ah. Good idea.
- Right.

363
00:15:39,808 --> 00:15:40,224
Yes.

364
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,560
I understand!

365
00:15:46,224 --> 00:15:48,608
Actually, I've never cooked it before...

366
00:15:49,952 --> 00:15:51,824
Well, you've done it now.

367
00:15:53,104 --> 00:15:55,378
If you have a proper takoyaki maker,

368
00:15:55,403 --> 00:15:56,930
it should be fine, right?

369
00:15:56,977 --> 00:15:58,823
That's what I thought, so I bought one.

370
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,816
But this is what it

371
00:16:03,456 --> 00:16:04,200
turned out to be.

372
00:16:05,648 --> 00:16:06,878
What kind of mistake

373
00:16:06,902 --> 00:16:08,433
did you make to get this?

374
00:16:08,496 --> 00:16:09,792
Is that takoyaki?

375
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,488
Wait, isn't this

376
00:16:13,183 --> 00:16:14,160
a chance?

377
00:16:14,704 --> 00:16:15,408
Soga-san,

378
00:16:17,383 --> 00:16:18,534
if you're okay with it,

379
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,886
shall I give you a lesson?

380
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:20,896
Huh?

381
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:23,007
After all,

382
00:16:23,488 --> 00:16:25,328
I'm a professional chef.

383
00:16:27,024 --> 00:16:28,128
Is it okay?

384
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,072
- Yes.
- Oh, that shouldn't be a problem.

385
00:16:32,064 --> 00:16:33,680
Alright, check, please.

386
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,580
- Thank you.
- Oh, that's right.

387
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,416
Me too.

388
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:38,000
20 000 000 yen.

389
00:16:38,384 --> 00:16:40,480
- Thank you. Please come again.
- Sure.

390
00:16:41,136 --> 00:16:42,592
Soga-kun, do your best.

391
00:16:42,592 --> 00:16:44,590
- Yes, thank you.
- I'm stuffed.

392
00:16:47,232 --> 00:16:48,064
Alright.

393
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,632
How about a lesson at your place?

394
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:50,307
I'm sorry.

395
00:16:51,072 --> 00:16:52,119
Please forget what

396
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,401
we talked about earlier.

397
00:16:54,224 --> 00:16:54,576
Huh?

398
00:16:55,328 --> 00:16:56,272
Why?

399
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,712
Well...

400
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,208
the other day,

401
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,488
I got drunk and you helped me out...

402
00:17:05,008 --> 00:17:08,544
I owe you one from that time.

403
00:17:09,648 --> 00:17:10,240
Huh?

404
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:13,552
So, taking your help again

405
00:17:13,664 --> 00:17:16,320
while I haven't repaid that debt yet...

406
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:18,496
Well,

407
00:17:19,216 --> 00:17:20,612
If our roles were reversed,

408
00:17:20,636 --> 00:17:22,436
would you be concerned?

409
00:17:22,816 --> 00:17:23,932
If I keep borrowing

410
00:17:23,957 --> 00:17:25,175
without ever repaying.

411
00:17:27,056 --> 00:17:27,616
No.

412
00:17:27,888 --> 00:17:29,952
So why are you thinking like that?

413
00:17:30,608 --> 00:17:32,688
Do I look like a calculating person?

414
00:17:34,112 --> 00:17:36,307
If you need me 100 times in a row,

415
00:17:36,332 --> 00:17:37,452
I don't mind.

416
00:17:39,056 --> 00:17:40,417
In return,

417
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:42,340
when I need you 100 times in a row,

418
00:17:42,864 --> 00:17:44,040
I won't worry about it.

419
00:17:45,584 --> 00:17:46,816
I want to have that kind

420
00:17:48,655 --> 00:17:50,248
of relationship with Soga-san.

421
00:17:54,816 --> 00:17:56,519
We're going to walk separate paths

422
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:57,535
from now on,

423
00:17:58,048 --> 00:18:00,896
so maybe I shouldn't say this, but...

424
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:02,640
Huh?

425
00:18:03,536 --> 00:18:04,704
I...

426
00:18:04,705 --> 00:18:06,293
I hope that Hisashi-kun

427
00:18:06,432 --> 00:18:09,472
will be able to rely on others more.

428
00:18:10,336 --> 00:18:13,584
I thought I was trying to do that.

429
00:18:14,601 --> 00:18:15,945
'If it's this person,

430
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,961
I can rely on them with peace of mind.'

431
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,750
I sincerely wish for

432
00:18:20,775 --> 00:18:22,455
someone like that to

433
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,088
appear in front of you.

434
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,200
(Divorce Certificate)

435
00:18:37,296 --> 00:18:37,984
Umm...

436
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,290
Can I

437
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,950
ask you for a favor?

438
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:49,614
I've been saying that

439
00:18:49,623 --> 00:18:50,794
from the beginning.

440
00:18:56,816 --> 00:18:58,288
(SND Residence)
Thank you for having me.

441
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:07,248
Oh, foreign books.

442
00:19:08,553 --> 00:19:10,194
I don't understand them,

443
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:11,615
but they look stylish.

444
00:19:12,928 --> 00:19:14,304
Sakae-san.

445
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,136
Huh?

446
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,272
Oh, right, takoyaki, yes.

447
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:26,096
Divide into two portions for pouring.

448
00:19:26,097 --> 00:19:26,791
Yes.

449
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:33,344
Mix it well until there are no lumps.

450
00:19:50,992 --> 00:19:52,304
Ah, this way.

451
00:19:55,488 --> 00:19:56,928
- Flip it.
- Oh!

452
00:20:03,904 --> 00:20:04,688
Got it?

453
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:08,920
Yes.

454
00:20:14,656 --> 00:20:17,520
It's done, I suppose.

455
00:20:18,848 --> 00:20:20,080
Looks good!

456
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,632
Sakae-san, were you always

457
00:20:35,657 --> 00:20:37,017
good at cooking?

458
00:20:37,648 --> 00:20:38,800
Oh, no.

459
00:20:39,296 --> 00:20:40,928
To be honest, not at all.

460
00:20:41,984 --> 00:20:43,360
Really? That's surprising.

461
00:20:45,056 --> 00:20:46,523
Originally, my mom managed

462
00:20:46,547 --> 00:20:47,671
our family restaurant.

463
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,480
I just worked part-time.

464
00:20:51,744 --> 00:20:54,080
But my mom got sick and passed away,

465
00:20:56,336 --> 00:20:57,920
so I decided to

466
00:20:58,448 --> 00:20:59,920
to keep the place going

467
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,096
by seriously studing cooking.

468
00:21:03,568 --> 00:21:05,248
I see...

469
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,064
Well, there were various other things.

470
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,390
Various things?

471
00:21:12,976 --> 00:21:14,400
Let's save that for another time.

472
00:21:16,752 --> 00:21:17,424
Yes.

473
00:21:19,856 --> 00:21:22,096
By the way, Soga-san,

474
00:21:22,705 --> 00:21:24,624
could you stop using polite language?

475
00:21:25,328 --> 00:21:25,968
Huh?

476
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,904
And

477
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,619
I don't like being called

478
00:21:29,635 --> 00:21:30,666
'Sakae-san' either.

479
00:21:35,568 --> 00:21:36,544
Umm...

480
00:21:38,272 --> 00:21:39,056
Then...

481
00:21:40,896 --> 00:21:42,016
Can Sakae-san also

482
00:21:42,464 --> 00:21:44,010
stop using it?

483
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:46,896
Yeah.

484
00:21:47,936 --> 00:21:48,784
Both of us.

485
00:21:50,717 --> 00:21:51,366
Yeah.

486
00:21:51,616 --> 00:21:53,232
I understand, Sakae-san...

487
00:21:54,576 --> 00:21:55,328
Sakae...

488
00:21:56,496 --> 00:21:57,056
kun.

489
00:21:58,816 --> 00:22:00,416
That feels so forced.

490
00:22:04,384 --> 00:22:06,944
Well, we'll get used to it eventually.

491
00:22:06,945 --> 00:22:07,365
Ah.

492
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,496
Sauce.

493
00:22:22,224 --> 00:22:23,888
Sakae... kun.

494
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:45,216
Sorry for the wait.

495
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,320
Delicious!

496
00:23:10,576 --> 00:23:12,032
(Next episode)
If you don't mind, let's go together.

497
00:23:12,048 --> 00:23:13,240
(First date...)
First date...

498
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,000
(Maybe)
Maybe.

499
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,896
He's perfect as far as people go.

500
00:23:16,905 --> 00:23:20,127
(Osaka's love triangle)
Kazuyo-chan likes you 100%

501
00:23:20,128 --> 00:23:22,030
I'm actually in love.

502
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,944
Sakae-san feels the same way, right?
