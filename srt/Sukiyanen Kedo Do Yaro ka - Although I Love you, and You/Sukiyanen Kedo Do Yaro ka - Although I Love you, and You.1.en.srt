1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:02,570
Hey,

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,880
Should we end our relationship?

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,120
You and I...

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,590
Let's break up.

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,630
I know

6
00:00:18,813 --> 00:00:20,450
it was pointless to say anything more.

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,897
If I hadn't told you

8
00:00:22,906 --> 00:00:24,288
that I loved you that day,

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,634
maybe I wouldn't have to feel this way.

10
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,190
Good morning.

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,840
Oh, leave that there!

12
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,420
Thanks for the delivery.

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,905
It's special today,

14
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,520
there are spring onions too.

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,930
- Oh, thank you!
- They're especially good!

16
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,710
Yeah,

17
00:01:23,507 --> 00:01:24,586
it's got a good flavor.

18
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,990
It's freezing.

19
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,550
You here?

20
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,420
Come in!

21
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,200
Let's make a toast!

22
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,730
Let's drink a lot today.

23
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,070
- Excuse me.
- Over here too.

24
00:01:40,406 --> 00:01:41,500
Sorry to keep you waiting.

25
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,210
- Thank you, thank you.
- Thank you.

26
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,070
But you know,

27
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,625
Sakae-kun, you're starting to

28
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,664
exude an air of authority,

29
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,636
just like Tamae-san.

30
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,850
- Really?
- Yeah.

31
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,710
Geez, not quite there yet.

32
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,859
Inside, he's still the same

33
00:01:54,883 --> 00:01:55,906
as when he was a kid.

34
00:01:55,931 --> 00:01:56,906
Quit it.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,031
And is it okay for you

36
00:01:58,056 --> 00:01:59,077
to come here alone

37
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:00,270
when you just got married?

38
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,766
My wife has a school reunion.

39
00:02:01,774 --> 00:02:03,656
We understand each other, so no worries.

40
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,650
Yeah, drink up.

41
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,370
So Kaname-kun has finally tied the knot.

42
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,400
And you, Sakae-kun?

43
00:02:11,672 --> 00:02:12,570
Not dating anyone?

44
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,100
Oh, yes.

45
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:17,445
What a waste, being handsome and all.

46
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,550
That's right.

47
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,330
Oh no. It's from my wife.

48
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,200
Sorry, let's settle the bill.

49
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,080
Sure.

50
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,750
Alright, 20 million yen.

51
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:28,616
Keep the change.

52
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,640
Huh, two million yen?

53
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,930
You're already drunk.

54
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,470
A tip for the excellent service.

55
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,740
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

56
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,510
- Hey, I'll head back first.
- Yeah, see you later.

57
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,220
- Looking forward to your next visit.
- Yeah, thanks.

58
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,470
- Say hello to Aya-chan for me.
- Yeah, yeah.

59
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,222
You're really not looking

60
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:45,707
for someone new?

61
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,347
No. I'm too occupied with

62
00:02:47,372 --> 00:02:48,754
this restaurant right now.

63
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,670
Sakae-kun, I'll have grilled saury.

64
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:52,750
Sure!

65
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,550
Oh, this is an excellent saury.

66
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,860
The smoke is too much!

67
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,650
That's because it's packed with fat...

68
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,990
You're coughing too!

69
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,800
- So much fat.
- Oh no, take it away!

70
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,930
Wow, that's a lot of smoke.

71
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:11,800
Oh, Takagi-san,

72
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,660
- welcome.
- Yeah.

73
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,105
Do you have two available seats?

74
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,980
- Yes, please come in.
- Alright.

75
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,810
Hey, Soga-kun!

76
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,980
Excuse me.

77
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,070
"Although I Love You, And You?"

78
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,780
"Episode 1: What am I going
to do, now that I've met you?"

79
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,561
Bon appétit.

80
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:27,467
Are you really okay?

81
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,650
Delicious.

82
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,070
Thank you.

83
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,123
Sorry to keep you waiting.

84
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,717
Oh! Here it is!

85
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,580
Wow, amazing.

86
00:05:26,222 --> 00:05:27,256
Eating so gracefully,

87
00:05:27,288 --> 00:05:28,316
it looks delicious.

88
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,710
No, it's really delicious.

89
00:05:32,045 --> 00:05:34,725
Hey bro, you transferred from Tokyo?

90
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,570
- Oh, oh!
- Hey, what are you doing?

91
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,460
Sorry, sorry.

92
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,370
- Sorry.
- It's alright.

93
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,470
Please stand properly.

94
00:05:41,555 --> 00:05:43,165
Sakae, towel please.

95
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,740
Towel please, Sakae!

96
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,920
Hey, pull yourself together.

97
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,470
- Sakae, towel please!
- Oh. Yeah.

98
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,850
Please use this!

99
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,570
Oh, excuse me.

100
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:54,840
Thank you very much.

101
00:06:08,739 --> 00:06:10,027
The atmosphere here is

102
00:06:10,052 --> 00:06:11,692
very Osaka-like, isn't it?

103
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,220
Yes, indeed.

104
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,590
- I feel like coming back again.
- By all means!

105
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,060
Huh?

106
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,050
Anytime...

107
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,580
please come again.

108
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:23,680
Oh.

109
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,710
Yes.

110
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,340
A black ship...

111
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,990
a black ship from Tokyo

112
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,650
has landed in my heart.

113
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,100
What kind of expression is that?

114
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,270
Eating my food so deliciously,

115
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,013
even spilling beer

116
00:06:52,021 --> 00:06:53,583
and gently wiping it away...

117
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,130
Hey, Kaname...

118
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,430
Do you always carry a handkerchief?

119
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,430
- Of course not.
- Right?

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,580
This is all already so different.

121
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,140
Am I being dissed?

122
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,310
His choice of words is polite,

123
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,440
his smile is gentle,

124
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,150
and...

125
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,820
when he loosens his tie like that?

126
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,180
It's incredibly seductive!

127
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,700
He said he wants to come back again.

128
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,780
I wonder when...

129
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,890
I wonder when he'll come again.

130
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,280
I'm sorry.

131
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,440
Understood.

132
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,800
We'll proceed with the contract.

133
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,740
- Thank you very much!
- Thank you very much!

134
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,629
But really,

135
00:08:03,653 --> 00:08:05,936
this is a well-prepared presentation.

136
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,840
Is that so?

137
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,325
As expected from someone sent from

138
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,489
the Tokyo headquarters,

139
00:08:09,514 --> 00:08:10,890
so dedicated.

140
00:08:11,411 --> 00:08:12,500
Thank you very much.

141
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,370
Even though starting next month,

142
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,060
you'll be transferring to our company.

143
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,400
Huh?

144
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,420
Soga-kun, do your best over there too.

145
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,360
No, I'm kidding. How could it be true?

146
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,040
You're right.

147
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,730
- Right. I'm sorry.
- You're so serious.

148
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,290
Can I help you?

149
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,490
Oh, that's kind of you.

150
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,080
- Can you take half of it then?
- Ah, yes.

151
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,690
I'm really sorry.

152
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,600
Soga-san,

153
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,216
you look even more dignified

154
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:45,334
from the side.

155
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,420
Ever consider acting in a period drama?

156
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,660
- Oh... No.
- Come on, you can do it.

157
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,200
Umm... Oh, Soga-kun!

158
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,230
Kanda-san,

159
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,905
can you come here?

160
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:00,660
- Yes.
- Yes.

161
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,430
Excuse me.

162
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,443
About the procurement of

163
00:09:05,452 --> 00:09:07,068
those wine glasses,

164
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,230
could I leave it to you two?

165
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,960
- Me and Soga-san?
- Yes.

166
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,830
It's a fairly significant deal,

167
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,228
so I want our two rising stars

168
00:09:17,236 --> 00:09:18,236
to team up

169
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,980
and handle it together.

170
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,320
Understood.

171
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,180
I'll do our best.

172
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,030
Thank you,

173
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,550
I'm counting on you.

174
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,800
- Ah, Sueyoshi-kun!
- Yes?

175
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,060
Can you come here?

176
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,150
Let's do our best.

177
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,820
Soga-san, are you busy tonight?

178
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,210
Huh?

179
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,650
- It's him.
- Yeah. By the way...

180
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,220
You know...

181
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,320
How is that okay?

182
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:52,990
Hello.

183
00:09:54,187 --> 00:09:55,640
Oh, Soga-san,

184
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,660
welcome!

185
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,360
- Are there available seats?
- Yes.

186
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,150
Good evening.

187
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,370
Welcome.

188
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,820
- Sakae-kun.
- Yes?

189
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,660
Those two seem to have

190
00:10:15,685 --> 00:10:16,723
a good vibe, yeah?

191
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,420
- Ah, would you like another...
- I...

192
00:10:25,187 --> 00:10:27,157
I need to tell you something, Soga-san.

193
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,530
Oh, a confession?

194
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,200
What is it?

195
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,110
Soga-san, do you...

196
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,590
dislike Osaka people?

197
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,160
- Huh?
- Huh?

198
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,414
I wanted to ask you clearly

199
00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:45,602
before we team up.

200
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,810
How did it turn out like this?

201
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,110
- I don't get it.
- I don't know.

202
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,990
No, it's not like that...

203
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,641
When someone jokes with you,

204
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:54,125
your expression tightens.

205
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,921
"I dislike it"

206
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,704
You must be thinking that, right?

207
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:02,240
- About that...
- Enough! It's fine if that's the case.

208
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,070
But if you hide your true feelings,

209
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,478
you would be unable to

210
00:11:06,494 --> 00:11:07,736
build trust with anyone.

211
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,880
Can you tell me honestly?

212
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,510
It's really not like that.

213
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,340
Really?

214
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,220
Yes.

215
00:11:21,536 --> 00:11:23,876
How should I put it...

216
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,820
Sorry to keep you waiting.

217
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,940
Ah, thank you.

218
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,280
You see...

219
00:11:30,927 --> 00:11:33,077
- I overheard everything.
- Huh?

220
00:11:33,787 --> 00:11:35,810
There might be a misunderstanding.

221
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,964
Just the other day, Soga-san

222
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,403
was having a pleasant conversation

223
00:11:39,411 --> 00:11:40,666
with regular customers here.

224
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:41,910
- Yeah.
- It's true.

225
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,190
Huh? Is that so?

226
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,810
Maybe he's still a bit nervous at work?

227
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,130
Right?

228
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:50,690
Ummm...

229
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,460
I suppose so.

230
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,520
Give it a bit more time, won't you?

231
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,310
I understand.

232
00:12:00,297 --> 00:12:01,817
I'm sorry for raising unnecessary doubts.

233
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,570
No, it's okay.

234
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,360
Well,

235
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,870
Feeling uneasy when things are unclear

236
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,870
- is understandable.
- Huh? You get it?

237
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,170
Yes. Like capybaras and kabiparas.

238
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,350
You have to check which is which first.

239
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,720
What was that?

240
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,460
Isn't that too different?

241
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,340
Is that so?

242
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,000
This is incredibly delicious!

243
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,800
Thank you.

244
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,450
What an eager colleague.

245
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,670
Everyone loves and respects you.

246
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,160
I'm glad that I was able to

247
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,635
clear up Soga-san's misunderstanding.

248
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,620
So, it did get through after all.

249
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,600
Huh?

250
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,750
Huh... Umm...

251
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,692
I mean,

252
00:12:54,717 --> 00:12:56,692
it's not that I dislike them at all.

253
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,830
Really, just a tiny bit...

254
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,227
I guess I'm not very comfortable

255
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:06,555
with people from Osaka.

256
00:13:08,405 --> 00:13:10,295
Their loud voices,

257
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,990
how they speak so fast, and...

258
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,120
And...

259
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,296
It feels like they always

260
00:13:18,321 --> 00:13:20,156
expect something humorous.

261
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,940
The new project in 2024

262
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,020
will be both cool and unifying,

263
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,480
and will make the shop more modern.

264
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,430
This concludes my presentation.

265
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,640
Where's the punchline?

266
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,420
Yes?

267
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,486
A presentation without a punchline

268
00:13:37,494 --> 00:13:38,946
isn't a presentation.

269
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,430
Are you underestimating Osaka?

270
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,200
You need to grab attention with a joke!

271
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,200
Throw in a joke every 30 seconds!

272
00:13:44,225 --> 00:13:46,635
Don't underestimate us!

273
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,300
That's my impression.

274
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,235
What kind of prejudice is that?

275
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,600
He seems to have quite a strong aversion.

276
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,240
If there's really such a funky company,

277
00:14:00,265 --> 00:14:01,945
tell me! Where is it?

278
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,920
In the end, it seems we can't

279
00:14:05,936 --> 00:14:07,446
connect with Tokyo folks.

280
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,440
Thank you.

281
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,490
What's with Soga-san?

282
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,640
Soga-san?

283
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,000
Thank you for yesterday.

284
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,371
The Japanese Meat and Potato Stew

285
00:14:20,396 --> 00:14:21,996
was tender and truly delicious.

286
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,120
What the heck now?

287
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,370
You're grinning!

288
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,720
Did you exchange contact information?

289
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,800
Well, sort of.

290
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,592
He said he might come eat

291
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:32,666
alone from now on.

292
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:33,740
That's nice.

293
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,930
He was just trying to be polite.

294
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,996
People from Tokyo are perfectly fine

295
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,973
with telling lies.

296
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,010
Can I come again?

297
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,900
Is he really going to come?

298
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,200
What a troublesome uncle.

299
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,150
Well, it's good though.

300
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:54,640
Huh?

301
00:14:55,446 --> 00:14:57,017
I haven't seen your lively face

302
00:14:57,057 --> 00:14:58,182
like that in years.

303
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,838
I thought you might have

304
00:15:00,854 --> 00:15:02,002
given up on romance.

305
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,260
It's a bit different from romance.

306
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,120
Huh?

307
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,541
It's more like silently

308
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:10,057
cheering for him in my heart.

309
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,780
That's okay with you?

310
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,730
I don't want to go through tough times

311
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,360
or get hurt anymore.

312
00:15:20,104 --> 00:15:21,980
I have to break myself like this.

313
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,210
Should we end our relationship?

314
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,320
Let's break up.

315
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,951
Once you become an adult,

316
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:32,677
people don't change that easily.

317
00:15:34,175 --> 00:15:36,216
Being happy with the current distance

318
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:37,513
is enough.

319
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,444
If that's the decision you've made,

320
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,695
then I think it's fine.

321
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,230
Auntie, thank you.

322
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,790
Also,

323
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,905
Saying that you can't change

324
00:15:55,929 --> 00:15:57,056
because you're an adult

325
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,480
might be a bit off, you know?

326
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,903
I'm heading back.

327
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,340
I'm already content,

328
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,300
truly content.

329
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,410
Oh!

330
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,530
THis is delicious!

331
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,450
Soga-kun, try this one.

332
00:16:41,145 --> 00:16:41,715
Ah...

333
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,740
I'm sorry.

334
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,660
I can't eat asparagus.

335
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,640
- Good job.
- Huh?

336
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,490
What's wrong? Can't handle it?

337
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,932
When I was a child,

338
00:16:50,956 --> 00:16:52,385
I didn't like the smell.

339
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:54,923
This one doesn't have

340
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:56,378
that strong scent, though.

341
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,810
I understand that logically.

342
00:16:59,224 --> 00:17:00,520
But I'm not good at it

343
00:17:00,545 --> 00:17:02,015
and I've reached this age.

344
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,810
Isn't it

345
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,930
still not too late?

346
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,140
Huh?

347
00:17:09,282 --> 00:17:12,828
People, no matter their age, can change.

348
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,960
One's age doesn't matter.

349
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:18,540
You're just finding an excuse.

350
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,850
Alright. Please wait a moment.

351
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,230
Here are the asparagus and pork skewers.

352
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,250
Sorry to keep you waiting.

353
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,253
If you can't eat it,

354
00:17:49,285 --> 00:17:50,690
you're allowed to leave it.

355
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,520
Bon appétit.

356
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:24,520
Sweet...

357
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,400
and crispy...

358
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,520
It's not bad at all.

359
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,970
- Have some water.
- Don't rush.

360
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,550
It was delicious.

361
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,050
Thank you.

362
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:22,854
Huh?

363
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,080
Um, excuse me.

364
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,330
Soga-san.

365
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,534
I seem to have misplaced

366
00:19:32,542 --> 00:19:33,971
my smartphone somewhere.

367
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,390
Oh, this?

368
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,110
Ah, that's it!

369
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,290
What a relief, thank you!

370
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,750
You're completely drenched.

371
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,720
I'll get you a towel.

372
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,510
No, it's fine...

373
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,240
Here.

374
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,422
I'm sorry and thank you.

375
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,420
Thank you for today.

376
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,280
Thanks to Sakae-san,

377
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,800
I was able to change.

378
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,160
That's overly dramatic.

379
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,080
No.

380
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,607
In my own way,

381
00:20:21,632 --> 00:20:23,037
it was a significant step.

382
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,280
Is that so?

383
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,280
A long time ago,

384
00:20:31,762 --> 00:20:33,732
someone told me,

385
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,130
'Your true feelings aren't visible.'

386
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,700
I despise it.

387
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,560
Being called well-mannered

388
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,550
is just creating a wall

389
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,776
to keep people away

390
00:20:48,801 --> 00:20:50,135
from my stubborn self.

391
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,440
Living this way all my life

392
00:20:53,465 --> 00:20:54,740
until I let go of a chance

393
00:20:54,748 --> 00:20:55,857
to change myself.

394
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,520
But today,

395
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,630
when Sakae-san said that,

396
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,470
I felt like I could listen sincerely.

397
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,780
It makes me really happy.

398
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,540
I don't quite understand it myself,

399
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,924
but it's the first time

400
00:21:20,949 --> 00:21:21,955
I've felt this way.

401
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,200
Coming to an unfamiliar place alone,

402
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,590
I used to feel anxious about it.

403
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:31,991
But meeting someone like Sakae-san

404
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,210
made me feel grateful.

405
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,310
Thank you very much.

406
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,570
Oh, I'm sorry.

407
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,581
It's troublesome to hear

408
00:21:43,613 --> 00:21:44,427
a one-sided story...

409
00:21:44,452 --> 00:21:45,432
If that's the case...

410
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,480
You can still change, right?

411
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,130
Huh?

412
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,300
Oh no!

413
00:21:59,200 --> 00:21:59,920
I

414
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,040
want Soga-san to like us more.

415
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,550
Both Osaka

416
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,160
and me.

417
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,350
If I say more...

418
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,560
Soga-san.

419
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,180
I like you.

420
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,850
What now?

421
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,790
Sorry to keep you waiting.

422
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,990
Please eat a little slower.

423
00:23:10,435 --> 00:23:12,245
(Next episode)
I don't care anymore!

424
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,710
I didn't expect that much.

425
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:14,680
Let's give it a try.

426
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,060
(The concern for the other party)
About my matters,

427
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:16,930
(Which is completely opposite)
please don't mind it.

428
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,090
You should

429
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,400
show more of yourself.

430
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,190
Something like takoyaki or something.

431
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
Why not grab the chance?
