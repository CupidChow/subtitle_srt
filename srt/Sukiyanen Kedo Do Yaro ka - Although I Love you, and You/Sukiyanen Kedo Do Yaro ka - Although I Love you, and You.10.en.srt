1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,040
Let's...

2
00:00:04,781 --> 00:00:05,820
break up.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,230
I...

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,740
don't want to break up.

5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,570
Every day,

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,297
my feelings for you

7
00:00:23,313 --> 00:00:24,820
grow stronger and stronger.

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,830
Right now, I love you the most.

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,090
I feel the same.

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,830
- Then...
- Because I love you so much,

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,370
I want you to be happy.

12
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,641
If you quit your job now,

13
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:37,868
you'll definitely regret it.

14
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,134
You understand that,

15
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:41,331
don't you, Soga-san?

16
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,590
I'll be in Osaka,

17
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,950
and you'll be in Tokyo.

18
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,790
We both have people who need us.

19
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,990
Please don't cry.

20
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,330
The time we spent together

21
00:01:06,377 --> 00:01:08,290
was like a long sauna.

22
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,840
I don't understand.

23
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,640
It's a special time,

24
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,680
but it can't last forever.

25
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,840
But you're crying too!

26
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,710
I'm not crying,

27
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,120
it's sweat.

28
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:49,700
I understand.

29
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,830
Thanks for everything.

30
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,820
I should be the one thanking you.

31
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,480
I'll go ahead.

32
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,150
Take care

33
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,950
of yourself.

34
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,020
Yeah.

35
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,710
Mm.

36
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,920
You too, Sakae-kun.

37
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,250
Huh?

38
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,590
Soga-san and I.

39
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,580
We broke up.

40
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,990
Do your best at the Tokyo HQ too.

41
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,930
- Yeah.
- Thank you so much.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,630
- Thank you for looking after me.
- Yeah, thanks for your hard work.

43
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,260
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

44
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,970
And then...

45
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,201
The relationship between Soga-san and me

46
00:03:12,623 --> 00:03:13,880
has ended.

47
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,420
"Although I Love You, And You?"

48
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,810
Isn't that too much sugar?

49
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,160
"Final episode"
Huh?

50
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,410
"Although I Love You, And You?"

51
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,550
Huh? Oh, uh!

52
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,220
Are you okay?

53
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,520
You've been like this for a while now.

54
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,230
Sorry.

55
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,910
No, I get it, it can't be helped.

56
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,728
But try to force yourself

57
00:04:19,753 --> 00:04:20,953
to bounce back.

58
00:04:23,486 --> 00:04:24,962
Speaking of which, your birthday is

59
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:26,298
coming up soon, isn't it?

60
00:04:27,048 --> 00:04:28,564
Why don't we all get together

61
00:04:28,572 --> 00:04:29,790
and throw a big party?

62
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,140
Thank you.

63
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,299
Hisashi-kun, did you

64
00:04:38,323 --> 00:04:39,752
break up with Sakae-san?

65
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,870
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,302
You came to celebrate

67
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:45,918
my return to Tokyo,

68
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,622
and now I have to tell you this.

69
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,960
I see.

70
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:52,980
Mm.

71
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,780
I spent

72
00:04:55,398 --> 00:04:58,438
a lot of time with Sakae-kun in Osaka.

73
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,780
Ah.

74
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,810
Sakae-kun's birthday is coming up soon.

75
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,206
But in the end,

76
00:05:11,222 --> 00:05:12,628
I couldn't celebrate it here.

77
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,360
Why not send him a gift or something?

78
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,760
Huh?

79
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,720
Even if the relationship has ended,

80
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,290
it's a way to express gratitude.

81
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,800
- I see.
- Wouldn't that be nice?

82
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,950
Why not send a video message too?

83
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,100
- Oh, sounds good.
- Yeah.

84
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,790
A video message?

85
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,860
Thank you.

86
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,030
(Sakae's birthday party in progress)
Happy birthday.

87
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,130
(Sakae's birthday party in progress)
Been a while since we've seen this.

88
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,290
- Wow! It's a boat!
- Yay!

89
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,070
- Amazing!
- Cheers!

90
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:39,970
Cheers!

91
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,290
- Oh, let's do it.
- Excuse me.

92
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,290
- A package.
- Oh, thanks.

93
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,370
What are your resolutions for this year?

94
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,810
- Tell us.
- Well?

95
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,220
There's none.

96
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,410
- What?
- Hey, hey, hey.

97
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,510
What are you saying?

98
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,210
Soga-kun sent you something.

99
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,820
- Huh?
- Sakae-san,

100
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,370
- let's open it.
- Oh.

101
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,650
- Hmm?
- What is it?

102
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,590
- Wow!
- Whoa!

103
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,050
Is that an Kiriko glass? So cool.

104
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,450
Kaname-san, this development is...

105
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,520
Yeah.

106
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,980
There might be a chance for them.

107
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,600
Hey.

108
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,110
- There seems to be a QR code as well.
- Right.

109
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,520
Sakae-kun, scan it.

110
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,340
- Yes.
- Yeah.

111
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,080
Huh?

112
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,320
- Ah, a video message.
- That's true.

113
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,740
Come on, everyone, let's watch it.

114
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,640
Wait, let Sakae-san open it first.

115
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,000
- Come on.
- Huh?

116
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,330
- Yeah.
- Alright.

117
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:38,519
(Happy birthday, Sakae)

118
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,930
Sakae-kun, happy birthday.

119
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,010
Oh!

120
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,340
How are you?

121
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,930
I'm doing fine.

122
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,763
The other day

123
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:50,740
I went to eat Monjayaki at Tsukishima.

124
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,240
It was delicious.

125
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,360
Okonomiyaki is even more delicious.

126
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,580
Oh, well said.

127
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,560
That's right.

128
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,920
Tokyo is a fascinating place.

129
00:07:00,488 --> 00:07:01,910
There are rickshaws in Asakusa.

130
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,370
Art Museums in Ueno.

131
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,485
The buildings in Roppongi district.

132
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,090
The scramble intersection in Shibuya.

133
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,550
The Tokyo Tower...

134
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,950
What's this? He only talks about Tokyo.

135
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,360
Yeah.

136
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,260
Is he saying that Osaka is boring?

137
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,280
- Right?
- That's right.

138
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,458
The Skytree that

139
00:07:15,466 --> 00:07:17,224
I didn't see for a while, it's so tall.

140
00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:18,060
Is he saying that

141
00:07:18,085 --> 00:07:18,997
Tsutenkaku is the tower low?

142
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,164
- Yeah, that's right.
- Geez, come on, be quiet.

143
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,860
This is a question.

144
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,250
How many meters tall is the Skytree?

145
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,860
- Huh?
- It turned into a quiz.

146
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,480
- I don't know.
- Who would know?

147
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,470
The answer is...

148
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,980
634 meters.

149
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,880
Six, three, four. Remember it.

150
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,200
What nonsense.

151
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,190
- Yeah.
- What is wrong with Tokyo people?

152
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:45,790
What was that?

153
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,110
I bought an Kiriko glass for you.

154
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,000
Please use it.

155
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,160
What Kiriko glass?

156
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,950
Dotonbori is more interesting.

157
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,510
- Right?
- Wait, please calm down.

158
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,710
- Take it out.
- Throw it away.

159
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,300
- The glass isn't at fault.
- Dammit.

160
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,560
I already told you.

161
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,060
Huh? Is that what you want?

162
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,060
Even if we live in different places

163
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,060
but I hope that both of us are fine.

164
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,730
- Hey.
- Better throw it away.

165
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,130
Really?

166
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,089
(Tamae's recommended menu)

167
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,710
Oh.

168
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:24,930
Why are you here?

169
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,370
Why, just celebrating your birthday.

170
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,070
This.

171
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,450
Here.

172
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,430
- Thanks.
- Happy birthday.

173
00:08:38,425 --> 00:08:39,749
By the way, Soga-san has

174
00:08:39,773 --> 00:08:41,296
returned to Tokyo, right?

175
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,671
Are you guys doing long-distance now?

176
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,300
No.

177
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,840
I see,

178
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:54,960
so you broke up.

179
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,220
Well, you must be bored

180
00:09:00,236 --> 00:09:01,313
on your days off.

181
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,520
Why not go to lots of places with me?

182
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,157
I don't have any

183
00:09:07,165 --> 00:09:08,462
ulterior motives, though.

184
00:09:09,068 --> 00:09:12,168
As a friend,

185
00:09:13,481 --> 00:09:15,134
I just want to support you.

186
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:16,940
Well?

187
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,490
Alright.

188
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,320
Oh, I finally cut it.

189
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,610
Well, well,

190
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,210
it should come out alright, right?

191
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,350
Oh, you can tell?

192
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,350
I'm trying to do it here and here.

193
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,060
Well, it's amazing, right?

194
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,850
All right, it's complete.

195
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,523
Let's take these bento boxes

196
00:09:42,547 --> 00:09:43,679
and go on a picnic tomorrow.

197
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,710
More importantly, this sausage

198
00:09:47,718 --> 00:09:48,758
is delicious.

199
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,980
Yeah, it's good.

200
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,660
Man, squash is really fun!

201
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,070
You...

202
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,470
What are you up to?

203
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,760
What do you mean?

204
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,501
You're doing everything that Soga-san

205
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:12,556
and I used to do together!

206
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,760
It's definitely on purpose.

207
00:10:15,228 --> 00:10:16,495
Well, yeah, it is on purpose.

208
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,890
But why are you so mad?

209
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,970
Huh? Well, it's nothing.

210
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:22,970
Ah.

211
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,350
"Trying so hard to forget" right?

212
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,050
"Don't remind me" right?

213
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,174
It's pointless, you're not going

214
00:10:32,183 --> 00:10:33,565
to be able to do it anyway.

215
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,963
- Why are you...
- If you put in as

216
00:10:35,987 --> 00:10:37,448
much effort trying to forget,

217
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,682
why don't you try to figure out

218
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:41,354
a way to get back with Soga-san?

219
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,520
Huh?

220
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,600
If you really love him,

221
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,080
you won't give up no matter what,

222
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,990
that's you, isn't it?

223
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,570
You're trying to act

224
00:10:52,594 --> 00:10:53,686
all mature and rational,

225
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,780
but in the end,

226
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,320
I'm pulling back like an idiot.

227
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,500
Are you...

228
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,200
trying to push me forward?

229
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:07,520
What?

230
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,482
Did you think I was

231
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,810
seriously hitting on you?

232
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:12,590
No.

233
00:11:13,994 --> 00:11:15,200
I told you from the beginning

234
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:16,990
that I didn't have any ulterior motives.

235
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:18,400
Besides,

236
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,040
I'm dating someone right now.

237
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,440
Huh?

238
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:23,880
You're kidding!

239
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:25,680
Who is it?

240
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,670
Looks like the conversation is over.

241
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,020
Huh?

242
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,800
Senpai Café!

243
00:11:37,265 --> 00:11:38,510
Ryuji of Aoharu?

244
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,720
It's Ryuji-senpai.

245
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,360
No way.

246
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,480
Ryu-chan,

247
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,850
I said what I wanted to say to him.

248
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,280
I see.

249
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,320
You did well, you tried hard.

250
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,080
Huh?

251
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,080
So, yeah.

252
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,930
Well, we're busy doing our own thing.

253
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,180
Don't expect any more meddling from me.

254
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:04,510
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

255
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,080
I can't stand it anymore.

256
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:28,750
Can't stand it anymore.

257
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,740
Kaname.

258
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,010
It's hot.

259
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,300
Hey, Kaname.

260
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,692
I just can't seem to

261
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:37,997
forget about Soga-san.

262
00:12:39,152 --> 00:12:39,792
Huh?

263
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,122
Even though I was the one

264
00:12:42,138 --> 00:12:43,598
who suggested breaking up,

265
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,710
I just can't seem to forget.

266
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,490
I'm lame, right?

267
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,965
Thinking about wanting to

268
00:12:52,974 --> 00:12:53,911
start over now.

269
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,520
It's lame

270
00:12:59,644 --> 00:13:01,121
to be concerned about whether

271
00:13:01,146 --> 00:13:02,083
it's lame or not.

272
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,400
Huh?

273
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,650
Stop overthinking it

274
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,370
and just be honest with yourself.

275
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,300
Yeah.

276
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,440
Thanks for

277
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,980
always being there for me, Kaname.

278
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,344
Just treat me today.

279
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,310
What do you want?

280
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,360
Coffee.

281
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,360
- That video message you sent
- I'm back.

282
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,320
- didn't go down well, you know.
- I'm back.

283
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,930
- Sorry.
- Huh?

284
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,070
Ah, this is

285
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,780
- the souvenir.
- Oh, thank you.

286
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,490
- I bought it for everyone.
- Soga-san?

287
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,580
What are you doing here?

288
00:13:35,745 --> 00:13:37,053
Seems like there was

289
00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:38,436
a meeting here yesterday.

290
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,592
He stopped by before

291
00:13:39,608 --> 00:13:41,026
heading back to Tokyo.

292
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:41,740
Got these

293
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,400
as souvenirs.

294
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,290
Kaminari okoshi (thunder cakes)!

295
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,590
I had no idea.

296
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,760
Huh?

297
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,560
You should have told me beforehand!

298
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,900
This is for eating with tea...

299
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,530
I'm sorry.

300
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,680
Are rou rot roing ro ree rakae-san?

301
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,160
Yes?

302
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,440
Are rou rot roing ro ree rakae-san?

303
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:06,590
Huh?

304
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,290
Are you not going to see Sakae-san?

305
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,118
You knew I would ask,

306
00:14:15,143 --> 00:14:16,423
so you came here when

307
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:17,782
I wasn't around, right?

308
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,740
Well...

309
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,900
It's already over between us.

310
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,587
You don't want to see him

311
00:14:26,595 --> 00:14:28,267
because you don't think it's over.

312
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,120
I understand.

313
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,400
How about this then?

314
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,730
Soga-san,

315
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:46,480
please go near 'Tamae' once, anyway.

316
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,945
If you see that shop

317
00:14:48,953 --> 00:14:50,725
and still feel like going back,

318
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,110
quietly turn back.

319
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,790
But

320
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,491
if at that moment,

321
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,382
you feel the urge to meet someone...

322
00:14:58,155 --> 00:14:59,882
then please acknowledge

323
00:14:59,907 --> 00:15:01,347
your own feelings.

324
00:15:06,727 --> 00:15:08,687
Please come again anytime.

325
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,810
People, regardless of their age,

326
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,820
can change.

327
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,408
If you need me 100 times in a row,

328
00:15:13,424 --> 00:15:14,464
I don't mind.

329
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,360
It won't drift away.

330
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,670
My heart...

331
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,960
is with Soga-san.

332
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,540
I am in love with you!

333
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,807
Kissing is for those

334
00:15:22,816 --> 00:15:23,901
who love each other.

335
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,550
It feels like a dream.

336
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:26,940
I'm happy.

337
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,280
Because I love you so much,

338
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,550
I want you to be happy.

339
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,700
Sakae-kun.

340
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,410
Sakae-kun!

341
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,090
Sakae-kun!

342
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,440
Sakae-kun!

343
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,600
Hello, Sakae-kun!

344
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,320
Soga-san.

345
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,590
Where are you right now?

346
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,190
Ah, yeah.

347
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,880
I'm in front of 'Tamae' right now.

348
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,120
Huh?

349
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:58,780
Huh?

350
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,645
I came all the way to

351
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,106
Tokyo to meet Soga-san!

352
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,080
Huh?

353
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,650
Huh? What? This means...

354
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,380
We...

355
00:16:08,764 --> 00:16:10,304
- We've missed each other?
- We've missed each other?

356
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,160
What should we do?

357
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,790
Should I come there

358
00:16:14,301 --> 00:16:16,250
or should you come here?

359
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,160
Ah, just a moment.

360
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,160
Hamamatsu.

361
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,950
Hamamatsu?

362
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,435
Seems like Hamamatsu is roughly

363
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,241
halfway between Tokyo and Osaka.

364
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,690
So, should we meet there for now?

365
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,600
Hamamatsu.

366
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,392
(Osaka Tokyo)

367
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:43,896
(Hamamatsu)

368
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,780
Long time no see.

369
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,000
Yeah.

370
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,130
Umm...

371
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,320
Here's your

372
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,200
Grilled Eel Rice Bowl or una-don.

373
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,330
- Ah, thank you.
- Here.

374
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,720
- Thank you.
- No problem.

375
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,820
Haa...

376
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,160
Ya know, 'cause gramps is all lazy,

377
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,160
it's always me who's runnin' 'round.

378
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,950
It really gets on my nerves, ya know?

379
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,110
Huh?

380
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,541
Ya know, 'cause gramps is all lazy,

381
00:17:20,557 --> 00:17:22,646
it's always me who's runnin' 'round.

382
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,300
It really gets on my nerves, ya know?

383
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,480
- Yeah, I see.
- She slowed down.

384
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,870
Enjoy, y'all.

385
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:28,780
Thank you.

386
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,120
- What was that?
- I don't know,

387
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,940
some kind of Enshuu dialect.

388
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,940
- Enshuu dialect?
- Wait.

389
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,480
Ya know, 'cause gramps is all lazy,

390
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,580
it's always me who's runnin' 'round.

391
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,420
It really gets on my nerves, ya know?

392
00:17:47,802 --> 00:17:50,466
(Ya know, 'cause gramps is all lazy,
it's always me who's runnin' 'round. It really gets on my nerves, ya know?)

393
00:17:50,513 --> 00:17:51,999
(Since grampa is all lazy, it's always me
who's running around. It gets on my nerves)

394
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,116
Since grampa is all lazy,

395
00:17:53,141 --> 00:17:55,075
it's always me who's running around.

396
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,780
It gets on my nerves.

397
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,150
Ah, I see.

398
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,760
Let's eat.

399
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,320
Yeah.

400
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,080
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

401
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,480
Delicious.

402
00:18:28,087 --> 00:18:29,507
The way una-don is grilled

403
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,830
is different in Tokyo and Osaka, right?

404
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:33,900
Huh?

405
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,101
In Kanto style,

406
00:18:35,117 --> 00:18:36,843
they split the eel down the back,

407
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:37,992
while in Kansai style,

408
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:39,296
they split it down the belly.

409
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,867
But apparently in Hamamatsu,

410
00:18:40,892 --> 00:18:42,092
they have both?

411
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,270
Oh, I see.

412
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:44,830
Yeah.

413
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,760
Maybe this place...

414
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,050
Hamamatsu,

415
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,010
was our sanctuary?

416
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,570
Sanctuary?

417
00:18:55,053 --> 00:18:55,701
Yeah.

418
00:18:56,874 --> 00:18:59,304
Not in Tokyo or Osaka.

419
00:18:59,522 --> 00:19:00,592
A neutral ground.

420
00:19:01,364 --> 00:19:02,458
We both only have to

421
00:19:02,483 --> 00:19:03,856
travel half the distance.

422
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,620
That might be true.

423
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:07,800
Oh.

424
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,170
There's Lake Hamana nearby too.

425
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,660
- The Lake Hamana?
- Yeah.

426
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,040
Oh, I'd like to visit it.

427
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:15,960
So,

428
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,560
what do you think?

429
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:19,740
Huh?

430
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:20,890
Well...

431
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,010
How about staying overnight?

432
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,416
(Lake Hamana)

433
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,080
Hey, Sakae-kun.

434
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,550
Yes?

435
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,240
I...

436
00:19:54,315 --> 00:19:56,880
I always miss Sakae-kun.

437
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,800
I felt really lonely being apart.

438
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:06,890
What?

439
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,460
I was lonelier.

440
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,805
That's not true! I'm sure I...

441
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,710
Oh, come on!

442
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,370
Let's just

443
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,370
call it a draw.

444
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,410
So, uh...

445
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,120
Tonight, we'll probably...

446
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,990
do that, you know?

447
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,430
Huh?

448
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,851
We've had eel and,

449
00:20:28,891 --> 00:20:30,281
we're both in high spirits.

450
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,660
What are you suddenly saying?

451
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,600
So, I

452
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,880
wanted to make things clear before that.

453
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,080
I know it sounds weird

454
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,730
coming from me now...

455
00:20:50,662 --> 00:20:51,552
But I want to give

456
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,650
long-distance dating with you a try.

457
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:57,690
For me...

458
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,480
It has to be Sakae-kun.

459
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:04,780
Sakae-kun.

460
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,210
I like you.

461
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,340
What now?

462
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,980
Your Kansai dialect is so clumsy.

463
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:26,480
Yes.

464
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,710
It has to be Soga-san.

465
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,050
I'll be in your care...

466
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,440
for a long time.

467
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:01,920
Alright then,

468
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,260
let's get pumped up and find an inn.

469
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,100
Can we find one?

470
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,230
Well, let's start by believing it is.

471
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,650
What's with the sudden optimism?

472
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,100
Sorry to keep you waiting.

473
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,420
It's truly delicious.

474
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,248
- Delicious.
- Delicious, right?
