1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,520
Work stuff?

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:03,410
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,260
How could you not feel hurt?

4
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,890
Seeing an ex being treated badly.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,880
I understand you

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,460
better than Soga-san does.

7
00:00:37,936 --> 00:00:38,690
No,

8
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,538
for a moment, I felt

9
00:00:41,554 --> 00:00:42,608
my heart fluttering.

10
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,390
Well,

11
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,900
I'll try a little harder in my own way.

12
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,100
I won't back down.

13
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,975
I'll make Sakae's heart

14
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,970
move.

15
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,940
"Although I Love You, And You?"

16
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,420
"Episode 7: I want to
believe, but... what now?"

17
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,424
Alright, with this,

18
00:01:47,433 --> 00:01:48,620
it's sent to the other party.

19
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,630
- Thank you very much.
- No problem.

20
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,549
Sorry, it was due to

21
00:02:03,565 --> 00:02:04,756
my lack of confirmation.

22
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,310
Mistakes happen to everyone.

23
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:09,780
But...

24
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,260
that is why we need to help each other.

25
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,356
You should try to understand to be more
understanding to the people around us...

26
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:25,430
Yes.

27
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,386
(I'm really sorry for yesterday.

28
00:02:29,395 --> 00:02:30,582
Could you please

29
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:32,027
reschedule the appointment?)

30
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,380
Complaining about it

31
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,420
won't help.

32
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:40,660
Yeah.

33
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,010
I apologise for all

34
00:02:46,035 --> 00:02:47,604
the rude things I said and did!

35
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,960
Ah. Huh? Umm...

36
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,820
Well, umm...

37
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:54,985
I heard a lot about

38
00:02:55,017 --> 00:02:56,438
many circumstances from him.

39
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,680
Huh? "circumstances?"

40
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,912
Back in high school, there was a

41
00:03:00,921 --> 00:03:02,467
transfer student from Osaka

42
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,490
who started dating my class idol.

43
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,630
Huh?

44
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,761
Since then,

45
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:10,886
he has felt a sense of hostility

46
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,376
towards people from Osaka.

47
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,310
- That's ridiculous!
- Well,

48
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,680
I'm glad to know the reason.

49
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:20,210
From today, let's work hard as a team.

50
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:21,400
Yes.

51
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,590
- I'll really be in your care.
- Hmm?

52
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,840
"I'll really be in your care?"

53
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,070
I also need to get more used to Osaka.

54
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,700
What's with that fake Kansai dialect?

55
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,880
Bang! Bang!

56
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:46,980
Huh?

57
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,437
Hey! You're supposed to go 'Whoa!'

58
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:50,851
and fall down there!

59
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,770
- Look. What is he doing?
- Umm... It's nothing, Kanda-san.

60
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,240
- Twice.
- Please calm down.

61
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,210
Ouch! That hurts!

62
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,186
Ah! Wait, Kojimachi-kun!

63
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,891
This is a company, so...

64
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,920
I'm really sorry, Chief. Let's go!

65
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,650
This guy really ticks me off.

66
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:15,790
- Chief!
- Huh?

67
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,570
- Chief, it's Tonaki!
- Tonaki?

68
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:21,830
Sakae-kun.

69
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:23,980
Soga-san.

70
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,640
I'm really sorry about yesterday.

71
00:04:31,725 --> 00:04:33,490
I said we'd decide on the schedule,

72
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:34,679
but I wanted to talk

73
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,718
as soon as possible.

74
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,070
Has the shop just closed?

75
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,921
Just a little bit of time...

76
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,060
Long time no see.

77
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,630
Mizuki-san.

78
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,993
No. I told him we're closed,

79
00:04:57,017 --> 00:04:58,951
but he persisted in staying.

80
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,460
And why are you here, Soga-san?

81
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,960
I need to talk to Sakae-kun.

82
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,210
Talk?

83
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,150
Alright, let me join too.

84
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,270
Huh? No way.

85
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,270
- It's fine.
- How is it fine?

86
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,170
Oh well.

87
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,150
I didn't do it...

88
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,090
Kojimachi-kun?

89
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,570
Soga-san!

90
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,092
I was drinking with

91
00:05:33,108 --> 00:05:34,803
the Chief and Kanda-san,

92
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,787
just the three of us!

93
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,210
Oh, where did those two go?

94
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:50,200
Oh no, I drank too much.

95
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,480
Has the Chief returned home?

96
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,300
It seem they're busy, let's go home.

97
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,720
- Yeah.
- Let's get going.

98
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,980
- Soga-san!
- Huh?

99
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,630
Osaka is such a nice place, isn't it?

100
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,840
Yeah.

101
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,370
- You must feel lonely.
- Huh?

102
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,731
Going back to Tokyo

103
00:06:14,747 --> 00:06:16,184
in just one more year.

104
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,500
- Right? Kanda-san mentioned it.
- Idiot!

105
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,830
Seriously, you are an idiot!

106
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,210
- Oww!
- Huh?

107
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,630
- Chief, just where were you sitting?
- Over there.

108
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,450
- What?
- By the way, you're a lightweight.

109
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,580
Is that true?

110
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,087
Your going back to Tokyo in a year?

111
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,800
Yeah.

112
00:06:51,324 --> 00:06:52,524
I had no idea.

113
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,414
I'm sorry.

114
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,656
But I've been meaning

115
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,656
to tell you one day.

116
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,780
- That's why, today, I...
- There have been

117
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,100
plenty of opportunities to talk.

118
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,780
- No...
- To you, Soga-san,

119
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,500
what exactly am I?

120
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,650
Huh?

121
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,950
Soga-san, aren't you a bit too cruel?

122
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,570
Just stop.

123
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:23,841
Don't try to involve him

124
00:07:23,866 --> 00:07:25,296
with half-hearted feelings.

125
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,300
No, it's not like that...

126
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,210
Sakae has me.

127
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,110
There's no room for you here.

128
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:42,135
Alright, the shop is now closed!

129
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,690
I'll help with the cleaning.

130
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,660
This is Soga.

131
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,550
I guess you're already asleep.

132
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:54,850
This is Soga.

133
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,700
Good morning. It's nice weather, right?

134
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,700
So, you still haven't called back?

135
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,390
Even if I talk now,

136
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,179
I don't know what I'll say.

137
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,120
I get that.

138
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,440
It's just that...

139
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,869
I did think about whether Soga-san

140
00:08:15,784 --> 00:08:17,080
can stay here forever,

141
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,727
but to be confronted with it

142
00:08:20,752 --> 00:08:21,986
like this...

143
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,607
Regardless, you have to talk it out

144
00:08:25,623 --> 00:08:27,482
properly at some point, don't you?

145
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,480
I know that.

146
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,325
But

147
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:35,145
it's not easy to just flip a switch on

148
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,607
your feelings like that.

149
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,380
Alright. Well then,

150
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,202
It's our day off after all,

151
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:48,266
let's go out.

152
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,130
Is that okay?

153
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,270
Stop being so hesitant.

154
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,824
Cheering you up at a time like this,

155
00:08:54,832 --> 00:08:56,558
that's what friends are for, right?

156
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,360
Hey! Isn't this 'Senpai Café Aoharu?'

157
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,654
Sorry. I never expected this to be

158
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,896
Mizuki's part-time job.

159
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,945
I'm so happy! Did you come all the way

160
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,493
here just to see me?

161
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,440
No way! Why would I...

162
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,840
What, you're here again?

163
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,000
Ryuji, you're here too?

164
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,980
It's Ryuji-senpai, okay?

165
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:23,730
Hey.

166
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,650
What's with that disgusting drink?

167
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,855
It's the 'Senpai Got Carried Away

168
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:32,796
at the Drink Bar, Terrible Juice'.

169
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,540
Don't make that a menu item!

170
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,060
Drink.

171
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,660
Wow, this tastes terrible, senpai!

172
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,440
Hey, Kaname! Come back to this world!

173
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,990
- Man, that's youth for you!
- How?

174
00:09:53,502 --> 00:09:54,799
- You're right.
- This is my first time

175
00:09:54,824 --> 00:09:55,863
hearing about it.

176
00:09:55,893 --> 00:09:58,360
- It's even quicker on this end.
- Yeah.

177
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,280
Mizuki, let's make it a race to there.

178
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,030
Huh, but I'm going to win, okay?

179
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,930
That's my line.

180
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,686
With you as my opponent,

181
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:10,546
I'm going to run with Kaname on my back.

182
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:14,630
Well then, I'll carry Sakae and run.

183
00:10:15,002 --> 00:10:19,012
- Huh? Why do you have to do that?
- Stop complaining, come here.

184
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,430
That way, alright?

185
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,070
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

186
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,100
Come on, Kaname.

187
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,800
- Excuse me.
- Always doing as you please.

188
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,530
Alright. Go!

189
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,240
- Dammit!
- Hey, what are you doing?

190
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,330
Move a bit. Hurry up.

191
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:34,640
Oh well.

192
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,090
Stay still. Alright.

193
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,380
- Soga-san.
- Huh?

194
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,340
Wait.

195
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:53,271
I'm sorry for calling so many times.

196
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,670
Here without an appointment again?

197
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,470
- The four of us are having...
- Hey, be quiet!

198
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,414
I've been feeling truly sorry for not

199
00:11:04,438 --> 00:11:05,750
bringing up the topic of

200
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,060
returning to Tokyo for so long.

201
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,883
But it's not that I thought

202
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:12,281
it wasn't necessary to say.

203
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,430
I just couldn't say it.

204
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,031
Your presence kept growing

205
00:11:19,056 --> 00:11:20,173
bigger and bigger.

206
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,040
I've been cowardly.

207
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,078
But I want to put an end to

208
00:11:27,094 --> 00:11:28,281
that version of myself.

209
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:31,489
I want to express all

210
00:11:31,514 --> 00:11:33,083
my current feelings in words...

211
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,650
Can I have a little bit of time to talk?

212
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,090
I...

213
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,330
Sakae, let's go.

214
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,680
Like I said,

215
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,680
Sakae has me.

216
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,860
There's no room for you here.

217
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:04,880
Sakae-kun!

218
00:12:06,421 --> 00:12:07,775
The length of time spent together

219
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,868
might not be in my favor.

220
00:12:08,893 --> 00:12:10,780
But as the poet Goethe once said...

221
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,840
- Time is the...
- Shut up!

222
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,470
I don’t' care about any philosophers.

223
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,704
I also don't care about the size

224
00:12:19,713 --> 00:12:20,775
of his presence with you.

225
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,321
But how prepared are you

226
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:27,283
to accept this guy?

227
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,540
- Sakae-kun!
- Sakae!

228
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,570
Don't look back.

229
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,310
Do you remember when we first met?

230
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,140
I pulled your hand and ran away.

231
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,830
It all started from here.

232
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,330
Let's start again from here.

233
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,020
Sakae-kun.

234
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,240
To you, Soga-san,

235
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,700
what exactly am I?

236
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,670
- Here you are.
- Oh.

237
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,030
Here.

238
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:48,210
Oh, thank you, but that's okay.

239
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,020
I have this.

240
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,500
Huh? Is that alright?

241
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:55,990
It's fine.

242
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,960
I'm really sorry about the other day.

243
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,402
I never thought Kojimachi-kun would
blurt that out.

244
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,160
Oh, it's alright.

245
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,390
It's not Kanda-san's fault.

246
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,480
So, what happened with Sakae-san?

247
00:14:27,482 --> 00:14:29,716
I've been calling nonstop,

248
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,590
but he won't pick up.

249
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,610
Wow. What are you going to do?

250
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,390
Is it just fate?

251
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,460
Huh?

252
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,859
Ever since the other day,

253
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,094
it feels like nothing

254
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,297
has been going right.

255
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,168
I wonder if it's fate that

256
00:14:52,193 --> 00:14:53,236
it doesn't work out.

257
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,561
I'm not

258
00:14:58,617 --> 00:15:01,475
going to meddle in Soga-san's decision,

259
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:04,920
but...

260
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,510
isn't attributing

261
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,550
everything to fate a bit of a cop-out?

262
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,090
Huh?

263
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,710
If you say that,

264
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,334
I feel bad for Sakae-san

265
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:18,851
as things never go his way,

266
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,248
even if it's from

267
00:15:20,264 --> 00:15:21,997
an outsider's perspective.

268
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,250
But still...

269
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,690
because he likes you, he didn't give up.

270
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,684
Even if he doesn't answer your calls,

271
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:33,708
so what?

272
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,880
It's too early to give up.

273
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,770
Oh, sorry.

274
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,215
I shouldn't said that when

275
00:15:43,223 --> 00:15:44,676
you're already feeling pressured.

276
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,440
No.

277
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,460
You're right.

278
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,747
You know,

279
00:16:05,771 --> 00:16:06,974
Mizukichi's workplace

280
00:16:06,982 --> 00:16:08,224
sounds interesting.

281
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,620
- If you'd like, please visit.
- Oh, should I go then?

282
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,170
Oh, it has run out.

283
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:14,110
Sakae-kun, can I get another bottle?

284
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,980
- Hey, Sakae-kun.
- Yes?

285
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,960
- Can I get another beer? What's wrong?
- Oh, certainly.

286
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,120
- That's right.
- Good.

287
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,650
- Oh, hello!
- Welcome!

288
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,550
Man, it's terrible.

289
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,320
- Huh? Did something happen?
- Huh?

290
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,930
Our colleague, Soga-kun, collapsed.

291
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,170
- Huh?
- Oh, well,

292
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,574
not exactly collapsed,

293
00:16:33,598 --> 00:16:34,824
but he's got a fever and

294
00:16:34,848 --> 00:16:35,986
is bedridden at home.

295
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:36,940
Oh.

296
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,030
Takagi-san, did you work too hard?

297
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,030
- Right?
- Huh? Is that so?

298
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,670
May I have a bottle of beer, please?

299
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,800
- Is that so?
- Good at ordering for others.

300
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,660
Excuse me.

301
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,530
- Oh, Sakae-kun.
- Sakae-kun.

302
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:51,250
- What about me...
- Shall I do it for you?

303
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:54,490
- Yes, thank you.
- Two servings, right?

304
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,980
(I heard you had a fever)

305
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,380
(I want to see you)

306
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:02,140
- This is a new style.
- Dammit, don't eat it.

307
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,360
- Is that so?
- My work is...

308
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,720
Hey, hey, hey.

309
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,960
- Everyone.
- And mine...

310
00:17:11,577 --> 00:17:12,190
Hmm?

311
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,790
We're closing for the day.

312
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,360
- Huh?
- No way.

313
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,120
I'm sorry, Mizuki.

314
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,667
Why?

315
00:17:25,995 --> 00:17:28,917
(SND RESIDENCE)

316
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,430
Ah, sorry and thank you very much.

317
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,620
Why are you acting so distant?

318
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,980
But I'm glad.

319
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,810
- Finally, we can talk...
- Let's not do it now.

320
00:17:48,977 --> 00:17:50,148
If I make porridge,

321
00:17:50,173 --> 00:17:51,414
will you be able to eat it?

322
00:17:57,954 --> 00:17:59,375
I've always been thinking

323
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,563
about holding off.

324
00:18:01,985 --> 00:18:03,938
There will surely be another chance.

325
00:18:05,532 --> 00:18:07,345
And it reaches this point,

326
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:09,946
I'm regretting it.

327
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,368
I want to talk to you properly now.

328
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:19,140
Yeah.

329
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,970
Ever since you said you liked me,

330
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,220
I've been thinking.

331
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,530
What do I really think about you?

332
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,179
No matter how much I thought about it,

333
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,390
I couldn't find an answer.

334
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,159
Then I'm

335
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,698
fine with just being friends

336
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,380
with you.

337
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,220
I'm sorry

338
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,630
for causing you so much pain, Soga-san.

339
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,230
- It's because I was stubborn...
- I...

340
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,280
don't want to be friends.

341
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,100
I actually already knew.

342
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,860
The answer was so clear that

343
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,870
all that was left was my own courage.

344
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,700
I'm really sorry for being late.

345
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:46,680
I also...

346
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,310
like you, Sakae.

347
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,140
If you're okay with it,

348
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,330
would you go out with me?

349
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,050
It's too late

350
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,750
to joke about it now.

351
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,400
I won't say that.

352
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,650
Can I believe that?

353
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,791
I don't understand

354
00:20:21,815 --> 00:20:23,322
Tokyo-style sensibilities.

355
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,760
That's why I said I won't say that.

356
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:35,970
It feels like a dream.

357
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,600
I'm happy.

358
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,010
Oww, hot!

359
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,090
- I'll make some porridge.
- Yeah.

360
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:49,970
Thank you.

361
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,087
You should take off your glasses.

362
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,330
Oh.

363
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,800
Delicious.

364
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,440
You're really cute.

365
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:17,680
Hmm?

366
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,120
No, not now.

367
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,760
First, make sure you're feeling well.

368
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,330
Finally...

369
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,066
A new day with Soga-san

370
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,199
and me has begun.

371
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,460
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

372
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,515
However, at this moment,

373
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:01,953
we still didn't know...

374
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,610
Yeah, delicious.

375
00:22:06,104 --> 00:22:07,752
The turbulence that will unfold.

376
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:09,950
And...

377
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,190
- Right?
- Yeah.

378
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:11,940
Huh?

379
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:13,700
Let's

380
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,490
break up.

381
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,878
- Where is this from?
- If I didn't tell you

382
00:22:21,894 --> 00:22:22,726
I loved you that day.

383
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,390
- From kaname.
- I see, from Kaname-san.

384
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,991
I wonder if I wouldn't

385
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:27,105
have felt that way.

386
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:29,130
- Yeah, it's delicious.
- This is tasty.

387
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:44,990
Sorry for the wait.

388
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:12,290
(Next episode)
Let's try holding hands, shall we?

389
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,290
Huh?

390
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,080
- Sakae-kun, I'll start filming now.
- Huh?

391
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,790
It was so empty that it felt strange.

392
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,120
(Nonstop conflicts)
Be reasonable.

393
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,750
Yeah.

394
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,600
Caring for each other is good.

395
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,540
Plus, there's a feeling like that too.

396
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,540
I don't understand.
