1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:02,590
I like you, Sakae-kun.

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:05,600
If you're okay with it,

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:07,350
would you go out with me?

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,050
Good morning.

5
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,400
Good morning.

6
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,990
It's been a week since

7
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,559
our new relationship began.

8
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,780
Huh, what is it?

9
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,920
My boyfriend is drinking coffee.

10
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,030
What's that?

11
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,970
Finally, you two are really together.

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,790
You're already living together?

13
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,540
No, not quite.

14
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,030
Well, but...

15
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:05,310
I do spend a lot of time at his place.

16
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:06,810
Huh?

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,770
So, how far have you gone?

18
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:09,480
Huh?

19
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,670
Well, um...

20
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,480
We've kissed, you see.

21
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,640
Ah, no,

22
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,750
- I meant with work.
- Huh?

23
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,470
Oh,

24
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,280
- Ah, I'm sorry!
- No, I didn't make it clear.

25
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,590
I'm sorry!

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,400
Oh dear.

27
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,070
But, I see, that's how it is.

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,089
It's sort of like

29
00:01:33,114 --> 00:01:35,314
an extension of our friendship...

30
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,807
But I hope that we can slowly close

31
00:01:37,823 --> 00:01:40,057
the distance between us from now on.

32
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,780
Do you have that kind of time?

33
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,595
Eventually you'll return to Tokyo,

34
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:45,619
won't you?

35
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,830
Well, yes, that's true.

36
00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:51,389
If you don't gather your courage

37
00:01:51,397 --> 00:01:52,404
and move forward,

38
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:53,887
you'll just remain friends forever.

39
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,410
Well, today's pretty warm.

40
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,320
- Yeah, nice weather we're having.
- Yeah.

41
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,160
Should we try holding hands too?

42
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,130
Huh?

43
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:14,076
My hands are really cold right now.

44
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,350
It's probably best not to.

45
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,420
Ah, I see. Yeah.

46
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,420
How cool.

47
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,950
- Sakae-kun, I'm taking a picture.
- Huh?

48
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,500
I'm the only one smiling.

49
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,640
"Although I Love You, And You?"

50
00:03:30,824 --> 00:03:31,400
Here!

51
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,110
"Episode 8" Alright!

52
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,760
"The second chapter of love. What now?"
Oh, nice catch!

53
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,460
Alright, which direction next?

54
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,510
- Alright!
- Oh!

55
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:41,890
Amazing.

56
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,020
Excellent, nice catch!

57
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,010
Hey.

58
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,611
I'm fine with being

59
00:03:46,642 --> 00:03:48,087
a little further away.

60
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,300
Is that so?

61
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,790
I mean, I said I wanted to play catch.

62
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,454
Being this close, you probably

63
00:03:54,471 --> 00:03:55,431
feel unsatisfied.

64
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,580
Alright,

65
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,820
here it comes!

66
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,920
Alright!

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,640
- Oh!
- Nice play!

68
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,710
Right? Alright...

69
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,730
- Then...
- I'll throw correctly. Concentrate. Ah!

70
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,070
- Ah!
- No!

71
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,970
Hey, what are you guys trying to do?

72
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,410
- I'm sorry!
- I'm sorry!

73
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,990
I'm really sorry, it's my fault.

74
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,570
It's okay.

75
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,062
More importantly, this sausage

76
00:04:28,078 --> 00:04:29,015
is delicious.

77
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,750
What's wrong?

78
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,070
Ah.

79
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,010
Yeah, it's good.

80
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,290
Can I ask you something?

81
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:51,610
Yes?

82
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,510
Your ex-wife...

83
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Saeko-san,

84
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,170
what is she like?

85
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,680
Ah...

86
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,610
I'm not sure. It was a long time ago.

87
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,810
Please answer properly.

88
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,625
I want to know about your past

89
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:11,125
to connect it to our future.

90
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,570
Saeko-san is

91
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,620
a straightforward and optimistic person.

92
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,490
Even now, I still respect her.

93
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,059
Oh, no. It's not about

94
00:05:26,091 --> 00:05:27,722
romance or anything...

95
00:05:27,747 --> 00:05:28,787
I understand.

96
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,411
So, what kind of communication

97
00:05:31,436 --> 00:05:32,467
did you have?

98
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,669
We decided to talk rationally

99
00:05:34,694 --> 00:05:36,494
without getting emotional.

100
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,820
We valued brainstorming time.

101
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,120
"Brainstorming?"

102
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,591
I knew it. It's important to

103
00:05:45,615 --> 00:05:47,056
have breakfast together.

104
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,120
Sakae-san.

105
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,557
Do you think that 'Brain'

106
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,683
stands for Breakfast?

107
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,950
Huh, it's not?

108
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,310
Not at all! It's "brainstorming."

109
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,090
It's when you freely throw out ideas

110
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,621
and discuss solutions without

111
00:06:01,637 --> 00:06:03,590
denying the other person's thoughts.

112
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,910
Oh, I see.

113
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,525
Well then,

114
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:11,116
I'll try it with Soga-san too.

115
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,048
People have their strengths

116
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,525
and weaknesses.

117
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,275
I want Soga-san

118
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,033
to speak his mind freely.

119
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:22,621
I'll adapt to his style this time.

120
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,120
No, still...

121
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,865
I'll become the 'Saeko-san'

122
00:06:27,873 --> 00:06:28,866
of Osaka for him.

123
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:29,510
Huh?

124
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,180
Sakae's "Sa"

125
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,580
is "Sa" from Saeko! Yeah!

126
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,263
Sometimes, being alone in

127
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,799
the sauna is nice.

128
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,090
- Soga-san.
- Ah, hello.

129
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,400
Haa...

130
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,520
- I feel refreshed.
- No, that was too early!

131
00:06:58,770 --> 00:06:59,863
You must go back and forth

132
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:00,995
to the cold bath to say that!

133
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,980
Oh, is that so?

134
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,690
Sorry, I don't usually come here.

135
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,100
Sorry.

136
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,570
Why the sudden visit?

137
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,073
When you took photos together,

138
00:07:13,081 --> 00:07:14,666
you were the only one smiling?

139
00:07:14,713 --> 00:07:15,563
Yes.

140
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,590
Well, he does have quite a shy side.

141
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,790
Oh, no, there are many other things.

142
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,420
Can I just interpret them as that?

143
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,130
At the very least,

144
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,211
I can guarantee that

145
00:07:28,236 --> 00:07:29,916
Sakae really likes you.

146
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,420
Ah, that's a relief.

147
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,646
Are you not going to directly

148
00:07:37,662 --> 00:07:39,732
confront him with that kind of question?

149
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,210
You're right.

150
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,910
- Ah, I'm sorry.
- Oh, I'm not blaming you or anything.

151
00:07:46,097 --> 00:07:46,880
No.

152
00:07:48,355 --> 00:07:49,738
I used to have

153
00:07:49,746 --> 00:07:51,886
brainstorming sessions with my ex-wife.

154
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:52,860
"Brainstorming?"

155
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,910
Is that about breakfast?

156
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,520
No, it's about discussions.

157
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,018
Both parties sharing

158
00:08:02,042 --> 00:08:03,604
their opinions rationally.

159
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:05,940
I think Saeko-san is right too.

160
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,160
Hisashi-kun.

161
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,790
Hmm?

162
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:16,130
I don't understand what you're thinking.

163
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,140
Huh?

164
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,850
I allowed the other party to speak,

165
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,761
and kept my true feelings

166
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,918
hidden deep inside.

167
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,919
That's why I feel like I shouldn't

168
00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:31,466
repeat the same mistake.

169
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,715
I should confront things

170
00:08:32,724 --> 00:08:33,752
with my true feelings

171
00:08:33,777 --> 00:08:35,135
without fearing getting emotional.

172
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,700
But I keep hesitating.

173
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,520
Well, for better or worse,

174
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,220
Sakae is someone who acts on emotions.

175
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,003
You don't have to go out of your way

176
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:50,139
to brainstorm.

177
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,643
Just speak your mind

178
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:52,815
when you feel like it.

179
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,720
If you're with him,

180
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,260
Soga-san, won't you change too?

181
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,180
- Hey, Soga-san.
- Hmm?

182
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,950
Let's try brainstorming, shall we?

183
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,300
Huh?

184
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,579
No, it's not good to

185
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:13,291
clash emotionally, is it?

186
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,730
But I...

187
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,970
I've thought about

188
00:09:16,986 --> 00:09:18,666
many ways to handle this.

189
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,340
In order to not clash with each other,

190
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,410
when we want to speak,

191
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,200
let's use a signal.

192
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,170
Oh Am I doing something wrong?

193
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,960
- No, right.
- Ah.

194
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,860
- Let's give it a try.
- Alright.

195
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,045
Like, we should replenish

196
00:09:43,069 --> 00:09:44,780
toilet paper when it runs out.

197
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,436
And buy household items

198
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,141
from the cheapest place.

199
00:09:53,053 --> 00:09:54,286
How about a rule where

200
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:55,793
if one person cooks, the other person

201
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:57,418
washes the dishes?

202
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,231
Sounds good! If someone breaks a rule,

203
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:01,762
they have to pay a fine of 100 yen.

204
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,190
But that might create a tense atmosphere

205
00:10:08,114 --> 00:10:10,090
if someone points out a rule violation,

206
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,590
the person being pointed out smiles

207
00:10:11,622 --> 00:10:12,840
and says 'Thank you' while

208
00:10:12,849 --> 00:10:13,879
paying the fine?

209
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,106
And the person pointing it out

210
00:10:16,131 --> 00:10:17,637
also smiles gently.

211
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,930
That's it, Soga-san!

212
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,304
Alright, let's establish

213
00:10:22,328 --> 00:10:23,446
the rules in detail.

214
00:10:23,585 --> 00:10:24,155
Sure.

215
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,160
Yeah.

216
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,080
When sleeping, take off your glasses.

217
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,710
Don't let the sink get too wet.

218
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,570
Sakae-kun.

219
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,553
Worn clothes must be placed

220
00:10:35,592 --> 00:10:36,926
in the washing machine.

221
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,110
That's the rule.

222
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,640
Thank you.

223
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,130
Yeah.

224
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,679
Today's brainstorming involves how to

225
00:10:48,704 --> 00:10:51,609
eat the vegetables from Kaname.

226
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,030
Should we stir-fry or simmer?

227
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,650
Pickles?

228
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,130
Oh, pickles!

229
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,120
Oh.

230
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,030
Done and done.

231
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,290
Then we chill this in the refrigerator.

232
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,972
Since it's a plant, we need to

233
00:11:20,997 --> 00:11:22,128
talk to it frequently.

234
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,590
Are we defining pickles as plants?

235
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,210
Don't we?

236
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,120
Oh!

237
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,210
Looking good!

238
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,480
Oh, is that the rumored pickles?

239
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:41,580
Huh?

240
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:42,890
Why do you know?

241
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,190
I heard from Soga-kun,

242
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,680
can I have a look?

243
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,100
Yeah, let me see.

244
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,700
Wow, it's handmade, right?

245
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,930
What's inside?

246
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,690
- Vinegar.
- Oh.

247
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:54,880
Katsuo fish soup.

248
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,050
- Huh? Katsuo fish soup?
- Sakae-kun!

249
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,770
You're out of toilet paper!

250
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,180
Oh, really?

251
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,170
- Yes.
- I'll bring some out now.

252
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:02,660
Yeah.

253
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,000
Is that so?

254
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,820
Ah, oh.

255
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,310
Yes, hello.

256
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,920
Thank you for the long support.

257
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:11,950
Yes, yes.

258
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,190
Huh?

259
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,630
As I was saying...

260
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,208
Yeah.

261
00:12:18,368 --> 00:12:19,240
Oh, of course.

262
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,920
Insane.

263
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,370
- Huh?
- Yeah.

264
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,340
Huh? What?

265
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,520
Oh, Sakae-kun.

266
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,440
Another beer, please.

267
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,940
Another beer for me too.

268
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,840
Hey! What are you eating?

269
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,470
Why are you yelling?

270
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,660
- No, they're almost gone.
- Are these free?

271
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,940
No, it's not!

272
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,650
The pickles have been eaten.

273
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,040
Huh?

274
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,840
Why were the pickles eaten?

275
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,962
Honestly, I just looked away

276
00:12:54,987 --> 00:12:56,026
for a moment.

277
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,070
But why were our pickles in your shop?

278
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,116
It should have been

279
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:00,946
in the fridge.

280
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,499
Well, you're the one who said

281
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:03,846
we need to talk to them.

282
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,530
So it's my fault?

283
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,020
No, I didn't say that.

284
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,690
But...

285
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:09,870
No.

286
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,300
I worded that wrong.

287
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,410
Thank you.

288
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,707
Did you talk to Takagi-san

289
00:13:20,731 --> 00:13:22,006
about the pickles?

290
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:22,490
Huh?

291
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:23,640
Was it a no-go?

292
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,720
I didn't tell him about us.

293
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,470
No, it's fine, not at all.

294
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,200
Got it.

295
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,460
Thank you.

296
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,180
This is not a fight.

297
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,610
- We're not getting emotional at all.
- Yes.

298
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,290
- Yeah, let's be rational.
- Yeah.

299
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,840
- We just need to improve each other.
- Yes.

300
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,825
It's good that we can things to improve.

301
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:44,380
Yeah.

302
00:13:48,064 --> 00:13:49,008
Sakae-san.

303
00:13:50,944 --> 00:13:52,144
Sakae-san.

304
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,448
Huh?

305
00:14:01,872 --> 00:14:02,960
Sa...

306
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,680
Saeko-san?

307
00:14:06,384 --> 00:14:08,688
Welcome to the House of Reason.

308
00:14:09,072 --> 00:14:10,160
The House of Reason?

309
00:14:11,088 --> 00:14:12,704
Wait, this is my house.

310
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,440
Then, please enjoy the tea of reason.

311
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,280
Oh, it's good.

312
00:14:26,624 --> 00:14:29,344
That's not reason, it's emotion.

313
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:30,208
What?

314
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,704
What are you trying to say?

315
00:14:32,704 --> 00:14:33,696
Anger.

316
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:36,384
That's emotion too.

317
00:14:36,384 --> 00:14:37,376
I don't understand!

318
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:38,864
I don't understand anymore!

319
00:14:38,864 --> 00:14:42,432
Not understanding! That's emotion too!

320
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,904
Your eyes are glowing!

321
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,360
Sakae! Sakae!

322
00:14:51,488 --> 00:14:52,480
Sakae!

323
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,216
Whoa!

324
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:55,210
Kaname!

325
00:14:56,064 --> 00:14:56,704
Huh?

326
00:14:57,668 --> 00:14:59,082
You were groaning like crazy

327
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,218
when I came to deliver.

328
00:15:00,528 --> 00:15:01,312
I...

329
00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:03,552
I can't be Saeko-san.

330
00:15:04,432 --> 00:15:05,024
Huh?

331
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,544
I want to say

332
00:15:07,264 --> 00:15:08,592
what I mean directly.

333
00:15:10,046 --> 00:15:11,534
I don't understand

334
00:15:12,728 --> 00:15:13,704
all this formal stuff.

335
00:15:14,224 --> 00:15:15,360
Is that okay?

336
00:15:16,304 --> 00:15:16,752
Huh?

337
00:15:17,491 --> 00:15:18,750
Soga-san said that too.

338
00:15:18,976 --> 00:15:20,194
He wants to confront you

339
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,436
and his own feelings.

340
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,240
Soga-san said that?

341
00:15:27,536 --> 00:15:28,400
Sakae-kun.

342
00:15:28,864 --> 00:15:29,840
Soga-san.

343
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:33,744
I'm sorry.

344
00:15:36,272 --> 00:15:37,553
I thought I had to conform

345
00:15:37,578 --> 00:15:38,920
to Soga-san's style.

346
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:40,336
And went overboard.

347
00:15:40,336 --> 00:15:42,064
No, it's my fault.

348
00:15:43,328 --> 00:15:44,096
In the end,

349
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,046
I kept what I really thought inside,

350
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:47,195
just like I used to.

351
00:15:48,016 --> 00:15:49,304
I didn't want to

352
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:51,062
treat Sakae-kun like this.

353
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,592
I wanted to...

354
00:15:53,043 --> 00:15:53,904
with Sakae-kun...

355
00:15:54,464 --> 00:15:56,448
I wanted to be more...

356
00:15:56,448 --> 00:15:57,216
Soga-san.

357
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,576
Catch ball,

358
00:16:03,575 --> 00:16:04,439
how about it?

359
00:16:07,936 --> 00:16:09,648
Say anything!

360
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,504
All the things you've kept inside!

361
00:16:12,176 --> 00:16:14,144
Any dissatisfaction or complaints,

362
00:16:14,832 --> 00:16:15,680
anything!

363
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,752
You didn't hold my hand!

364
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:25,040
Huh?

365
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:27,024
When?

366
00:16:27,424 --> 00:16:29,024
When we went out together!

367
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,278
It's not appropriate to be

368
00:16:31,303 --> 00:16:32,622
all lovey-dovey in public!

369
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,040
But

370
00:16:35,872 --> 00:16:37,440
if Soga-san wants it,

371
00:16:38,128 --> 00:16:39,456
shall we hold hands now?

372
00:16:42,288 --> 00:16:42,960
And.

373
00:16:43,488 --> 00:16:44,873
A picture of the two of us!

374
00:16:44,898 --> 00:16:45,921
I'm the only one smiling,

375
00:16:45,968 --> 00:16:47,552
but Sakae-kun's face looks weird!

376
00:16:47,552 --> 00:16:48,663
Because Soga-san suddenly

377
00:16:48,688 --> 00:16:49,592
took the picture!

378
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,475
How am I supposed to know

379
00:16:51,483 --> 00:16:52,792
how to pose all of a sudden?

380
00:16:52,816 --> 00:16:54,768
Photos capture that moment, don't they!

381
00:16:54,768 --> 00:16:56,608
You could've said 'cheese' or something!

382
00:16:56,608 --> 00:16:57,680
Maybe, but!

383
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,808
If you didn't like it,

384
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,573
you should've asked for a retake!

385
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,312
Because

386
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:07,120
I thought you didn't want it!

387
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,000
Huh?

388
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,128
How could I not like it?

389
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,544
I really like it.

390
00:17:12,544 --> 00:17:14,272
How am I supposed to know that?

391
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,208
When I beat around the bush,

392
00:17:16,232 --> 00:17:17,277
it gets awkward.

393
00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:18,912
I always do that!

394
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,656
Jut ask me anything.

395
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:22,256
So,

396
00:17:22,936 --> 00:17:24,376
bring it all on!

397
00:17:24,672 --> 00:17:26,132
If I bring everything up,

398
00:17:26,156 --> 00:17:27,816
it might turn into a huge fight.

399
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,720
You might end up hating me, Sakae-kun.

400
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,912
That's what scares me!

401
00:17:33,104 --> 00:17:34,910
I won't end up hating you!

402
00:17:35,872 --> 00:17:37,166
So let's just fight a lot

403
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,880
and make up a lot, okay?

404
00:17:45,424 --> 00:17:46,448
I'll catch any kind of ball

405
00:17:46,912 --> 00:17:48,368
you throw at me!

406
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,576
Bring it on with all your might!

407
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,440
I love you!

408
00:18:20,752 --> 00:18:21,312
See,

409
00:18:22,336 --> 00:18:23,310
I caught it!

410
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:33,248
Thank you

411
00:18:34,688 --> 00:18:35,984
for throwing with all your might.

412
00:18:36,672 --> 00:18:37,600
No, it's me,

413
00:18:38,608 --> 00:18:40,640
thank you for catching it.

414
00:18:47,152 --> 00:18:47,728
Hey...

415
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:48,864
Hmm?

416
00:18:53,136 --> 00:18:54,864
Should we use the money we've saved

417
00:18:55,296 --> 00:18:56,496
in the piggy bank?

418
00:18:56,992 --> 00:18:57,888
Huh?

419
00:18:58,624 --> 00:19:00,464
Well, we were saving it for a trip.

420
00:19:00,464 --> 00:19:02,240
I want to spend it now.

421
00:19:03,312 --> 00:19:04,064
It's...

422
00:19:05,152 --> 00:19:06,336
a commemoration

423
00:19:07,376 --> 00:19:10,176
of becoming real lovers with you?

424
00:19:10,912 --> 00:19:12,432
We can buy a nice bottle of wine

425
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,224
with it.

426
00:19:21,104 --> 00:19:22,016
For some reason,

427
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,494
in my mind, Saeko-san is becoming more

428
00:19:24,502 --> 00:19:26,455
and more like a spirit of reason.

429
00:19:28,032 --> 00:19:29,664
She's not like that at all.

430
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:35,200
She's really emotionally caring.

431
00:19:36,768 --> 00:19:37,822
She kept worrying

432
00:19:37,847 --> 00:19:39,221
about me until the end.

433
00:19:39,824 --> 00:19:41,096
'If it's this person,

434
00:19:41,112 --> 00:19:43,135
I can rely on them with peace of mind.'

435
00:19:44,304 --> 00:19:45,969
I sincerely wish for

436
00:19:45,994 --> 00:19:47,432
someone like that to

437
00:19:48,402 --> 00:19:50,120
appear in front of you.

438
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,002
When Sakae-kun taught me

439
00:19:52,027 --> 00:19:53,707
how to make takoyaki,

440
00:19:53,968 --> 00:19:55,471
I don't know why this sentence

441
00:19:55,496 --> 00:19:56,786
popped into my head.

442
00:19:56,832 --> 00:19:58,307
If you need me 100 times in a row,

443
00:19:58,338 --> 00:19:59,378
I don't mind.

444
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,275
In return,

445
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,244
when I need you 100 times in a row,

446
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,640
I won't worry about it.

447
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,663
I want to have that kind

448
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:06,202
of relationship with Soga-san.

449
00:20:06,624 --> 00:20:07,824
Thinking about it now...

450
00:20:08,064 --> 00:20:10,784
maybe I knew deep down that

451
00:20:11,808 --> 00:20:13,392
this person was the one back then.

452
00:20:16,112 --> 00:20:17,299
In order to avoid making you

453
00:20:17,323 --> 00:20:18,728
feel like making a mistake,

454
00:20:18,752 --> 00:20:19,584
I'll do my best.

455
00:20:22,992 --> 00:20:23,840
I will also

456
00:20:24,512 --> 00:20:25,280
do my best too.

457
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,176
Alright then.

458
00:20:30,944 --> 00:20:33,056
Shall we get some sleep?

459
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,224
Hey.

460
00:20:37,632 --> 00:20:38,955
Can I be honest with you

461
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,057
one last time today?

462
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,512
Sure. What is it?

463
00:20:47,232 --> 00:20:48,240
I want to sleep

464
00:20:49,328 --> 00:20:51,008
together with you in the same futon.

465
00:20:56,904 --> 00:20:57,816
Is that like...

466
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,138
sleeping side by side?

467
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:02,192
Right?

468
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,720
No, that's not it.

469
00:21:07,264 --> 00:21:07,904
Properly...

470
00:21:10,016 --> 00:21:10,656
Is that okay?

471
00:21:14,672 --> 00:21:15,280
Yeah.

472
00:22:04,576 --> 00:22:06,880
(Saeko-san)

473
00:22:11,648 --> 00:22:12,144
Yes?

474
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:13,312
Hello.

475
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,648
It's been a while, how have you been?

476
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,888
Ah, yeah.

477
00:22:18,736 --> 00:22:20,497
Actually, there's something I want to

478
00:22:20,521 --> 00:22:21,927
talk you about in person.

479
00:22:22,336 --> 00:22:23,435
Can I come to Osaka to meet

480
00:22:23,459 --> 00:22:24,521
you next time?

481
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,112
Huh?

482
00:22:44,048 --> 00:22:45,024
Sorry for making you wait.

483
00:22:52,544 --> 00:22:53,344
Delicious.

484
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:12,160
(Next episode)
A long distance relationship?

485
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,656
Why not try simulating it?

486
00:23:14,656 --> 00:23:15,984
(A long-distance relationship simulation)
What did you bring?

487
00:23:15,984 --> 00:23:18,096
(A long-distance relationship simulation)
I want you to eat what I cook.

488
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:19,824
Geez!

489
00:23:19,824 --> 00:23:21,088
(What is actually hindering)
I will resign from the company.

490
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,608
(What is actually hindering)
A relationship like that cannot go on.

491
00:23:22,608 --> 00:23:24,600
We'd better just end it.
