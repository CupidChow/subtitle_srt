1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,160
This.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,540
I am in love with you!

3
00:00:03,989 --> 00:00:05,301
I don't know what to say,

4
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:07,066
I can't process this. I'm sorry.

5
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:07,910
Could you

6
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:09,820
think about it for a little?

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,780
I got it.

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,740
(Saeko)

9
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,270
Saeko...

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:34,370
Who is it?

11
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:37,750
Sorry, we are still preparing.

12
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:44,230
Yo.

13
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,530
Mizuki.

14
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:30,430
"Although I Love You, And You?"

15
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,580
"Episode 5
He's returned. What now?"

16
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,240
Long time no see.

17
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,420
How have you been?

18
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,390
Why are you...

19
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:39,650
Just to say hi.

20
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:41,590
I just suddenly remembered you,

21
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,450
that's all.

22
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,070
Why the heck are you back?

23
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,676
You suddenly dumped everything

24
00:01:45,701 --> 00:01:47,067
and left without a word.

25
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,410
Hey...

26
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,330
Hmm?

27
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,280
Should we end our relationship?

28
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,620
Huh? Why?

29
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,711
Even if you ask for a reason.

30
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,700
Hey, at least tell me the reason.

31
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,840
There's no reason.

32
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,117
It's just that it's been

33
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:08,539
longer than expected.

34
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,390
So I think it's time.

35
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,889
Is that all there is

36
00:02:14,914 --> 00:02:16,248
to our relationship?

37
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,350
Understood.

38
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,690
You and I...

39
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,450
Let's break up.

40
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:34,967
Oh no. I'm that kind of guy, aren't I?

41
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,680
Exactly.

42
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,170
You have changed a bit.

43
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,090
I'm glad to see you.

44
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,480
Stop making that face.

45
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,959
You used to compliment me

46
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,209
on my cute smile, remember?

47
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:03,480
Well then,

48
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,320
take a good look from different angles.

49
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,080
About yesterday,

50
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,950
I'm really sorry.

51
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,520
No, I should be the one apologizing.

52
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,215
You've heard about

53
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,520
Sakae-san feels, right?

54
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:28,900
Yes.

55
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,340
So, how do you feel about him?

56
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,490
I thought about it all night,

57
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,208
but I couldn't come up with anything.

58
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,867
But I just I don't think of him

59
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:48,992
as just a friend.

60
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:50,950
Huh?

61
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,070
Ah, but,

62
00:03:53,593 --> 00:03:55,083
it's something like being a close friend

63
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,600
or a different kind of feeling,

64
00:03:59,377 --> 00:04:00,687
I don't really understand it myself.

65
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:05,930
And

66
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,346
there's one more reason why

67
00:04:08,355 --> 00:04:09,495
I can't give a clear answer.

68
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,560
Sakae.

69
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,530
- Sakae, wait.
- Stop chasing me!

70
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,110
Sakae-kun?

71
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,150
It's the touching reunion with your ex!

72
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,080
- Shut up, let go!
- Aww...

73
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,180
what kind of relationship?

74
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,997
There's a lot to talk about.

75
00:04:27,013 --> 00:04:27,866
How about some tea?

76
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:28,820
- Shut up!
- Oh!

77
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,520
I'm opening the shop now.

78
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,820
Don't show up in front of me anymore.

79
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,670
Hello, Kaname-san?

80
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,600
Hey, Kazuyo-chan. I heard from Sakae.

81
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,650
Thanks to you,

82
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,553
he was able to confess

83
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:45,756
to Soga-san, right?

84
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,180
I'm currently with Soga-san.

85
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,370
Oh, I see.

86
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,047
Somehow, Sakae-san seems to be getting

87
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:53,274
all suspicious when with

88
00:04:53,298 --> 00:04:54,711
someone we don't know!

89
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,720
Huh?

90
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,370
He doesn't have another lover, right?

91
00:05:00,764 --> 00:05:03,714
There shouldn't be anything like that.

92
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,280
It was Mizuki?

93
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,390
So you met him?

94
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:11,940
Ah...

95
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,270
Of all people,

96
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,050
to be seen by those two.

97
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,610
And what are you going to do?

98
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,620
That's what I want to know.

99
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,410
Mizuki suddenly came over,

100
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,570
and then I ran away.

101
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,790
Why did you run away?

102
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,220
Well, I did say not to come again.

103
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,260
He didn't say anything.

104
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,180
I didn't necessarily say 'yes' either.

105
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,850
Yeah, but even so...

106
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,440
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

107
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,190
It's been a while, Kaname.

108
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,030
- You...
- Isn't it? A little bit warm.

109
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:55,960
Huh?

110
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,280
A bit warm?

111
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,180
Hey.

112
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,350
- Wait, wait.
- Hey!

113
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,070
Hey!

114
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,410
Stop it!

115
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,560
Hey! Cut it out!

116
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,130
Kaname, isn't it great?

117
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,470
Hatcha!

118
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,784
The guy I met the other day

119
00:06:12,809 --> 00:06:14,254
was just an ex, Mizuki,

120
00:06:14,311 --> 00:06:15,230
and there's absolutely

121
00:06:15,246 --> 00:06:16,253
no connection now.

122
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,460
Really? I can trust you, right?

123
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,100
Yeah.

124
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,560
I won't ever meet that guy again.

125
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,530
Understood.

126
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,550
I'll let Soga-san know the same.

127
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,780
Thanks.

128
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,740
Well, see you.

129
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:56,860
You're back.

130
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,570
How did you get inside?

131
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:02,840
The spare key,

132
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,710
I haven't returned it.

133
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,770
- Hey, you!
- Hey, hey!

134
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,810
I want you to make that for me.

135
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,586
Ginger ale with freshly

136
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:11,648
squeezed orange juice.

137
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,920
If you drink it, then leave.

138
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:23,410
Alright, praise be to Sakae-sama.

139
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,710
Nostalgic, huh?

140
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,710
We met under strange circumstances,

141
00:07:41,855 --> 00:07:44,270
and I ended up working and living here.

142
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:49,210
Then, you fell for me...

143
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:53,800
I've forgotten

144
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,810
about those old stories.

145
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:57,230
Oh, really?

146
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,730
Alright, Bon appétit.

147
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,380
This is it!

148
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,940
As I said before,

149
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,250
- if you drink that...
- Actually, I

150
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,580
got caught cheating on two guys.

151
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:19,282
I got kicked out of the boyfriend's

152
00:08:19,307 --> 00:08:20,345
place I was crashing at.

153
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,480
Huh?

154
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,470
You're still living that carefree life?

155
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,350
Well, it's not so bad.

156
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,420
But.

157
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,399
So, until I find a job

158
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:30,735
and a place to stay,

159
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,310
can I crash here?

160
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,490
Absolutely not.

161
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,180
You're being cold. Come on, please?

162
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,630
No way.

163
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,630
Figure it out yourself.

164
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,540
I see.

165
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,560
I guess I have no choice.

166
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,140
If I get kicked out of here,

167
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,500
I don't know where I'll end up.

168
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,530
Thanks

169
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:03,297
for the many memories.

170
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,940
Sounds like a death poem.

171
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,380
Really, you

172
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,590
have nowhere else to go?

173
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,010
- Are you fine with me stay here?
- No, I didn't say that.

174
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,820
Alright, I'll work for my stay.

175
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,820
- Now, let's get ready for the opening.
- Hey! It's too early to open the shop!

176
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,230
Come with me for a bit.

177
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,800
Ex-boyfriend?

178
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,068
Yes. There's nothing going on now,

179
00:09:35,084 --> 00:09:36,544
that's what Sakae-san said.

180
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,980
- I see.
- Yeah.

181
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:44,932
Would you have some

182
00:09:44,956 --> 00:09:45,966
time after work today?

183
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,350
Maybe we can have a drink at Tamae?

184
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,790
Huh? But, that's...

185
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,432
You've been thinking about

186
00:09:51,456 --> 00:09:53,182
Sakae-san all for a long time

187
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,740
and there's still no answer, right?"

188
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,643
In that case, maybe changing

189
00:09:57,667 --> 00:09:59,041
the approach a bit.

190
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,854
By talking face to face in a normal way,

191
00:10:00,862 --> 00:10:02,729
your feelings might become clearer.

192
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,200
Maybe you're right.

193
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,680
- I never knew.
- Yeah.

194
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,220
- Well? Delicious, right?
- This is my first time eating it.

195
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,510
- Alright, sorry for the wait.
- Thanks.

196
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,845
This one is certainly tasty,

197
00:10:18,862 --> 00:10:19,876
you must eat it.

198
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,850
Yes, yes.

199
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,000
- Mizuki-kun.
- Yes?

200
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,230
- Could you pass me hot sake?
- Oh, certainly.

201
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,140
- Would you like two cups?
- Just gave one to that person.

202
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,310
This person.

203
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,320
Good evening.

204
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,820
Welcome! Two seats, right?

205
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,730
Please take a seat at the counter.

206
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:31,890
Ah.

207
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,300
Hey, why did you stop?

208
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,728
But I never thought Mizuki

209
00:10:43,753 --> 00:10:45,175
would come back.

210
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,280
I didn't expect to see you again.

211
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,509
You never know what life

212
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:49,658
has in store for you.

213
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,181
He didn't come back.

214
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,255
He's here for a today.

215
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,494
By the way, when I told him

216
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,586
I have no place to stay,

217
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,705
Sakae said I could crash at

218
00:10:56,721 --> 00:10:57,796
the upstairs of this place.

219
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,360
- Oh.
- Sakae-san.

220
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,360
No! Nobody said anything like that.

221
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,050
Oh, right. I tried making these.

222
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,290
(Collecting eight points)
Oh

223
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:06,870
(get one meal free.)
Oh.

224
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,610
Oh, a 'Tamae' stamp card.

225
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,137
When you collect 8 points,

226
00:11:10,146 --> 00:11:13,185
you get one meal.

227
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,020
No, you can't!

228
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,110
He's just making things up.

229
00:11:16,945 --> 00:11:18,465
I didn't hire him,

230
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,140
and I never said he could live here.

231
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,910
He's just saying whatever he wants.

232
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,180
He's always been like this, hasn't he?

233
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,079
Geez, even if you keep denying it,

234
00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:32,149
but in the end,

235
00:11:32,165 --> 00:11:33,626
he still helped Mizuki out.

236
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,000
Now that you mention it,

237
00:11:35,024 --> 00:11:36,935
it was that kind of relationship.

238
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,740
You're so well aware.

239
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,590
Please stop saying that.

240
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,710
- Geez, come on.
- Stop saying what?

241
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,560
What did I say wrong?

242
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,400
Soga-san,

243
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,650
you are eating the bones!

244
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,910
- Soga-san, that's the bone!
- Sogachi, you alright?

245
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,790
Are you okay?

246
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,240
- Are you okay?
- What's wrong with him?

247
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,490
I've always wanted you for so long...

248
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,470
I won't let you go anymore.

249
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,820
Why are you laying it next to mine?

250
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,550
It's fine anywhere, isn't it?

251
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,180
Go lay it somewhere else.

252
00:12:35,205 --> 00:12:35,925
Hey, hey.

253
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,200
You... Take that!

254
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,130
Ouch!

255
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,460
What are you doing?

256
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,020
You're always so cunning.

257
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,060
Pillow throwing game.

258
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,060
How am I cunning?

259
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,390
Enough!

260
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,230
What are you doing?

261
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,034
Didn't you say you weren't going

262
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:57,276
to meet with Mizuki anymore?

263
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,270
That is how it should've gone.

264
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,270
I heard the story from Kazuyo-chan.

265
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:03,710
What are you thinking?

266
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,710
Oh, come on, even Kaname...

267
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,226
When there's no punctuation

268
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,351
at the end of a sentence,

269
00:13:08,376 --> 00:13:10,056
it's a serious tone.

270
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,180
It's all because of you!

271
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,890
I'm done. I'll stay at a net cafe.

272
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,900
Huh?

273
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,280
You don't want the pillow?

274
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,850
Soga-san.

275
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,440
Soga-san.

276
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,010
- Soga-san!
- Ah, whoa!

277
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,950
Oh Kanda-san, thanks for your hard work.

278
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:39,467
Are you concerned about Mizuki-san?

279
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,040
Huh?

280
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,850
No, it's not like that.

281
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,850
It's pretty obvious.

282
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,700
Well, I shouldn't be talking, but...

283
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,000
For now,

284
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,409
it seems like Mizuki-san is unilaterally

285
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:57,300
making advances towards Sakae-san.

286
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,920
But

287
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,552
if you keep postponing

288
00:14:00,577 --> 00:14:02,075
your answer indefinitely,

289
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,190
who knows what might happen.

290
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,050
The other day,

291
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,160
I couldn't tell Kanda-san,

292
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,269
but there's another reason

293
00:14:15,294 --> 00:14:16,917
why I couldn't give an answer.

294
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,000
I

295
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,010
won't be staying in Osaka forever.

296
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,576
A year from now, I'll be

297
00:14:27,592 --> 00:14:28,615
transferring back to the

298
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,616
Tokyo headquarters.

299
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,840
That's...

300
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,640
a difficult issue.

301
00:14:38,435 --> 00:14:39,040
Yes.

302
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,490
But you've talked to Sakae-san

303
00:14:42,498 --> 00:14:43,938
about this, right?

304
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,600
Huh? Why not?

305
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,209
When you were confessed to,

306
00:14:49,234 --> 00:14:50,591
you should've discussed this!

307
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,570
Why...

308
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,115
Were you afraid that Sakae-san would

309
00:14:54,131 --> 00:14:55,630
give up if you told him the truth?

310
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,960
While the decision is yours,

311
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,350
but I think...

312
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,185
it's better to honestly

313
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:03,729
face your feelings,

314
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,740
both towards Sakae-san

315
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,550
and your own true emotions.

316
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:18,730
I...

317
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,200
I am in love with you!

318
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,880
Where should I put these plates?

319
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,960
On the corner over there.

320
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,170
Sure.

321
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,400
Hey.

322
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,640
Hmm?

323
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,640
Can we have an honest

324
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,160
conversation now?

325
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,691
You don't seem to be actively

326
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,520
looking for a job or a place to stay.

327
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,426
What are your intentions

328
00:16:00,442 --> 00:16:01,418
coming back here?

329
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,420
Ah...

330
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,420
Well...

331
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,483
The story about being kicked out

332
00:16:11,508 --> 00:16:13,975
for cheating and all that

333
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,560
was a lie.

334
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,380
Can we

335
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,370
start over?

336
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,910
That's

337
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,080
impossible.

338
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,360
Do you resent me?

339
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,690
I'm sorry for what happened back then.

340
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,540
Can't we put it behind us?

341
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,050
Leaving like that was a shock,

342
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,200
I admit.

343
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,000
I used to think

344
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:05,920
you were my fated partner.

345
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,100
It was embarrassing,

346
00:17:12,744 --> 00:17:13,825
but I was dragging it along

347
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:14,825
until recently.

348
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,690
But,

349
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,380
it's not because I'm holding a grudge.

350
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,840
I met someone who moved my heart

351
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,560
enough to overcome that shock.

352
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,610
Right now, I can only see that person.

353
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:45,184
Is he better than me?

354
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,560
Yes.

355
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,190
Soga-san!

356
00:18:14,768 --> 00:18:16,278
Soga-san! Please wait!

357
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,250
Soga-san!

358
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,900
Soga-san!

359
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,580
Soga-san!

360
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,600
I can't figure out my own feelings.

361
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,940
But when Mizuki's hand

362
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,600
touched your cheek...

363
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,710
I really disliked it.

364
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,220
I was jealous.

365
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,770
If I had been a bit slower,

366
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,990
you would have kissed, right?

367
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,140
Huh?

368
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,200
No way, absolutely not!

369
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,260
You guys did it already.

370
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,110
I said no!

371
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,270
I can tell that Sakae-kun is popular.

372
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,690
And Mizuki-san is handsome

373
00:19:04,706 --> 00:19:05,956
with a wonderful smile.

374
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,580
Honestly,

375
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,710
you two look good together.

376
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,200
I already confessed to you.

377
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,780
Do I look like such a frivolous guy?

378
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,040
Then let me ask this to.

379
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,520
Who is Saeko?

380
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,040
Huh?

381
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,700
I saw the call display

382
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,540
pretty clearly.

383
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,440
No, about that...

384
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,040
She's my

385
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,720
ex-wife.

386
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,420
What?

387
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,430
You're divorced, Soga-san?

388
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,590
I didn't intend to hide it.

389
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,930
No, but...

390
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,620
And if you're still in contact,

391
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,190
your lingering feelings...

392
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,980
No, it's not like that.

393
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,443
She used to work for a

394
00:19:59,467 --> 00:20:01,267
business partner's company,

395
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,560
and she contacted me out of the blue.

396
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,210
Hello.

397
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,880
Hisashi-kun.

398
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,560
Saeko-san.

399
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:13,520
Yeah.

400
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,130
It's been a while.

401
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:17,980
Hisashi-kun.

402
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,431
Do you remember Furukawa-san,

403
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,681
the senior from the Tokyo headquarters?

404
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,770
Oh, Furukawa-san.

405
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,260
We're currently working together,

406
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,892
but I find it a bit difficult

407
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:29,978
to approach.

408
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,962
Yeah. They're quiet and

409
00:20:34,978 --> 00:20:36,134
doesn't smile much.

410
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,000
Ah,

411
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,321
But, you know, they

412
00:20:40,346 --> 00:20:41,766
absolutely loves animals.

413
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,400
Really?

414
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,610
Well, maybe I'll try approaching them

415
00:20:45,634 --> 00:20:46,860
with topics related to that.

416
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,149
They're really kind to people

417
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,173
they're comfortable with,

418
00:20:50,181 --> 00:20:51,118
so give it a try.

419
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,000
Thank you.

420
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,227
I'm glad I took the courage

421
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:56,459
to contact you.

422
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,837
Can I reach out again if...

423
00:20:57,853 --> 00:20:58,860
Yeah.

424
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:00,960
Of course.

425
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,730
Feel free to contact me anytime.

426
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,470
It's been like that,

427
00:21:05,493 --> 00:21:06,735
and then, occasionally.

428
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,900
So why did you

429
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,520
hurriedly hang up the call?

430
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,220
Well, it was just bad timing,

431
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,220
and I felt a bit awkward.

432
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:17,980
Really now?

433
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:19,550
Really!

434
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,000
Never mind.

435
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,250
Huh?

436
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:31,980
No.

437
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,400
But you know,

438
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,370
the conversation we've been having

439
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:36,901
is pretty much like that of lovers.

440
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,550
But...

441
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,550
Soga-san,

442
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,860
the fact that you got jealous.

443
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,330
Does that mean you like me?

444
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,870
It might be possible.

445
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,440
But...

446
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,470
Huh? Why not?

447
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,796
When you were confessed to,

448
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,218
you should've discussed this!

449
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,870
Sakae-kun, I...

450
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,860
Kissing is for those

451
00:22:09,868 --> 00:22:10,985
who love each other.

452
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,200
Sorry for the wait.

453
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,070
Delicious.

454
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,360
(Next episode)

455
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,910
(A character with distinct characteristics)
May I contact you frequently?

456
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,360
(How will the story continue?)
Ryuji-senpai, right?

457
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,760
I have something to discuss clearly.

458
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,910
How mean, Soga-san.

459
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,000
(The destination of these feelings)
What exactly do you intend to do?

460
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,640
You're my special one.

461
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,480
So I wish you happiness.

462
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,480
Currently, I...
