1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,540
Come and cook some takoyaki.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:03,625
If you're okay with it,

3
00:00:03,641 --> 00:00:04,586
shall I give you a lesson?

4
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,190
I haven't repaid that debt yet,

5
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,190
if I owe you more than this...

6
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,929
If you need me 100 times in a row,

7
00:00:09,945 --> 00:00:10,985
I don't mind.

8
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,156
In return,

9
00:00:12,172 --> 00:00:14,117
when I need you 100 times in a row,

10
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,830
I won't worry about it.

11
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,280
I want to have that kind

12
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,020
of relationship with Soga-san.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,870
I have a presentation early today.

14
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,970
I'm starting to feel nervous now.

15
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,270
In times like that,

16
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,280
start with some stretching.

17
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,430
I might have calmed down a bit.

18
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,790
I'm rooting for you,

19
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,770
do your best!

20
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,740
Thanks!

21
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,580
By the way, changing the subject a bit.

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,729
There's a place I want to check out.

23
00:01:04,754 --> 00:01:07,087
How about going together sometime?

24
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:09,970
Huh?

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,800
Well,

26
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,090
I guess there's no one else to invite.

27
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:23,532
(OK)

28
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,020
A first date?

29
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,050
"Although I Love You, And You?"

30
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:19,780
Alright.

31
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,700
It's no good.

32
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:23,990
Oh.

33
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,400
"Episode 3: Different hobbies. What to do?"

34
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,560
Sorry for making you wait.

35
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,620
Sorry. Have you been waiting for long?

36
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,050
Sakae-kun.

37
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,260
Ah, hello.

38
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,190
So this is how he dresses casually.

39
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,180
Sorry for dragging you along.

40
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,500
No worries.

41
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,090
Alright, shall we go?

42
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,580
- Yes. This way.
- Yeah.

43
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,437
I always wanted to come

44
00:02:59,462 --> 00:03:00,742
to this art school.

45
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,150
Oh, Sakae?

46
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,440
No, I'm just not sure what to draw.

47
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,230
Anything is fine.

48
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,850
Whatever comes to your mind,

49
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,220
just draw it.

50
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,290
Nothing's coming to mind,

51
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,890
so that's the problem.

52
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,090
Huh?

53
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,450
Nothing, I'll try to draw something.

54
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,120
Yeah.

55
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,850
That is...

56
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,400
Melonpan.

57
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,910
I see.

58
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,380
It's a melon yet not a melon,

59
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,025
within you,

60
00:03:43,073 --> 00:03:45,233
- representing the truth and lies...
- It's not...

61
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,250
That kind of thing.

62
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,860
I'm embarrassed, please stop.

63
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,310
It's not embarrassing.

64
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,790
I think it is wonderful,

65
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,770
your drawing.

66
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,530
I think art

67
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,413
isn't something lofty,

68
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:04,953
it's something very close to us.

69
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,270
- Oh, I see what you mean.
- Yeah.

70
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,820
- Sorry, excuse me for a moment.
- Hmm?

71
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:20,960
I see,

72
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,490
even this flower is considered art.

73
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,090
No matter the environment,

74
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,740
it stands strong...

75
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,880
You're stepping on it!

76
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,300
Huh? Oh no! I'm sorry!

77
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,670
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,710
We don't get along at all.

79
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,130
Well, but you had a good time, right?

80
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,250
What to do?

81
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:45,670
The two of us are completely different.

82
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,450
I'm the athletic type from Naniwa

83
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,863
and Soga-san is the cultural type

84
00:04:50,894 --> 00:04:51,894
from Tokyo.

85
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,780
Maybe one day, Soga-san will

86
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,175
start making al ajillo

87
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,548
with a takoyaki maker.

88
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,240
I'll definitely get mad!

89
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,511
What does he think

90
00:04:59,543 --> 00:05:00,894
a takoyaki maker is for?

91
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,110
Well, but it won't happen.

92
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,400
Oh?

93
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,240
Takoyaki...

94
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,150
for me and Soga-san,

95
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,340
it holds a special memory.

96
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,900
Having those roots connecting us

97
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,780
is my salvation.

98
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,452
I saw online that you can make

99
00:05:37,477 --> 00:05:38,772
al ajillo with a takoyaki maker.

100
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,150
Now that I think about it,

101
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,800
it's the perfect shape for it, huh?

102
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,640
Um, Soga-san...

103
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,160
Huh?

104
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,090
Making al ajillo

105
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,450
with a takoyaki maker...

106
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,370
That's quite a cool idea, isn't it?

107
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,760
Geez...

108
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,770
I didn't come up with it myself.

109
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,597
Well, I was really tired

110
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,543
of regular takoyaki,

111
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,880
so al ajillo is a good choice.

112
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,140
Yeah.

113
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,440
I'm glad you liked it.

114
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,820
- Oh, I'll get some drinks.
- Sure.

115
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,610
The soul of an Osaka person,

116
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,830
I sold it out.

117
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:41,900
Here.

118
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,740
Ah, thank you.

119
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,550
And this.

120
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,780
Huh?

121
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,810
Post-Impressionist art exhibition.

122
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,960
Would you like to go together?

123
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,170
Yes, let's go!

124
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,141
Wow. I bet there are as many postboxes

125
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,922
as there are countries.

126
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,400
- Huh?
- Huh?

127
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,130
Postboxes?

128
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,480
(Encyclopedia of Modern Art)

129
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,490
It's no good.

130
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,670
Nothing enters my head at all.

131
00:07:21,796 --> 00:07:23,189
(Tamae)

132
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,000
- Don't say strange things.
- That's hilarious.

133
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,380
Sakae-kun!

134
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,520
Sakae-kun!

135
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,477
What's with that

136
00:07:31,502 --> 00:07:33,143
gloomy face since earlier?

137
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,625
Yeah, you're ruining

138
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,399
the sake and snacks for us.

139
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,240
Right?

140
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,580
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

141
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,600
Hey.

142
00:07:43,275 --> 00:07:44,750
Oh, Kaname?

143
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,390
Hey. Just by yourself?

144
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,070
Good evening.

145
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,950
Nice to meet you.

146
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,790
Ah, you're Kazuyo-chan, right?

147
00:07:55,836 --> 00:07:57,590
I've heard about you.

148
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,164
Apparently, you're a beautiful

149
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,406
regular customer now.

150
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,600
Cut it out. Come on, let's drink.

151
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,320
This way.

152
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,250
Huh? Wait. What?

153
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,030
A bottle of barley soju, please!

154
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,010
Let's drink.

155
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,460
- A bottle of soju, please.
- Sure.

156
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,110
- Two more of this snack, please.
- Sure.

157
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,780
Umm, Kaname-san, you

158
00:08:16,248 --> 00:08:17,381
have been friends with Sakae-san

159
00:08:17,406 --> 00:08:18,585
since childhood, right?

160
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,960
Well, yeah.

161
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,770
In that case, I'd like to know.

162
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,640
What kind of person is Sakae-san's type?

163
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,770
Type?

164
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,630
- What do you mean...
- Or rather,

165
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:34,800
is Sakae-san dating anyone right now?

166
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:39,140
- Well, I don't think so.
- Is that so?

167
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,140
- That's a relief.
- Welcome.

168
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,527
Sakae-san is good at

169
00:08:46,552 --> 00:08:48,160
sports in general, right?

170
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:49,650
Well, yes.

171
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,440
I also love physical exercise.

172
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:53,790
I'm taking Muay Thai lessons

173
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,130
three times a week.

174
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,780
Oh, really?

175
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,120
I think it's important to

176
00:09:00,145 --> 00:09:02,285
share common interests, right?

177
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,760
You see...

178
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,560
No, sorry. It's nothing.

179
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,080
Hmm?

180
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,240
I knew it,

181
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,090
he likes it, right? Is it exciting?

182
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,330
We need to try it together.

183
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,620
Kazuyo-chan likes you 100%.

184
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,240
Well...

185
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,565
I was wondering why she came

186
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:41,776
to my shop so frequently.

187
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,323
Shouldn't you tell her that

188
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:45,940
you are not interested in women?

189
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:47,610
But...

190
00:09:48,082 --> 00:09:50,662
it's not like she told me directly.

191
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,710
Well, that's true.

192
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,150
When the right moment comes,

193
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,110
I'll talk to her properly.

194
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,660
Yeah.

195
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,610
You're right.

196
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,080
But...

197
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,366
hearing that it's important to share

198
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:07,452
common interests...

199
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,760
Makes my ears hurt.

200
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,936
Did something happen

201
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,171
with Soga-san again?

202
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,147
We went to an art exhibition together

203
00:10:18,163 --> 00:10:19,125
the other day.

204
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,663
After looking at many paintings,

205
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,925
he asked for my thoughts.

206
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,000
Oh. What did you say?

207
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,790
At any rate,

208
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,680
I just said,

209
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,930
'It's deep, ' for every painting.

210
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,780
How shallow.

211
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,962
I ended up buying a clear file

212
00:10:34,987 --> 00:10:36,884
at the gift shop in front of Soga-san.

213
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,450
Well, it's definitely your style.

214
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,136
When you like someone, you tend to

215
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,823
conform completely to their preferences.

216
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,910
Are you talking about Mizuki?

217
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:48,900
Well...

218
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,880
Mizuki, huh?

219
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,930
Well, that guy was a total mess.

220
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,913
I know Mizuki and Soga-san

221
00:11:09,938 --> 00:11:11,069
are different.

222
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:13,616
But I'm a little worried that you'll be

223
00:11:13,648 --> 00:11:15,577
pushed around and get hurt

224
00:11:15,602 --> 00:11:16,900
like you did back then.

225
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,702
Considering the other person

226
00:11:19,726 --> 00:11:20,725
is important,

227
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,820
- but it's okay to be a little selfish.
- Don't worry.

228
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,360
I am not in love with Soga-san.

229
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,960
I've decided to be friends with him.

230
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,420
Even then...

231
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,691
I can't deny that

232
00:11:33,716 --> 00:11:35,098
I'm being pushed around.

233
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,540
But I won't be hurt by that.

234
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,810
- Kazuyo.
- Hmm?

235
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,730
- Tawarauchi-san?
- Please check it when you're free.

236
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,770
- Sure.
- Yes, thank you.

237
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,160
I'm sorry, even though it's my job.

238
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,160
It's fine. I'll handle it quickly.

239
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,100
- Kanda-san
- Thank you.

240
00:11:55,441 --> 00:11:58,040
- seems more enthusiastic lately.
- Sure, it's fine.

241
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,420
Yes.

242
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,820
I need to learn from her.

243
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:05,080
Oh, Soga-kun, you're doing great.

244
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,750
Look, the other day...

245
00:12:07,264 --> 00:12:08,861
when you were invited to that party

246
00:12:08,902 --> 00:12:10,208
at the client's place.

247
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,170
Well, I just got carried away...

248
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,680
This looks really cool.

249
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,070
No, no.

250
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,560
Oh, but

251
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,430
it was a lot of fun.

252
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,340
Oh.

253
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,500
That's good.

254
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,393
In the end, it's about relationships

255
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:25,683
between people in the Reiwa era.

256
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,210
You must enjoy everything you do.

257
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,720
Indeed.

258
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,010
However, well,

259
00:12:31,026 --> 00:12:33,026
there are many sorts of cases.

260
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,281
Building relationships

261
00:12:35,306 --> 00:12:36,922
outside of work is important,

262
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,220
but even with our clients,

263
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,490
they're not always good people.

264
00:12:47,595 --> 00:12:48,360
Sakae-kun...

265
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,280
Sakae-kun, do you like squash?

266
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,990
Squash?

267
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,000
I like it!

268
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,400
I used to play squash.

269
00:12:59,668 --> 00:13:01,263
If you're interested, how about playing

270
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,372
together sometime?

271
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,290
Huh?

272
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:04,720
Huh?

273
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,380
Huh?

274
00:13:10,325 --> 00:13:13,580
Soga-san, do you play squash?

275
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:14,910
Yes.

276
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,690
Well, I just dabble in it.

277
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,550
What's with that?

278
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,550
He should have told me sooner!

279
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,820
By all means! Let's do it!

280
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,070
There it is!

281
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,080
Now that you mention it,

282
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,200
squash would suit Soga-san, wouldn't it?

283
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,390
Sakae-kun!

284
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,560
Soga-san!

285
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,160
Sakae-kun!

286
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,700
Alright. I won't lose!

287
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,550
Oh, awesome!

288
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:09,370
Nice!

289
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,320
I'm looking forward to it.

290
00:14:12,555 --> 00:14:13,470
Right.

291
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,610
Alright, let's begin.

292
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:20,969
Yeah.

293
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,890
Huh?

294
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,000
Whoa!

295
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,890
Umm...

296
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,840
Oh.

297
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,028
Soga-san,

298
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,895
have you actually played it before?

299
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:55,900
Yes, but only to the extent of dabbling.

300
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,380
Dabbling...

301
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,186
When I was in university,

302
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:03,389
I used to play squash.

303
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,950
I went to watch a friend compete once...

304
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,690
That's not dabbling.

305
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:10,860
And it was just once.

306
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,040
I'm sorry.

307
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,120
Then why did you suggest playing squash?

308
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,947
I was talking with our Chief Takagi

309
00:15:23,972 --> 00:15:25,948
the other day.

310
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,520
Huh?

311
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,102
Building relationships

312
00:15:30,126 --> 00:15:31,765
outside of work is important,

313
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,020
but even with our clients,

314
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,480
they're not always good people.

315
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,920
What do you mean?

316
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,920
There are those

317
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,620
who only think about themselves,

318
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,170
only impose their own convenience on us.

319
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,240
Oh.

320
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,060
In such situations,

321
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:51,440
I still

322
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,800
put on a smile,

323
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,120
but in my heart,

324
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,230
I feel like I'm drifting away.

325
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,520
At that time...

326
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,348
I started to feel like

327
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,951
I thought I was being

328
00:16:07,975 --> 00:16:09,256
like that to Sakae-kun.

329
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,280
I'm really sorry.

330
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,340
I...

331
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,090
got too carried away...

332
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,337
Meeting someone in Osaka

333
00:16:23,353 --> 00:16:25,540
with whom I could be completely myself,

334
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,240
I wanted to do this and that together,

335
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,080
and all I could see was myself.

336
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,160
I was selfish,

337
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:35,480
and I regret it.

338
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,360
That's why you asked me out?

339
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,040
Yes.

340
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,020
I heard from 'Tamae' customers

341
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,020
that you used to play it.

342
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:55,920
I took your smile for granted,

343
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,920
when I imagined that

344
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,180
if this continues,

345
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:03,664
the heart would drift away,

346
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,720
I got scared.

347
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,800
You don't have to worry about that.

348
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,240
It won't drift away.

349
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,640
My heart...

350
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,640
is with Soga-san.

351
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,280
Well, but, you know...

352
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,446
if we're going to do this,

353
00:17:28,462 --> 00:17:30,110
you better improve your skills a bit.

354
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,000
Right.

355
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,860
Alright then,

356
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,260
let's have another round.

357
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,760
- Yeah.
- Right?

358
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:43,950
Like this.

359
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,200
Like this.

360
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,730
Too stiff.

361
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,270
Hold it tightly.

362
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,430
Oh!

363
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,890
Oh! Terrific!

364
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,320
Try it again.

365
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,600
Why did you choose that one?

366
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,350
I exercised, so I need the energy.

367
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:05,950
Calories.

368
00:18:07,404 --> 00:18:08,741
I don't want that.

369
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,640
How about we exchange?

370
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,650
Mmm.

371
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:20,400
So this is how it tastes.

372
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:25,786
Soga-san and I are

373
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,906
complete opposites in every way.

374
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:28,650
So sweet.

375
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:29,960
However...

376
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,810
Hey, Kaname.

377
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,410
Turns out, I'm in love.

378
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,860
Yeah.

379
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,580
I've been saying all sorts of things,

380
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,680
but I'll stop deceiving myself.

381
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,180
I like

382
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,920
Soga-san.

383
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,930
It's a little late for that, isn't it?

384
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:07,690
That's because

385
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,850
Soga-san is so cute.

386
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,170
Yeah, yeah.

387
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,130
Finally.

388
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,640
- I'm off.
- Yes, feel free to drop by again.

389
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,090
Unbelievable.

390
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,910
Kazuyo-chan, you seem a bit quiet today.

391
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,530
I'm sorry.

392
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,873
You probably want to close

393
00:19:32,898 --> 00:19:33,740
the shop by now.

394
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,590
Oh, no. It's fine.

395
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,220
Kazuyo-chan

396
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,700
likes you 100%.

397
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,240
Umm...

398
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,140
How should I put this?

399
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,210
- Well...
- Haa...

400
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,960
Another day of work tomorrow.

401
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,410
Huh?

402
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,490
I'm feeling a bit worn out, you see.

403
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,320
That's unusual for you, Kazuyo-chan.

404
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,740
I took on too much work

405
00:20:05,764 --> 00:20:06,865
from my colleagues.

406
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:09,900
I mean, I volunteered for everything.

407
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:12,791
Ah, I'm sorry,

408
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,266
I shouldn't be complaining like this.

409
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,130
No, it's fine.

410
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:21,462
I want you to keep smiling, Kazuyo-chan.

411
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,400
If you ever need to vent,

412
00:20:24,425 --> 00:20:25,767
feel free to do it with me.

413
00:20:49,077 --> 00:20:50,810
Yes? Hello.

414
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:52,540
Hisashi-kun.

415
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,030
Saeko-san?

416
00:20:58,979 --> 00:21:00,320
(Divorce Certificate)
I hope that Hisashi-kun

417
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,150
will be able to rely on others more.

418
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,160
Yes. It's been a while.

419
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:11,800
Here,

420
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,800
a complimentary dote-yaki.

421
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,040
Sorry for making you wait.

422
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,030
Are you sure?

423
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,866
Take in this stamina,

424
00:21:19,906 --> 00:21:21,171
and let's do our best tomorrow.

425
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,530
Yes.

426
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,000
Bon appétit.

427
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,620
Stamina acquired.

428
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,330
That was quick.

429
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,860
Thank you.

430
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:55,950
Sakae-san, you also

431
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,410
feel the same way, right?

432
00:21:58,890 --> 00:21:59,770
Yes.

433
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,160
I feel the same way.

434
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,360
Huh?

435
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,690
I also

436
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,660
want to see Sakae-san's smile

437
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,630
by my side always.

438
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:20,440
I like you,

439
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:22,640
Sakae-san.

440
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,040
Sorry for making you wait.

441
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,890
(Next Episode)
Even though there's a dress code.

442
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,890
(The arrow of love has hit a major snag)
Happy birthday.

443
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,120
(The arrow of love has hit a major snag)
Sakae's kiss was a little strange.

444
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,360
Sakae's kiss was a little strange.

445
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:18,921
Because of Kazuyo-chan,

446
00:23:18,945 --> 00:23:20,116
I have come to like Soga-san.

447
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,080
(And finally...)
That hurts.

448
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,080
(And finally...)
I...
