1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,720
I want to sleep

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,960
together with you on the same futon.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:07,810
Huh?

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,800
Saeko-san is coming to Osaka?

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,010
Yeah.

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,395
There's something

7
00:00:12,411 --> 00:00:13,586
she wants to talk about.

8
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:14,661
You could just talk about it

9
00:00:14,686 --> 00:00:15,701
over the phone.

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,100
That's what I told her.

11
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:19,680
Hmm...

12
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:21,780
I see.

13
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:28,980
Stewed dishes,

14
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,852
when they cool down,

15
00:00:30,861 --> 00:00:32,541
they will reveal its true taste.

16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,670
What are you trying to say?

17
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,915
After Saeko-san distances

18
00:00:37,931 --> 00:00:39,611
herself from Soga-san,

19
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,550
perhaps it deepens her love for you?

20
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,680
That's impossible.

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,640
In that case,

22
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,292
'Tamae' is good enough

23
00:00:47,316 --> 00:00:48,573
for meeting, right?

24
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:50,570
Huh?

25
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,670
I'll make sure to witness

26
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,720
every bit of your conversation.

27
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,880
Right, I understand.

28
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,610
"Although I Love You, And You?"

29
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,350
Ah.

30
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,620
This way, on the right.

31
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,620
"Episode 9: It suddenly changed, what now?"

32
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,740
Long time no see.

33
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,160
Yeah.

34
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,350
Huh?

35
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,120
Yo.

36
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,450
Umm...

37
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:57,870
(Private Reservation Today)

38
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,500
Thank you.

39
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,320
This is the owner here, Sakae-kun.

40
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,470
Ah, nice to meet you.

41
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,860
And this is Saeko-san.

42
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,000
And...

43
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,860
Hello, I'm Kajiwara.

44
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,120
He's a senior from

45
00:02:11,145 --> 00:02:12,199
the Tokyo head office,

46
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,285
the person who has

47
00:02:13,293 --> 00:02:14,667
taken care of me the most.

48
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,360
So, why are you two...

49
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,310
I'll serve the dishes then.

50
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,640
Thank you.

51
00:02:29,308 --> 00:02:31,323
Originally, we knew each other

52
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:32,468
through Soga.

53
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,840
But recently, we happened to

54
00:02:34,856 --> 00:02:36,183
meet again through work.

55
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,050
- Is that so?
- Yes.

56
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,490
We talked about work troubles and stuff.

57
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,140
And well,

58
00:02:42,922 --> 00:02:44,811
being divorced so we could relate...

59
00:02:46,131 --> 00:02:47,000
Therefore...

60
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,140
We are dating.

61
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,026
I thought I should properly

62
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:56,480
tell Hisashi-kun too.

63
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,200
Soga-san...

64
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,609
She is a straightforward

65
00:03:05,634 --> 00:03:07,086
and optimistic person.

66
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,540
Even now, I still respect her.

67
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,795
Even though the relationship is over,

68
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,350
it must be a shock.

69
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,470
I see.

70
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,390
Somehow, I'm happy.

71
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:25,840
Huh?

72
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,240
Will you support us?

73
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,030
Of course,

74
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,673
you're both people

75
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:32,626
I truly trust.

76
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,220
'Trust' might

77
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,820
not be the right word.

78
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,350
Ah, actually,

79
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,230
I've found someone important to me too.

80
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:43,840
He is...

81
00:03:44,344 --> 00:03:45,400
Sakae-kun.

82
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,290
- Huh?
- Huh?

83
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:46,970
Huh?

84
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,530
Soga-san

85
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,740
please give me a heads up first.

86
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,940
Sorry.

87
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,920
I just couldn't hold it in.

88
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,540
Ah, I'll go buy some water.

89
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,590
We have water here.

90
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,430
It's okay. I'd like to go and buy it.

91
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,270
Any convenience stores nearby?

92
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,600
Oh, it's a bit tricky to explain.

93
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,060
Leave and turn left, walk straight.

94
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,980
- You'll see it on the right...
- Why don't you guide me?

95
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,120
Huh?

96
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,020
Uh, sure.

97
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,280
I'm glad I got to hear about Sakae-san.

98
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,730
I'm glad I got to talk about it too.

99
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,521
It's complicated,

100
00:04:28,537 --> 00:04:30,122
but I felt like you and Sakae-san

101
00:04:30,147 --> 00:04:32,052
have good chemistry more than I do.

102
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,110
Do you remember, Saeko-san?

103
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,300
You once told me in the past

104
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,357
that you wanted me to meet someone

105
00:04:45,381 --> 00:04:46,677
I could truly rely on.

106
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah. I remember.

107
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,830
Coming to Osaka

108
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,760
and meeting Sakae-kun,

109
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,960
I finally felt like I understood.

110
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,570
I see.

111
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,810
Let's both be happy.

112
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,602
It goes without saying.

113
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:07,536
I've had enough of failures already.

114
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,490
Geez, failures, huh...

115
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,740
Soga-san is very cheerful.

116
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,120
We made a good team.

117
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,900
When he decided to go to Osaka,

118
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,090
we made a promise.

119
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,150
We promised to keep growing and

120
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,960
working hard together again in Tokyo.

121
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,320
Oh, I'm sorry.

122
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,750
I shouldn't be talking about this.

123
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,560
No, it's okay.

124
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,750
I'm prepared for when that time comes.

125
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,765
Thank you for the meal.

126
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:41,070
It was really delicious.

127
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,070
- See you later, Soga.
- Yes.

128
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,410
Thank you.

129
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,120
Well then, see you again.

130
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,280
I ended up pretending to be tough.

131
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,410
Huh?

132
00:05:58,602 --> 00:05:59,292
No,

133
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,900
Even though I haven't really prepared

134
00:06:01,925 --> 00:06:03,564
myself to be separated from you,

135
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,430
I told Kajiwara-san

136
00:06:05,455 --> 00:06:06,603
I had already done so.

137
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,890
I haven't prepared myself either.

138
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,600
Ah.

139
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,310
But we still have 10 months left.

140
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,030
Why don't we enjoy this moment

141
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,656
while we have it and

142
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,570
think slowly about what comes next?

143
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,220
That sounds good.

144
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,931
(SND Residence)

145
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,660
Ta-da! I bought this.

146
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,860
- A harmonica?
- Yeah.

147
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,630
I thought I'd try something new.

148
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,408
With 10 months left, maybe I can

149
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:46,081
come up with an original song.

150
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,660
An original song, huh?

151
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,080
Oh!

152
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,730
A new challenge...

153
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,870
(Soga-san and Sakae's diary)

154
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,291
For the first time in my life,

155
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,151
I've decided to try keeping a diary.

156
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,650
Right now, it's still a blank diary.

157
00:07:08,635 --> 00:07:10,130
Oh, that's a good eggplant.

158
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,410
Soga-san, please wait!

159
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,280
- Ah!
- Oh!

160
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,320
- Caught you!
- Geez...

161
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,849
In 10 months, this diary will be

162
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:24,974
filled with lots of memories, won't it?

163
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,020
Sorry.

164
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,314
I've been asked if I could return

165
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:30,775
to Tokyo ahead of schedule.

166
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,310
Huh?

167
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,580
I might be here for another month or so.

168
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,033
No, no! It's only been a week

169
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:38,991
since our last conversation!

170
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,070
Look at my diary,

171
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:44,150
- it's still blank!
- I'm just as confused!

172
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,344
But it seems like

173
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,494
the project to sell

174
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,542
original cooking utensils

175
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,505
is getting started.

176
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,450
I don't care about that!

177
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,610
I was wrong about you.

178
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,424
Are you just a puppet

179
00:07:53,448 --> 00:07:54,572
of the organization?

180
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,978
You don't understand

181
00:07:57,994 --> 00:07:59,616
the world of corporate employees!

182
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,980
Oh, spare me!

183
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:02,416
Just stick to saying 'your company'

184
00:08:02,432 --> 00:08:03,696
or 'our company' for all your life!

185
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,690
Then maybe Sakae-san should just

186
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,080
keep saying 'thank you'

187
00:08:07,096 --> 00:08:08,355
and 'sure' forever?

188
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,810
- Huh?
- Right?

189
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,280
Sorry,

190
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,080
it's my problem on my end.

191
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,380
No,

192
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,440
I'm the one who spoke too harshly.

193
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,130
Let's make up.

194
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,090
Hey! Is this really the time for this?

195
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,360
We were both confused by our emotions.

196
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,500
This is a serious emergency.

197
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,691
We need to discuss what to do

198
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:32,722
from here on out.

199
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,850
I understand.

200
00:09:35,995 --> 00:09:38,730
Kaname and I will help you.

201
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,030
Huh?

202
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,170
Otherwise it won't progress, right?

203
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,820
I'll try my best.

204
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:50,820
What if, for example,

205
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,012
is there no possibility of

206
00:09:54,037 --> 00:09:56,230
Sakae going to Tokyo at all?

207
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,990
Closing 'Tamae' is out of the question.

208
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,830
Well, yeah, I see.

209
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,710
Then, what if Soga-san

210
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,360
stays at the Osaka branch?

211
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,940
- It seems a bit unrealistic.
- Yeah, yeah.

212
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,880
That's right.

213
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,810
Umm...

214
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,770
Well, this is awkward.

215
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,550
The peanut shells are really tight.

216
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,270
Geez, Kaname-san,
you're not helping at all!

217
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,978
In the end, does it boil down to

218
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:37,467
a long-distance relationship?

219
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,260
A long-distance relationship?

220
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,754
There are plenty of people

221
00:10:41,762 --> 00:10:42,866
who make it work.

222
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,940
Why don't you try simulating it?

223
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,590
- Simulation?
- Yeah.

224
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,172
Starting from tomorrow,

225
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,106
imagine yourselves in distant places.

226
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,630
Communicate frequently through calls

227
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:53,833
and messages since you

228
00:10:53,841 --> 00:10:54,910
can't meet in person.

229
00:10:54,935 --> 00:10:56,525
- I see.
- Yeah.

230
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,570
So, you'll judge whether

231
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,860
it works well or not based on that?

232
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,920
Simulation...

233
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,150
Should we give it a try?

234
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,260
Let's give it a try.

235
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:31,450
(Heading to work!)

236
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,510
Today...

237
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,940
do...

238
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,920
your best.

239
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,920
(Today, do your best)

240
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,850
(Simmered eggplant, preparation done)

241
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,360
Right, right.

242
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,790
Wow, that must be delicious for sure!

243
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:57,390
(Simmered eggplant, preparation done)

244
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,960
(Wow, that must be delicious for sure!)

245
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,920
Soga-san, good job on your work today.

246
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,080
Thank you for your hard work as well.

247
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:06,780
Yeah.

248
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,229
Somehow, it's also fresh

249
00:12:10,245 --> 00:12:11,979
to communicate like this.

250
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,520
Ah!

251
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,490
You can now play the harmonica, right?

252
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,510
Well...

253
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,743
I can manage

254
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:21,236
'Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star'.

255
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,700
Oh, play it for me!

256
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,320
It can't be helped.

257
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,891
I'm starting

258
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,875
to feel like we can handle

259
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,477
this long-distance relationship.

260
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,843
Even though we're apart,

261
00:12:53,868 --> 00:12:55,798
we're looking at the same stars.

262
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,020
Ah.

263
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,430
Hmm?

264
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,020
Hey, Soga-san! You shouldn't be here,

265
00:13:07,045 --> 00:13:08,319
we've supposed to be far away

266
00:13:08,327 --> 00:13:09,376
from each other!

267
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,250
But...

268
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,430
I'm actually nearby.

269
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,220
This doesn't change anything!

270
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,760
It's not like a simulation at all!

271
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,420
But!

272
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,280
I really wanted to see you.

273
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:23,870
Geez!

274
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,190
Geez!

275
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,950
I mean, I'm happy,

276
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,660
I'm happy, but!

277
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,678
We're adults, so we need to

278
00:13:41,703 --> 00:13:42,867
follow the rules.

279
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,310
Sorry.

280
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,210
Well, I guess

281
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,400
just hearing your voice is kind of dull.

282
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:50,960
Yeah.

283
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,070
Right.

284
00:13:53,943 --> 00:13:55,256
How about next time,

285
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:56,945
we cook while on a video call?

286
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,960
Huh? What's that? Sounds interesting!

287
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,680
- Right?
- Yeah.

288
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,100
Our lives are

289
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,070
boring from the beginning...

290
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,070
Not.

291
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,680
May you be happy.

292
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:11,930
Thank you.

293
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,680
Who?

294
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,740
No clue.

295
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,660
Ta-da!

296
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,930
Wow, it looks amazing!

297
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,050
It's totally different from my nikujaga.

298
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,020
How is this possible?

299
00:14:32,944 --> 00:14:35,120
You really are amazing, Sakae-kun.

300
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,630
It looks so delicious.

301
00:14:39,836 --> 00:14:42,992
Well then, let's dig in together.

302
00:14:42,992 --> 00:14:43,600
Soga-san.

303
00:14:44,224 --> 00:14:45,760
Just a moment, please.

304
00:14:45,906 --> 00:14:46,320
Huh?

305
00:14:53,952 --> 00:14:56,864
Hmm, this is delicious!

306
00:14:59,616 --> 00:15:00,656
Not!

307
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,344
Huh? Wait! What did you bring?

308
00:15:04,224 --> 00:15:05,872
No, but, you see...

309
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:09,344
You said we should follow the rules.

310
00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:10,896
I understand!

311
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:12,544
But...

312
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,752
I wanted you to try my dish.

313
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,336
Geez!

314
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:26,153
I'm really sorry.

315
00:15:27,776 --> 00:15:29,392
What am I doing?

316
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,912
Alright,

317
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,943
I'll make sure not to

318
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,310
repeat the same mistake.

319
00:15:41,728 --> 00:15:44,336
- Let's refocus and...
- No, it's no use.

320
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:46,160
I'm sure next time I'll end up

321
00:15:46,544 --> 00:15:47,957
going to your place again.

322
00:15:48,288 --> 00:15:49,776
Soga-san!

323
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:56,544
I knew it.

324
00:15:57,655 --> 00:15:59,057
Long-distance relationship

325
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:00,417
is just impossible.

326
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,776
There's no use complaining about it.

327
00:16:05,184 --> 00:16:07,296
We can't force the impossible.

328
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,712
But there must be another way.

329
00:16:25,856 --> 00:16:27,136
I'll quit my job.

330
00:16:31,536 --> 00:16:32,048
Huh?

331
00:16:32,912 --> 00:16:34,537
I'll leave my current job

332
00:16:34,562 --> 00:16:36,002
and stay in Osaka.

333
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,451
I've been considering

334
00:16:39,476 --> 00:16:40,935
that option for a while.

335
00:16:42,464 --> 00:16:43,856
But, if that's the case...

336
00:16:43,857 --> 00:16:44,615
It's okay.

337
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,552
'Tamae' is only here,

338
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,550
but I'm just an ordinary salaryman.

339
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,312
I can find another job.

340
00:16:56,768 --> 00:16:59,616
Wouldn't that solve everything?

341
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,624
We made a promise.

342
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,069
We promised to keep growing and

343
00:17:06,288 --> 00:17:08,060
working hard together again in Tokyo.

344
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:10,784
If Soga-san

345
00:17:12,176 --> 00:17:13,056
thinks

346
00:17:14,736 --> 00:17:15,696
that's okay...

347
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:18,400
Yeah.

348
00:17:19,136 --> 00:17:19,904
I'll be fine.

349
00:17:23,072 --> 00:17:24,400
Oh, thank you.

350
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,520
- Is it this?
- Oh, thank you for all your support.

351
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,210
Ah, here it is.

352
00:17:30,288 --> 00:17:31,152
Soga-kun!

353
00:17:31,632 --> 00:17:32,864
- Come here for a bit!
- Yes.

354
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:33,696
Right?

355
00:17:33,936 --> 00:17:36,016
It's not far.

356
00:17:36,064 --> 00:17:37,696
(Sorry. It looks like I'm going to have

357
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:39,673
to break our promise with Kajiwara-san)

358
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,369
If I quit the company,

359
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,672
I won't get the rent subsidy anymore.

360
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,211
I'm thinking of moving to

361
00:17:45,236 --> 00:17:46,596
a cheaper place.

362
00:17:50,864 --> 00:17:51,904
Is there

363
00:17:53,488 --> 00:17:54,176
no other choice?

364
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,170
Huh?

365
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,456
What?

366
00:17:59,024 --> 00:17:59,568
No...

367
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,680
(Kajiwara-san)

368
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,130
Sorry, I have to take this call.

369
00:18:07,936 --> 00:18:08,992
Yes, hello.

370
00:18:09,648 --> 00:18:11,648
Ah, sure. A moment please.

371
00:18:13,104 --> 00:18:13,640
Yes.

372
00:18:14,816 --> 00:18:15,360
Yes.

373
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,704
I'm sorry.

374
00:18:19,376 --> 00:18:20,532
We promised to work

375
00:18:20,556 --> 00:18:21,844
together again in Tokyo.

376
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,270
If it's a decision you won't regret,

377
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,120
then it's fine.

378
00:18:29,312 --> 00:18:31,856
To say I have no regrets would be a lie.

379
00:18:32,896 --> 00:18:34,432
The original product proposal was

380
00:18:34,433 --> 00:18:35,647
something Kajiwara-san and

381
00:18:35,672 --> 00:18:36,969
I came up with together.

382
00:18:38,046 --> 00:18:38,592
But,

383
00:18:39,648 --> 00:18:41,111
right now, there's nothing

384
00:18:41,136 --> 00:18:43,163
more important to me than Sakae-kun.

385
00:18:45,168 --> 00:18:47,648
I'm truly sorry.

386
00:18:49,888 --> 00:18:51,280
Are you preparing for a move?

387
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,000
Yeah.

388
00:18:53,696 --> 00:18:54,288
Ah.

389
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,400
I'm out of beans.

390
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:58,439
I'll go buy some.

391
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,456
It's okay.

392
00:18:59,457 --> 00:19:00,557
Oh, it's fine.

393
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,450
We're running low on toilet paper.

394
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:04,336
I'll be back soon.

395
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,672
(Proposal for In-House Brand Product)

396
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,660
(Proposal for In-House Brand Product)

397
00:19:46,128 --> 00:19:48,208
You finally invited me to the sauna!

398
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:54,000
I've been wanting to come with you.

399
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,192
What's wrong?

400
00:20:02,151 --> 00:20:03,682
Soga-san, how about we try

401
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,608
to make long-distance work after all?

402
00:20:11,248 --> 00:20:12,672
Let's drop that subject.

403
00:20:12,673 --> 00:20:13,363
No.

404
00:20:16,032 --> 00:20:17,344
This new project,

405
00:20:19,024 --> 00:20:20,391
it's something you've wanted

406
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,516
to do for a long time.

407
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:25,984
You can't quit your job.

408
00:20:29,248 --> 00:20:31,152
Why are you saying this all of a sudden?

409
00:20:32,192 --> 00:20:34,576
I want to be with Sakae-kun!

410
00:20:34,577 --> 00:20:35,638
I don't want you to

411
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,248
give up something important for my sake!

412
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:42,592
Can't we make

413
00:20:43,792 --> 00:20:45,424
long-distance work somehow?

414
00:20:50,944 --> 00:20:51,968
It's impossible.

415
00:20:55,584 --> 00:20:57,536
Let's finish this discussion outside.

416
00:20:57,648 --> 00:20:58,480
I...

417
00:21:00,912 --> 00:21:01,888
When you said

418
00:21:03,216 --> 00:21:05,744
your job didn't matter,

419
00:21:07,408 --> 00:21:08,368
I knew...

420
00:21:10,048 --> 00:21:11,664
you were putting on a brave face.

421
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,184
I felt lucky that we could stay together

422
00:21:16,384 --> 00:21:19,312
if I just stayed silent.

423
00:21:22,432 --> 00:21:23,616
But, the truth is...

424
00:21:26,592 --> 00:21:28,336
relationships like that don't last.

425
00:21:30,768 --> 00:21:32,128
I'll try to make it work.

426
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,471
I'll do my best

427
00:21:33,496 --> 00:21:34,744
not to burden you

428
00:21:34,768 --> 00:21:36,040
with unnecessary worries.

429
00:21:36,064 --> 00:21:37,568
You're just carrying it all by yourself.

430
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,960
Being with you when you force a smile,

431
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,544
I'm not happy at all.

432
00:21:50,112 --> 00:21:50,768
So...

433
00:21:57,408 --> 00:21:58,368
So...

434
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,782
If you can't handle

435
00:22:02,814 --> 00:22:04,282
a long-distance relationship,

436
00:22:10,384 --> 00:22:12,496
I think it's best to end it here.

437
00:22:16,624 --> 00:22:17,472
Soga-san...

438
00:22:19,344 --> 00:22:20,144
let's...

439
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,856
break up.

440
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,584
Sorry for the wait.

441
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,760
(Final episode)

442
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,860
It's like a dream, I'm glad!

443
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,240
I want to meet no matter what.

444
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,544
(In the beautiful world that you gave)
Because I love you.

445
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:17,909
So I want you to be happy.

446
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,610
(I was loved and get to know love)
The moment we're together,

447
00:23:19,611 --> 00:23:21,355
I want to extend the time at sauna.

448
00:23:21,356 --> 00:23:22,592
Thank you for everything.

449
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:24,927
Please take care.
