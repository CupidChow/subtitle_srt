1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,240
I also

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,010
want to see Sakae-san's smile

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,010
by my side always.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,840
I like you,

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,100
Sakae-san.

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,100
Will you go out with me?

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,270
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:29,490
I

9
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,460
have someone I like.

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,040
Where am I lacking?

11
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:38,810
Huh?

12
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,430
I think I'm a pretty good catch, you know?

13
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,820
I can do both work and housework,

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,000
- and I have a good of sense of humor...
- Umm...

15
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:49,990
I know.

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,820
I know that, but...

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,460
You see...

18
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:01,590
It's a guy,

19
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,190
the person I like.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,290
Huh?

21
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,040
I had decided in my heart.

22
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,280
Even if I got rejected by Sakae-san,

23
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,520
I wouldn't give up

24
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,660
until he accepts me.

25
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,050
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,280
Please don't apologize.

27
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:37,890
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,610
- Who is the person you like?
- Huh?

29
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,650
Even if I ask, I probably won't know.

30
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:45,870
Oh.

31
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,910
Um, yeah,

32
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,240
that's right.

33
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,507
Huh?

34
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,270
- Is it someone I know?
- Someone you know? Huh?

35
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,360
Well...

36
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,310
Soga-san?

37
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,580
Sakae, listen, my house...

38
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,260
Umm...

39
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,680
"Although I Love You, And You?"

40
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,030
"Episode 4 It's his birthday, what now?"
What?

41
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,030
"Episode 4 It's his birthday, what now?"
What's so good about Soga-san?

42
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,480
That's a matter of personal preference.

43
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,800
What "preference"?

44
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,020
Just the other day,

45
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,650
Soga-san was having lunch.

46
00:03:07,276 --> 00:03:08,870
He was eating tamagoyaki!

47
00:03:08,895 --> 00:03:11,004
Tamagoyaki is not a side dish for rice.

48
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,830
Tokyo-born Soga-san

49
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,168
and Osaka-born Sakae-san

50
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,350
are definitely not compatible!

51
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,260
I know that better than anyone,

52
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,900
but...

53
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,620
I can't suppress my feelings.

54
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:29,810
Well,

55
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,000
I understand Sakae-san's feelings.

56
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,690
But

57
00:03:35,434 --> 00:03:38,194
what does Soga-san think of Sakae-san?

58
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,080
I think he sees me as a friend...

59
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,240
I really want to

60
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,740
be your friend, Sakae-san.

61
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,170
We are friends.

62
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,789
If I say that I don't have

63
00:03:55,805 --> 00:03:56,867
any expectations

64
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,750
that it might be more,

65
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,780
it would be a lie.

66
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,220
Then,

67
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,587
why don't you just clearly

68
00:04:03,612 --> 00:04:04,830
convey your feelings?

69
00:04:05,435 --> 00:04:06,837
Kazuyo-chan, I think Sakae

70
00:04:06,862 --> 00:04:08,337
understands that too.

71
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,550
He understands the feeling of being worried

72
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,270
about what the other party thinks

73
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,650
if he confesses.

74
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,230
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,940
No, what you're saying is reasonable.

76
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,876
It'd be good if you could

77
00:04:25,884 --> 00:04:27,396
shorten the distance, step by step.

78
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,170
Yeah.

79
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,930
Oh, by the way,

80
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,730
Soga-san's birthday is coming up soon.

81
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,330
(Soga-san's birthday)
Oh!

82
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,706
Why don't you celebrate it

83
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:36,842
as a surprise?

84
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,780
Huh?

85
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,542
But he's bound to have plans

86
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:40,596
on such an important day.

87
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,270
You won't know unless you ask.

88
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,390
Well, what do you

89
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,160
do for a surprise?

90
00:04:46,212 --> 00:04:48,002
You just have to do your best.

91
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,300
Even if you say that, but how?

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,700
- Do your best.
- May I help you?

93
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,260
- Huh?
- Huh?

94
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,878
I think we need to know

95
00:04:56,886 --> 00:04:58,085
what kind of surprise

96
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,250
Soga-san would be happy with.

97
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,150
But...

98
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,270
to ask you for help...

99
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,590
No, to be honest,

100
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,330
I'm feeling really conflicted right now.

101
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,005
It's like when an actor

102
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:13,778
I was following moved to Tokyo.

103
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,346
All sorts of emotions

104
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:16,838
are swirling around.

105
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:17,920
Yeah.

106
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,200
Even though it's clearly going to fail,

107
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,510
I don't want to just leave him alone.

108
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,230
Is it...

109
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,150
really okay?

110
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,180
Soga-san,

111
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,830
this Sunday,

112
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,960
are you free?

113
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,730
(Soga-san, this Sunday, are you free?)

114
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,770
I'm inviting you for some fun.

115
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,570
I'm free. Let's do it.

116
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,460
Yes!

117
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,320
Good morning!

118
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,640
- Good morning.
- Today's vegetables are also great!

119
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,000
Thank you, you can put it there.

120
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,920
I had Soga-san fill out a survey.

121
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,070
Oh.

122
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,490
- And these are the results.
- Thanks.

123
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,554
If I were to be reborn as

124
00:06:22,563 --> 00:06:23,765
an animal, I would be

125
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,110
a giraffe?

126
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,510
There are a lot of dummy questions,

127
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,984
so the important thing is

128
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:30,384
where it's checked in red.

129
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,120
(Currently, the thing I want to try)
Leather from natural material

130
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,680
- in a moden style...
- Modern.

131
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,130
Modern.

132
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,539
I think he's talking about

133
00:06:39,555 --> 00:06:40,757
leather crafting.

134
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:44,040
Leather crafting?

135
00:06:44,197 --> 00:06:45,607
Yes, leather crafting.

136
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:48,911
Oh, so that's what he meant.

137
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,970
And the next question is...

138
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,050
The moment I'm moved...

139
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,380
is when I'm facing the mystery of

140
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,776
classical music, led by the instruments

141
00:06:58,801 --> 00:06:59,847
and the conductor.

142
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:00,620
Huh?

143
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,560
Probably about a classical concert.

144
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,150
Geez.

145
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,396
So, how about doing

146
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,706
leather crafts somewhere,

147
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,950
going to a classical concert,

148
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,710
and then having a party here?

149
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,910
The problem is the party.

150
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,140
(If you were invited to a party, )
A party with a Gothic atmosphere,

151
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,590
(what kind of atmosphere would you like)
with beauty in the midst of fear.

152
00:07:22,091 --> 00:07:24,101
What does that mean?

153
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,779
In other words, something like

154
00:07:25,795 --> 00:07:27,435
a stylish Western horror.

155
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,780
Like Halloween?

156
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,600
Well, probably?

157
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,960
Anyway, something like that.

158
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,680
Yeah.

159
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,670
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

160
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,530
Stylish horror...

161
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,500
Umm...

162
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,190
Should I help?

163
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,710
No, this much is already enough.

164
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,121
I can't just leave

165
00:07:53,146 --> 00:07:54,762
when you're making that face.

166
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,290
Even so...

167
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,497
This is the kind of person I am!

168
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,480
I told you I'm a good catch.

169
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,660
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

170
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,950
Should I help with the surprise too?

171
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,280
Just the thought is enough.

172
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,959
Thanks to Kazuyo-chan,

173
00:08:14,984 --> 00:08:16,525
everything is going smoothly.

174
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,660
That girl is really amazing.

175
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,990
She's like a bundle of vitality.

176
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,000
But,

177
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,420
is it okay to have her help this much?

178
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:27,730
Huh?

179
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:29,540
No,

180
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,280
it's just that it reminds me of Mizuki.

181
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,020
Hey.

182
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,460
Hmm?

183
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,910
Come to think of it,

184
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,492
I've never had a relationship

185
00:08:39,524 --> 00:08:41,176
that lasted more than a month.

186
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:41,810
Huh?

187
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,810
I broke the record?

188
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,320
Yeah...

189
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,750
I feel like...

190
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,400
Sakae is a little different.

191
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,700
Until I met Soga-san,

192
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,040
I was still dragging

193
00:09:06,824 --> 00:09:08,320
the heartbreak from that person.

194
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,630
I was wondering how

195
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,600
Kazuyo-chan feels now,

196
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,207
and whether it would be

197
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:18,434
better not to meet me.

198
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,940
I've been thinking about many things.

199
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,570
Isn't it arrogant of you

200
00:09:25,595 --> 00:09:27,115
to think that much?

201
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:28,650
Huh?

202
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,805
Even if you experience heartbreak,

203
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:31,861
life goes on.

204
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,320
She's probably trying to

205
00:09:33,344 --> 00:09:35,024
recover in her own way.

206
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,649
You should be grateful

207
00:09:37,657 --> 00:09:38,688
that she's so strong.

208
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:43,880
Yeah.

209
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,030
(Let's meet up at 1 PM tomorrow!)

210
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,400
Got it, looking forward to it!

211
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,570
(Thank you in advance)

212
00:09:57,675 --> 00:10:00,105
- Sakae-san!
- Yes?

213
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,810
Wow, amazing.

214
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,990
How did you decorate it so well?

215
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,370
Ta-da!

216
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,360
I think the atmosphere is like this.

217
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,110
- The atmosphere is great.
- Right?

218
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,490
How about your end?

219
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,670
I've prepared beef stew and turkey,

220
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,860
and a cake and battera.

221
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,030
Battera?

222
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,110
One of Soga-san's recent favorite.

223
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,360
I see.

224
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,260
Well, I was torn about it.

225
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,460
Whether battera fits

226
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,490
the stylish horror theme...

227
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,380
But in the end, I thought,

228
00:10:39,115 --> 00:10:40,209
I want Soga-san to

229
00:10:40,225 --> 00:10:41,240
enjoy his favorite food.

230
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,360
It's a bit tricky,

231
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,770
but when I weighed the options...

232
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,370
Huh?

233
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,780
No, I thought it was cute.

234
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,130
Cute?

235
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,310
I've come to terms with it.

236
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,050
Sakae-san is ridiculously devoted.

237
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:07,986
I'm not just saying this

238
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,033
to appear strong.

239
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,665
But I really think

240
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,658
we could be good friends.

241
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,310
Is that so?

242
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,110
Yes.

243
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,040
(Happy birthday, Soga-san)

244
00:11:19,065 --> 00:11:20,725
It's done!

245
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,100
Kazuyo-chan, thank you so much.

246
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,279
It's fine. With this, it's completed.

247
00:11:27,314 --> 00:11:27,955
Yeah.

248
00:11:29,537 --> 00:11:30,140
Whoa!

249
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,600
It's already morning.

250
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,940
Right.

251
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,810
Well then, I'll be going.

252
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,600
Ah, Kazuyo-chan,

253
00:11:41,595 --> 00:11:43,550
do you have plans today?

254
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:44,840
Huh?

255
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,100
Well...

256
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,832
If you don't mind,

257
00:11:49,864 --> 00:11:51,199
would you like to

258
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:52,940
join the party?

259
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,137
If it was just me, I definitely wouldn't

260
00:11:57,161 --> 00:11:58,472
have been able to prepare properly.

261
00:11:58,497 --> 00:12:00,237
I want to say we both

262
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:01,770
worked hard on it.

263
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:04,990
I understand.

264
00:12:05,852 --> 00:12:06,990
Just in the beginning then.

265
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,510
Just in the beginning?

266
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,368
I can't stay until the end.

267
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,594
Sakae-san, make sure to close

268
00:12:13,619 --> 00:12:15,453
the distance with Soga-san properly.

269
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,110
Yes.

270
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,350
Yeah.

271
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,640
Alright.

272
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,300
See you tonight.

273
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,560
Leather crafting.

274
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,100
I've been wanting to try this for ages.

275
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,350
Really?

276
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,800
What a relief.

277
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,310
Oh.

278
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,547
But why does Sakae-kun

279
00:12:37,572 --> 00:12:38,969
know that I want to do it?

280
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,440
No, that is, well...

281
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,830
You pay attention to every detail, huh?

282
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,240
Oh, you can tell?

283
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,630
Ah, here, look.

284
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,927
I'm trying to do it

285
00:12:50,952 --> 00:12:52,310
here, here, and here.

286
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,640
Oh, I see.

287
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,630
Amazing.

288
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,540
Right?

289
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,250
Alright.

290
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,440
Let me try as well.

291
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,000
Oh, it was a wonderful concert!

292
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,788
Did you hear a lovely snore

293
00:13:09,813 --> 00:13:11,333
from the next seat?

294
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,250
It just means the music was so soothing.

295
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,250
But it really was wonderful.

296
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,291
Thanks for inviting me

297
00:13:22,316 --> 00:13:24,401
to do many things today.

298
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,800
It's not over yet.

299
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,140
Huh?

300
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,790
Actually, after this...

301
00:13:34,334 --> 00:13:36,114
Oh, Soga-kun!

302
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,120
Oh, Sakae-kun too.

303
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,560
Chief Takagi.

304
00:13:44,882 --> 00:13:46,392
So low.

305
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,194
I even have the dress code

306
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:49,323
down to a tee.

307
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,811
Got caught by Chief Takagi,

308
00:13:54,819 --> 00:13:56,499
now the three of us are drinking.

309
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,300
Huh?

310
00:13:59,163 --> 00:14:00,358
Alright, on to the second place.

311
00:14:00,358 --> 00:14:01,266
Did you find us a spot?

312
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,330
- Yes, yes.
- A moment, please.

313
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,120
Sakae-san, let's go to the second place.

314
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,040
Yes.

315
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,440
Okay, let's go.

316
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,650
- Cha la la.
- Found you!

317
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:09,200
Oh.

318
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,020
Kanda-san?

319
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,780
What's with that outfit?

320
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,614
Chief Takagi, want to go for drinks,

321
00:14:16,638 --> 00:14:18,051
just the two of us?

322
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,890
Why?

323
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,040
Why?

324
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,278
Because I've always

325
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,970
thought you were cool.

326
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:23,840
No!

327
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,550
I have a loving wife

328
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:26,821
and kids.

329
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,810
Why do you have to be so cold?

330
00:14:29,262 --> 00:14:30,892
Soga-kun, find us a spot?

331
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:31,840
Oh, yes.

332
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,080
How about here?

333
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,440
Oh, great! Do they have Ume Suisho?

334
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,920
Ume Suisho or whatever.

335
00:14:37,475 --> 00:14:38,915
Soga-san, don't you want to have

336
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:40,356
a long talk with Sakae-san alone?

337
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:40,860
Huh?

338
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,360
Uh, well,

339
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,360
a larger group is more lively too...

340
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,500
Right?

341
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:49,660
Yeah.

342
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,327
Since we're here, how about joining us,

343
00:14:54,343 --> 00:14:55,343
Kanda-san?

344
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,032
Soga-san is an idiot!

345
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:03,491
Idiot!

346
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,680
Kazuyo-chan!

347
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,085
How much do you think Sakae-san

348
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,163
considers Soga-san's feelings?

349
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,615
Do you think he'd be happy?

350
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,190
Do you think he'd be surprised?

351
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,350
Despite that, Soga-san...

352
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,158
Has Soga-san ever thought of him

353
00:15:21,174 --> 00:15:22,228
even one tenth or

354
00:15:22,253 --> 00:15:23,564
one hundredth as much as

355
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,719
Sakae-san think of you?

356
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,500
That's enough.

357
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,200
Hey!

358
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,700
Do you want to fight?

359
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,000
Come at me!

360
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,630
Come, hurry!

361
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:32,960
Hey!

362
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,240
Soga-kun...

363
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:37,000
I think I'm going to throw up.

364
00:15:37,032 --> 00:15:37,766
Huh?

365
00:15:37,856 --> 00:15:40,270
Huh? Are you alright?

366
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,024
No.

367
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,260
You mortals

368
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,290
can't see...

369
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,260
our bodies, huh?

370
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,768
Even if you say it in Kansai dialect,

371
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:54,385
it doesn't create the right atmosphere.

372
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,760
Well, let's eat.

373
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:56,440
Please.

374
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,980
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

375
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,130
Umm... Delicious.

376
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,130
We

377
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,600
did well.

378
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,220
Even though it's delicious...

379
00:16:23,964 --> 00:16:25,130
I'm sorry.

380
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,670
I'm sorry!

381
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,160
No,

382
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,220
Kazuyo-chan, you did nothing wrong.

383
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,000
I was wrong.

384
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,388
There were many ways

385
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,325
to handle it smoothly,

386
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:41,290
but...

387
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,790
I couldn't bear it.

388
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,650
It's sad, isn't it?

389
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,070
Sakae-san's feelings

390
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,800
wasn't conveyed.

391
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,080
Kazuyo-chan,

392
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,550
thank you.

393
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,040
I really appreciate it,

394
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,330
about what you told Soga-san,

395
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:07,820
I was really happy.

396
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,770
I've been relying on convenience.

397
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,317
I thought even if I

398
00:17:14,342 --> 00:17:15,832
don't express my feelings,

399
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,715
maybe someday Soga-san

400
00:17:17,731 --> 00:17:19,411
would notice my feelings.

401
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,480
It's such a convenient story,

402
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,130
but it's impossible.

403
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,920
Thanks to you, Kazuyo-chan,

404
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,580
I've finally made up my mind.

405
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,350
My feelings...

406
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,940
I will properly convey what I think him.

407
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,184
(I'm sorry about earlier
Let's hang out again...)

408
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,350
Happy Birthday to you,

409
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,940
Happy Birthday to you.

410
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:09,840
Happy Birthday, Dear Soga-san!

411
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,990
Happy Birthday, Soga-san!

412
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,140
Huh?

413
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,600
You knew?

414
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:19,720
Sorry

415
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,740
for the odd timing.

416
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,090
Blow out the candles!

417
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,020
Happy Birthday!

418
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,810
Thank you!

419
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,905
Wait, did you prepare

420
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,226
other things as well?

421
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:41,800
Well...

422
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,200
I'm sorry!

423
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,400
No, well...

424
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,698
I didn't forget that

425
00:18:47,714 --> 00:18:48,706
today's my birthday,

426
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,716
but I never expected...

427
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,040
Let bygones be bygones.

428
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,650
Anyway, want to

429
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,190
share this cake with me?

430
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,080
It's really delicious.

431
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,510
What a relief.

432
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,800
Come on, eat this too.

433
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,830
You like it, right?

434
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,210
Yeah.

435
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,520
This taste,

436
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,790
it really puts me at ease.

437
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,320
Yeah, it's good.

438
00:19:45,905 --> 00:19:46,490
Hmm?

439
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,420
The first time we met,

440
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,140
seeing the expression on your face

441
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,350
while eating my cooking.

442
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,910
I was really happy.

443
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,160
I said I liked you

444
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,490
as a friend, didn't I?

445
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,800
Well,

446
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,480
that was a lie.

447
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,870
It was actually love.

448
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:23,820
I...

449
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,040
I am in love with you!

450
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,610
Are you serious?

451
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,400
Can you

452
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,590
feel my heart pounding?

453
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,090
Since we first met,

454
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,830
I thought you were a wonderful person

455
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,500
and before I knew it,

456
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,794
I couldn't help but

457
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:02,848
fall in love with you.

458
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,470
That...

459
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,510
Thank you.

460
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,450
I...

461
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:27,960
Oh no...

462
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,513
I don't know what to say,

463
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,607
I can't process this. I'm sorry.

464
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,590
It's okay.

465
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,360
Just...

466
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,609
if you're not going to

467
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:40,672
say no right away,

468
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,620
could you

469
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,230
think about it for a little?

470
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:49,880
I got it.

471
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,584
(Saeko-san)

472
00:22:04,512 --> 00:22:04,848
Ummm...

473
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,520
Huh?

474
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,280
Oh, it's nothing.

475
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:16,780
(Preparing)

476
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,560
Guess I'll come back later.

477
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,050
Sorry for the wait.

478
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,560
Mmm...

479
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,850
Delicious.

480
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,540
(Next Episode)

481
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,610
(Unexpectedly encountered the problem again)
See it from other perspective.

482
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,400
You still shamelessly return.

483
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,829
(Soga's rival finally appears.)
If Soga-san continues to

484
00:23:16,845 --> 00:23:18,096
hold back your answer

485
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,790
I don't know what will happen.

486
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,050
If I endure more.

487
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,170
It's a sign, right?

488
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,110
I don't understand my feelings.
