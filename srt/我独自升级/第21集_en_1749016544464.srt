I'll party at home when I get home.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm sure my father will be happy too.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I want to try the effect of the body right away.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
By the way, the wheel of the quest direction is...

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
No.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
This is also different.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Um...

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Oh, there it is!

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Um...

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The effect of the shadow...

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Is this...

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Is this the effect of the shadow's soldiers being able to put in places wherever they are?

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Then...

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Eshil, I'm sorry, but I'll go home alone.

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What? Where's the party?

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The Radis stay is in the 80th floor, so it's a bit far to go back.

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I see.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
If you have a chance, I'll see you again.

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Take care.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Jina-sama! I...

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What?

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I really thought I'd be able to make a name for myself.

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But I'm scared that it'll take me 3 hours to make the final concept Yi.

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Kaisel!

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
K truc suddenly veel.

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
They stopped at the und이는 fence by being too small.

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
While other troops had taken action on the belief they'd belong to,

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So they made Rome surrender.

74
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,400
We can cigarette the leftover z investigateまり which makes up to us.

75
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:11,460
ml, but truth will primval we explore the details well.

76
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:17,740
And at this point, electric Jeezid has been solved.

77
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:24,860
The plan is to wear some rangus to the red Zone!

78
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,320
Yes.

79
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,320
So, what about the call with the Sun Hunter?

80
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,320
I haven't got it yet.

81
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,320
Mr. Yunho, I'm drinking, so please smile a little.

82
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,320
The conversation you just had was really interesting, right?

83
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,320
I don't know how to be a biong.

84
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,320
I'll be happy if you can tell me the truth.

85
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,320
You're a big talker!

86
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,320
SQ Healer Min Biong.

87
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,320
He's got a few young people who didn't know him.

88
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,320
And he's a friend I fought with.

89
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,320
He's a funny guy, including his funny sense.

90
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
Are you listening?

91
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
Mr. Yunho.

92
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,320
Are you really going?

93
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
Yes.

94
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,320
I saw Mr. Yunho die.

95
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,320
That's why I'm going.

96
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,320
If you let me like him forever, I'll be a traitor.

97
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,320
Since when did you become such a biong?

98
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,320
If you have to go anyway, it's better to say that.

99
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,320
I was just saying the same thing.

100
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,320
I can't go.

101
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,320
I'll never give up if you come to the Seatokushi.

102
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,320
I just came to the meeting.

103
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,320
I might not be able to see you again.

104
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,320
I'll take the test of the Ministry of Justice.

105
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,320
The Ministry of Justice?

106
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,320
It's no good.

107
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,320
That's what the boss said.

108
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,320
It's no good.

109
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,320
That's what the boss said.

110
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,320
That's why I'm going to be a biong.

111
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,320
I'm not sure about the history.

112
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,320
It's bad.

113
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,320
You're good at history.

114
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,320
I like the old times.

115
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,320
What's that?

116
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,320
But this is normal.

117
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,320
It's enough to deal with it in history.

118
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,320
That's right.

119
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,320
It's normal to be a hunter.

120
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,320
Think about it.

121
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,320
I don't think I've seen a hunter who hates fighting monsters.

122
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,320
It's a daily thing to fight.

123
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,320
That's what I like.

124
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,320
Is that the condition of the Ministry of Justice?

125
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,320
Mr. Yunho.

126
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,320
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,320
I'm sorry again.

128
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,320
Shut up and drink.

129
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,320
You're sorry too, aren't you?

130
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,320
What's that?

131
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,320
I'm sorry for the trouble.

132
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,320
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,320
I'm sorry.

134
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,320
I don't know what's going on.

135
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
I don't know what's going on.

136
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,320
I don't know what's going on.

137
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,320
I don't know what's going on.

138
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,320
But I've seen a miracle that has been done several times.

139
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,320
I'm the one who survived.

140
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,320
I'm the one who survived.

141
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
I'll believe you.

142
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,320
I'm sorry.

143
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
Mother.

144
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,320
Please wake me up.

145
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,320
It's the only reason I fought to become strong.

146
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,320
Wake me up.

147
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,320
Mother.

148
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,320
I can't concentrate today.

149
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,320
Mother.

150
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,320
The wind is blowing.

151
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,320
I'm sorry.

152
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,320
It's Gina.

153
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,320
How much did mother sleep?

154
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,320
Four years.

155
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,320
Where's Gina?

156
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,320
She's fine.

157
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,320
Thank you, Gina.

158
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,320
You promised me.

159
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,320
You've grown up.

160
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,320
You've been so hurt.

161
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,320
You must have made a lot of trouble.

162
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,320
You're hurt, aren't you?

163
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,320
My hand.

164
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,320
My hand.

165
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,320
My hand.

166
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,320
Thank you, Gina.

167
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,320
The patient of the pulmonary kidney has woken up.

168
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,320
Yes, I can't believe it.

169
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,320
And the patient's body function is not a problem.

170
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,320
The family and the main person are hoping for the patient soon.

171
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,320
I'm sorry.

172
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,320
Gina, please.

173
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
I'm sorry.

174
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Finally, I've got the help of the doctor.

175
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,320
I finally got the true star.

176
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,320
I'm sorry.

177
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,320
Thank you for joining us today.

178
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,320
As you know, there has been a fire in the area

179
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,320
that was opened from Jeju Island.

180
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,320
We, the Hunter Association, decided to make a decision

181
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,320
on Jeju Island Raid No. 4.

182
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,320
This time, we decided to make a decision

183
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,320
to reinforce Japan's forces with a new new name.

184
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,320
Hoads of A-class circuit and sea acaba once again

185
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,120
to become стazido forest and significa that

186
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,320
the lemurs of theadic will join the team

187
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:16,320
to ensure your safety.

188
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,320
Mr. Uz nazi...

189
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,320
Mr. Unsok, I'm honestly scared.

190
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,320
I'm the same.

191
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,320
But those who can't fight are afraid of our hundreds of times.

192
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,320
Let's end this.

193
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,320
We can only do that to us who have power.

194
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,320
We can't let this country become the heir to our throne.

195
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,320
You idiot!

196
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,320
You're going to crush me to pieces.

197
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,320
Yunho has a place to go.

198
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,320
He has the ability to be precise.

199
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,320
I'm the one who can support this person when I say Ida.

200
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,320
Hey, you're going to let go of your eyes.

201
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,320
Well, I wonder if the four-year-old fruit is from the kitchen.

202
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,320
Let's clean it up with three people.

203
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,320
This house has become quite old.

204
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,320
It's quite dirty.

205
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,320
I've been living here since I was born.

206
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,320
I've always wanted this.

207
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,320
But I'm worried.

208
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,320
I've been living as a hunter.

209
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,320
I've been living in a place where I can't even step on.

210
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,320
Jin.

211
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,320
What?

212
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,320
Did you not contact your father?

213
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,320
By the way, news has come.

214
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,320
You've become a hunter.

215
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,320
Didn't you become a firefighter before your father died?

216
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,320
You were handsome and married to a man for the world.

217
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,320
You've taken over that land.

218
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,320
I'll be a doctor and work hard for the people.

219
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,320
That's right.

220
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,320
Jin has taken over it.

221
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
You're right.

222
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,320
Yes.

223
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
Good work on your trip.

224
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,320
Thank you for your help.

225
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,320
No problem.

226
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,320
You'll be back after the trip.

227
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,320
Thomas Andrew, an American national-owned QA hunter.

228
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,320
I've been waiting for you.

229
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,320
I can't wait.

230
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:06,320
But I've never been convinced that a soldier with the same power as a country would be able to enter the country.

231
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,320
Yes.

232
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,320
But why?

233
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:16,320
Did you come to the QA to check if you were on your way to the trip?

234
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,320
Or did you come to the QA to check if you were a fan hunter?

235
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,320
Or did you come to check if you were looking for something else?

236
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,320
By the way, are you still with the Sun Hunter?

237
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,320
No, I've just come.

238
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,320
I'll be back soon.

239
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,320
Let's leave.

240
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,320
Our raid is a disaster.

241
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,320
Can you lend us your power?

242
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,320
I've brought you a chance to level up.

243
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,320
Don't let it go.

244
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,320
I've always thought so.

245
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,320
I am...

246
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
the leader of the evil forces.

247
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,320
You're right.

248
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,320
I can feel it from this distance.

249
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,320
Now, the S9 Hunters are protecting their bodies in the Taekwondo.

250
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,320
If you're interested, let's take a look.

251
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:33,320
Bacchus, you're still young, so you should look forward to your little boy.

252
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,320
Now, it's just a war.

253
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,320
March 1st!

254
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,320
It's no surprise that the S9 Hunters gather in one place.

255
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,320
The leader of the evil forces is probably the one who was born from them.

256
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,320
Is Bacchus the one who's being pushed?

257
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:56,320
If Bacchus is serious, we won't be able to defeat the Maw Hunters.

258
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,320
Hello.

259
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,320
The one who came to that raid is Mr. Madong from Myojou Guild.

260
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,320
Why can't you be serious?

261
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,320
I don't think he's a person who can be easily defeated.

262
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,320
You can't be fully powerful in front of people.

263
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,320
When you're fully powerful, he's a monster.

264
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,320
Is the rumor true that he's a pervert?

265
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,320
And the people there are Mr. Kishidan Guild.

266
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,320
Oh, you're finally here.

267
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,320
The S9 Hunters of Japan, and the master guild leader, Ryuji Goto.

268
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,320
Who are you?

269
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:44,320
I'm the S9 Hunter, Son Jin.

270
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,320
You seem to be a killer.

271
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,320
No, he's a magician.

272
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,320
That's...

273
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:00,320
Oh, that's Son, who made our Minson's wings look so much better.

274
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,320
He's changed his mind.

275
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,320
I'm the top of this country.

276
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,320
I'm a little disappointed.

277
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,320
I'm always looking at your fighting style.

278
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,320
I don't think the S9 is the S9.

279
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,320
I don't think so.

280
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,320
You're not going to listen to me.

281
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,320
Suyaku, you're making fun of me now.

282
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,320
I don't know because I'm going to say it.

283
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,320
That's right, Master.

284
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,320
What's the matter?

285
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:38,320
This guy is Mr. Park Jones, the master guild leader of Kishidan Guild.

286
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,320
Park Jones? I'm the first to ask you that.

287
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:47,320
I don't think I've heard of the master guild leader from the S9 or the A9.

288
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,320
But I'm one of the five great guild leaders in the country.

289
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,320
I'll be the leader this time.

290
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,320
It's better not to make a wild wave.

291
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,320
Chau-chan, they're so weak at talking about us.

292
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,320
It's okay, calm down.

293
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,320
Just right.

294
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,320
I'm going to have a new match because it's a new one.

295
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,320
Just an Eskil Hunter.

296
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,320
I'm going to be the boss!

297
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,320
The details are decided by that.

298
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,320
That's good.

299
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,320
However, it's difficult to play the match.

300
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,320
Magic and non-fighting are good for the fight.

301
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,320
I agree.

302
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,320
Then, the fight is about the battle.

303
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,320
You can grab your wrist and touch your back.

304
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,320
If you get your body on the floor, you lose.

305
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,320
And the game is not a one-on-one match.

306
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,320
It's a match for everyone at once.

307
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,320
What?

308
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,320
At the moment, it's almost certain that it will be a wild battle.

309
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,320
I understand. Let's do that.

310
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,320
From here,

311
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,320
Chau, Im, Ma, and the four back-hunter.

312
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:03,320
From here, Tawata, Kumamoto, and the four Tanaka-hunter.

313
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,320
Then, let's start the match.

314
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:23,320
The most dangerous of all is my Demonstra.

315
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,320
The condition that you can see from the bottom of your heart is a defeat.

316
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:37,320
A hard-working skill, a hard-working face, a hard situation.

317
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,320
A hard-working skill, a hard-working feeling, a hard-working mind.

318
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,320
I'll crush you.

319
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,320
Sorry, sorry, I'll leave you alone.

320
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,320
It's almost lovely, don't miss it, Chau.

321
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,320
Goodbye, goodbye, we just like my world.

322
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,320
No one can touch it.

323
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,320
I'm looking for a good girl.

324
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
I'll make you cry.

325
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
It's almost beautiful.

326
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,320
It's a good moment.

327
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,320
I'll make you feel the moon.

328
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,320
I'll make you feel the moon.

329
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,320
Say that you can't get it.

330
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,320
Say that you can't get it.
