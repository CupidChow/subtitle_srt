00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Happy Homestay

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Kousha!

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Kousha, please let me live!

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That voice...

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You can't be...

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry, we lost!

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Please help us!

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Kousha!

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sorry, we lost!

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm sorry, we lost!

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Please help us!

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm sorry, we lost!

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You attacked us and killed us?

14
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Your friends are all dead.

15
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Knight's duty is to protect the Shikun.

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm fine with it, everyone will be happy.

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Even I...

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Well, that's fine.

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You're a bad boy!

20
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What are you doing?

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll kill you if you save my life!

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So please!

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This guy...

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Can I enter the Shinkansen?

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm going to destroy the Shinkansen with my family.

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
If you let me go, I'll kill you.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm sure the Shinkansen is in the top.

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
If you let me and my family go, I'll lead you.

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Are you hiding?

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You can't come out if you defeat them.

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The problem is...

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Are you okay with trusting me?

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Of course.

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm not lying.

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's okay.

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
If you let me go, I'll be in trouble.

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Thank you.

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
By the way, who are you?

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm a girl from the Radir family.

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm Eshil.

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No, that's not what I meant.

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What?

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I thought you could get information about the system.

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But...

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Do you hear the voice of the people in your head?

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What?

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
No, but I hear it from another order.

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What?

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Protect the place you're in.

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Since when?

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Since I came here.

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Since you came here?

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Where were you before?

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I was in the underworld.

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But I noticed something here.

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What were you doing in the underworld?

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
War...

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I was preparing for war.

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
War?

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Who?

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The enemy was strong enough to gather the demons.

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The enemy was in a situation where war was going to happen.

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The army that was forced to attack was over.

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
We're going to destroy them.

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The army that was forced to attack was over.

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
We're going to destroy them.

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
We're going to destroy them.

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I can't do this anymore.

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This is the victim's record of the attack

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
that was established in Japan.

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
294 victims of the civilians.

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
108 of the hunters who were involved.

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The fighters in the army were E-9, C-9, and B-9.

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Only one of them was killed?

81
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The E-9 hunters that were just in time

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
succeeded in giving the decisive order to the 9th floor.

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The rank of the trap is E-9 class.

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We're also fighting the Chosabu who was in the open.

85
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The island we're going to destroy is 120 km from Jujutsu Island.

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
If the hunters get more flying abilities,

87
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
they'll enter the Jorikohanin this time.

88
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
We'll have to hurry to help Japan.

89
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
We'll also have to reach the Kinden Shokoku.

90
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yes.

91
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The time has come.

92
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
There's no use in saying this.

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
If it's true, I wanted to fight before the victims came out.

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
From now on, I'll have the Hunter Association's council members

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and launch the fourth Jeju Toreido project.

96
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Why did I suddenly lose my mind?

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
No, don't worry.

99
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Is there any problem with your body?

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yes, it's fine.

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You're worried about me, aren't you?

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Well, I guess.

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Is the destination any closer than that?

104
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yes, the one-band radio station is in the way.

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
There's a permission to go there.

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What are you doing here?

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Ehiru!

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You can't see me?

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You're a coward who's hiding in the darkness of that man!

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You're a coward.

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You can't take my daughter away from me!

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You're a madman!

113
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Father, wait!

114
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I made a promise with him.

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
If he gets the permission to enter, I'll have to take him to the hospital.

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I heard that the Bolganian Netsu was defeated.

117
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
But we shouldn't have money against him.

118
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I hate you.

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm sure he's taken the money.

121
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Then, you should have forgotten your promise.

122
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You can't do that!

123
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And one more thing.

124
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm going to borrow this girl.

125
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What?

126
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Ah, no. I want to ask you for a guide.

127
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I heard that you know the owner of each of the permission.

128
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I heard that you know the owner of each of the permission.

129
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'll guarantee it.

130
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm sure you know the owner of each of the permission.

131
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
That's all. Please, Eshil.

132
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yes, sir.

133
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Master Guild.

134
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Master Guild.

135
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Alright.

136
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Now, the 89th floor is cleared.

137
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The Ygritte and the Tank level has been increased.

138
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The rank has been reduced to S9 and A9.

139
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm going to take the money.

140
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Now, the equipment I brought for the promotion has been wasted.

141
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You can take it back.

142
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
No, I won't.

143
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The Ygritte and the Tank level has been reduced to S9 and A9.

144
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The Ygritte and the Tank level has been reduced.

145
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So, I'll take the money and give you permission.

146
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
If I were weaker than you, I'd be in a fight.

147
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That's what I'm saying.

148
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm sure you've been fighting against the Ygritte and the Tank level.

149
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'll make the Ygritte the first in the Radies.

150
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Radies?

151
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Hey, why did you let me rule the Ygritte and the Tank?

152
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Because I like you.

153
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Oh, no!

154
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm going to take the money.

155
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I might be able to do it well if I take out one screw.

156
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You can go home now.

157
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The enemy will be stronger from now on.

158
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I have a promise with my father.

159
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
If you tell me the truth, I'll let you know.

160
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm not that useful!

161
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's not like that.

162
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I thought it was hard.

163
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Thank you, Lord Okuro.

164
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'll wait until the end.

165
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I want to see what you can do.

166
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Okay.

167
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Let's go.

168
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yes!

169
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
As Eshil said, the difficulty level has risen from the 90th floor.

170
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The monsters that protect the situation are stronger,

171
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
but they won't be as good as the ones I've written.

172
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Even so, I'm on the floor all at once.

173
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'll definitely get the material of life's death.

174
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
For that reason.

175
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm the fourth, the first one to be assigned to the Jeju Island Raid.

176
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Other than us, there's a hundred guilds' headquarters,

177
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
and all the SQ hunters in the country are calling out to everyone.

178
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So you're talking about the Sun Hunters?

179
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Moreover, this time, the cooperation with the forest is officially decided.

180
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Are you from Japan?

181
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yes.

182
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
If we think about the flying ability of the wings,

183
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
it's a natural decision to be included in the new high-ranking committee.

184
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's okay to be anyone.

185
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
If we can destroy them.

186
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What about the Raid marriage?

187
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm adjusting.

188
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But there's no doubt that it's a long-term plan.

189
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And in order to compete in the strategy,

190
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
the super-large guild's hunters will come here today.

191
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Finally, the top floor.

192
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But no one's here.

193
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Ah!

194
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's the devil's sword.

195
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Laugh!

196
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The Raid

197
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
How can a man who has no shield win like this?

198
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm going to be punished.

199
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
As long as you can feel the power of the sword.

200
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Well, if you're going to be thrown, it's a bad idea.

201
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Is there anyone else besides the devil?

202
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The Raid

203
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You're so slow.

204
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
What should I do?

205
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Princess!

206
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I know.

207
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Come out!

208
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Princess

209
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Wow, Princess, you can fight like this?

210
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
But that man is the devil's Balan.

211
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Then, who should be the leader of this place?

212
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
There's only the one who's the new master.

213
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The leader I should defeat.

214
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Which should I put on?

215
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's not just a trick.

216
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's a second-hand attack with a stun effect.

217
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
The soldiers will come back.

218
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
If we keep eating that, the mana will be used immediately.

219
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Before that happens.

220
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'll kill you.

221
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
The secret weapon is broken.

222
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's a secret method.

223
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'll catch you.

224
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm going to get you.

225
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
The secret weapon is broken.

226
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The secret weapon is broken.

227
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
The secret weapon is broken.

228
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Finally, you're down.

229
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
If I stop looking at you, my neck hurts.

230
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm going to save you.

231
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Hello.

232
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm Hanekawa, the owner of the Bakken Guild.

233
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm the master of the guild, Ryuji Goto.

234
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'll talk to you about the two-man strategy instead of him.

235
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Bakken Guild?

236
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The super-sized guild of Japan, known as the SQ Hunter 11.

237
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The name of the guild is called Asia Number 2.

238
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And Ryuji Goto, the master of the guild who can defeat it.

239
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Ryuji Goto.

240
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I can feel the aura of the guild.

241
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
First of all, thank you for accepting the proposal of the cooperation strategy and the alliance attack.

242
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
No problem.

243
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
The first one that I gave you was this one.

244
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'll be grateful for your cooperation.

245
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
As the information in the manual,

246
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I found out that the analysis result of the trap that I received from there

247
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
and the opening of the trap that I destroyed this time

248
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
were various.

249
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Among them, there are two important things about this strategy.

250
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
One is the lifespan.

251
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
The ant grows rapidly from the deep-sea,

252
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
but its lifespan is about a year.

253
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
In other words, if you defeat the queen ant,

254
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
the ant will naturally disappear after a year.

255
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Another is the ant's co-operation pattern.

256
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
The ant became stronger from the battle record of the previous three times,

257
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
and it was proven that it could be drawn to a strong magic force.

258
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
This time, it will be a strategy plan that took its life to the limit.

259
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
We were also aware of the movement of the ant.

260
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
But if we analyze it in detail...

261
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
In addition to that strategy,

262
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I will participate in the 11th member of the SQ Hunter

263
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
from the Backing Guild.

264
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
11 members?

265
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
We will make sure that the ant is safe.

266
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Please defeat the queen ant with that team.

267
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But that's a few thousand ants.

268
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
If it's just a movement, there's no problem.

269
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Even in AI simulation, it has the highest success probability.

270
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It's true that the SQ Hunter that we can get out of here is not visible to the public.

271
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Then... I understand.

272
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Let's focus on the detailed strategy in that direction.

273
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
There's no time to recover the ant's mana.

274
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Hmm?

275
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I got rid of the SQ Hunter!

276
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Huh?

277
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The mana is gone?

278
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
This is the last time I've seen an ant.

279
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
But it's a bit of a shame, but it's still a good opportunity.

280
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'll try to get rid of the ant's mana.

281
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm glad I can get rid of it.

282
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'll try to get rid of it.

283
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'll try to get rid of it.

284
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'll try to get rid of it.

285
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I'll try to get rid of it.

286
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'll try to get rid of it.

287
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Yes!

288
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
That's a power!

289
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Are you kidding me?

290
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Don't be scared!

291
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Now!

292
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
If I get the power I gave you as a result and the hand of the SQ Hunter!

293
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'll try to get rid of it.

294
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'll try to get rid of it.

295
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I'll try to get rid of it.

296
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
That's it!

297
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Mr. Shire!

298
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Mr. Shire!

299
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Mr. Shire!

300
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Eshil, report to your father.

301
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
From now on, the Radice Sword will be the first place.

302
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Mr. Shire!

303
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It's not Radice, it's Radile.

304
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
The situation is new.

305
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
The gap is not easy.

306
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
The long-awaited feeling is not enough.

307
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'll try to get rid of it.

308
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Sorry, sorry, I'll leave you alone.

309
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'll try to get rid of it.

310
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Goodbye, bye, we're just like my world.

311
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I'm lost in the world and I'm going to lie.

312
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I can't walk out without being alone.

313
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Hello, my friend, this is my cell phone.

314
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's getting low, excuse us, I can't get off.

315
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Give me your phone and leave now.

316
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I can't get it, I can't get it, I can't get it, I can't get it.
