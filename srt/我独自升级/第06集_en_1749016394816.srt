1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm the only one who's going to die.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm the only one who's going to die.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm the only one who's going to die.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm the only one who's going to die.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm the only one who's going to die.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm the only one who's going to die.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's impossible to defeat the boss with a bad EQ and a raid experience of 0 DQ.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'll bring out the Mana Stone on the day they're all asleep.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Is it another battle magic?

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Then the spider will wake up.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
There's a side road to the ceiling.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'll go down from there.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I see. As expected of Don Sok.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
But I can't sleep.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If I don't sleep, I'll have to defeat the boss.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Is it a friend?

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You saw that weapon, right?

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'll just shoot it with my sword and shield.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
If I can't get the Mana Stone, I'll just use it as a good item.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Let's see if it's a good item.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'll get out of the funeral.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Even so, the wall collapsed with a great sound just now.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The boss must have been in a hurry.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Kyuhan, are you confident that you can defeat him by yourself?

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
There's no way I can defeat him.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
To be honest, I'm the same.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I feel like I'm the boss.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
In other words, that little kid...

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I can't survive without a door.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Wait a minute!

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's impossible to defeat the boss with a DQ alone.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's impossible to defeat him without a power above the C.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's a total disaster.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Let's find a way to escape together!

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
As the saying goes, even if you're the best,

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
even if the level rises, I'm still weak.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The Aodokuga that was introduced in the Instance Dungeon is probably DQ.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The boss of the Golem type is also DQ or Stray.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This boss is definitely stronger than them.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But why?

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I don't feel the pressure to make a move.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm stronger than them, even if I don't suspect the boss of the CQ.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The level now is 18.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
If it's the boss of the CQ...

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'll just try it!

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The reason for being called Hunter Hunter...

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Is the beginning of the real curry!

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The level is now 18.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The level is now 18.

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The level is now 18.

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The level is now 18.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The level is now 18.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The level is now 18.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The level is now 18.

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The level is now 19.

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The level of theine still essential for attack...

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I hate how Dark Knight only follows the Kers.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Maybe her Poison Dungeon is 100% definitely the game.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm sure the guys that came here are not lack of a player to make a move.

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,800
The headlines, the headworks

61
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,000
So we got a buddy, got an ankle

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Local boy and he came in from a zero

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Everybody we can punch him as the power grows and grows

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Let's get it!

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Good work.

66
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,000
He Maya to a government has an energybus

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
His Пос catches the eye of us

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,040
Even without a good Joining

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We think there'll be nothing but flat indeed

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,960
It's just that

71
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,000
Can't you give us a proper quarter保itz sex

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That may inspire you to evolve

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The old man is a drinker.

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
If you break the rule of the young, you won't be able to go anywhere.

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The product is hard.

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What power.

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I can't give up.

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That move is absolutely not an EQ.

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What is that thing?

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
No way.

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Unidentified registered.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I've heard of it.

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
A hunter called Unidentified registered who is registered at a lower rank than the enemy who controls the magic power.

84
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
There are many people who are trying to kill each other.

85
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Why did he come here?

86
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Father...

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Damn it.

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I can't get in the way of the damage.

89
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You guys.

90
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
If you get up here, you'll lose your speed.

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
If you don't make a decision before that,

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
you'll lose your magic power.

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
This special ability of the detective is the key to victory.

94
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
If it's his weakness, it's the door.

95
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Over there!

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
San?

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Did you hide that?

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's a simple weapon.

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's a scary bastard who's more than I thought.

100
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
If I spend this much time, I'll lose.

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
If I have to go far,

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'll die.

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'll jump into the place where I can't see.

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
If I can't get out of here,

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'll do it no matter how many times!

106
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's fast.

107
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But I wonder if I have the power.

108
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What am I going to do?

109
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Hurry up!

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Faster!

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Just a little more!

112
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Jin!

113
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Jin!

114
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Jin!

115
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm glad I let you take the reward of the daily quest.

116
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
If it wasn't for that, it would have been tough.

117
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I can't believe it.

118
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I really defeated the boss by myself.

119
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
There's no doubt about it.

120
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
He's a non-servant.

121
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
How much is this?

122
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Excuse me, brother?

123
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Let's have a good time, magic stone.

124
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'll carry the stuff.

125
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's water, but please drink it.

126
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Brother...

127
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Brother?

128
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Please take a break.

129
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'll dig the magic stone and make it.

130
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What's wrong with him all of a sudden?

131
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
He's alive.

132
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What?

133
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Are you okay?

134
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yes, thank you for your help.

135
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm glad you're feeling better.

136
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Thank you.

137
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
As expected of the boss.

138
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I can't even see the fish's tail.

139
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Well, compared to the original,

140
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Jinchou-kun's technique is better.

141
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Don't be too serious.

142
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I can't even rank him,

143
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
but I can't do anything to get him to do it.

144
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's very important to train your mind and not to get into Hunter's power.

145
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
If you get to the place where the dungeon is located,

146
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
you'll be in trouble.

147
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
People's tricks will always be easy to get rid of.

148
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Boss, you're dead.

149
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You're just too big.

150
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You're too much of a fighter.

151
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You might even defeat the CQ boss.

152
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You're too weak to lose to the DQ.

153
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Donsok-san, what do you think?

154
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm sure of it.

155
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yuji-go!

156
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's amazing that you've been looking for a good partner.

157
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yuji-kun's manager, Yu Myonghan.

158
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
He's your father, right?

159
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Then...

160
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'll give you a chance.

161
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Kill the Sonjin.

162
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You know that now, right?

163
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
We're the ones who killed the impossible Kazuyama and took the revenge.

164
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Yuji-go, you'll be the one to be the threat.

165
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Then I'll let you go.

166
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
No way.

167
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You're the only one who can defeat the CQ with that stupid weapon.

168
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It'd be a hassle if you had a special effect.

169
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
If you don't have a lower side, you'll die too.

170
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What's wrong?

171
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What are you doing here?

172
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You can't get out of here.

173
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Are you afraid of the DQ?

174
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Huh?

175
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Are you...

176
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
...going to get that guy?

177
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Hmm.

178
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Mr. Donsok, what's wrong?

179
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'll clean up from the weak.

180
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Have you...

181
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
...killed people?

182
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
A emergency quest?

183
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What's this?

184
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Don't let me get you!

185
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Hey!

186
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Aniki!

187
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Heejin!

188
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Long time no see.

189
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
How's your back, Gild?

190
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Nothing special.

191
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Gina and the others are too much of a hunter.

192
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
We're not the same.

193
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I told you so.

194
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
How was the emergency dungeon training with Chasan?

195
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It was amazing.

196
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It was a moment.

197
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The emergency monster we were fighting in the Z-A-N-D.

198
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
We defeated it in an instant.

199
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It felt like we were already out of time.

200
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
We were surprised, too, but Gifun was so excited.

201
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
He's aiming for the next attack squad leader.

202
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You're serious.

203
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
How's Choru?

204
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
He's aiming for the leader, too, right?

205
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I don't think he's a bad guy.

206
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
That's what everyone says.

207
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
No, we're fine.

208
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
We can go to the Hunter's Guild, the Backo Guild, and the Ote Guild.

209
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I see.

210
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
There are many bad rumors in the world.

211
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Bad rumors?

212
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
They say that the attack squad is highly defensive.

213
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Halt! He's dead!

214
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
What's going on?

215
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Why did you forget?

216
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The world of the weak and the weak.

217
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And the world of the violence and betrayal.

218
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Why?

219
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Why?

220
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Why?

221
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Why?

222
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Why?

223
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I see.

224
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You were angry.

225
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The hero, the Manjin, the Sackaku...

226
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The enemy?

227
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The enemy is the one who's forcing me to kill.

228
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The enemy is the one who's forcing me to kill.

229
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm not a good guy.

230
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I need a system.

231
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
What?

232
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
A strong me.

233
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Brother, thank goodness.

234
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You're still alive.

235
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I see.

236
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Use my system.

237
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Use my system.

238
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Hey, Gyuhan, don't go out.

239
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I forgot.

240
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
The place is where the weak take away the weak.

241
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You know that, don't you?

242
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The human is the worst weapon.

243
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Then you two have the same determination.

244
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What?

245
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
If you're also a traitor,

246
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
you should have the determination to be paid.

247
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's gone.

248
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Donsok, I'll do it.

249
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Hey, brother, you don't seem to be able to make any progress.

250
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You're prepared to be paid.

251
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
What can you do when you're alive?

252
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The human is the worst weapon.

253
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
The one.

254
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Jun!

255
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You're kidding me?

256
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
When did he get the weapon?

257
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Where did he hide it?

258
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Even if it's a lie, Jun is a DQ.

259
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Why is he a EQ?

260
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I killed the human.

261
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I killed the human...

262
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I killed the human because I wanted to order the system.

263
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I killed the human now.

264
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
But if I don't kill him, I'll die.

265
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I can't take him anymore.

266
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
If only the police survive!

267
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Damn you!

268
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Why is the EQ moving?

269
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You bastard!

270
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Jun!

271
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Yes, sir!

272
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Damn you!

273
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
He's strong.

274
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I feel like he's getting stronger when he fights with the boss of the dungeon.

275
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
He's the one who killed all of us in an instant.

276
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
He's the one who's been trying to hide his true power.

277
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You defeated the boss too!

278
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
But even if we're the same kind of people, I'm different from them!

279
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Jun!

280
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
He's a monster, but he's the one who's been fighting the boss and the five hunters.

281
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So he's not going to be able to do anything.

282
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
His skills are the special ability of the speed and the power of the bullets.

283
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
But my body is not weak by using the skill of the force.

284
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Stun the bullets!

285
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Fan-san, you're strong.

286
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
But I'll tell you one thing that's unfortunate.

287
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm...

288
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm not going to be able to fight him.

289
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
What's going on?

290
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
He's... he's attacking me on the ground.

291
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
He's not going to be able to fight the boss.

292
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Wait! Don't kill him!

293
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Don't let him get away!

294
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
If he's going to come, I'll kill him!

295
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'll kill him!

296
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'll kill him!

297
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'll kill him!

298
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You want to kill him?

299
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I got it!

300
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Then I'll pay you back!

301
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Sand...

302
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Sand is going to help you kill him.

303
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Stop it!

304
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Do you think you can do this?

305
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You said you can't get out of the dungeon.

306
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Didn't you say that?

307
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You!

308
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You're going to kill my brother!

309
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'll kill him!

310
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
The boss is dead, so I'll close the dungeon.

311
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Hurry up.

312
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The End

313
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
All the CQ hunters are dead, and the survivors are...

314
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Are there only DQ and EQ hunters?

315
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
That's right, but...

316
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You!

317
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Yes?

318
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That equipment is the super sword of the Maya.

319
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's just been sold out!

320
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Well...

321
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I can get a reward for this.

322
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Skill...

323
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I can reflect all the abilities.

324
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I see.

325
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
This equipment is very convincing.

326
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
This person defeated him by himself,

327
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
and the EQ hunter was hiding somewhere.

328
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Thank you for your hard work today.

329
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
The investigation is over.

330
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Um...

331
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Brother, you did a great job!

332
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Yes.

333
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Did something happen?

334
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
No.

335
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm glad I left the umbrella behind.

336
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
The End

337
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
The End

338
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
The End

339
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
The End
