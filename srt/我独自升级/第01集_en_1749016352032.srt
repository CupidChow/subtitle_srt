1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next day

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Happy Holidays

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The next day

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The next day

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The next day

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The next day

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The next day

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The next day

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The next day

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The next day

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The next day

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The next day

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The next day

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The next day

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
They're not here. They're in the Hunter.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Halt! Attack!

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
If I get shot, the war will be over!

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The next day

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What's that?

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
They can't beat us!

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Damn it.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I can't believe it.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The healing magic...

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Amazing.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
In a moment of injury...

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Watch out!

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Ryugu, get out of here!

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Ryugu!

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yes!

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Esküter!

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Eskü Hunter is here!

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You're too quick, Ryugu.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm sorry. I wanted to save you a lot.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Besides, I believe that you two will protect us.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Come on.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Boss, it seems that Dewa isn't here.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
He's the leader of this village.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Ryugu, I'm counting on you.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Leave it to me, Mr. Yohan.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's go, Unsa!

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Roger!

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Go!

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Go!

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Are you stupid?

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You don't seem to be a leader.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Interesting.

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It seems that we made it.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Well, let's start this too.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
President Chie, anytime!

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Go!

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Attack, start!

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,000
A few years ago, a passage that was suddenly called the Gate was made known to the world.

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The gate was full of monsters and monsters that were not used by normal weapons.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:20,000
They were called Hunter, which made them able to fight monsters that were not used by normal weapons.

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Hunter was ranked in the SQ, AQ, BQ, CQ, DQ, and EQ that were used in the army.

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:40,000
However, no matter how hard the person tries to awaken, his ability will never grow.

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Good luck with today's raid.

60
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Thank you.

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Hey, Kim!

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh, it's a big one.

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Huh?

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What's wrong with you, Paksa?

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I told you I was sorry about Hunter.

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm sure you two have a dream.

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yeah, if you're good at raids, you can earn a lot.

68
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But I'm worried.

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm pretty sure you're not feeling well because you're wearing a white shirt.

70
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You're just weak.

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Huh?

72
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's Son!

73
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Son, come on.

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's cold. Good work.

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Thank you for today.

76
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Hey, Son!

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Did you eat the meat properly?

78
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yes, I ate it properly.

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Who's that?

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Is he strong?

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I've been greeting everyone.

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's the opposite.

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
After Paksa quit, he came in, but he's a weak person.

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
A weak person?

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Not a weak person.

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yeah, he's a weak person because he's injured at the EQ gate.

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
He's the weakest among the hunters.

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The weakest? That's all?

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So I think the raid he called was a low-level raid.

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I see.

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'll be in trouble if I hear it.

92
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'll explain it as soon as possible.

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I heard everything.

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I can't say it's true, but...

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
No, Chin. You're getting hurt again.

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Juhi, you're back together again.

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What's wrong with your face?

98
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Well, it's always like that.

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Please be careful.

100
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Oh, you're not even in the entrance.

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I was the only one who got injured at the EQ gate.

102
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Then, the hero...

103
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Other people had a high rank, so I didn't call the hero from the beginning.

104
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What's that? It's terrible that we're all fine.

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's okay. I'm just too weak.

106
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Juhi knows it very well.

107
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm used to it now.

108
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It seems like he's already in the inside.

109
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Let's go.

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm going to lead the raid with a strong spirit.

111
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm Son Chiyoru.

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Thank you for your help.

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Well, of course.

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Son is the most powerful in this raid.

115
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I can leave it to you without any worries.

116
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Thank you for your help, Son.

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Are you ready?

118
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Let's send it.

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Son.

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We're trying not to hurt you behind us.

121
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yes.

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Let's do our best.

123
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The knife that only has a little magic power.

124
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I was full of money to buy this, but it's better than nothing.

125
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'll do it today.

126
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'll do it today.

127
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Thank you for your hard work, Chief Gao.

128
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
How was the conversation with the government?

129
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
They always say the same thing.

130
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's hard to make a dungeon break.

131
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But we need a stable supply of weapons from the dungeon.

132
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Their demands are not wrong.

133
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
We hunters sell weapons that can be taken by the dungeon and make them our slaves.

134
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The final battle from the defeated monster.

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
This magic stone will be money.

136
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I did it.

137
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Finally, the first one.

138
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Jin!

139
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Jin!

140
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Jin!

141
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Lower your gun!

142
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Lower your gun!

143
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'll go to the next monster.

144
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'll go to the dungeon.

145
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yes!

146
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's all right now.

147
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'll fix it.

148
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The magic stone from the rank-up monster.

149
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It can be used to defeat monsters and make them stronger.

150
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It can be used to destroy the dungeon.

151
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It can be used to destroy the dungeon.

152
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But it's less effective than magic.

153
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
But the way to get the government...

154
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's a new energy source.

155
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's safer than the original power.

156
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's more efficient than the original power.

157
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's more efficient than the water power, wind power, and heat.

158
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's not as powerful as firepower.

159
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's a reasonable clean energy.

160
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
The government is also pursuing a new method of power by the magic stone and the magic stone.

161
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's a new method of power by the magic stone and the magic stone.

162
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That's why the role of a hunter is so important.

163
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I did it!

164
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I defeated the dungeon monster!

165
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I did it!

166
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Jinne, you're not just a hunter, are you?

167
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
If you keep doing this, you'll be really fat.

168
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You're not just hungry, but you're also hurting your body.

169
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm not saying I want you to apologize!

171
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm worried!

172
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Did you guys get the money back?

173
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I think we did.

174
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
There's not enough money for the magic stone.

175
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
There's not enough money for the magic stone.

176
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Did I end it?

177
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I got this one of the magic stones I got.

178
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm dead, but I can't get it.

179
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Hey!

180
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Come over here!

181
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The cave?

182
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's close.

183
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's been going on for a long time.

184
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
20 dungeons?

185
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I heard about it.

186
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I defeated the dungeon boss, but there's no way to close the dungeon.

187
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I thought it was strange.

188
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So you mean...

189
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yeah.

190
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
There's still something inside.

191
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Everyone, listen to me.

192
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
If this kind of emergency happens,

193
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
it will be a matter of time for the Hunter Association to decide.

194
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Wait a minute, Son.

195
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Do you mean that the guy who comes later will bring you something delicious?

196
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's the same DQ dungeon, so there's no problem.

197
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
There weren't many people who could be born with two eyes.

198
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You can use it for a while.

199
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
No?

200
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I understand your feelings.

201
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But it's also true that you can't get away with danger.

202
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Let's get some more blood.

203
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'll go first.

204
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm against it.

205
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Let's see.

206
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Me too.

207
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Let's stop.

208
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'll go.

209
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm sorry, but I don't want to go.

210
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
This is the third and sixth, the other six.

211
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Son is the only one left.

212
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What do you do?

213
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I...

214
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I know 100 dungeons are dangerous for me.

215
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But I'm the only one who can work in the family after my father passed away.

216
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I have my mother's treatment, and my sister who has been in college.

217
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I have money.

218
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm going.

219
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Please touch the black water bottle with one hand.

220
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Next person, please.

221
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You're CQ, right?

222
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Please come to my clinic.

223
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Our contract conditions are not here.

224
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The condition of the road is here.

225
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yes, I was able to install a contract from CQ alone.

226
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's going well now, President Chie.

227
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
That's great.

228
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Please call the person who is trying to protect you.

229
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I don't think the person who surpasses our Chai people will appear soon.

230
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Someone, stop it!

231
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You bastard!

232
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You bastard! You're being kicked!

233
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You bastard! You're being kicked!

234
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Um...

235
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Yes?

236
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Thank you very much!

237
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Thank you very much!

238
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Are you CQ Hunter?

239
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Wow!

240
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Wow!

241
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Wow!

242
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What is this?

243
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Please let me go.

244
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Wow!

245
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
How long did you walk into the cave?

246
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
About 40 minutes.

247
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
After one hour, the gate will be closed, so there's 20 minutes to go.

248
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Um...

249
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm sorry.

250
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What is it?

251
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I went to look for the boss because I was involved.

252
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm fine, so don't worry about it.

253
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Are you really okay?

254
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm really okay.

255
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
There's no way!

256
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Did you forget?

257
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Jin, I was a little bit higher just now, and I was dead.

258
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I was dead, and I was just dead.

259
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm not shocked!

260
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You hit me with your head, right?

261
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
That's right!

262
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm sorry.

264
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm really sorry.

265
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm really sorry.

266
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm really sorry.

267
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm really sorry.

268
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm really sorry.

269
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Are you really going to reflect on yourself?

270
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yes.

271
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So, I might be a nuisance to the boss next time.

272
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
What?

273
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You don't want to go to dinner with me?

274
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
No way!

275
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm here!

276
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's the boss's room!

277
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
There's a door, and it's still rare.

278
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It looks like something's wrong.

279
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm going.

280
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Can you come here and go home?

281
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Yes, I'll go too.

282
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'll go first with all the teams.

283
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You've decided that, right?

284
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Son Li.

285
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yes, that's right.

286
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Dear new students,

287
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
the Hunter Association is at your disposal.

288
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Among you,

289
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
there are some who will become hunters

290
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
and some who will not be able to choose the path.

291
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
After the gate was created,

292
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
there are still many things that are unknown in the dungeon.

293
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Hunters are the jobs of life.

294
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Even if you get used to the raid,

295
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
you can't avoid it.

296
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You can't think about it.

297
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You can't do it.

298
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
There's only one thing you can do to survive.

299
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Stay in the inn.

300
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Oh, it's on fire.

301
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
There's a lot of atmosphere.

302
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's the first time I've seen such a dungeon.

303
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
What is this place?

304
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It seems to be quite old.

305
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
There's also a school.

306
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Oh.

307
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
This is just a big one.

308
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It's really big.

309
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What is it?

310
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's kind of a weapon.

311
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But there's no monster.

312
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's a monster.

313
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It's a monster.

314
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's a monster.

315
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's a monster.

316
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's a monster.

317
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's a monster.

318
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But there's no monster.

319
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
There's definitely not a single monster.

320
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What? A witch?

321
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Son, there's something written here.

322
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Is it an ancient word?

323
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Who is it?

324
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The first thing that occurred in the Carthenon temple is to guard the god.

325
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
The second thing is to guard the god.

326
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
The third thing is to trust the god.

327
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
That big stone statue moved.

328
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I was watching us.

329
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I didn't expect that.

330
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You can't live.

331
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Hey, the door is closed.

332
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Why?

333
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I didn't expect that we were locked in.

334
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
That's why I didn't want to.

335
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm going to get in trouble.

336
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I shouldn't have come from the beginning.

337
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm going to get you all.

338
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Arba.

339
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Get out of here.

340
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Damn it.

341
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It moved.

342
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I didn't expect that we would fight again.

343
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
The person who was killed is a DQ.

344
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's definitely stronger than the DQ.

345
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But at that moment...

346
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's strange.

347
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
This is a DQ dungeon.

348
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I've never heard of such a monster.

349
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
What's the meaning of this?

350
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I can't believe it.

351
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I've been attacked by the DQ many times.

352
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I was attacked by the first raid in my life.

353
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I was attacked by the DQ monster and I was locked in for a few weeks.

354
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I was locked in for a few days and I was forced to do so.

355
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
No matter how low the rank is, it's always a mistake for me.

356
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Hunters are usually armed with magic sticks and get stronger monsters.

357
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
They are used to get more rewards.

358
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But I have to use the knife of a cheap person.

359
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
If I break it, I can't stand up.

360
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I can't wear these shoes anymore.

361
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And then one day...

362
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
One more day...

363
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I've been working hard to survive the days of being beaten up.

364
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I've been working hard to survive the days of being beaten up.

365
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Is that why I know?

366
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Get out of here!

367
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Run away!

368
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Are you kidding me?!

369
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
What's happening?!

370
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm going to die!

371
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Where's the princess?

372
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm scared.

373
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
What's going on?

374
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
How could this happen?

375
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
She was locked in for a few days and she couldn't escape.

376
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Die...

377
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
She's going to be killed!

378
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm going to die!

379
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm going to die!

380
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Get out of here!

381
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Run away!

382
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Run away!

383
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Run away!

384
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Run away!

385
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Run away!
