1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,780
Accept the treaty

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,020
Version F

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,200
Maybe, this ship will fix this מח

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,380
With this medicine, I may get my mom's Hartree

5
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:32,380
To make the life of the dead, we need three items.

6
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:37,380
We don't have any yet, but we know where they are.

7
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,380
But it's a little bit of a threat to the fact that we're going to destroy that door with our current strength.

8
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,380
Let's level up a little more.

9
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,380
Let's make it stronger.

10
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,380
Can you remember to look for yet?

11
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,380
Little boy who lost a bet.

12
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,380
Now I'm breaking off the kills.

13
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,380
I got to pay the bills, don't we need three?

14
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,380
We pray for what we get.

15
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,380
Is your way to hit me sad?

16
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,380
Giving warning just from lack of the who I've got level.

17
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,380
Feeling, feeling, all those things are yet.

18
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,380
There's no really, ceiling.

19
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,380
Let's get it.

20
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:31,380
So give it yourself, give it yourself a shot.

21
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,380
It's important, so no what you gonna get.

22
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,380
It's very important, so no, give it your best shot.

23
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,380
Go it, it's okay.

24
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,380
You gotta go it, it's okay.

25
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,380
Just go it, it's okay.

26
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,380
Get up, reach out for it.

27
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,380
Go it, it's okay.

28
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,380
You gotta go it, it's okay.

29
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,380
Just go it, try to get your chance.

30
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,380
Get it, get up, get on to it.

31
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,380
Game over but they give it more than she calls.

32
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,380
Little kid in the gutter with the body knows.

33
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,380
Undercover body doesn't even beat rules.

34
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,380
The head lines, the head runs.

35
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,380
Soul shot body hasn't got an echo.

36
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,380
Local boy and he came in from a zero.

37
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,380
Everybody with him butch, my son power grows and grows.

38
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,380
Let's get it.

39
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,380
You're gonna take it?

40
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,380
The situation has changed.

41
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,380
You can take the CQ raid you proposed.

42
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,380
But there's one condition.

43
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,380
Come in, tell me what it is.

44
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,380
You and I, go together.

45
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:47,380
You and I, go together to clear the CQ dungeon?

46
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,380
That's right.

47
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:56,380
But, it's necessary for eight members to enter the CQ gate.

48
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,380
We're gonna use the number combination.

49
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,380
The same as the way we used the fandom.

50
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,380
But, isn't it too dangerous?

51
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,380
We need to think about it.

52
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,380
If we're safe, we can finish the raid in the 19th floor with the injured.

53
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,380
The 19th floor is a continuous attack.

54
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,380
We need to see the father's true power.

55
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,380
I see.

56
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,380
Let's do that, brother.

57
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,380
I won't let the members and the gate go.

58
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,380
Let's go.

59
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,380
Let's go.

60
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,380
So, what do you want?

61
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,380
I'm surprised.

62
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,380
You're a great SQ hunter.

63
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,380
You were looking at the timing of the raid.

64
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,380
Excuse me for the training.

65
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,380
I'm like this.

66
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,380
The number of years the gate has been open.

67
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,380
The world has changed.

68
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,380
Now, the infras, economy, media, and politics...

69
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,380
...are all connected to the dungeon.

70
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,380
The infras that are the basis for the lives of the people...

71
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,380
...have become useless without the dungeon's resources.

72
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,380
The only way to bring back the important resources...

73
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:08,380
...to this world is the existence of the hunters.

74
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,380
And the management of the hunters...

75
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,380
...is the Hunter Association as a public organization.

76
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,380
The Hunter Association is a registered hunter's rank,

77
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,380
registration, and management.

78
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,380
The gate's processing process is over.

79
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,380
The dungeon break is also on the rise.

80
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,380
But the association is not as public as it is.

81
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,380
To actually bring this society back...

82
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,380
...the majority of the dungeon resources...

83
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,380
...are the hunters' group.

84
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,380
The guild has the advantage of the dungeon resources...

85
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,380
...and has a huge profit.

86
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,380
The hunters' guild, the hundred guilds...

87
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,380
...the Shinnigami guild, the Myojo guild...

88
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,380
...the five main guilds of the Kishidan guild...

89
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,380
...are the big brothers.

90
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,380
They are almost exclusive to their profits.

91
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,380
It's not like they're just looking at the situation.

92
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,380
It's not like they're just looking at the situation.

93
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,380
It's not like they're just looking at the situation.

94
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,380
It's not like they're just looking at the situation.

95
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,380
We, who have supported the development of the country,

96
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,380
have to take responsibility for this.

97
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,380
The guild's promotion is a necessary step forward.

98
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,380
Yes.

99
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,380
Even so, it's a big risk to pull out the SQ Hunter...

100
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,380
...and cooperate with the two of them.

101
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,380
But, for me right now...

102
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,380
She has the audacity to ignore the lack of the summer cottage?

103
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:07,380
SQ was missed before, so she can't rest.

104
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,380
The days of SQ shop is on the catastrophe.

105
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:16,020
I never thought the key to the Devil While I was going to have a heartоны-themed item.

106
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,160
But still.

107
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:25,240
Even a regular определ box might be a possibility for you to find something like the key to the pregnant woman last instance, peace!

108
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,440
Sh mountain

109
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,000
What?

110
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,340
Oh well.

111
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:47,920
And a well-informed team that came toいて

112
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,820
Pourized

113
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,820
Penalty zone!

114
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,820
I'll go to the other side over there.

115
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,820
No, it might be easier than that time to escape.

116
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,820
But if I defeat him,

117
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,820
I won't be able to enter the experience zone.

118
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,820
The summoning of the DQ gate.

119
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,820
The formation of the attack team in the Hunter's world.

120
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,820
I can't fight alone if I'm not wrong.

121
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,820
Do you mind?

122
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,820
I wonder if I can't do it.

123
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,820
I want to know.

124
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,820
I can't defeat the boss.

125
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
I can't win yet.

126
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,820
But I'm sorry.

127
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,820
I wanted to fight with the boss of the full power.

128
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
That's it again.

129
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,820
It's been a few months since I've been standing.

130
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,820
A level-up summoner?

131
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,820
The DQ Hunter has a lot of strong summoning.

132
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,820
The boss really doesn't allow me to retire?

133
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
Retire?

134
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,820
The DQ Hunter

135
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,820
I'm sure it's a trap that lost its shoulder.

136
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,820
It might be only a trap.

137
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,820
No, that's not the case.

138
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,820
But the arm has lost its shoulder.

139
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:30,820
It's a long life, but I want to use it to contribute to the world.

140
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,820
The next raid is decided.

141
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
Hey, you.

142
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,820
Can't you stop the Hunter's job?

143
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
That's the story again.

144
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,820
It's too dangerous.

145
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,820
The raid was too dangerous before.

146
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,820
You came running away from the dangerous place, right?

147
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,820
Dad, dad.

148
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,820
But I'm going to have a kindergarten next year,

149
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,820
and I'm going to have a junior high school.

150
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,820
I'll have money.

151
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,820
I see.

152
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,820
It's okay.

153
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,820
The DQ Hunter doesn't call us dangerous men.

154
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,820
It's just that the previous one was special.

155
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,820
I know.

156
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,820
I'm sorry for saying that.

157
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,820
Don't worry.

158
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
Take care.

159
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
I love you.

160
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,820
Dad.

161
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,820
What?

162
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
Is dad strong?

163
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
Of course.

164
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,820
Dad can beat the scary monster.

165
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,820
Dad.

166
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,820
You did a great job.

167
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,820
What's going on?

168
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
It's an interview.

169
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,820
I'm sorry for the trouble.

170
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,820
I've found out.

171
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
It was a pretty good thing.

172
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,820
I was very upset.

173
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
Don't say that.

174
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,820
It's the first time I've come to you.

175
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,820
But I'm here to show you my true form and my true personality

176
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:18,820
about the DQ Hunter.

177
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,820
I'm a little bit of an enemy.

178
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,820
You're a little bit of a coward.

179
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,820
Fine.

180
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,820
D, why are you here?

181
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,820
You don't have to call me to ask me for help.

182
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:39,820
I heard that you should be more cooperative.

183
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,820
Your friend is working on the guild.

184
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,820
I know.

185
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,820
It seems like you're working on it.

186
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,820
I've heard rumors about you.

187
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,820
I don't think I know that.

188
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,820
You knew that much.

189
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,820
I'll tell you the truth.

190
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,820
I'll ask you again.

191
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,820
What's the problem?

192
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,820
You haven't contacted me lately.

193
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
Have you been doing it properly?

194
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,820
Yes.

195
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,820
What about your job?

196
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,820
Yes.

197
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,820
Well...

198
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,820
You've been so scared.

199
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,820
So you're the only one who's been suffering.

200
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,820
The DQ Hunter?

201
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,820
I'll ask other people for help.

202
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,820
But you're the only one who's been waiting for you.

203
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,820
You came home to help me.

204
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,820
Dad is worried about you.

205
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,820
I told you to leave!

206
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,820
I can decide on my own.

207
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,820
Leave me alone!

208
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,820
What are you doing?

209
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,820
I'm sorry.

210
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,820
I'm sorry.

211
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,820
But...

212
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,820
I'll try harder.

213
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,820
He's not in the mood to talk to me.

214
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,820
Excuse me.

215
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,820
What happened?

216
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,820
The DQ Hunter.

217
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:47,020
A scout from the training team just came to report that.

218
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,820
Oh?

219
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:55,220
I'll give you a new guild, so please come as a guild master.

220
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:01,020
You said you'd refuse to report.

221
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,820
Yes, I refused at that point.

222
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,220
I'm relieved. Thank you.

223
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:13,620
No, by the way, it seems like the head of the department was looking at me before I came.

224
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,620
What were you talking about?

225
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:28,620
What do you think about Jeju Island?

226
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,620
Jeju Island? What do you mean?

227
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,420
After the third raid, the island was unable to stand.

228
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,620
Now, it's been under investigation from a regular source.

229
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,820
In the end, it's just a matter of time before the first ghost is told.

230
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:49,620
People are trying to forget about the island with fear.

231
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,620
But that's not possible.

232
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,820
But...

233
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,420
No matter how much the gate exists,

234
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,620
even if it's taken away by the human army,

235
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,620
I've never forgotten what happened there.

236
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:10,620
I'll continue to work on that island in the future that I'm not far from here.

237
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,820
In order to do that, I'll have to be separated from you.

238
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:20,220
We need to strengthen our forces and make friends.

239
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,620
For the sake of the Shuzueya Shrine.

240
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,620
You have one too, right?

241
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,420
The one who forgot about that island.

242
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,220
The destiny...

243
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,420
Byung.

244
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,020
Please kill them.

245
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,620
Kill them.

246
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,020
I'm coming.

247
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,220
You're working again after a break?

248
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,420
You've been working a lot lately.

249
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,620
Well...

250
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:14,820
I used to go to the gate and get hurt and take a break.

251
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,620
Is that why you're here?

252
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,820
Maybe.

253
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,020
I've been able to make sure that I can make a safe return.

254
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,620
Isn't that good?

255
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,820
Well, I guess so.

256
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,020
And... where's your luggage?

257
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,620
It's okay. I'll be right back.

258
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,620
Wait!

259
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,420
I'm not going to the convenience store.

260
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,420
My sword, which I couldn't awaken to the power of physical form,

261
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,620
doesn't belong to the monster.

262
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,820
The sword I've been working on for decades

263
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,020
is useless in the dungeon.

264
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,220
The sword I'm using as a magic hunter

265
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,420
and I've been able to make a revolution.

266
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,620
And I'm sure there's a reason for that.

267
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,620
What?

268
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,820
You're...?

269
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,020
Son?

270
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,220
I didn't think you'd be here.

271
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,420
It's been a while.

272
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,620
You're here again?

273
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:16,820
And where did that young man who couldn't be saved go?

274
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,020
He's been here for a few months.

275
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,220
And...

276
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,420
What happened to your leg?

277
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,620
I was back when I woke up from the hospital.

278
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,620
I see.

279
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:35,820
Maybe there was a high-class healer in the hunter who came to the dungeon after that.

280
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,020
I'm glad you're still recovering.

281
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,220
Thank you.

282
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,420
But, Son...

283
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,620
I've been sick for too long.

284
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,820
But it's okay.

285
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:57,020
I've heard that you're safe, but I'm glad you're back.

286
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,020
Why are you here, Son?

287
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,220
I was told by the church.

288
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,420
I heard you're a DQ.

289
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,620
Son?

290
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,820
What a coincidence.

291
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:23,020
That day's members were together.

292
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,020
Jeanne?

293
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,220
Jufi?

294
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,420
And Kim and Kansan.

295
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,620
It's impossible.

296
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:39,820
We were running away from that place by taking Son to the dungeon.

297
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:46,020
Kim, who had a sword on him, decided not to let us meet again.

298
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:51,220
But then, the five of them who survived that attack gathered.

299
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,620
Then...

300
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,820
Jin, you're right.

301
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,020
You're so wrong.

302
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,220
Yes, it's been a while.

303
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,420
My leg is getting really long.

304
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,620
I can't believe I'm in front of you.

305
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,820
In front of you?

306
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:17,820
Wow, there's a young woman here.

307
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:23,820
What? Are you able to do that with your brother?

308
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,020
We're...

309
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,220
Be quiet.

310
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,420
It's not a coincidence.

311
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:39,420
Then, we'll explain to the hunters.

312
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,620
What's this?

313
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,820
It's a big revenge for the people who are here today.

314
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,820
A big revenge for the people?

315
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,020
Fight with the criminals?

316
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:54,220
The hunters who committed the crime are on the brink of a crime, so they're not in danger.

317
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,420
The hunters are not enough for this area.

318
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,620
Please understand.

319
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,820
What do you mean?

320
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:06,020
This time, Kansika, the Kansika of the Hunter Association, will be here.

321
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:13,220
He's a B-class, so if he's in the outside world, it's good to have three C-class survivors.

322
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,620
So, please rest assured.

323
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,820
I'm a little worried.

324
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:35,440
Juhi, please send him to the

325
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,440
We're not in the same group, but we're in this together.

326
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,640
Shut up. You're the B-class.

327
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,840
If you keep your mouth shut, you'll know what will happen.

328
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,840
I'm Kansika, the Kansika of the Hunter Association.

329
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,040
They're responsible for me, so please rest assured.

330
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,040
Who will be the leader today?

331
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,040
Son, do you mind if I be the leader?

332
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,240
Yes, of course.

333
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,040
Thank you for giving me the opportunity.

334
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,240
Son?

335
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,440
That day, seven of my people died because of me.

336
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,640
My responsibility was great, but six of you survived.

337
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,840
Please let me represent the other five of you.

338
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,040
I'm grateful for that.

339
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,040
Son, please raise your face.

340
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,040
Don't you mind if I be the leader?

341
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,040
Please do as you wish.

342
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,040
That's why I'm the leader of the dungeon.

343
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,240
I've made my decision. Let's go.

344
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,040
I'm going to the dungeon.

345
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,040
I'm going to the dungeon.

346
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,040
I'm the leader of the dungeon.

347
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,040
I'm going to the dungeon.
