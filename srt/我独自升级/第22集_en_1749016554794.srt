1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
"...成員,歡迎!"

2
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,100
Allот Blue Trees got lesser.

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,600
My task is to spot all our fightingrants

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,360
according to their actions and race.

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,920
Now then,

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,960
Phew!

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,180
Let's get started....

8
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,140
The third one is the

9
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:57,760
The

10
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,260
The

11
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:58,760
The

12
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,260
The

13
00:00:59,260 --> 00:00:59,760
The

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,260
The

15
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:00,760
The

16
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,260
The

17
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:01,760
The

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,260
The

19
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:02,760
The

20
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,260
The

21
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:03,760
The

22
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,260
The

23
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:04,760
The

24
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,260
The

25
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:05,760
The

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,260
The

27
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:06,760
The

28
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,260
The

29
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:07,760
The

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,260
The

31
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:08,760
The

32
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,260
The

33
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:09,760
The

34
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,260
The

35
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:10,760
The

36
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,260
The

37
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:11,760
The

38
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,260
The

39
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:12,760
The

40
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,260
The

41
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:13,760
The

42
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,260
The

43
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:14,760
The

44
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,260
The

45
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:15,760
The

46
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,260
The

47
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:16,760
The

48
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,260
The

49
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:17,760
The

50
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,260
The

51
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:18,760
The

52
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,260
The

53
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:19,760
The

54
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,260
The

55
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:20,760
The

56
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,260
The

57
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:21,760
The

58
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,260
The

59
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:22,760
The

60
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,260
The

61
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:23,760
The

62
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,260
The

63
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:24,760
The

64
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,260
The

65
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:25,760
The

66
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,660
The

67
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,660
The

68
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,420
The

69
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,260
The

70
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:29,500
The

71
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:29,900
The

72
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,660
The

73
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,320
The

74
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:31,520
The

75
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:31,720
The

76
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,620
The

77
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,560
The

78
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:33,620
The

79
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,220
The

80
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:34,960
The

81
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,260
The

82
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,700
The

83
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,620
The

84
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,460
The

85
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,500
The

86
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,040
The

87
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,800
The

88
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,260
The

89
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,760
Powerply rockin' you!

90
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,740
Yeah. I'm the channel.

91
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,480
力 avoidance

92
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:13,600
Freely okay?

93
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,760
sympathic

94
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,720
Health

95
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,240
Which strategy is more powerful than this?

96
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,760
It's too fast! I can't even get close!

97
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,760
I'm not better at long-range attacks!

98
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,760
Watch out! It's dangerous!

99
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,760
Get rid of them!

100
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,760
This is the first-class magic stone in the world, right, Captain?

101
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,960
Yes is. It seems we need enquiry from theをby thankslevers

102
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,760
There are some high-class hunters.

103
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:11,760
How could they actually trap theirashes?

104
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,760
It's no war with配置 and irradi concepts.

105
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,760
Damn it, I can't believe it.

106
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,760
My heart is beating so fast.

107
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,760
Maybe he's trying to fight us.

108
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,760
Is there any way to fight him?

109
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,760
If you choose me as your mentor, I'll answer you with pleasure.

110
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,760
I'll do my best.

111
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,760
I'll answer you with pleasure.

112
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,760
I'll do my best.

113
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,760
You're a monster.

114
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,760
I'm a brave and brave guy.

115
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,760
That's not true.

116
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,760
You're strong enough as a master.

117
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,760
I'm the winner.

118
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,760
I've been ordered to the ground.

119
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,760
This is the first time.

120
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,760
I'm the winner.

121
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,760
How long are you going to run?

122
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,760
I'm weaker than a car hunter.

123
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,760
I'm being scolded.

124
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,760
I can't read the next hand.

125
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,760
You're a monster.

126
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:35,760
If you fight like you're losing, you'll be able to understand the meaning of it.

127
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,760
I have to save the back hunter.

128
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,760
What was that?

129
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,760
Oh, no. I accidentally got a hand.

130
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,760
He's gone.

131
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,760
I don't know what to do with him.

132
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,760
You should stop him.

133
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,760
I'm going to hurt him.

134
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,760
He's fast.

135
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,760
This is bad.

136
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,760
You're using a warning.

137
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,760
I feel like you're overreacting.

138
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,760
What the hell?

139
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,760
You're so close to the dead spider.

140
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,760
Is that hunter really magical?

141
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,760
Yes, that's the way it is.

142
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,760
You have to check it yourself.

143
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,760
Car hunter, this is the end of the game.

144
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,760
The back hunter is out of the game.

145
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,760
Yes.

146
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,760
I was in a situation where I could win by putting out my full power.

147
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:09,760
I heard that the back hunter is trying to get the guild master to do something.

148
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,760
He's trying to get the body to do something.

149
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,760
I want to see my true power.

150
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,760
It's a good opportunity to try the power that the devil is trying to get.

151
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,760
You laughed in front of me.

152
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,760
The back hunter has been eliminated.

153
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,760
But there seems to be a condition.

154
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,760
Condition?

155
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,760
If you're going to use your full power, you'll be in trouble.

156
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,760
Interesting.

157
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,760
The fourth Jejudo Raid is approaching.

158
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,760
Our country is preparing for a full-scale battle with Japan and the cooperation relationship.

159
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,760
You? What about today's work?

160
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,760
I said yesterday that I was going to take a break.

161
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
I see.

162
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,760
You're doing your best, so I'll do my best for my job.

163
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,760
I'm sorry.

164
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,760
Hello.

165
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,760
I have a meeting with Jejudo Raid Shubihan.

166
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,760
What is it?

167
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,760
The tenth Jejudo Raid is in a big mess.

168
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,760
It's a fight with the five of us.

169
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,760
The battle in the AQ dungeon is in my eyes.

170
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,760
Is it okay for the SQ opponent?

171
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,760
Are you okay with the hunters coming closer today?

172
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,760
I can't go there because I'm chasing flowers in the battlefield.

173
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,760
Can I stop them?

174
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:46,760
The battle against the battle-based hunters should stop the magical barrier battle.

175
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,760
I'm also the same reason as the car hunter.

176
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,760
Don't you expect something strange?

177
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,760
If the Sun Hunter is able to grow as I expected,

178
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,760
Then let's start.

179
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,760
You're not doing well.

180
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:15,760
I'll tell you that the speed and movement are magical.

181
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,760
I'll cut your monster skin.

182
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,760
This person is definitely different from the other rescue.

183
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,760
But it's not as much as I expected.

184
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,760
You laughed again.

185
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,760
You're fast enough to see the attack.

186
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,760
You're doing well.

187
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,760
It's amazing that you can just attack that attack.

188
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,760
You're just not attacking.

189
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,760
Try to attack the opponent.

190
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,760
I'll kill you if you keep being chased.

191
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
I'm going to kill you.

192
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,760
I'll kill you with my own hands.

193
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,760
The Sun Hunter!

194
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,760
I lost one more step.

195
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,760
I was caught by my hands.

196
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
You're trying to fool me?

197
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,760
I don't know what you're talking about.

198
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,760
It's a game over if you catch your hands.

199
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,760
You shouldn't have let it end like this.

200
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,760
Hey, Goto-san, be serious.

201
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,760
If you keep hitting me, you two won't be able to get through.

202
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,760
This way?

203
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,760
Sun Hunter!

204
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,760
Goto-san!

205
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,760
Let's stop here.

206
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,760
No one can take responsibility for anything.

207
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,760
Please tell us the difference.

208
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,760
Yes.

209
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,760
Did you do something bad?

210
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,760
No.

211
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,760
It's a big deal that you fought with Goto and got hurt.

212
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,760
It's getting hot.

213
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,760
But I've found the power of all the people here.

214
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,760
I've been able to get five soldiers to join the team.

215
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,760
I'll share the information of the Raid later.

216
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,760
Then, please take care of our Guild Master.

217
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,760
Of course.

218
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,760
Chairman Gao.

219
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,760
What's wrong, Sun Hunter?

220
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,760
It's about the Jeju Island Raid.

221
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,760
Reiji, there seems to be a Hunter who can do it.

222
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,760
Still, he's lower than the Guild Master of the Bakken.

223
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,760
I wonder.

224
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,760
Which Hunter?

225
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,760
Son Jin. He's been a new member of the SQ.

226
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,760
That's strange.

227
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,760
There's no such name in the Raid's participation.

228
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,760
What?

229
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,760
Sun Hunter doesn't participate in the Jeju Island Raid.

230
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,760
He must have his own situation.

231
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,760
But...

232
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,760
He doesn't have the name of the Ryong.

233
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,760
But...

234
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,760
There's already 15 SQ Hunters here.

235
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,760
This time, it's for sure.

236
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,760
I'll win and show you.

237
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,760
I'm home.

238
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,760
Brother, you're late.

239
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,760
Welcome home, Jin.

240
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,760
I've been able to have a meal.

241
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,760
I'm home.

242
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,760
I need you, mother, who woke up in the New Year.

243
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,760
So I won't go to Jeju Island.

244
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,760
The time has come for the prey to come.

245
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,760
There's no food for the people of the kingdom.

246
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,760
I can't leave like this.

247
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,760
I have to leave this island.

248
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,760
I need a stronger child.

249
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,760
A strong man who can lead the people of the kingdom.

250
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,760
The King of the Island

251
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,760
Become stronger, my child.

252
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,760
The Arigata Monster has evolved at the speed of the threat.

253
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,760
It was on the ground at the Jeju Island.

254
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,760
This is the latest form of the new day.

255
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,760
It has a big wing on its back, like a human.

256
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,760
The Hunter Association has launched a big project to the latest Arigata Monster.

257
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,760
A monster has appeared.

258
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,760
SQ Hunter is the opponent.

259
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,760
It's dangerous, so stop it.

260
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,760
Why can't I join the Shubihan?

261
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,760
Because you're an EQ.

262
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,760
Oh, it's a big one.

263
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,760
I'm sorry.

264
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,760
It's finally tomorrow.

265
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,760
The Jeju Tourade will start.

266
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:29,760
The first fleet arrives at the destination point of the Jeju Tourade.

267
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,760
The second fleet arrives at the destination point.

268
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,760
The third fleet will soon enter the alert system.

269
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,760
The fourth fleet is currently on the move.

270
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,760
It will arrive at the destination point in 5 minutes.

271
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,760
Master, do you think we have the power to stop them?

272
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,760
I don't know what to do.

273
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,760
But we are the Shubihan who are placed in the Man-Gai-Chichi.

274
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,760
We should be grateful that we can't go to the main point.

275
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,760
Master, I will follow the Chon-Yun-Te for the rest of my life.

276
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,760
Su-Shia, please take care of this place.

277
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,760
It's a good idea to go out.

278
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,760
We can just go out here and watch.

279
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,760
There is a Man-Gai-Chichi.

280
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:17,760
And because you are the Vice-Master, I can leave safely.

281
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,760
Please be careful.

282
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,760
Yes.

283
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,760
Why are you putting Min-San in such a place?

284
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,760
If something happens, it will be a trouble.

285
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,760
Give me a hand.

286
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,760
Her message came in from the unit.

287
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,760
The real TenGan and Jejudo days Имary is completed.

288
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,760
Both mission to the implies team is in a hurry.

289
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,760
Oh...

290
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,760
What?

291
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,760
What's that?

292
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,760
Compared to the combat still like this.

293
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,760
Keep going.

294
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,760
Right.

295
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,760
And as for us.

296
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,760
It is said that future units of 24t realize potential...

297
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,940
Yes...

298
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:27,580
In this battle, many hunters actually held the

299
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,760
You're going to get killed if you keep it a secret, aren't you?

300
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,760
If you keep it a secret, you'll be killed!

301
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,760
Is this the center of the island?

302
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,760
This is Alpha.

303
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,760
Go to the camp.

304
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,760
Bravo. Aichi is complete.

305
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,760
Charlie. Aichi is complete.

306
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,760
Delta, come back anytime.

307
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,760
The island center.

308
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,760
Yes.

309
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,760
It's a 10-minute broadcast on the inside of the car,

310
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,760
but as a cameraman at the Hunter's Department,

311
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,760
I'll make sure to tell you about this battle.

312
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,760
Hunter, you're the one who should protect it.

313
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,760
It's a fierce battle. Are you okay?

314
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,760
Don't worry.

315
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,760
It looks like this, and it's a good place to rest.

316
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,760
I'm used to dangerous shooting.

317
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,760
What's that?

318
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:28,760
This is the last time we can see a normal person look like an SQ Raid.

319
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,760
No, we have to do it.

320
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,760
We'll make it work this time.

321
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,760
If we fail this time, our country will disappear from the map.

322
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,760
This country is looking for heroes.

323
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,760
We've prepared all the attack and fire operations.

324
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,760
Okay, then let's start the fourth Jujutsu Raid.

325
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,760
The camp is open.

326
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,760
Roger.

327
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,760
It seems that the camp has started shooting.

328
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,760
It's a very powerful force.

329
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,760
They've moved, too.

330
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,760
Hey, hey, they're coming this way.

331
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,760
Open the hatch.

332
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,760
I'll help you.

333
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,760
That's amazing.

334
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,760
There are many of them.

335
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,760
Let's go and help them out.

336
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,760
We've finally reached the end.

337
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,760
This land again.

338
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,760
That's the last weapon. I'm counting on you.

339
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,760
I'm counting on you.

340
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,760
Then let's get going.

341
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,760
It takes about an hour to get a Japanese hunter to pull the trigger.

342
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,760
In other words, we have to defeat the Jouari.

343
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,760
Are you ready?

344
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,760
We can do it.

345
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,760
Let's go.

346
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,760
This is the start of the operation.

347
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,760
The defense power is activated.

348
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,760
The defense power is activated.

349
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,760
Now we can't catch the Jou's rescue signal.

350
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,760
It's a nightmare. I'll die if I'm alive.

351
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:38,760
It's faster for us to kill them than for them to defeat the Jou.

352
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,760
It's possible.

353
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,760
They're playing over there. They're like children.

354
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,760
Did you see that?

355
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,760
Cheta, you're that guy, right?

356
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,760
What if we beat him?

357
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,760
It's cold and hot.

358
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,760
I've covered you. Let's move on while the Jou is working.

359
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,760
No matter what, how many holes are there?

360
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,760
How can we find a hole that can reach the Jou?

361
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,760
What are you doing? It's dangerous.

362
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,760
We don't have time to check each hole.

363
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,760
We should find a hole that's deep.

364
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,760
It looks like over there.

365
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,760
The daily quest is over.

366
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,760
No one's walking today.

367
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:41,760
The SK hunters who participated in this raid are all strong.

368
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,760
If they're there, we can clear them.

369
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,760
Even if I'm not there.

370
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,760
Are there really Jou here?

371
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,760
They ran away because they saw them.

372
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,760
This is the island. We can't escape anywhere.

373
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,760
Everyone, come here.

374
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,760
What a mess.

375
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,760
The Jou's room should be close by.

376
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,760
Look.

377
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,760
That egg.

378
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,760
No way.

379
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,760
That egg.

380
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
The size is strange.

381
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,760
We're going to defeat the Jou.

382
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,760
Don't worry about anything else.

383
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,760
But it's not impossible.

384
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,760
We're going to defeat the Jou.

385
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,760
If the egg that was born from that size exists.

386
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,760
Damn it.

387
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,760
They're so annoying.

388
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,760
We're going to defeat the Jou.

389
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,760
Let's fix it.

390
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,760
It's not possible.

391
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,760
Shimizu, don't be a fool.

392
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,760
We need to fix it.

393
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,760
We don't need money this time.

394
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,760
What?

395
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,760
We need to fix it.

396
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,760
We need to fix it.

397
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,760
We need to fix it.

398
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,760
They're here again.

399
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,760
No way.

400
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
What's going on?

401
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,760
The Jou's room should be close by.

402
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,760
The egg that was born from that size exists.

403
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,760
We're going to defeat the Jou.

404
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,760
Let's fix it.

405
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,760
We're going to defeat the Jou.

406
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,760
Let's fix it.

407
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,760
We're going to defeat the Jou.

408
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,760
Let's fix it.

409
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,760
We're going to defeat the Jou.

410
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,760
Let's fix it.

411
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,760
We're going to defeat the Jou.

412
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,760
Let's fix it.

413
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,760
We're going to defeat the Jou.

414
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,760
Goodbye my weakness like my role.

415
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,760
No one can touch me.

416
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,760
Look at my heart.

417
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:13,760
We're gonna be the one.

418
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,760
Hello my friend.

419
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,760
Let's write down words.

420
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,760
It's getting old.

421
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,760
Let's give it a second.

422
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,760
Give me your hand.

423
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,760
Say that yes again.

424
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,760
Say that yes again.
