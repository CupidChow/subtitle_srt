1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:20,440
ор

2
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,440
What are these guys?

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,440
Oh, they didn't show up in the shrine?

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,440
I think they're one of my skills.

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,440
Is it possible to use these skills?

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,440
It's hard to explain, but...

7
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,440
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can use these skills.

8
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,440
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can use these skills.

9
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,440
Bro...

10
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,440
Please let me pick up the magic stone.

11
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,440
Thank you very much.

12
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,440
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can use these skills.

13
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,440
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can use these skills.

14
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,440
Oh, no!

15
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,440
Jesus!

16
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,440
Hey, don't make a sound.

17
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,440
Don't worry, I just made everyone faint.

18
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:41,440
I don't have to tell you, but I'm also very good at English.

19
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,440
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can use these skills.

20
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,440
I'm human. I want to go home.

21
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,440
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can use these skills.

22
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,440
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can use these skills.

23
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,440
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can use these skills.

24
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,440
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can use these skills.

25
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,440
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can use these skills.

26
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,440
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can use these skills.

27
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,440
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can use these skills.

28
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,440
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can use these skills.

29
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,440
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can use these skills.

30
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,440
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can use these skills.

31
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,440
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can use these skills.

32
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,440
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can use these skills.

33
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,440
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can use these skills.

34
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,440
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can use these skills.

35
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,440
Goodbye!

36
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,440
I'll just have to survive.

37
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,440
With time, I'm getting around this high.

38
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,440
This day is so bad.

39
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,440
I'll never go our way.

40
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,440
Goodbye.

41
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,440
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,440
This is the 19th time you've cleared your contract.

43
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,440
Yes. It's all thanks to you that I was able to finish the mission safely.

44
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,440
What are you going to do next?

45
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,440
First, I'll take the training of the Guild Master in the church.

46
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,440
I'm going to take that and try to negotiate with my father.

47
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,440
I see.

48
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,440
What are you going to do about your brother?

49
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,440
I don't think I'll be able to contact him for a while.

50
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,440
I have something to tell you.

51
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,440
Oh?

52
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,440
What is it?

53
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,440
Brother, I'm sorry to bother you.

54
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,440
But be honest with me.

55
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,440
I don't think you're going to bother me anymore.

56
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,440
Are you already drunk?

57
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,440
I have one brother who has 10 left.

58
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,440
He doesn't like me.

59
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,440
He doesn't like me doing something in the church.

60
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,440
And he doesn't just save my life.

61
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,440
He doesn't want me to ask for help.

62
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,440
I hope he's the real brother.

63
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,440
Then...

64
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,440
From today on, you will be my brother.

65
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,440
Brother!

66
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,440
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,440
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,440
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,440
Meat!

70
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,440
Eat the meat!

71
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,440
I'm going to burn it.

72
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,440
You're too much.

73
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
Do you want some lemon?

74
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,440
No.

75
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,440
You're drunk after all.

76
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,440
I'm a coward who never gets drunk.

77
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,440
Well, he's a guy who's got a lot of talent.

78
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,440
Did you find out who I am?

79
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,440
I'm a foreigner hunter.

80
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,440
I heard that you were locked up in the gate 10 years ago

81
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,440
and you couldn't get out.

82
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,440
But I heard that you were connected to the gate in America.

83
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,440
You're a big question.

84
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,440
What else?

85
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,440
I haven't spoken English yet.

86
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,440
I've still got a chance to be a human monster.

87
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,440
What about the sun?

88
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,440
I've asked an SQ hunter who is a member of the Washington Foundation.

89
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,440
Mr. Fankar?

90
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,440
He's going to investigate the history of the United States.

91
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,440
That's good.

92
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,440
By the way, what's his name?

93
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,440
It's a little difficult to pronounce, but...

94
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,440
It's Irfan Son.

95
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,440
He won't be back in a week.

96
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,440
You're going to travel this time?

97
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,440
You're busy.

98
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,440
Well, there are a lot of things.

99
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,440
Who are you going with?

100
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,440
I'm going with a friend.

101
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,440
When did you come?

102
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:14,440
The level of the fight with Cerberus was 20.

103
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,440
The level of the fight is 3 times the same.

104
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,440
It should be easier than that time.

105
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:43,440
I'm going to go first.

106
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,440
A quest?

107
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,440
This castle is haunted by demons.

108
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,440
Please gather the spirit of the devil.

109
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,440
The clear conditions are the spirit of the devil.

110
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,440
The spirit of the devil?

111
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,440
10,000?

112
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,440
Is that so?

113
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,440
But there's no one to sleep with this time.

114
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,440
10,000 of them.

115
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,440
I'll do it.

116
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,440
I want you to leave the guild.

117
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,440
Yes.

118
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,440
You know that Jinson is going to advance the plan, right?

119
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,440
The brother who will take the outside human to the guild master

120
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,440
has a big risk in our company.

121
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,440
You're a hunter called Sonjin.

122
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,440
Sonjin?

123
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,440
20 dungeons, a total destruction of the Phantom Speed attack,

124
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,440
a revenge attack by the surveillance hunter.

125
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,440
I'm involved in these three cases.

126
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,440
I've participated in all the raids you're involved in.

127
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,440
The red gate that the 100 guilds met the other day

128
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,440
and the one who was the one who pulled out the survivor was Son Hunter.

129
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
What?

130
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,440
The one who took the master guild was Son Hunter's co-worker, right?

131
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,440
Leave it to me.

132
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,440
Even so...

133
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,440
Even so...

134
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,440
Leave the master guild to me.

135
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,440
I'll do what you say later.

136
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,440
Okay. I'll leave it to you.

137
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
What?

138
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,440
But there's a condition.

139
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,440
After the red gate of the soul,

140
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,440
the 100 guilds move behind the Son Hunter scout.

141
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,440
Before that, take Son Hunter home.

142
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,440
I can do it.

143
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,440
I will!

144
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,440
I'm looking forward to it.

145
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,440
I wonder why I can't get out of the devil.

146
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,440
I don't have a problem with being here.

147
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,440
Huh?

148
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,440
The entrance to the upper floor.

149
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,440
I see. So you're using it there.

150
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,440
And it's a big dungeon.

151
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,440
There's only one city in the building.

152
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,440
The entrance to the castle is so mysterious.

153
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,440
The entrance to the castle is so mysterious.

154
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,440
The icebear is the head of the village.

155
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
It's too big.

156
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,440
Let's go.

157
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,440
The one who took the master guild...

158
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
I'll do it.

159
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,440
Leave it to me.

160
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,440
I'll do it.

161
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,440
You're a tank from today.

162
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,440
It's Heine!

163
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,440
It's so beautiful.

164
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,440
It's so beautiful.

165
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,440
Why?

166
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,440
Why didn't you give us any information about the Heine's trap?

167
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,440
Just some of it.

168
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,440
It's a warning of the church.

169
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,440
Even if you give it a warning at the site, it will only cause panic.

170
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,440
But...

171
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,440
It's okay.

172
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,440
It's time to take action.

173
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,440
As the best guild in the country,

174
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,440
I'll do it for the sake of the responsibility and the secret.

175
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,440
When I got the key,

176
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,440
I was afraid that this was the SQ dungeon.

177
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,440
But this devil is above the G-class.

178
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,440
I'm a strong person who knows how to solve a lot of problems,

179
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:49,440
but I was able to go on with the plan to defeat the devil who had the permission to appear in the world.

180
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,440
I did it.

181
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,440
To put it simply,

182
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,440
if the devil's castle is the same structure as the original tower,

183
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,440
there will be hundreds of times more existence.

184
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,440
How strong will it be when it reaches there?

185
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,440
What do you have to eat?

186
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,440
There are also promises and promises.

187
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,440
This is going to be a time-consuming battle.

188
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,440
Okay.

189
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,440
How far can I go?

190
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,440
Are you crazy?

191
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,440
I'm going to the castle.

192
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,440
You were an Ors, right?

193
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,440
I have a sister at home.

194
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,440
I'm just asking her to travel.

195
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,440
You've been asking about this house, but you're still here.

196
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,440
There are no record records of Raid in this area.

197
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:17,440
The only one record of the church's 1st floor without any traces of the foreigners was in the middle of the city.

198
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,440
Huh? Do you know that?

199
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,440
It's my job.

200
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,440
Where the hell is he?

201
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,440
I'll deal with that big boss.

202
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,440
I'll kill the rest.

203
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:55,440
Thanks to the status of the underground, the soldiers' supply line has increased the magic power to maintain it,

204
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,440
and there is a lot of freedom in the battle.

205
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,440
Even so, how long has he been playing?

206
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,440
If he doesn't move, let's get out of here.

207
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,440
What are you doing to me?

208
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,440
I just hit him.

209
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,440
Did he really use too much power?

210
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,440
Is that the time to kill Nios?

211
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
Fire!

212
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,440
I can't stop him.

213
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,440
I'm so angry that I'm being hit by this.

214
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,440
But I'm not going anywhere.

215
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,440
Now!

216
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,440
I got him!

217
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,440
He called my name.

218
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,440
The Trison of Attack.

219
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,440
That little guy.

220
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,440
First, I have to stop that strange move.

221
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,440
What?

222
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,440
He's here.

223
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,440
Did they turn their back on you cuz you were told to?

224
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,440
I think I got you.

225
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,440
Death!

226
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,440
If you change that you're released.

227
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,440
Kill it!

228
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,440
It's a bit of a change here.

229
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,440
You want me to turn the work around?

230
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:09,860
To

231
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:30,880
subscribe

232
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,440
Hey, can I ask you something?

233
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,440
Shut up and tell me!

234
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,440
How much do you know about the human race, the gate and the monster?

235
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,440
Huh?

236
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,440
How much do you know about the gate and the monster?

237
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,440
What are you talking about?

238
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,440
That is...

239
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Dungeon Gate Monster...

240
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
That's too much for my brain.

241
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,440
The power that becomes the worst technique has finally awakened.

242
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,440
What is that?

243
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,440
The worst technique.

244
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,440
I can't say anything more.

245
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,440
What?

246
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,440
My goal is to stop that technique.

247
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,440
Enough talking.

248
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,440
Do you know what kind of hunters are in this world?

249
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
They gather.

250
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,440
Even if you gather a number, it's meaningless in front of that power.

251
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,440
It's just used by eating.

252
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
You're a very strong monster.

253
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,440
Huh?

254
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,440
You even named the monster with the name of the gorilla?

255
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,440
And you have two sisters.

256
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,440
Do you remember the name of your son?

257
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,440
Jin.

258
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,440
What?

259
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,440
That sentence.

260
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,440
I didn't answer your question.

261
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,440
No, you didn't answer.

262
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,440
Instead, I'll teach you something good.

263
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,440
Your son is dead.

264
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,440
If you have a reason to say that, go and tell me.

265
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,440
What is this?

266
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,440
It's not a single shot.

267
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,440
You're stronger and more surprised.

268
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,440
You didn't think this would happen.

269
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,440
You're afraid of undead?

270
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,440
Well, it's fine.

271
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,440
Here! Hurry up!

272
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,440
If the battle between SQ and the City of Toshina happened, the area would have changed.

273
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,440
I heard that one of them was defeated.

274
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,440
But I don't think it's that bad.

275
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,440
It was a disaster.

276
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,440
In a moment...

277
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,440
In a moment, Mr. Fang lost.

278
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,440
It's faster than the revolution of death.

279
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,440
Now we have food.

280
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,440
This time, we're here.

281
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,440
Now, 75 times.

282
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,440
The rest is about 25 times.

283
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,440
We're still on the road.

284
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,440
But the harvest is going on.

285
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,440
The ear decoration from the 50th floor.

286
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,440
The neck decoration from the skeleton.

287
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,440
Each of them has a unique personality.

288
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,440
But the set effect is good.

289
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,440
The monster from the cave can be predicted to be one more.

290
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,440
This one is a great bullet.

291
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,440
I don't know how to use it myself.

292
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,440
But this is the best I can do.

293
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,440
If you use it as a magic weapon, you can double the magic power.

294
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,440
And...

295
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,440
Random box, which was chosen and cursed by the quest rewards.

296
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,440
I was nervous that I lost the entrance machine.

297
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,440
I noticed it, but I knew it was a key.

298
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,440
A small piece of paper?

299
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,440
When did you use it?

300
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,440
But this is not the end of the story.

301
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,440
The end of the world's magic weapon, which was obtained from the Volcan,

302
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,440
which is a great gift.

303
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,440
75 times.

304
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,440
The treasure of the forest, which was obtained from the Mets from the Immortal,

305
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,440
and the three treasures of life, were obtained by two.

306
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,440
One more thing.

307
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,440
One more thing, mother.

308
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,440
I will definitely come next time.

309
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,440
I will definitely come next time.

310
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,440
I will definitely come next time.

311
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,440
I will definitely come next time.

312
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,440
I will definitely come next time.

313
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,440
I will definitely come next time.

314
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,440
I will definitely come next time.

315
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,440
I will definitely come next time.

316
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,440
I will definitely come next time.

317
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,440
I will definitely come next time.

318
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,440
I will definitely come next time.

319
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,440
The end of the story.

320
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,440
The End
