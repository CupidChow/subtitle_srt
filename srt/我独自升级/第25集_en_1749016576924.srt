1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next day

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Happy Holidays

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Can you stop the camera?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yes!

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Hurry! Otherwise I'll break it!

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I-I got it!

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What are you doing?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What are you doing?

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What are you trying to do?

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm asking you!

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
There's no time. Please be quiet.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Wake up.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Episode 3

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Episode 4

17
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The plan-9's mission is to get out of the captain's office.

18
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Get ready.

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's not a joke!

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
There's so much monster there.

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Should I go again?

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You guys can't see it, so you can say that.

23
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Kotou-san is so slow.

24
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The new master is dead.

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The hunter on the other side has defeated him.

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
He's dead?

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Is that impossible?

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The ability to use the master's power

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
wasn't just a shoukama-ho?

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Bbyong!

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I heard a voice.

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The voice of the hunter who uses his own power.

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Episode 4

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I think I know who it was.

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
He was a warm person who was not under any control.

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I can't use this power on TV.

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's a scary ability to get more power

38
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
if the intensity of the fight is lost.

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But Min...

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You're right, Hunter.

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If you continue to fight as a hunter,

42
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Bbyong's power will be valuable.

43
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But he doesn't want to fight.

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't want him to stand on the battlefield again.

45
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's the same as when I was in the Red Gate.

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The back hunter caught my shoulder.

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But this time, it's not an order.

48
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's a desperate request.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's okay. I thought the same.

50
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The concentration is gone.

51
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Bbyong!

52
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Thank you.

53
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Thank you very much.

54
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Why are they alive?

55
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The Sun Hunter collided and defeated the new master.

56
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I know if you see this.

57
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Why are you in the island?

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I didn't participate in the fight.

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I don't know.

60
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The magic power's reaction suddenly appeared.

61
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What do you mean?

62
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I told you that I lost the Sun Hunter in the 12th and 17th.

63
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Captain, will you show me the Plan Q?

64
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
If the damage is more than 1 in the manga,

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
the power balance that the gate of the country is more than the master,

66
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
will be greatly reduced.

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What will you do?

68
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'll retreat.

69
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Retreat immediately.

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Roger.

71
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Why are they suddenly...

72
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I don't know.

73
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Didn't the queen defeat her?

74
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I don't know.

75
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm starting to get a little nervous.

76
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Don't let them get away with it.

77
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Wait a minute!

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This is the place where the base team guild is!

79
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Captain, boss!

80
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Everyone, hurry up!

81
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
This is bad.

82
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It seems that the people who are trying to escape from the island are heading towards the main road.

83
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
If they don't move, the road will be blocked here.

84
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Let's retreat immediately.

85
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Please let us out.

86
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Where is the Sun Hunter?

87
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
He seems to be left behind and is about to die.

88
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Unfortunately, we are now just a stone-tongue.

89
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And I hope you can see the Char Hunters quickly in the medical field.

90
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Even if you can get an experience from the egg before it is hatched, it's a happy thing.

91
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's a waste of time to let it get angry.

92
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
As expected of the devil's experience.

93
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
But I'll leave the rest to you.

94
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Finally, level 100 has been reached.

95
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This is the place where the dead man is flying.

96
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Wake up!

97
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What is this darkness?

98
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I can't feel anything.

99
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Something is really happening.

100
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's back.

101
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's back.

102
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I thought I was in a hurry.

103
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Well then, let's go to the other side.

104
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Did you talk to them?

105
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yes.

106
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Why are you talking to them?

107
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's the first time I've seen a Shogun Kyu.

108
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Is it because the level is different from the one you can talk to them?

109
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Even so...

110
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I killed you.

111
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And you still want me to do it?

112
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I was born not by death, but by the power of the king.

113
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I am now in the state of being a king.

114
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I will always be your servant.

115
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Please give me your name.

116
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Bell.

117
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Your name is Bell.

118
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Thank you, Shion.

119
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Then, again...

120
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Wake up.

121
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The monster group has been defeated.

122
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
This is the final defense line.

123
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Don't let them get close to the city.

124
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What are you doing?

125
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You can't get close to the city.

126
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Stop the attack with your life.

127
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What a great number.

128
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The number of the four thousand is increasing.

129
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It seems that the number is increasing.

130
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Is it still that high?

131
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Will you reduce the number?

132
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yes.

133
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Please give me your name.

134
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Go.

135
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Good.

136
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Good.

137
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The enemy is strong.

138
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I need to defeat them to a certain extent.

139
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Find the enemy.

140
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Mr. Mikazawa.

141
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Mr. Mikazawa.

142
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Are you all right?

143
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What is this?

144
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What is this?

145
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That light...

146
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I don't know.

147
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
But did you help me?

148
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Mr. Jingu.

149
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
No matter how many times the number increases,

150
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
it will never change.

151
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's impossible.

152
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The enemy is falling.

153
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It hurts.

154
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You are so brave.

155
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
We will meet in the air.

156
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I was saved by him until the end.

157
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I can escape.

158
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The people who escaped from the island

159
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
were caught by many hunters.

160
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The crime was stopped.

161
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And the victim was arrested at the very beginning.

162
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The SQ hunters were safe.

163
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The Chahunters were in a state of coma.

164
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
They were sent to the hospital.

165
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
They were sent to the hospital.

166
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
They fought to pay for the sacrifice.

167
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But they were forced to hide the fear

168
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
that was about to overflow in the island.

169
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And the fourth Jets' raid

170
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
closed the door with our victory.

171
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The SQ hunters were in the island

172
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
until the end of the war.

173
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It was a good day.

174
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The time has come.

175
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
The SQ hunters are on the move.

176
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Get ready to attack.

177
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Wait.

178
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
The heroes of our country

179
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
want to get rid of their bodies.

180
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's coming.

181
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I have to move my body a little.

182
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I will sink into the sea without leaving a single one.

183
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The SQ hunters were in the island

184
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
until the end of the war.

185
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
If it was that dark,

186
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
not a kid like him,

187
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I would have enjoyed it a little more.

188
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
But it's a pity.

189
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
A few days after the fourth Jets' raid,

190
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
a ghostly ghost was created.

191
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Many people are coming to the island.

192
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Look.

193
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The SQ hunters are heading to the battlefield.

194
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
The raid this time

195
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
has a huge role in his activities.

196
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
They say that he was not successful without the SQ hunters.

197
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Some of them are heroes and they are not good at expressing themselves.

198
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And many of his companions are very suspicious.

199
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
If he was participating from the beginning,

200
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
he would have been able to survive without making any mistakes.

201
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And he has a very negative voice.

202
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Please put your chest down.

203
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
What the world says,

204
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
is that you are the one who sent the SQ hunters to this attack.

205
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
First of all,

206
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I would like to thank you for your effort to attend

207
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
the fourth Jets' raid this time.

208
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
No.

209
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
If I could hurry up and get to the base,

210
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I would have been able to survive without losing the SQ hunters.

211
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
But thanks to you,

212
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
the fact that I was able to save many lives

213
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
of the five hunters and the SQ hunters

214
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
is a fact.

215
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
This achievement is great.

216
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Let's promise that we will do whatever we want

217
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
to the SQ hunters.

218
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I understand.

219
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
So, what are you planning to do in the future?

220
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
In the future?

221
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yes.

222
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You have been in the raid this time,

223
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
but you have not been able to show your power.

224
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
The world will not abandon you anymore.

225
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
There are people who will contact you.

226
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Even as a church,

227
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
you will not be able to survive.

228
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I would like to ask you again.

229
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
SQ hunters,

230
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
what will you do with your power from now on?

231
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I would like to raise my own guild.

232
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Why are you so desperate to join our master?

233
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You can't be so desperate to join our master?

234
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
No.

235
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I will not allow you to join our master.

236
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's a great job to take care of the enemy's death.

237
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
The last one who is left behind is a trusted master.

238
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
But...

239
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And...

240
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You will do something that will not be done on the road.

241
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You are a true man.

242
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I knew it!

243
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What are you doing?

244
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I am a forbidden hunter.

245
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Why are you doing this?

246
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You are a dangerous person.

247
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You are dangerous.

248
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
What?

249
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
What are you doing?

250
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I don't know what you are doing,

251
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
but I don't have the permission to join.

252
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
What are you doing?

253
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
What did you do?

254
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I just fell asleep because I heard a sound.

255
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
By the way, did you confirm it?

256
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yes, I am sure it's his power.

257
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's a strange story.

258
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I don't think that person can save humans.

259
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
His spirit has not started yet.

260
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
If you are interested, come to meet him.

261
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
If I have something to meet him,

262
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I will live here.

263
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I will live here.

264
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I will pull you up.

265
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You said that you are coming here alone.

266
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I should leave this area to him.

267
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You don't want to be involved?

268
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
He will start as planned.

269
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
There is no change.

270
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I don't think you need to do anything.

271
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Even so, it's smelly.

272
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
If that woman sees it, she will be shocked.

273
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I don't need to go.

274
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
What about the sword of Guild?

275
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Yes, I got permission from the 5th president.

276
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Really?

277
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Well then,

278
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I will come to you.

279
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You can't go.

280
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You can't go.

281
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You can't go.

282
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You can't go.

283
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I can't go.

284
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I can't go.

285
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You can't go.

286
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Really?

287
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Well then, I will hurry and find the office.

288
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Hey, hey, hey.

289
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I will not go.

290
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I will not go.

291
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I have a big story to tell you.

292
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I will not go.

293
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I don't want to go.

294
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I really can't go.

295
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Yes.

296
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm a son hunter.

297
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Did something happen in the Guild?

298
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
No, it's a different story.

299
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Before this highway?

300
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Yes, a B-class gate was created.

301
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's right.

302
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm in the hands of the hunter now,

303
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
but it will take time to get to the end of the time.

304
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
If you don't mind, I will go to that gate.

305
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Please go slowly.

306
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Are you still there?

307
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Can't you come with your body?

308
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm in trouble.

309
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Hey, hey.

310
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I came to close the gate.

311
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Yes.

312
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
The story is about to end,

313
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
but it seems that it will take a little more time for other hunters to arrive.

314
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I have no problem with that.

315
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But...

316
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I went.

317
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
No, it's a B-class.

318
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Huh?

319
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
This is...

320
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
No, this is definitely a red gate.

321
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's been an accident.

322
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
The exit is closed,

323
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
and where is this road going?

324
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
If it was like this, I should have told my mother.

325
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Well, if it's this much, it won't take much time.

326
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I will help you quickly.

327
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
He came.

328
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I was reminded of this raid.

329
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm still a monster.

330
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I was just a person who could help me at that place.

331
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
But he was wrong.

332
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I want to catch up with that person.

333
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I want to stand by that person.

334
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
For that reason,

335
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I want to be strong.

336
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
The hunter was born to hunt.

337
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
The dungeon is a weak meat-eating world.

338
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It needs a certain determination to hunt.

339
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
That's right.

340
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
The world where the enemy doesn't know when to turn.

341
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
The world where the enemy always meets the enemy.

342
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Even so, the hunter is trying to see the battle.

343
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The enemy is trying to say how many enemies there are.

344
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
He is trying to use the power that makes the enemy feel very strong.

345
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
He is trying to use the power that makes the enemy feel very strong.

346
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
The purpose of their fighting is different.

347
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
To protect the family.

348
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
To overcome the trust.

349
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
To prove their existence.

350
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
To make them fight for their destiny.

351
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The hunter is just hunting.

352
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
No one is going to stop hunting yet.

353

356

How the amazing silicon was pplatified.

I'm not sure if I can do this.
