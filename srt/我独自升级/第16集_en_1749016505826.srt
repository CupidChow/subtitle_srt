1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The End

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Two pieces of the material of the life's death have been collected.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
There's one more left.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The blood of the demon king, who has been purged.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I want to sacrifice the whole world to get it.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Thanks to the demon king, I've reached a pretty good level.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But my high-level rank is good.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I can't even go to the top level to get a higher level.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Stop acting like you're useless.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I can't hide it from you.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'll take the latest version of the Hunter rank.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,960
Only�로選ばね

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,500
We will rock all of them

14
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,400
Cuz I'm back here

15
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,000
This game is so let's go

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,800
The new scenario

17
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,800
Cuz I'm back here

18
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,500
This game we can survive

19
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,200
One more time, you smash the heart

20
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,000
This fight, the fate is so close

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,200
To be a one team, I'm a one team boss

22
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,600
You never go away

23
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,700
So I'm gonna go to your window

24
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm gonna knock on the door

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,400
Yeah, knock on the door

26
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,600
That I won't go shallow

27
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,200
So let's make the best

28
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,200
I'm gonna make my new awesome scenario

29
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,200
Cuz I'm back here

30
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,000
This game so let's go

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,600
All right, hey, there goes a total show

32
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
Cuz I'm back here

33
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,400
This game we can survive

34
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,000
One touch climb, I'm getting rocked

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
This high, the fate is so close

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,800
Come on, drop it, oh oh oh

37
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
So I'm dropping it

38
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,800
You stuck it, oh yeah, I'm dropping it

39
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
The End

40
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,600
If you have any questions, please leave a comment below

41
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Well, how many people can I get today?

42
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
He looks like a CQ

43
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,600
He's a good guy, he's a good guy

44
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
And...

45
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Yes, it's Beku Yunho

46
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,600
The second one, Kyon Kijou

47
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
What's up?

48
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
He's here

49
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
What? What do you mean?

50
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
I'm not making a mistake

51
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Son Hunter has received the latest rank

52
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,600
Then, this way

53
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Yes

54
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
I'm going there right now

55
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
I'm not that nervous

56
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Hmm

57
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,600
It seems like it's easy to say

58
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,600
I'm gonna take the Hunter rank and make a living

59
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
And share it with my wife and daughter

60
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Look

61
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,600
If you get the DQ rank, the scoutmen in the guild will call you

62
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,600
It's okay, if you don't have an EQ, you can eat it

63
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,600
If I don't have an EQ...

64
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Next one

65
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Yes

66
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
To confirm your name

67
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Son Jin

68
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
The latest rank

69
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Yes

70
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Then, the measurement method is the same as before

71
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,600
So, please wait for the black water proof

72
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
Huh?

73
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Error?

74
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Excuse me, once again

75
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Yes

76
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
That's weird

77
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Hey, what's wrong?

78
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Master

79
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,600
It's weird

80
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
I couldn't measure it no matter how many times

81
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
That's not the case

82
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Which one?

83
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Look, it looks like this

84
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
What?

85
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Master?

86
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
This is not the fault of the machine

87
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,600
It's showing the measurement ability

88
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
What?

89
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
What do you mean?

90
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,600
His magic power is exceeding the measurement power of this machine

91
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
What?

92
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Then...

93
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
That's right

94
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,600
This person is the 10th SQ of this country

95
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,600
What about the ring of the soul?

96
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,600
It seems that the Chosaba has begun to open

97
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
From the internal organization and the Zanryu Maruk

98
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,600
We will search for the data of the past and the present

99
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,600
We want to have more time to confirm it

100
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Is that so?

101
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,600
There are many things happening recently

102
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,600
I heard about the Red Gate

103
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,600
The Biyakko Guild raid has three subordinates

104
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,600
And defeated the dungeon boss

105
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Who is it?

106
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
I was at the site that day

107
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,600
But I didn't stay until the end

108
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
So I don't know what's going on

109
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
That's not true

110
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Master, you are more suspicious than Robbie

111
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,600
The person who received the magic power measurement is suspicious

112
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
I'll go and see

113
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,600
I'll go too

114
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,600
What kind of trick is it that interests you?

115
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
The measurement ability judgment

116
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Really?

117
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
Is that judgment actually true?

118
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
I tried everything

119
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Of course

120
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
There was only a short break

121
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Then that person will be the 10th SQ of this country

122
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
I understand

123
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
It's just like what Chief An said

124
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
I'll call you first

125
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,600
After that, I'll update the license

126
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
What happened?

127
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Hey, that...

128
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Hunter Guild representative, Jet Join

129
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:31,600
That person is the last weapon of the Super Power of the Hell magic

130
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,600
My great-grandma

131
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
I see

132
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,600
This is the reason for the confusion

133
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
Nice to meet you

134
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,600
I'm Hunter Guild representative, Jet Join

135
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
Have you decided on the file guild?

136
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,600
If you'd like, I'll give you some time later

137
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
Sorry, but I have to hurry

138
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,600
No way, Jet Join was rejected?

139
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:03,600
Chief, you called me Hunter's Jet Join, right?

140
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,600
Yes, you're right

141
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,600
I think I was just being carried away

142
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,600
That Hunter... He really is...

143
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,600
He disappeared for a while

144
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,600
Is it a murder case?

145
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Chief Bec

146
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
Chief!

147
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,600
So that's how it is

148
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,600
The 100th building is not that far from here

149
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,600
But I still have to breathe and run

150
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,600
That means he has that much value

151
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,600
I found it

152
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,600
The person who made the Red Gate

153
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,600
Join!

154
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,600
The person who I don't want to be known the most

155
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,600
He's looking so cold

156
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,600
Just a little more, mother

157
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,600
Thanks to you, I realized that my eyes are a hole in the air

158
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,600
We, the detectives, are responsible for the Hunter

159
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,600
If we have someone to report, we'll be punished

160
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,600
I was a little confident to see the person

161
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,600
I'm the head of the detectives

162
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,600
In a different way than the criminal

163
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:46,600
The detectives are the only ones who can take the Hunter

164
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,600
But even if we are like that, in front of the SQ

165
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,600
There's someone I want to see

166
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
Nice to meet you

167
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,600
I'm Gonhi, the head of the Hunter Association

168
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,600
First of all, congratulations on your SQ judgment

169
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
What?

170
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,600
The SQ judgment doesn't make much sense

171
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,600
It's the same as the SQ that was executed at the time of the SQ

172
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Then why?

173
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,600
Did you make the SQ judgment?

174
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,600
It's a time of the day

175
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,600
In this way, we are in contact with people like you

176
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Unfortunately, there are many hunters who have lost their hope

177
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,600
They are all blinded by the entry of the Oogata Guild

178
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,600
This Chief of the SQ is the top level Hunter

179
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,600
But he is still an AQ

180
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Let's go straight to the head office

181
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,600
I would like you to be my partner

182
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Let's prepare an important post in the church

183
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Why so?

184
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,600
The current government is not supporting this country

185
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,600
It is a Hunter who protects the people from monsters

186
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,600
And the one in the center is the Oogata Guild

187
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Currently, 5 groups of people are in a state of balance

188
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,600
But if you are in contact with them, that balance will be greatly reduced

189
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,600
The Hunter Church is the sixth force that controls them

190
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,600
This country will not be able to do so

191
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
That's why the church...

192
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,600
You have the power to forget about it

193
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,600
And then...

194
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,600
How about it?

195
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
It's not a bad story

196
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
It's a post in the church

197
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,600
It's a promise to the world

198
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,600
There will be no other correaionist from industry

199
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Also as the hunter

200
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,600
I think, this penitentiary SQ is very strong

201
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Soldiers havefronted countlessrells

202
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,600
If I accept this offer, I will live my life.

203
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Son Hunter.

204
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,600
I'm sorry. I refuse.

205
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,600
After all, money?

206
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
I want to fight.

207
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,600
Does that mean you want to fight with a monster?

208
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Yes. I think my place is dungeon.

209
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,600
What is this? I can't believe it.

210
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,600
How many years have I been in this kind of feeling?

211
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,600
I still have this kind of sound in my heart.

212
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,600
If I can actually fight with 24 more, I will fight with young people like this.

213
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,600
I understand. I can't force you.

214
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Well, I'm sorry to say this, but I'm the only one left.

215
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Thank you for your valuable time.

216
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,600
When I heard that you couldn't fix the dungeon with SQ's healer, how easy was I to make it?

217
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
I'm sorry.

218
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,600
Please cancel all the plans after this.

219
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
I don't want to be disturbed.

220
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Chief, can you come with me after this?

221
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,600
I can't drink, but I hope you can.

222
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,600
I don't mind.

223
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
He must like to drink.

224
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,600
The dungeon that the church is in charge of is mainly D-EQ.

225
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,600
I have to level up the whole country as soon as possible and fix my mother.

226
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,600
I can't stop.

227
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,600
I can continue to grow.

228
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:38,600
What do you want from the traitor, Chief Fuukukyu?

229
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,600
I have something I want to ask you directly.

230
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,600
Is he really a monster?

231
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,600
Do you think that's human?

232
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,600
It's definitely a monster.

233
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,600
It's definitely a monster.

234
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,600
I understand. You have to go to the treatment room.

235
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,600
The bodyguard will come out to the management once.

236
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
That man is...

237
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
The management is chasing him.

238
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,600
But, can you catch the man who will defeat you?

239
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Damn it!

240
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,600
I will definitely get close to my family.

241
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,600
I will go for you.

242
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,600
I can't escape from my eyes even if I die.

243
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,600
It's a disgusting monster.

244
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
I can't escape even if I die.

245
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
Are you going to kill me?

246
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
I know where you are.

247
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,600
I need equipment.

248
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,600
The artifact to crush him to pieces.

249
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
Artifact.

250
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,600
It's a human item to be played directly.

251
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,600
But, even if you are in the Hunter's world, you can't make it even as a craftsman.

252
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,600
You can't make it even as a craftsman.

253
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,600
Even if the number of hunters increased, it's natural that it's an auction on the net.

254
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Why is it so expensive?

255
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,600
I want to make the equipment perfect for the evil white attack.

256
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
There was no one to be satisfied with the store.

257
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:32,600
I can sell the

258
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,600
It should be sold at a price.

259
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,600
It's a problem that I have the E-class.

260
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,600
I will definitely find a way out.

261
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:48,600
I can't go to the high-level raid as long as I'm in the A-class gate.

262
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
What?

263
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
You're looking for something?

264
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
The data from 4 years ago.

265
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,600
It looks like the proof is different from now.

266
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
The possibility of a negative record.

267
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,600
There are records that have been proven many times.

268
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
Is that a lie?

269
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,600
It's a copy of the new record.

270
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
It's been here for a long time.

271
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:22,600
It seems that the mother's treatment and sister's study were supported by the entry.

272
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,600
It's a young girl who can't really see things these days.

273
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,600
It's a son-hunter, but the report that the hunters entered the raid team...

274
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,600
I was saying something like that, but the contract of the school was canceled.

275
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,600
According to the report, the son-hunter entered the mining team.

276
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,600
The mining team?

277
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
She's a young girl who can't really see things.

278
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
You're an EQ?

279
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
What's your job?

280
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
It's my first time.

281
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Oh, it's a combat system. It's no problem if you're a bodyguard.

282
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,600
There are a lot of people like Son-san here.

283
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
Let's do our best to get rid of the shoulder.

284
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,600
Yes.

285
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,600
In a large-scale raid like the top-class dungeon, the industry is essential.

286
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,600
The attack against monsters, the mining team that digs up the trap stones in the dungeon,

287
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,600
the mining team that absorbs the monster's blood,

288
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,600
the history of the people is large.

289
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
In the meantime...

290
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
Please back off.

291
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,600
I don't like too bright things.

292
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
Everyone in the tank.

293
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
Please.

294
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,600
The enemy is coming.

295
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,600
The damage will be less and less, so I've made it a lot.

296
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,600
Now the enemy in the area should be cleaned up.

297
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Let's move on.

298
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Miss Hanagabinkanna, please be careful of the burnt smell.

299
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,600
The attack team has come out!

300
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,600
Did they come down the dungeon's water pipe?

301
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,600
I felt a strong aura when I was out of my mind yesterday.

302
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
Everyone in the AQ gate is unharmed.

303
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
It's like a real origami.

304
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Oh, they're coming out. Hunter's number two.

305
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,600
That's...

306
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,600
The nine-in-one SQ Hunter, the master of the Hunters,

307
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,600
Myhime, Chahein, and Susamocino.

308
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Who would be in this world if they had such an aura?

309
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,600
What is it? The current strong aura?

310
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
Kinnase?

311
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,600
I thought you were the leader of the five realms,

312
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,600
but your aura disappeared like a lie.

313
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
You're a more sharp person than I thought.

314
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,600
Everyone, let's go!

315
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,600
After the attack, the team of the mining and recovery team is finally out.

316
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
X-ray!

317
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,600
The magic wave flowing through this dungeon.

318
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Is this the magic power the AQ dungeon bosses have?

319
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,600
The devil's castle's volcano is the monster that goes up the Metus.

320
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
If you want to try it,

321
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,600
what is the actual strength of the AQ boss?

322
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,600
Did you hear that? It seems that the new leader of the dungeon is Iqiu.

323
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Iqiu? Really?

324
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,600
What are you thinking about?

325
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,600
Iqiu is really...

326
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
I don't think it's going to be that easy to get anywhere.

327
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,600
Well, it's not going to be that easy anyway.

328
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,600
Hey, hey, let's hurry and move on.

329
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
The road is narrow, but it's going to be a lot of trouble.

330
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,600
No!

331
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
No, no, no.

332
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,600
I'm going to do my best.

333
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,600
Is he really Iqiu?

334
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,600
Team leader, that person really is Iqiu?

335
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,600
His strength is not half-perfect.

336
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,600
I'm sure that he's going to be a good worker who God gave us.

337
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,600
That's good.

338
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,600
Alright, Iqiu is here.

339
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,600
Let's go eat.

340
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,600
Son, are you going?

341
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,600
I want to finish this here.

342
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
I understand.

343
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,600
Don't go too far.

344
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
Yes.

345
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
I'm finally alone.

346
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
I can't let this chance escape.

347
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,600
It's about an hour.

348
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
Just take a look.

349
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
This is the boss's room.

350
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,600
It looks stronger than the Medus.

351
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,600
I have a reason to not defeat the boss.

352
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,600
If I defeat him, the gate will close.

353
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,600
The fact that there is a huge presence of the hunters.

354
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,600
Even so, if I try to hold on a little longer...

355
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,600
What are you doing there?

356
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,600
I'm going to ask you again.

357
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,600
What are you doing there?

358
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
I'm going to finish this here.

359
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,600
Sorry, sorry. I'll leave you alone.

360
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,600
It's about time to go to the lab.
