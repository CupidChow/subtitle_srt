1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm not sure if I can get the monster, but I'm sure I can.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the monster, but I'm sure I can.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm not sure if I can get the monster, but I'm sure I can.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm not sure if I can get the monster, but I'm sure I can.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm not sure if I can get the monster, but I'm sure I can.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You're a monster, too!

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You're here, huh?

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But you're getting better, Son.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Where did you get that good shot?

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
If you tell me, I haven't been hurt at all.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Oh, really?

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I hope you don't mind if I don't.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
No, I'm just counting on you.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I knew it.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I can't believe I'm in the Oura world without an appearance.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Let's move on.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not sure if I can get the monster, but I'm sure I can.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm not sure if I can get the monster, but I'm sure I can.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not sure if I can get the monster, but I'm sure I can.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm not sure if I can get the monster, but I'm sure I can.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm not sure if I can get the monster, but I'm sure I can.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm not sure if I can get the monster, but I'm sure I can.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm not sure if I can get the monster, but I'm sure I can.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm not sure if I can get the monster, but I'm sure I can.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm not sure if I can get the monster, but I'm sure I can.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm not sure if I can get the monster, but I'm sure I can.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
0

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,200
1 Buggers

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Self clearing route

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's lower than I thought, so I can't tell you the difference.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
There will be more risks, but we can clear it quickly.

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Let's do that.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'll go to the right of the rest of the people.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
If you find Boss's room, please let me know right away.

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Thanks for giving me the sense of direction.

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I can tell from here.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Boss is ahead of us.

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
There's not much room for Goblin.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Son, let's go to the left.

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay.

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Then we're in the middle.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes.

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If you have this much Goblin, you can open it.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's okay to end it like this.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's over, right?

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The lowest level of the area is lower than this dungeon.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
We were at peace like that before.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
We...

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I've decided.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
When the raid is over, I'll give Son's brother a head.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm sure Otaku is also caught.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We ran away.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The adult working as a hunter...

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
No matter how much it is for the family,

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
if we abandon our friends and disappear,

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
we'll accept the mistakes if we call the hunters again.

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Will you forgive me?

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I can't accept it.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But I'll give you a head.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Come on, hurry up.

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I can't give Goblin a hand.

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Did you clean up everything?

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's a moment like this.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'll kill you!

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
If this is human,

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
what?

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Can you kill him in the same way?

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Ha.

69
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Humans and monsters don't change.

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yes, exactly.

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What you're talking about is...

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The three men were embarrassed by the daughter.

73
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
After that, the daughter was caught.

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The body was in shock.

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But they came out again like nothing happened in a few years.

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And they're still the hunters.

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,140
Even during the raid, the hunters were seen as being

78
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,000
being taken to the raid.

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
There's no such thing as a husband.

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But the daughter has to come back.

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That's...

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
There are 300 million of them.

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Kill them.

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Kill them.

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
There's nothing to know about what happened in the dungeon.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Please, please.

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
If you come out from here, report to the monitor.

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You guys were here.

89
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You met 100 Goblins.

90
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The road is turning.

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I wonder if they're going to move on.

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Did they get out of the way?

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yes!

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Help me.

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I don't think it's going to be easy.

96
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm asking you to kill me as much as you can.

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What are you doing?

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh, the road is connected.

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So the road to the boss room is on the left.

100
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'll let you go.

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The plan was a little bit too much.

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The one who was in the room earlier came to the hospital with the monitor.

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I hope you don't remember me.

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
San!

105
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What's this?

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
John Ho!

107
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
K-Kan...

108
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Kim...

109
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Shiki, the data...

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Hurry up and get the data!

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yes!

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Kim, please be careful.

113
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
This isn't a monster's trick.

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's a weapon of the Eilin.

115
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And you're trying to avoid the fatal wound.

116
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's useless.

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I don't know why I can't help it.

118
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What are you saying?

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Please live properly.

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You have a family, right?

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Until the end...

122
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Until the end, you have to survive.

123
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You can't blame me, can you?

124
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm really sorry.

126
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I didn't mean to apologize like this.

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I was going to kill you.

128
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm sorry, brother.

129
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Kim...

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Wow, you're fast.

132
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I was going to kill the healer, but...

133
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I didn't expect you to stop me.

134
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
K-Kan, did you do it?

135
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What if I did?

136
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You're a man of the church, aren't you?

137
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
If you let me do this...

138
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's a good scenario.

139
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I was actually going to kill Goblin, but the road line changed.

140
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The master who added the head of the army killed you first.

141
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And I, who was the boss, attacked the boss.

142
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But I have no power to win.

143
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And I have to survive.

144
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
How is it? Perfect, right?

145
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm not going to win against you.

147
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Kim, I'll win.

148
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's been a long time since I've met a person.

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The opponent is a little bit aggressive.

150
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But, Juchi, could you cast a physical strength spell?

151
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yes.

152
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The dark sword is a weakness in defense.

153
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'll use it.

154
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The magic of the Oibore has increased its power.

155
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's a reverse effect.

156
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm a swordsman now.

157
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The first battle is magic.

158
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What does it mean by holding a sword?

159
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It might have a meaning.

160
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's not bad.

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's a skill that has a buff.

162
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'll kill you with a ten-year-old.

163
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It took me a moment to catch up with his speed.

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I hope I can get a little faster.

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'll survive quickly.

166
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I have to give up magic and hold a sword.

167
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But at that point...

168
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's a wakeful healer.

169
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'll crush it.

170
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm going to beat him with a sword.

171
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm not just a young man.

172
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm going to teach you how to be an SQ Hunter.

173
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm going to lose if I'm going to use the sword.

174
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Even if you say so, the power given to you is limitless.

175
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
When you use magic, you can't get to the speed of the SQ Hunter.

176
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Dad!

177
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
No way!

178
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It doesn't seem like a healer is used.

179
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's over.

180
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
How is it?

181
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
By testing the sword, I can use the magic to the magic.

182
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I can use the magic right before I finish.

183
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I didn't do a bad job.

184
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
This is a trick.

185
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Is this it?

186
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Die.

187
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's you again?

188
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Who are you?

189
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Who are you?

190
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Son Jinu.

191
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm an SQ Hunter.

192
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
SQ Hunter?

193
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You're such a fool.

194
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Son!

195
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What the hell is this?

196
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Even if you're a SQ Hunter, you're a power type.

197
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's not strange that you have so much power.

198
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But the reaction speed that stopped my attack twice?

199
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Is it a pressure-resistant attack?

200
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Well, that's not the problem.

201
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You're hiding your power, aren't you?

202
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You guys look like a face.

203
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
If you're not a SQ Hunter, you shouldn't have let the target attack you.

204
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
In other words, the answer is one.

205
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
The SQ Hunter.

206
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Son!

207
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
SQ Hunter?

208
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Then, it's after that 20-danjyo?

209
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
20-danjyo?

210
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Maybe that little EQ?

211
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's not a different person at all.

212
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And the target was a 10-dan.

213
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The best is after that.

214
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Then, it's after 20-danjyo?

215
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Well, it's okay.

216
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
The experience as a Hunter is just like that.

217
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'll teach you a lot as a senior.

218
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Why are you doing this?

219
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's about the people.

220
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I asked the victim's parents to let them do it one by one.

221
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
There's no reaction. This is for the sake of social justice.

222
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
No, it's not about the people.

223
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Why did you kill them?

224
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Is it because of the target?

225
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Then, you should do it one by one.

226
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But you should avoid the fatal injury.

227
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Just like you're going to get hurt.

228
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's a lie for the victim.

229
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Your real nature is not there.

230
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Hmm.

231
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That's about the price.

232
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But you're misunderstanding.

233
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm a B-class Hunter from the King's Guild.

234
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Why did I join the Hunter Association of the Yassu Gekkyu?

235
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm more fun when I kill people than monsters.

236
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I know where the EQ is.

237
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
That's right.

238
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What a beautiful sword.

239
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
My appearance is no longer in the form of a soldier.

240
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Speed is 5.

241
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
The same spec, the same ability,

242
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
and the number of battle experiences I've seen.

243
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That's the way to defeat you.

244
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Hmm.

245
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You're a little nervous.

246
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Sorry, but...

247
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Huh?

248
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I should have stopped you from coming out earlier.

249
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Look, the system is back on track.

250
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Huh?

251
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm grateful to the system for a long time.

252
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I've got another reason to kill you.

253
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
System?

254
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
What's this?

255
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm sure I'm the right one.

256
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Huh?

257
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's even faster.

258
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Where?

259
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Your tank and the effect.

260
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'll show you something interesting.

261
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Huh?

262
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's gone.

263
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You're a good guy who completely lost his mind.

264
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I like you.

265
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'll erase all the sounds and smells.

266
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I can only get some of the most unskilled hunters.

267
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Of course, I'm the one who can use this.

268
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
No one knows.

269
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Why?

270
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'll kill you.

271
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
There's no one alive.

272
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Speed is sealed.

273
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Don't be so hasty.

274
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Your turn is over.

275
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Son will be in danger.

276
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Can you stop the attack?

277
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Hey, how long have you been talking?

278
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You're recovering.

279
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I recovered in an instant.

280
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I've never heard of a combat hunter who can use a Chiyuma.

281
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
How many more can I use?

282
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm not expecting it.

283
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You're a dangerous guy.

284
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Another emotion has died.

285
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You're not going to feel any anger like you.

286
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I see.

287
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You've done it before, haven't you?

288
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What? Are you a thief?

289
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I see.

290
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm sure he's been trying to steal your thoughts

291
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
from the tank.

292
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It wasn't just an appearance.

293
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
The power of the awakening and the power of the consciousness

294
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
has changed this world.

295
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The unarmed body that was only allowed by the hunter

296
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
is really useless here.

297
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Only strong ones can win.

298
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
This guy...

299
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I didn't expect to be my position.

300
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
But I can't even see the exact position.

301
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
What?

302
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Wait.

303
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You're kidding me, right?

304
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What?

305
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
God...

306
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I asked you why you were going to kill me.

307
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's meaningless to be the hunter

308
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
who's the only one who's been chasing the general's consciousness.

309
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You're the same.

310
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
We're already murder machines.

311
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That's why I'm the one who lost.

312
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
This is all natural.

313
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What the hell are you?

314
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You're a murderer, but you've never heard of a criminal

315
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
who's a thief?

316
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I can't help but worry about my identity.

317
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You killed me.

318
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You can't keep hiding your identity any longer.

319
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
If I were the hunter who gets stronger every time I fight...

320
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Your shadow hat is connected to darkness.

321
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Only that depth can make you stronger.

322
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
But you have to be careful.

323
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
When you leave the garden,

324
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm looking for you again.

325
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You're definitely stronger than before.

326
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
But what's the reason?

327
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I feel like something is falling down from me

328
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
when I get stronger.

329
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Thank you, Jin.

330
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Thanks for saving me.

331
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
If you weren't here, we'd have died.

332
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
No.

333
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Please leave first.

334
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'll seal the dungeon.

335
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
What? You're not alone?

336
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I can't believe you.

337
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's a shame that I can't keep you company.

338
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'll wait outside.

339
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I am deeply sorry.

340
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Marcusgot'sWithsten

341
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It must be you.

342
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
delivering theseibi

343
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
this one.

344
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I were being sent here to find two of you.

345
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Hello.

346
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,640
A boxer,

347
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:21,640
He's a very different person than the Eq Hunter at that time.

348
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,640
It's been a while.

349
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,640
Um, a nurse?

350
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,640
It's a nurse.

351
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,640
This trip, our staff is not able to get it back.

352
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,640
But first, I'll ask you directly.

353
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,640
What did you do to defeat Kahn?

354
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,640
I can't hide it any longer.

355
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,640
Unfortunately, there was no suggestion from the Ministry of Justice.

356
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,640
It's me.

357
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,640
I killed Kahn.

358
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,640
I'm sorry, but the rank is CQ.

359
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,640
How did you defeat Kahn?

360
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,640
I don't think she's here.

361
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,640
I see.

362
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,640
You won by using the Healer's power.

363
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,640
Kahn is a top class in BQ.

364
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,640

I understand.

366
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,640

Well, please let me do what I did.

373
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,640
Three hours later, a man who was killed by a murderer in Kante Shikuni,

374
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,640
