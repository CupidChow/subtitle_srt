1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,260
THEY ARE BITTING YOU Um..

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,960
BIG NOMININY

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,820
They just continued many years ago,

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,980
theirkomana, Jeezian, was a prison between them and theテイの子供と party

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,180
Yet, on the second floor of this tearken knightly base

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,160
there was a monster

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,500
it appeared a type of monster and other competent Warring

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,240
WormRobber

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,240
It's called a Hunter.

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,640
The Hunter is a magical power that uses it in the body,

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:39,240
and it ranks SQ, AQ, BQ, CQ, DQ, and EQ.

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,240
However, I think the ones who have been awakened once will try to work on how much they can.

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,240
Their abilities will never grow.

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,240
I was awakened as a weaker Hunter in the EQ,

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,240
and I, Son Jin.

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,240
I, who have been awakened as a weaker Hunter in the human world,

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,240
have always been a master and a master.

18
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,240
I wanted to be awakened as a Hunter like them,

19
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,240
a SQ Hunter in the inner world,

20
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,240
who is a few-person hunter.

21
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,240
The Hunter is the one who manages and controls the hunters,

22
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,240
and who is in charge of dungeon strategy.

23
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,240
He has the power to defeat monsters,

24
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,240
and he has the power to fight together.

25
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,240
He can't help, help, support, and do anything.

26
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,240
He can't help anything, and I can't help but catch up with him.

27
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,240
I thought so until this moment.

28
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,240
I'm not making up the cues.

29
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,240
I got to bait the bills, no grills.

30
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,240
Be brave for what you get.

31
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,240
It's a way to hit with that.

32
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,240
Give your warning just a lick.

33
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,240
Up, up, who? I've got a level.

34
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,240
Feeling, feeling.

35
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,240
All those things are yet to be.

36
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,240
There's no really, really.

37
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,240
Let's get it.

38
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
So give it yourself.

39
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,240
You're giving yourself to fashion.

40
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,240
You're giving yourself.

41
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,240
You're giving yourself to fashion.

42
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,240
You're giving yourself to fashion.

43
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,240
It's important.

44
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,240
So no, what you gonna get?

45
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,240
It's very important.

46
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,240
So no, you're giving your best shot.

47
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,240
Go and try to getcha.

48
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,240
Yeah, go and try to getcha.

49
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,240
Just go and try to getcha.

50
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,240
Get up, we need you out for it.

51
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,240
Go and try to getcha.

52
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,240
Yeah, go and try to getcha.

53
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,240
Yeah, just go and try to getcha.

54
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,240
Just get it, get up, get on to it.

55
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,240
Hey, game over but they giving all the shit coast.

56
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,240
Little kitty in the gutter with the body rolls.

57
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,240
Undercover body doesn't even beat roads.

58
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,240
The headlines, the headlines.

59
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,240
So we got a body, hasn't got an angle.

60
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,240
Book of birth and it came from a zero.

61
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,240
Everybody with them budget miles, the power grows.

62
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,240
End rose.

63
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,240
Let's get it.

64
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:11,240
The End

65
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,240
What? It's Son.

66
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,240
I, Son Jin-yo,

67
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,240
I'm the lowest level hunter in the world.

68
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,240
I'm the one who got me.

69
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,240
You're the lowest level hunter in the world.

70
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,240
Even if I'm the lowest level hunter,

71
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,240
I have to protect my family.

72
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,240
I'll do it.

73
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,240
I have to get the gate and the dungeon.

74
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,240
I have to make a reward.

75
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,240
I did it.

76
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,240
I'm finally the first.

77
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
Jin-san!

78
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,240
Jin-san!

79
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,240
Lower your gun!

80
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,240
It's okay now.

81
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,240
I'll get it back.

82
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,240
Son Jin-san!

83
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,240
Hey!

84
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,240
Come here!

85
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,240
The dungeon is even deeper than the one we've already built.

86
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,240
The dungeon is 20.

87
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,240
We'll go.

88
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
We'll go.

89
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,240
But we'll get a chance to get a lot of rewards.

90
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,240
We'll get more and decide what to do.

91
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,240
We'll go.

92
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,240
That was a mistake.

93
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,240
Everybody!

94
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,240
Ah!

95
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,240
What's happening?

96
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,240
How could this happen?

97
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,240
I'm trapped.

98
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,240
I can't escape.

99
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,240
I'll die.

100
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,240
I'll die.

101
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
I'll be killed!

102
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,240
The dungeon's boss...

103
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,240
We...

104
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,240
We're all dead.

105
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,240
It was just a chance to kill him.

106
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,240
Son-san!

107
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,240
Please run away from Ju-Hee-san.

108
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,240
I said I'll stay!

109
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,240
Who's going to take Ju-Hee-san?

110
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,240
We don't have time. Hurry!

111
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,240
No!

112
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,240
Jin-san!

113
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,240
If that's the case, I'll...

114
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,240
It was a promise to take the food.

115
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,240
Please eat first.

116
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,240
If you leave here, I'll go get the fish.

117
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,240
I'm in this situation!

118
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,240
I'm sorry.

119
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,240
I really don't have time.

120
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,240
Please.

121
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,240
I'm glad I'm the only one who's going to die.

122
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,240
I'll kill you.

123
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,240
I'll kill you.

124
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,240
Go!

125
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,240
I've been trapped for so long.

126
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,240
I've been trapped for so long.

127
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,240
I've been trapped for so long.

128
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,240
I've been trapped for so long.

129
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,240
What?

130
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,240
Don't scream!

131
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,240
Don't scream! Don't scream!

132
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,240
I've become stronger.

133
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,240
But I couldn't get used to it.

134
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,240
But I have lived to this day.

135
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,500
Edas!

136
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,240
You're the party.

137
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,240
But I'm just a private student.

138
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,540
This is what brings duy.

139
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,240
And I'm worrying if you can answer me.

140
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,240
I'm always the one who thinks about my family the most!

141
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
I have a family too!

142
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,240
I want to live too!

143
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,240
I'm glad I'm the only one who dies.

144
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
I'm sorry.

145
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,240
You're so stupid!

146
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,240
You're so stupid!

147
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,240
No...

148
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,240
I don't want to die.

149
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,240
If I had another chance...

150
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
I'd be dead.

151
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
When my eyes are cold,

152
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,240
I'm on the bed at the hospital.

153
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:09,240
The arms and legs that I lost were all the same.

154
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,240
That's not all.

155
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,240
I was the only one who could see the game's message window.

156
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,240
Sorry.

157
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
It's nothing.

158
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,240
After I came back, I realized something.

159
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,240
First, this is not the limit.

160
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,240
If you do a daily quest, you can get three rewards.

161
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,240
The recovery of the state.

162
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,240
I'm so tired that I'm going to blow it away.

163
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,240
Next is the ability point.

164
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,240
The ability you get is divided into your favorite ability.

165
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,240
I guess it's the ability.

166
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,240
If you increase your ability point, you'll get a stronger, smaller, and more powerful experience.

167
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,240
And the last daily quest reward, the random box.

168
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,240
What will it be today?

169
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,240
A key?

170
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,240
Instance Danjo?

171
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,240
What's that?

172
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,240
It's an event to make the flow stronger.

173
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,240
What should I do?

174
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,240
I'm starting to feel weak.

175
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
It's beginning.

176
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,240
My hand is細.

177
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,780
Tangled

178
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:31,580
Didn't I reduce the movement speed population to 30 when I said Happiness Showup?

00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,260
..

187
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,360
The object that will take my chance

188
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,360
...

189
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,660
E어가!

190
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,580
It's been a while since I've been so skilled!

191
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,120
Aah!

192
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,820
You still cannot stop me?

193
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,820
Do you think I could destroy this life…

194
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,360
… umm…

195
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,820
…which I have been frequently underestimate?

196
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,560
Let's go!

197
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,640
This is...

198
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,500
I have to be strong!

199
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,520
Not yet!

200
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,300
If you compare that to that...

201
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,620
If you compare that speed to fear!

202
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,440
Stop provoking me!

203
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,840
I wanted to be on the China to attack Earth quickly!

204
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,940
Again?

205
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,820
Now it's my turn!

206
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,820
You are mine!

207
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,820
No!

208
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,820
Hey, look!

209
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:47,820
The ability of the planet is fixed and there is no change.

210
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,820
But for some reason, I was able to level up.

211
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,820
Oh...

212
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,820
I'm sorry.

213
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,820
If it's me now, I'll keep earning more than before.

214
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,820
I thought so.

215
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,820
I can't find it easily.

216
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:10,820
I need to go to the top of the rank gate without earning.

217
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:15,820
But I can't find a good gate or an EQ Hunter.

218
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,820
I'll try to get the best.

219
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,820
If the rank goes up, I can go to the top of the rank gate.

220
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,820
If I pay attention, I may increase the income.

221
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,820
But it's like I'm getting paid.

222
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,820
It's rare to see it just by the cost.

223
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,820
I've never heard of a Hunter who's getting stronger after the level goes up.

224
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,820
If that's the case, I'll pay attention to the budget.

225
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,820
I'm sure the Masukomi will be noisy.

226
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,820
I'll be hit by Del Quay.

227
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,820
Don't do that.

228
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,820
Just pretend you can protect yourself.

229
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,820
And until you get the power of the power.

230
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,820
I'll check.

231
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,820
Hello!

232
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,820
I'm a fan of Donsok.

233
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,820
I'm Son Jin.

234
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,820
Are you an EQ Hunter?

235
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,820
Yes.

236
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,820
We look like friends.

237
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,820
I'm a 21-year-old EQ Hunter.

238
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,820
I was invited by the number of people.

239
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,820
Oh, an EQ Hunter?

240
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,820
He's a real guy.

241
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,820
Is this your first time playing in a CQ dungeon?

242
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,820
It's okay.

243
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,820
I'll protect you.

244
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,820
Let's go!

245
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,820
Alright! I'll save you!

246
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,820
I'll save you!

247
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,820
It's a good connection.

248
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,820
I'm glad I've been playing with this member for a long time.

249
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,820
But I haven't had a healer in a while.

250
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,820
I don't have a healer.

251
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,820
I'm still a little bit disappointed.

252
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,820
I was expecting this.

253
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:11,820
I needed a healer while I was at the Rekisen party.

254
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:16,820
The fans of Donsok were fighting a rank-less hunter.

255
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,820
They were killing him in the dungeon.

256
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,820
To poison the reward.

257
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:29,820
This time, I was trying to kill them in the dungeon where I and the people were staying.

258
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:37,820
But they were planning to kill me because I defeated the boss.

259
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,820
Enemy?

260
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,820
The system is forcing me to kill.

261
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,820
The system is forcing me to kill.

262
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,820
You're so strong.

263
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,820
I forgot.

264
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,820
I'm taking away from the weak.

265
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,820
That's the place.

266
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,820
You know that.

267
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,820
It's the worst weapon in humanity.

268
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:17,820
Then you have the same determination.

269
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,820
What?

270
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:28,820
If you're a hunter, you should be able to get a healer.

271
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,820
Donsok, I'll do it.

272
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,820
Hey, brother.

273
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,820
You're not able to make a situation.

274
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,820
You have the determination to get a healer?

275
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,820
What can you do when you're alive?

276
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,820
The worst weapon in humanity.

277
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,820
I killed people.

278
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:06,820
I killed people in order of the system.

279
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,820
I killed people now.

280
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,820
But if I don't kill them, I'll die.

281
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,820
I can't take them anymore.

282
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,820
If only the weak survive.

283
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,820
Damn you!

284
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,820
Damn you!

285
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,820
Why are you moving?

286
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,820
Damn you!

287
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,820
Eat this!

288
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,820
I'm so strong.

289
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,820
I feel stronger than when I fought with the boss in Dungeon.

290
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,820
The whole of the house is in a moment.

291
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,820
Are you trying to hide your real power?

292
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,820
If you defeated the boss, too...

293
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:18,820
Even if you die, I'll be different from them.

294
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,820
I'll be different from them.

295
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,820
You're strong!

296
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,820
Fan, you're strong.

297
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,820
But I'll tell you one thing.

298
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,820
I'm at a level without a fight.

299
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,820
What happened?

300
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,820
He attacked me on the ground.

301
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,820
He's not a good guy.

302
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,820
Wait! I'll kill him!

303
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,820
I'll pay for it!

304
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:05,820
I'll pay for the magic stone and the stone here!

305
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,820
Who's that?

306
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,820
I got it! I'll pay for it!

307
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,820
Sand.

308
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,820
I'll help you kill Sand.

309
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,820
Stop it! Do you think you can do this?

310
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,820
I can't get out of the dungeon.

311
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,820
Didn't I tell you?

312
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,820
You! You're my man!

313
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,820
I'm stronger.

314
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,820
For the precious thing.

315
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,820
I want to lose everything.

316
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,820
I want to be a monster.

317
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,820
I want to be a human.

318
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,820
I can't stop fighting.

319
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,820
I'm still...

320
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,820
I have to level up.

321
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,820
I have to level up.

322
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,820
I can't stop fighting.

323
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,820
I'm stronger.

324
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,820
I'm stronger.

325
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,820
I'm stronger.

326
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,820
I'm stronger.

327
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,820
I'm stronger.

328
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,820
I'm stronger.

329
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,820
I'm stronger.

330
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,820
I'm stronger.

331
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,820
I'm stronger.

332
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,820
I'm stronger.

333
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,820
Regrets.

334
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,820
Reperents.

335
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,820
forthright戦.

336
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,820
battles.

337
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,820
the outline of the mirror.

338
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,820
Are you a true man?

339
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,820
I'm me.

340
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,620
I'll grasp the hidden truth

341
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,320
I'll paint the path of despair

342
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,720
I'll paint the weakness

343
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,020
I'll break through the darkness

344
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,620
I'll never be able to escape

345
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:31,120
I'll destroy myself

346
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,120
I'll take over the world

347
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,420
Endless questions, endless questions

348
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:43,120
The fun that's set at night
