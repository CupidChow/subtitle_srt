1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:01,820
Huh?!

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:03,760
Oh

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,400
Hey, hey, did you see that?

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,900
I saw, I saw that E-Q, didn't I?

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,460
He challenged me!

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,520
Yeah, it's great!

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,220
Oh, first of all, the face is nothing big.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,080
Looks like he's freaking out.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,240
Who did you come to architecture with?

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,360
Well, I don't really know.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I didn't pat her at first, but she became a thin macho while she was doing the muscle training.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Really? That's not how you become a macho.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Excuse me.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Sanjin-san.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
No, I'm sorry.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Really, she's got a really strong muscles.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
But did she really have a good body?

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So, what's the story?

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh, yes!

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Today is the day of the hospitalization, but how is Okagen?

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
He's fine, thanks to you.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Really? Then please continue to the hospital until the hospitalization.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yes, I'm glad to hear that.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Amo!

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yes?

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes?

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Can you contact me?

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Contact me?

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yes, if you're okay with it.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Can you send me the results of the examination after the hospitalization?

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I understand.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Thank you for watching!

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Thank you for watching!

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Good morning, everyone. Today's special guest is this.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Nice to meet you. I'm Yungho Beku.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
As a Beck Hunter, you have only seven members in the country.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You have eight members.

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
There's a lot of ideas and a lot of training.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm Yungho Beku.

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm Yungho Beku.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm Yungho Beku.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm Yungho Beku.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm Yungho Beku.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm Yungho Beku.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm Yungho Beku.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
As a backhunter, you're a member of the only SKU Hunter in the country.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What's the daily routine of a hunter when he's not around?

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's right. It's mainly training.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't train every day.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I always think that if I don't get to see a close-up of the actual battle, I'll get sick.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Every day? Isn't it hard?

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
In my case, I've had training sessions since I was a former fighter.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But I might hurt my friends with my own trivial mistakes.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If I think about it, I'll get sick.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I see.

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's the same time as yesterday!

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Brother!

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Jin, good morning.

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I woke up.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I woke up in the dark. Take care of the car.

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The food you had yesterday is in the fridge.

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Are you feeling sick?

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Just a little bit.

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You're getting taller.

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Do you want to train too?

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Men grow up to be adults.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm off.

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Hey, I forgot my mom.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm hungry today.

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Where's my mom?

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
She's fine.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
If you're hungry, I'll get you.

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm off.

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm off.

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
See you.

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Running is after this.

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You've got muscles.

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Is it because of the status?

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
If you keep doing this, you'll become a bodybuilder.

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm still waiting for the level up point.

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Well, how do I get rid of it?

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It doesn't mean that it's not a big deal to give you damage.

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Is it speed for that?

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I've never used both muscle and speed.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm also useful.

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I think it's important to have a magic and a relationship with the brain.

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Okay, I've decided.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll do it.

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yes, it's Sonjime.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Finally.

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm sorry, I was in the hospital.

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I know. I'm sorry.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm still in the hospital.

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm still in the hospital.

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'll be waiting for you.

97
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'll be right there.

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm glad to hear that.

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm not worried about you.

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Thank you.

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I don't know if I'm the best at what I'm doing now.

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But if I can defeat Goblin in an instant,

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I should be able to make it as easy as a wild boar.

104
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
No, I can't find it that easy.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I need to go to the top of the rank gate to make money,

106
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
but I can't find a good gate or EQ Hunter.

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'll try my best.

108
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
If the rank is up, I'll be able to get a good gate.

109
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
If I'm noticed, I'll be able to get more income.

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But it's not easy to get that.

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's rare to see a new student.

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I've never heard of a Hunter who's getting stronger after the level is up.

113
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
If that's the case, I'll be able to get a good reputation.

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'll be noisy, and I'll be beaten by Del Quay.

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Stop it.

116
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm going to protect my own body.

117
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And until I get the power of the power.

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'll confirm it.

119
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Hello!

120
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm Fan Donsok.

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm Son Jin.

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Are you EQ Hunter?

123
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yes.

124
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I know this guy. He's a very famous guy.

125
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
He's a very famous guy. He's a very famous guy.

126
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
He's a very famous guy. He's a very famous guy.

127
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
He's a very famous guy. He's a very famous guy.

128
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He's a very famous guy.

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What's that?

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Hey, hey, stop it.

131
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm sorry, my friend.

132
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
No, it's true that I'm EQ Hunter.

133
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Is there any problem?

134
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's okay.

135
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm just going to help you get a lot of income.

136
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I've already called you, but I'll confirm it.

137
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
This time, there's at least 8 people to enter the CQ dungeon.

138
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
More than half of them are not allowed to enter the CQ party.

139
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Son is a war criminal, so we can't distribute the military goods,

140
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
but as a number, we'll give you 2 million yen.

141
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
There are 4 CQs and 2 DQs.

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I understand. What should we do?

143
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Please carry the luggage.

144
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
There are bento and yobi clothes and equipment inside.

145
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
There's a CQ box inside.

146
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Are you going without a healer?

147
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You know that it's hard to call a healer for an individual's attack.

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
We always do it without a healer.

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Oh, only a tank and a damage dealer's attack?

150
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That's a lot.

151
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And it takes a long time for a healer to be gone.

152
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Then please sign the contract.

153
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
If something happens in the dungeon, we'll have to follow the responsibility.

154
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Please.

155
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Thank you.

156
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Looks like we're friends.

157
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
My friend, Junho. I'm a 21-year-old DQ.

158
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I was invited by a group of friends.

159
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Oh, this is a DQ.

160
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
This guy is a real good guy.

161
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Is this your first time in a CQ dungeon?

162
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's okay. I'll protect you.

163
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Let's go!

164
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Isn't that backpack heavy? Are you okay?

165
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yes, I'm okay.

166
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm older, so please don't use my shoulder.

167
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I understand.

168
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Did you hear that?

169
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The company's president who received this job seems to have escaped abroad with $9 million before two months.

170
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
He said he was throwing a classmate and a teacher.

171
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Oh, you were talking without reading the air again?

172
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I've never asked about people's faces before.

173
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Here it is.

174
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Wow, it's a huge entrance.

175
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's rare to see such a huge one.

176
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Mr. Donso, is this really a CQ dungeon?

177
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's too big.

178
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The boss has sent the principal twice and confirmed it.

179
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's a CQ dungeon, right?

180
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The gate is very big, but is it okay?

181
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The size of the gate doesn't matter much.

182
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
The magic wave's number is the problem.

183
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The boss will measure the number first and rank it.

184
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The dangerous dungeon above the BQ is the role of a normal king-type guild.

185
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's not that dangerous.

186
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Mr. Donso, you're so smart.

187
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That's what Hunter's history is.

188
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I said that, but I've never been to a CQ dungeon.

189
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Please follow me.

190
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yes, Mr. Donso.

191
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm going.

192
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Okay, I understand.

193
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Give me a light, Gifan.

194
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yes.

195
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What is this place?

196
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
There's no monsters.

197
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
There's no light.

198
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The dungeon has a night stone.

199
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
A dark dungeon.

200
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I can't remember the dead body of the cult.

201
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Mr. Jin, what is a night stone?

202
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yes.

203
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
A night stone is a stone with a thin light that can be seen often in the cave dungeon.

204
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's surrounded by walls and stones like this and illuminates the cave.

205
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Well, the magic stone that can be taken from the monster's body.

206
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
The magic stone that can be removed from the dungeon.

207
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The night stone that illuminates the cave.

208
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Something's wrong.

209
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I can get used to it soon.

210
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
But there's nothing.

211
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Mr. Jin, is there a monster's inside the dungeon?

212
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
This sound...

213
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's not inside.

214
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's just that it hasn't shown its form yet.

215
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Take this!

216
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yes!

217
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's a creature that can be seen through the darkness without any light.

218
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's a monster of the Cunche type!

219
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Damn it!

220
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Mr. Donso, can you see anything?

221
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
No, I can't see anything.

222
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I can't believe it! It's a monster of the Cunche type!

223
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's a monster of the Cunche type!

224
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The sound is coming from the distance!

225
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Where are you coming from?

226
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's too big!

227
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Don't move!

228
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That's the power of the monster!

229
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yes!

230
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Mr. Jin, please don't leave my side.

231
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
This way!

232
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You're dead!

233
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Wow, all the monsters are fighting against the monster!

234
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
The super-powerful skill...

235
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's a very effective hand.

236
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Mr. Jin, please move to the right!

237
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Roger that.

238
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm still down!

239
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'll go to the counter!

240
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, go!

241
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's coming!

242
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Take this!

243
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Alright! I'll attack you!

244
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I've been waiting for you!

245
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's a good form of training.

246
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I know that you've been doing this for a long time.

247
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
But, you've been a healer for a long time.

248
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You're a little weak.

249
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Mr. Jin, you're probably getting better at fighting.

250
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You're doing well, but...

251
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What?

252
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's still a bit long.

253
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Is this the last one?

254
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Mr. Jin!

255
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yes, the enemy is down.

256
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I've cleared it.

257
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Alright, finish it!

258
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
If you bring back all the magic stones, it's a tie!

259
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Yes!

260
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
This moment is the happiest moment.

261
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You saved me earlier.

262
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I thought you'd be late for the discovery.

263
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
No.

264
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
How did you know that it's coming from above?

265
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's a ship.

266
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's a very sharp sword.

267
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Mr. Jin!

268
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Look at this!

269
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
These are the wounds.

270
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
They're not the sword's sharpness.

271
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's not like they're the magic burners.

272
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's not like they're the ones who died because they were bitten by a sword.

273
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Did you do a monster fight at the same time?

274
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So, you mean there's a stronger monster than these guys?

275
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Oh, I think this monster is the one who's going to feed the monsters.

276
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Did you see how I'm going to kill a monster?

277
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yeah.

278
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Mr. Jin, you must have done a lot with that sword.

279
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Yes, it's my first time, so my father bought me a good one.

280
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I see.

281
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I can't explain it well, but you should be careful.

282
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What?

283
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What's going on?

284
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Are you going to explode?

285
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Calm down.

286
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
This is a good one.

287
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Yeah.

288
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The guild master is training.

289
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Wow, he's hitting such a big rock.

290
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
He's going to be a tough guy.

291
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Hey, someone please clean up.

292
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's been a long time.

293
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The size of the dungeon is...

294
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It doesn't have anything to do with the rank.

295
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It was a magic wave.

296
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
So, this dungeon is big, but it's a bit small.

297
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I guess so.

298
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
But it's hard to keep the size of the dungeon.

299
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Mr. Jin, are you okay?

300
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I've never been this much.

301
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's not bad to be able to get an audience without fighting.

302
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's not bad.

303
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
No, it's too good.

304
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Something is going to happen.

305
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
There's no need to be a part of the history battle.

306
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
We need to combine.

307
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You're going to be a shadow for me?

308
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Nice.

309
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's strange to be a shadow.

310
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I've been walking a lot, but I haven't seen a single monster yet.

311
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I've been dying from the dead.

312
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Boss is somewhere.

313
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
If he's not here, the gate won't open.

314
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Wait.

315
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Gio, light up the light.

316
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Yes.

317
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I think this is the boss's room.

318
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Let's go.

319
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
This is amazing!

320
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Isn't it a magic gem?

321
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm so tired!

322
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I can't sleep as much as a magic gem,

323
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
but I can't sleep as much as this.

324
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Donsoc, you're going to have to use your fingers to do this.

325
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Hey, don't you dare to talk about your brother!

326
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Donsoc, you said it, right?

327
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's not always the right thing to do.

328
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Donsoc, you're always the brother who's been a brother to your brother.

329
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'll make this guy's own attack team bigger.

330
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Wait.

331
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm going to kill you.

332
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'll make my own attack team bigger.

333
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You're so stupid.

334
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
If you divide it into seven, it's over 1 billion.

335
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
How can you carry it?

336
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Gino, show me the contract you signed.

337
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'll go through it in detail.

338
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Okay.

339
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Excuse me, can I have a minute?

340
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
What?

341
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
This is Gino's contract,

342
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
but it's only written about the distribution of the goods.

343
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
The Mana House is a product of the export,

344
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
so it's not seven, but eight.

345
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Of course.

346
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Let's split it into eight.

347
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I know that.

348
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
But before that, we have to finish that.

349
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Dungeon Boss!

350
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You know, the gate is closed when you defeat the boss.

351
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You have to dig the Mana House before you defeat that spider.

352
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm sleeping with a bad idea,

353
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
and I might have a chance to win.

354
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Cho, give me the equipment.

355
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I didn't think there would be so many Mana House.

356
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'll put the equipment in the car.

357
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Hey, you're always saying that you're going to carry it.

358
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm sorry.

359
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm sorry, but can you two look after this place?

360
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'll go get the equipment.

361
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
What? You're the boss's room, but only me and Gino?

362
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's okay. I'm really sleepy.

363
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
If I don't attack, I won't be able to get up for a while.

364
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
But...

365
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You were in the first battle of Raid.

366
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You were the first one to attack the CQ Dungeon, right?

367
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Please trust me.

368
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
That's great.

369
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I have something to tell my members, so I'll go get them.

370
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's a plan.

371
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
We need eight people to attack the CQ Dungeon.

372
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
If you look after Jinho and me, six people will be in the attack team.

373
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'll always be without healers.

374
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You always say that, but you've never experienced the CQ Dungeon.

375
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
There are people who use it for a few times in a row.

376
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Gyuhan, you're going to be in the boss's room.

377
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Hmph.

378
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
What? Why are they in the entrance?

379
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Did they betray them?

380
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I knew it. They're...

381
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
There are people who are sometimes not even six.

382
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's a dangerous job, so it's a daily job.

383
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
However, no matter what happens,

384
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
we don't have to be in the world, so we don't have to be punished.

385
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
There's no security camera in the dungeon,

386
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
and if we kill everyone, we'll be out of the way.

387
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
We'll take the weak and run away with the weak.

388
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It's a big mistake.

389
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
This is to kill us for the sake of the Potsch's money.

390
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
If I hadn't said something like a contract,

391
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
No, let's do it anyway.

392
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
If we move to the bottom, we'll be killed soon.

393
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
More importantly...

394
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Please go back to the dungeon. I'll do something.

395
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
If you think it's going to work, you can get out of there.

396
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Is that what the fans want?

397
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Roy!

398
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Eat Q Hunter EQ Hunter.

399
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Everything is very big.

400
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
roof

401
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I won't move.

402
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,200
W-what just happened?

403
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,780
I'm going to defeat you.

404
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'm a little bit more mature

405
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,500
I'm the most confident person

406
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,000
Tell me, is there enough?

407
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,500
Is there enough of a story?

408
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:44,500
I'll try to take a picture of myself that I can't show you

409
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,500
Request Request

410
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,000
The voice of the heart

411
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Request Request

412
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,500
The strong heart

413
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
The voice of the heart

414
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,500
Request Request

415
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,500
The mirror, the mirror

416
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,500
Do you believe?

417
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,500
I am me

418
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,500
The hidden truth

419
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,500
The color of the heart

420
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,500
I crush the fear

421
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,500
I can't escape the feeling of being lost

422
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
I crush myself

423
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,500
I crush myself

424
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,500
I'm the one who caught you

425
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,500
Endless question

426
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
Endless question

427
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,500
Next time, Request Request

428
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
I won't stop
