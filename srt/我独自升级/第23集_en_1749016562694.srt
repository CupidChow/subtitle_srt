1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Happy Holux

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Happy Holux

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
There's something!

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Be careful!

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I know!

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You bastard!

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Kendo!

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What's wrong?

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But I'm really waiting for revenge

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm just going to get a little bit of revenge

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Thank you office bitch, you're out

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Statue of a living body count

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Two, three, cut the port, and go

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yeah, the day of the 21st century, go

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Give back the light, it gave me one

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm pleased you guess no, you're my only

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Cuz I'm back here, this game is so red, let's go

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
A new scenario, it's true

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Cuz I'm back here, this game, we can survive

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The one who's more brave, especially the one who's right

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The day is silent

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Two, three, one game, one game, one scene

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You never go away

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Two, three, cut the port, and go

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Give back the light, it gave me one

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm pleased you guess no, you're my only

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Cuz I'm back here, this game is so red, let's go

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
A new scenario, it's true

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Cuz I'm back here, this game, we can survive

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
One touch, I'm getting the wrong

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Cuz I'm back here, this game is so red, let's go

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You never go away

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Two, three, one game, one scene

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
One, two, three, one game, one scene

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You never go away

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Two, three, one game, one scene

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You never go away

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Two, three, one game, one scene

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You never go away

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Two, three, one game, one scene

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You never go away

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Two, three, one game, one scene

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You never go away

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Two, three, one game, one scene

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You never go away

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Two, three, one game, one scene

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You never go away

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Two, three, one game, one scene

50
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,880
This area is quite hard

51
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,360
They areشot a lot of wind

52
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,360
It's okay to beors that areOK

53
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,360
I'll support you from behind. Don't worry.

54
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,360
I can't believe the words he said about the battle.

55
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,360
That's right, Yunho.

56
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,360
Are you a beginner?

57
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,360
Don't forget that they'll be alive even if you crush their heads.

58
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,360
You should be careful not to use your hands and feet.

59
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,360
Oh.

60
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,360
You're getting stronger and stronger, but you haven't even gone two-way yet.

61
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,360
Yes, probably, but you've been abandoned by the Queen's immediate relatives.

62
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,360
You're still in a hurry. Are you really meeting with her?

63
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,360
I think so.

64
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,360
Hey!

65
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,360
It's okay. I can smell a powerful monster from behind.

66
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,360
If you're that far away, you'll be able to see the Commander of the Reckless.

67
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,360
Yes.

68
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,360
Daku.

69
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,360
Is that it?

70
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,360
The Queen is the farthest away. She's protected by a number of soldiers.

71
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,360
There's a limit to the fact that the forces of the Reckless are outside.

72
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,360
There are a number of soldiers of the S9 Navy in the farthest away.

73
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,360
The Queen's strength and the way of fighting will be tough.

74
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,360
However, if you're a member of this team, you'll win.

75
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,360
Let's go!

76
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,360
Yes, sir!

77
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,360
Let's go!

78
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,360
I saw the area around here because Charlie and I couldn't reach them.

79
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,360
They went through the door.

80
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,360
They seem to be killing the Reckless without any problems.

81
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,360
The glasses of Fujishima.

82
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,360
No way!

83
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,360
What's wrong?

84
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,360
What's the smell of these flowers?

85
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,360
I've never bought anything so far away.

86
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,360
Where's Charlie's contact?

87
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,360
He's not here yet.

88
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,360
Did something happen?

89
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,360
There's no time to worry about the others.

90
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,360
We'll fight properly this time.

91
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,360
No way.

92
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,360
This is a big sight.

93
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,360
Then let's answer this in the preparation of the King of the Reckless.

94
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,360
I'll be back.

95
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,360
As you wish.

96
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,360
I'm sorry to have to ask you, but you're the last soldier of the S9 Navy.

97
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,360
I'm proud of you.

98
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,360
I'm the one who's against you!

99
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,360
I don't usually use my strength here.

100
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,360
I have to get everything out today.

101
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,360
That's right.

102
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,360
You don't need to use your strength.

103
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,360
Even if you're a ugly figure,

104
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,360
I'll kill all of you, you bastards!

105
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,360
I'll kill you!

106
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,360
That's...

107
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
the beast of the Reckless.

108
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,360
It's started.

109
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,360
The land rate has exceeded 80%.

110
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,360
Come out before you can see it!

111
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,360
The land rate is 80%?!

112
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,360
I have to answer the expectations.

113
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,360
This is the boss room of the S9 Navy.

114
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,360
Do you want to die?

115
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,360
No way!

116
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,360
Stay behind me.

117
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,360
It's going to be intense from now on.

118
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,360
Look!

119
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:07,360
The S9 hunters who have finally reached the end of the world are now spreading a fierce battle to defeat the enemy.

120
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:14,360
The S9 hunters who don't fight together usually put together a fierce group of attacks.

121
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:27,360
The S9 hunters who don't fight together usually put together a fierce group of attacks.

122
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:37,360
The S9 hunters who don't fight together usually put together a fierce group of attacks.

123
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:47,360
The S9 hunters who don't fight together usually put together a fierce group of attacks.

124
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:57,360
The S9 hunters who don't fight together usually put together a fierce group of attacks.

125
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:07,360
The S9 hunters who don't go to the end of the world put together a fierce group of attacks.

126
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
And!

127
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:17,360
The S9 hunters who don't fight together usually put together a fierce group of attacks.

128
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:25,360
The S9 hunter who has come to the end of the world put together a fierce group of attacks.

129
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,360
I'll finish the last 5A!

130
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,360
Now! I'll finish him in one go!

131
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,360
Eat this!

132
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,360
I'll finish him in one go!

133
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,360
I'll finish him in one go!

134
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,360
This is the first time I've ever seen you!

135
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,360
How many times have I told you to stop fighting?

136
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,360
I'll finish him in one go!

137
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,360
I won't let you get close to me!

138
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,360
Please keep that in mind!

139
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,360
I'll finish him in one go!

140
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,360
Is this how much power you still have?

141
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,360
Damo-tsu, no, something's wrong.

142
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
Let me go!

143
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,360
I'll finish him in one go!

144
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,360
I'll finish him in one go!

145
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,360
Who are you?

146
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,360
No!

147
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,360
I did it!

148
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,360
Captain!

149
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,360
You've been trying to kill me.

150
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,360
It's over, right?

151
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,360
Of course.

152
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,360
If you die, the rest of the animals will disappear in one year.

153
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,360
That's why I'm going back to the human realm.

154
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,360
But, I'll be back in the end.

155
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,360
That scream...

156
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,360
What are you saying?

157
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,360
I defeated that super demon, Ryo!

158
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,360
I took your sword!

159
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,360
That's right.

160
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,360
It's a big change.

161
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,360
The animals are heading towards the river.

162
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
What?

163
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,360
I can't hear the sound of the sound.

164
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
Something's happening.

165
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Get some information and report it.

166
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,360
The monster's prison is being destroyed.

167
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,360
What's going on?

168
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,360
It's still early in the forecast!

169
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,360
I didn't know that you were going beyond the river.

170
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,360
Did you call your friends?

171
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,360
No, but the animals outside can't break the standard.

172
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,360
Then, something's coming.

173
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,360
A ghost Circum~~~~

174
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:55,420
THE bluetooth

175
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:01,260
Three second TUNE

176
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,360
The smell of the iron ore is so strong that I can't even breathe.

177
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,360
What do you mean?

178
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,360
That's not just a monster!

179
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,360
I don't have time to waste.

180
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,360
I'll have to kill him.

181
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,360
He went through the tunnel.

182
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,360
I'll kill him.

183
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,360
Destroy!

184
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:50,360
Who Wants

185
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,620
luggage

186
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,580
a

187
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,260
poder

188
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:59,980
blood

189
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,140
until

190
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:07,060
the котором

191
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:11,440
omnd

192
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,660
me

193
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,100
Get up !

194
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,120
Get out!

195
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,700
Hiding you!?

196
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,660
This is gonna come back!

197
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,660
I'm using my body...

198
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,660
...but I can't believe it!

199
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,660
Biog!

200
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,660
Biog!

201
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,660
Yunho...

202
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,660
...is running away.

203
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,660
Biog!

204
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,660
Yunho...

205
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,660
...is running away.

206
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,660
Yunho...

207
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,660
...is running away.

208
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,660
Run away...

209
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,660
...you bastard!

210
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:32,660
You guys are weak.

211
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,660
This is...

212
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:38,660
...the enemy who was killed by the queen.

213
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:43,660
You can't take the risk of killing the soldiers.

214
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:49,660
Where is the queen of you guys?

215
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,660
Be careful, Bebe.

216
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,660
You're gonna get stabbed.

217
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,660
Be careful...

218
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,660
...about the queen.

219
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,660
No, I'll think about it later.

220
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,660
I'll have to get out of here right away.

221
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,660
Damn it, he's back.

222
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,660
It's strange.

223
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,660
Not only Charlie, but Delta is also not in contact with him.

224
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,660
I wonder if the radio is bad.

225
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,660
But he should be in the communication distance.

226
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,660
Bravo, drop the gun.

227
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,660
This is Bravo.

228
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,660
Can you contact Charlie and Delta?

229
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,660
No, this is not connected from before either.

230
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,660
Let's look at the situation.

231
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,660
We're heading there now.

232
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,660
If you're clear, wait at the meeting point.

233
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,660
I understand.

234
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,660
What?

235
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,660
What?

236
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,660
We're here.

237
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,660
It seems that the enemy communication is getting late.

238
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,660
The viewers have come.

239
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,660
Oh, that's a good thing to do.

240
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:17,660
You're only going to be in the editing department to avoid the risk.

241
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,660
They're just weak.

242
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,660
It's a strange situation.

243
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:27,660
Well, if you're here, there's no problem with the number of people.

244
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,660
Is the queen's place over there?

245
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,660
Yes.

246
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:35,660
But the outside of the castle is free of charge.

247
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:39,660
The outside of the castle is confirmed to return to the queen's place.

248
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,660
So the probability of them surviving from there is...

249
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:48,660
That strategy is 0%.

250
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,660
Good.

251
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:55,660
We Japan have lost all our forces, but we have no power left.

252
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,660
We have to retreat.

253
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:03,660
After that, the second enemy that is waiting at the meeting point is attacking the Jujutsu Island.

254
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:09,660
We are going to destroy the SQ gate while attacking the Jujutsu Island.

255
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:15,660
All of you, please move to the meeting point.

256
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,660
Well, that's fine.

257
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,660
The command has been dropped from the president.

258
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,660
We're going to retreat.

259
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,660
The return of the two bodies is later.

260
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,660
Ishida!

261
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,660
Go!

262
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,660
Go to the meeting point with Bravo.

263
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,660
Then, you'll be in trouble.

264
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,660
But...

265
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,660
You'll be in trouble if you're left here.

266
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,660
Go.

267
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,660
Roger.

268
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,660
You're so rude, Yora.

269
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,660
You're the king?

270
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,660
Interesting.

271
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,660
You're talking to me.

272
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:02,660
Oh, that's right. I'm the king.

273
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,660
What is this magic power?

274
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:14,660
I've tasted this feeling before.

275
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,660
This is...

276
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,660
The Jujutsu Island

277
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,660
Jujutsu, give me some money.

278
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,660
Please don't say that.

279
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,660
This is the limit.

280
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,660
Everyone is chasing the command.

281
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,660
There's no need to stand back.

282
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,660
The Tsunami's Chie is...

283
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,660
Not yet.

284
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:01,660
What is this black magic power?

285
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,660
Change.

286
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,660
The most dangerous of all.

287
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,660
My demonstration.

288
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,660
The condition that can be seen from the bottom.

289
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,660
The taste is extinct.

290
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,660
A sharp skill.

291
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,660
A sharp face.

292
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,660
A new situation.

293
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,660
A sharp skill.

294
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,660
A long time.

295
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,660
I don't have a weapon.

296
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,660
I'm sorry.

297
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,660
Sorry, sorry.

298
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,660
I'll leave you alone.

299
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,660
I'll be there soon.

300
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,660
Goodbye, goodbye.

301
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,660
We just like my world.

302
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,660
No one is going to leave.

303
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,660
Good night.

304
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,660
I'm not afraid.

305
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,660
We're gonna be good.

306
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,660
The End
