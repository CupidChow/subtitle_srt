1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
All those days are yet, there's no real in, ceiling

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Let's get it, so give it yourself, give it yourself, don't mind it

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Give it yourself, give it yourself, don't mind it

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's important, so no, what you gonna get?

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's very important, so no, give it your best shot

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Give it yourself, give it yourself, don't mind it

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Give it yourself, give it yourself, don't mind it

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Give it yourself, give it yourself, don't mind it

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Game over, but they give it all to streetcodes

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Little kitty in the gutter with the body rolls

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Undercover body doesn't even beat rules

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The headlines, the head runs

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So we got a body, I'm got an ankle

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Boke a bird and it came from a zero

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Everybody we can punch, my's the power grows

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
In rows, let's get it

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Excuse me, sir

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What's wrong?

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Please take a look at this

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Six of us fought in the raid of CQ Dungeon last night

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The survivors were the hunters of DQ and EQ

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You escaped, right?

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's what happens often

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But they came out to defeat the boss

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The DQ's hero, the Jingo Hunter, was equipped with a very powerful weapon

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So it's impossible to get rid of it

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What do you mean?

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You should be able to find out the exact date

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
No, actually, the other survivor was the hunter who survived in the previous Dungeon

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The hunter?

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And one of the six survivors was the Phantom Suc Hunter

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The brother of the Phantom Suc Hunter?

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That's true, he's caught up with us

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm home

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Welcome home

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Oh, a souvenir?

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Fried chicken!

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Did something good happen?

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't know if it's good or not

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll make sure to save my mother's life and her health

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's rare to see a dangerous brother like him

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
By the way

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What was the feeling like when you came in?

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Hm?

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The raid was very popular, right?

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I didn't get hurt that much

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So I thought the members were strong

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Well, I guess so

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Then it was easy to get rid of enemies

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It was indeed easy

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The difference in power was not so great

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
At that moment, I didn't have much of a reason to do it

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
In fact, you and I were the ones who were in the same team

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I should have looked for a way to escape without making a mistake

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Did you get a big deal of your energy by leveling up?

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But the opponent is not a monster

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He's a human

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Brother?

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Are you okay? Are you feeling bad?

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I think I forgot to get a gift, but I made a mistake

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What? You're already surprised

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm fine now

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The important thing is to become stronger for my family

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And to not die

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Even if the same situation comes, I'll do it

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Hm? What?

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The foreign government?

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The prison?

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Thank you for the meal

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Hm?

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Eh? You already ate all of them?

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Don't say that I'm fat again

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I can't say it at all

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The system's special ability is breaking down alcohol

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Is it some kind of effect?

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Ah...

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Resurrection...

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
A healthy day

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's because I've been damaged

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's a very common effect on the poison

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This is it

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The reward for the 20th dungeon

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I didn't check it because I was too angry

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Is it because of this that I lost the game?

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I still don't know much about it

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Brother, I'm calling from the person named Yu-jin-ho

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm going now

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You're too drunk. You're poison to your body

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm fine

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I can't even look at you when you're together

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm sorry, I called you all of a sudden

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I didn't think I'd see you again

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm happy! I'm the cause of your life

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Well, I was saved by the magic stone

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And you're still being so quiet about that time

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That's...

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
They were trying to kill me first, right?

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's a sexual harassment

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So, what's the message?

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Brother, I'm actually going to attack you

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I have a question

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Eh? Um, until the end...

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I don't intend to play with you

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
20! No, I only want to play with you for the 19th time

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
19th time?

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I can't believe it, for the guild master

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Just listen to me, please!

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So...

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yes!

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
As you requested, I want to take care of the guild master

111
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The only condition for that is that the hunter is more than 20 times more experienced than the raid

112
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The first time was the day before that

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I've only studied to get the company, so I'm confident in my work

114
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But...

115
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So, that's the reason why you're looking for a friend

116
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I want to be a guild master because of the company

117
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Actually, my father is trying to make a guild

118
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
A guild friend?

119
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yes

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The dungeon is dangerous, and there are many treasures that are still in the dungeon

121
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The magic and the mana ore are only a part of it

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The damage of the upper-level monsters can be used in various materials

123
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The ones inside the dungeon can be used as money

124
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
In other words, the hunter who is the company's owner will be able to make a guild master and get the reward

125
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Is the time-lapse time the purpose?

126
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That's right

127
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
My father is using SQ Hunter as a master and I'm going to leave my brother to the master and make a guild like a company

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Only seven SQ hunters are in the country

129
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yes

130
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And the only one who has not entered the guild, Ming Yong Hunter, has already retired

131
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Don't tell me you're going to withdraw from the guild?

132
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's better to stop it

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm going to buy the back of the guild that has been withdrawn

134
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
My brother is not a revolutionary, so I can't become a master

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So you're going to be a master and fight your brother?

136
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Brother, you need a friend to join the raid while hiding your own strength

137
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm also a rank-high hunter, so it's easier to convince my father that I'm a SQ Hunter and make a raid

138
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
My brother is a BQ

139
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
No, I have more power

140
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
If I apologize for my brother's life, I'll be in danger

141
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
This is a building that will be used as a guild's office

142
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The current time-lapse time is 300 billion

143
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's a raid reward for my brother

144
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
300 billion in the CQ Raid 19 times

145
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
If this is so far, it will be a fast-growing price

146
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
However, the situation where I can level up is different

147
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'll be able to continue growing like this

148
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'll be able to save it someday

149
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
No, I might be able to aim for it more than that

150
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
If you think about it, it's a 300 billion-hp gun

151
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:29,000
More than anything, the risk is high that others will not know how to influence me

152
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm sorry

153
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Wait a minute

154
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
If you cooperate, I'll make my brother's life a secret

155
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I want to know the two remaining information

156
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Bring the data right away

157
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Excuse me

158
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I've brought it

159
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Mr. Fan

160
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
My brother was killed

161
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What's the secret?

162
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
The data

163
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yes, here

164
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Laura, what if I kill someone I know?

165
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Are you serious?

166
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
If the country where the contract of withdrawal is determined is a crime, it will be taken away by the local authorities

167
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But if not, it will be taken away by the country

168
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
In other words

169
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The government's policy is to make a request

170
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Please make a schedule

171
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The sudden change of plans will be issued to the guild's business

172
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
How long will it take?

173
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Until a while

174
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'll hold you back

175
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I've made a promise

176
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'll make it on time

177
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
DQ Hunter Yu Jin-ho

178
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
E-Q Hunter Son Jin-ho

179
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I just want to live until then

180
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm sorry

181
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm sorry

182
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's rare for you to move your body

183
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's bad for your body if you're studying

184
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What? You eat too much chicken

185
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Hey, what if you get 300 million yen?

186
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What do you mean?

187
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's a pity

188
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'll go to college with your treatment

189
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
After?

190
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I don't know the real deal

191
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You're coming at your own pace

192
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Hey, brother

193
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You're a hunter at E-Q

194
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yes

195
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
No, no

196
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
11 kilometers?

197
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Why is the distance more than the target?

198
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I see

199
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'll try to go as far as I can

200
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Brother

201
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I did it

202
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm sorry

203
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm sorry

204
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I did it

205
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm so tired

206
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'll run a little more

207
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I just stopped at the second place

208
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'll stay

209
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Did the daily quest change to a secret quest?

210
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yes

211
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
A random box for the selection

212
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Well, it's a random box that was first restored

213
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Again?

214
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The devil's castle

215
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
NUSINAID S

216
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'll heal you with a powerful magic

217
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
The life's essence

218
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
If you can really heal the disease

219
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm sure

220
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'll use the key to hide the dungeon

221
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'll open the dungeon with this

222
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
SQ

223
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'll open the dungeon with this

224
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
SQ

225
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'll open the dungeon with this

226
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
SQ

227
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
If that's the case

228
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
The SQ hunters are waiting for the Jeju Island level

229
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That's what happened

230
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I wonder if I can communicate with the monsters

231
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
about such an incident

232
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
If I say I'm not afraid, I'll be a liar

233
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
When it's really dangerous

234
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I should use the key to hide the dungeon

235
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
If I give up, that's it

236
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'll become stronger

237
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'll level up more

238
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'll take everything back

239
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't want to live here

240
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Sw担

241
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
The door will open

242
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I answered that

243
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm afraid they get me

244
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'll fight them

245
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I don't feel like there's any damage

246
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
There's a small trap in this

247
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,500
How could you?

248
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Japanese

249
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Two times in the hole!

250
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
That was fast.

251
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Half of it!

252
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I can't believe it!

253
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'll show you what I got!

254
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I got it!

255
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I got it!

256
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'll show you what I got!

257
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
The police!

258
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I can't believe I'm in such a bad situation.

259
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm a player!

260
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm not a normal player who thinks like that!

261
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
If I can't get through the three-part anger,

262
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I can't do it. It's too dangerous!

263
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I have to use it.

264
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
How can I survive?

265
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'll finish it by making a few more.

266
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
What's the plan?

267
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I forgot the store!

268
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
One, three hundred, three five hundred.

269
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
One hundred and one hundred.

270
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I can't do it.

271
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I can't do it.

272
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's too much. It's poisonous to the body.

273
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm fine.

274
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I have to do it.

275
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I can't do it.

276
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I got it.

277
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's not over yet.

278
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It's not over yet.

279
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I can't do it.

280
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I can't do it.

281
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I can't do it.

282
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I can't do it.

283
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I can't do it.

284
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Is it a secret item?

285
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It's again...

286
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Is it something that Cerberus protected?

287
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What?

288
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The curse of life?

289
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I found out my strength this time.

290
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
If I go to the castle as it is, I'll definitely die.

291
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
But...

292
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'll come back as soon as I get there.

293
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I promise.

294
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'll catch you.

295
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'll paint the edge of despair.

296
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I'll paint the weakness.

297
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I'll crush you.

298
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'll break you.

299
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'll break you.

300
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'll break you.

301
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'll break you.

302
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'll break you.

303
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'll break you.

304
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I'll break you.

305
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'll break you.

306
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'll break you.

307
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'll break you.

308
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'll break you.

309
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'll break you.

310
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'll break you.

311
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I'll break you.

312
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'll break you.

313
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'll break you.

314
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I'll break you.

315
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'll break you.

316
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'll break you.

317
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'll break you.

318
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I'll break you.
