1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next day

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Happy Holidays

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The next day

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The next day

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The next day

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The next day

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The next day

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The next day

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hey, look at that!

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's the 100th guild's back-up!

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Let's go to the top of the Hunter's Guild!

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I've gathered with Yatara.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What's the matter with him today?

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Did you two have a scout with you?

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Who's Minson?

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's not like he came here because of that sword.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sure you know that Minson signed with Shinigami Guild,

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
but today is a different story.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What is it?

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I thought it was a story.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm so disappointed.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I heard about it.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It was a lot of trouble for the AQ Gate and the SQ.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
No, no.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's not as bad as the 100th gate that lost the new AQ.

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I heard that it was a place where a scout was involved.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
He stopped it.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
To get to that point,

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
if we hunters couldn't welcome him,

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
you idiot!

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We're the same here.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We're even out of the bloodline!

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What are you going to do with the SQ?

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Are you going to start?

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'll return the words as they are.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
No!

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh, it's a good thing you're here.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Hey, did you two come here to get Minson?

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That's why I'm not interested in Minson or Min-kun!

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You guys are so selfish.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I came to the final destination, but what is this?

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm going to the final destination, but what is this?

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Look, look! It's Minson's experience!

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's the story?

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It seems like a woman's play is terrible.

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What is this?

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I can't read it.

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Thank you for joining us today.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
As you all know, I, Minson, have been a hunter.

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And I will be a rank judge from now on.

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I've been in trouble since the day I was raised.

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But I've decided to meet the fate given to me.

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I will fight the dead guild, the guild master, and the dog master!

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So that means you're a criminal?

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I've been working on it all the time before I found out.

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I see. You've already been a rank judge.

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I've been working on it since two years ago.

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I've been doing hunter work.

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Scandal is a criminal, and he's a heroine.

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm going to the training camp.

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
No matter what rank you meet, I'm going to fight monsters with my life!

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Hunter!

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Can't you see the police?

91
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm in the way, so go over there!

92
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
No, I have a strong will.

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You're going to die!

94
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What is this guy who can't read the air?

95
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The air is going to stop from here. Go over there!

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I don't want it to stop at the same time.

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Chief Go!

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He's my guest.

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I should have asked you to be the center of the conversation at this hour.

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Please, Son Hunter.

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What's wrong with this air?

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Excuse me, everyone. I'll check it out.

103
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The other people are taking the fastest rank.

104
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You can't enter until the trial is over.

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Hey, do you know who I am?

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
If I say something, you'll be in trouble.

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I don't know who you are, but I'm sorry to bother you around here.

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's not an intention to interfere.

109
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Those two were waiting for you to hear about today.

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
They must be interested in the power of the SQ Hunter that appeared in the second year.

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Please check the ability of the Hunter in the fastest order.

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What kind of power does Son Hunter use?

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I can do this.

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Is this a summoning spell?

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Well, it's like that.

116
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Son Hunter, I'm receiving a report from Chief Go.

117
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I didn't expect that to happen.

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I see. I wish I could be seen.

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I can give you about 100 more.

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
100? I can't believe it!

121
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What a powerful spell.

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'll be crushed.

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This is the power of Son Hunter.

124
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Thank you for your hard work.

125
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The final test is over.

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This is the new Hunter's show.

127
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
All right. I'll sell the horse without being suspicious.

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'll make the money and equip it.

129
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'll attack the devil's castle this time.

130
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
This is the SQ Hunter that you will be using with Meijitsu.

131
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm looking forward to seeing what you can do with that power.

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Congratulations on the SQ's judgment.

133
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Can you please say thanks again for the previous test?

134
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I have a story to tell you.

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Can you give me some time?

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm sorry. I have a plan.

137
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Over there!

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What is it?

139
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Hey.

140
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Hey.

141
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Hey.

142
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Jinku.

143
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Jinan's brother is coming out.

144
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
No way. Why?

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
He really said no.

146
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That's why he said it.

147
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He's blinded by killing people.

148
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What kind of cruel incident did you do?

149
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The SQ Hunter has been officially certified as SQ.

150
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The data bank has been updated.

151
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It seems that the SQ Hunter has no official evidence.

152
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The SQ Hunter has been certified as SQ.

153
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The data bank has been updated.

154
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It will be released in two years.

155
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What the hell?

156
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
My back...

157
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I couldn't let you turn the SQ.

158
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I see.

159
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I still have to do it alone.

161
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I want to fight more and become stronger for that.

162
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I want to be able to get along with some organization.

163
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Jinku.

164
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That's why I...

165
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So, you came to me?

166
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I know how much you hate me.

167
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I had originally planned this for Jinson.

168
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You came in from the side and cut off all that tank.

169
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You left everything behind and went back to the side.

170
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's not like that.

171
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm sorry, father.

172
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But I will go to where you are.

173
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Then, I will be the one to cut off all that.

174
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Please come back.

175
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Please come back.

176
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Don't come back.

177
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I heard that you will come back.

178
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Let's send them to the capital.

179
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's okay.

180
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Even though you have a great physical ability, you are a magical hunter.

182
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
President Bekusha.

183
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You are so fast.

184
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You are stronger than before.

185
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What do you mean?

186
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Next is the equipment.

187
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The Sun Hunter has been waiting for you.

188
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The artifact that prevents the tragedy is here.

189
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
By the way, what is your purpose?

190
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I want to protect the body from the dungeon's heat.

191
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I see. Then, how about this?

192
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The ring that can be equipped with a coat of clothing and a coat of coat.

193
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
That's good.

194
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The price is about this much.

195
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The price is...

196
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm sorry, but I'm doing it for the price.

197
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But if the customer can break this glass,

198
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't mind.

199
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm using a special glass that is specially rated in the temple.

200
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Me?

201
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I can feel the magic, but I can't feel it yet.

202
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Wait a minute.

203
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
This is a joke.

204
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
If we have abnormal vibration, the guards will fly away.

205
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Oh, I see. I'm sorry.

206
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
No, no. This is a joke.

207
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Well, I'd like to see something else, but I'll take a look.

208
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Then, I'll guide you to the weapon control.

209
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
This way, please.

210
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I didn't know you were not here.

211
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
How much is this?

212
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
If it's that much, it'll be this much.

213
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
This is about the price of the holy fire.

214
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Then...

215
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Customer?

216
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
How much is this?

217
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
This is...

218
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I can feel the details of the customer.

219
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
No, it's just a normal store.

220
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I think it's about 1 million.

221
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What?

222
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
2.8 million gold?

223
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The one I bought at the store is this price.

224
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I might have to pay for the price.

225
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Can I borrow your hand?

226
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yes.

227
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I knew he was strong.

228
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
But that's not the case.

229
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
That magic power that came from the check box,

230
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
and the physical ability,

231
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
the re-emergency is almost over.

232
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Is it possible that it will get even stronger from there?

233
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Oh, it's not re-emergency.

234
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's a hunter that can grow continuously.

235
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Is it?

236
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I finally got rid of it.

237
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I can go to school with this.

238
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Masukomi, the church has treated you.

239
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
If you're going to be on TV, do it properly.

240
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Don't pay attention to the convenience.

241
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Even if you're told by me, it's a mess.

242
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'll open the house for about a week tomorrow.

243
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Oh, again? Why?

244
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm sorry.

245
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What? Why?

246
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm sorry.

247
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The priest, the priest, has just arrived.

248
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Do you know him?

249
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yes, he's my sister.

250
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
He's my brother's unmarried priest.

251
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm going to work with him for a week tomorrow.

252
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What? Tomorrow?

253
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
What do you mean?

254
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm going to work.

255
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Tomorrow is the most important thing.

256
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm sorry I'm late.

257
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I have a problem with Masukomi.

258
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Come out.

259
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Huh?

260
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Did you call the church of the church?

261
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
What's the other one?

262
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Oh, I couldn't find the shadow of the shadow on the ceiling.

263
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Well, I'm strong enough to be able to do three.

264
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'll put two on you and ask for Jina's help.

265
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm counting on you.

266
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'll take care of the blood pressure.

267
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Start the sightseeing.

268
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Can I have a little of this?

269
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'll take care of it.

270
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Thank you for stopping me last night.

271
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
That's good, but what are you going to do from today?

272
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You said you didn't have to go home.

273
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm a self-proclaimed thief.

274
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
What kind of job is it in the DS Tower?

275
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I told you yesterday that I'd open a house for a week.

276
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Well, it's like a training.

277
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Are you still going to be strong?

278
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You've been given an SQ judgment.

279
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Well...

280
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Thank you. I'll be going.

281
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Yes, I'll be going.

282
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
The water-soaked ring and the wind...

283
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
The heat control is complete.

284
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The devil's white strategy is resumed.

285
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Is there a quest?

286
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Collect the Devil's soul, 2.

287
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Take the Devil's military spirit, Balan's soul.

288
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
The jewel is a silver gem of the shadow.

289
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Is it a special skill for the job?

290
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
There's a better jewel than the previous one.

291
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I feel like I'm walking in the past.

292
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The last destination of the previous one is 76th floor.

293
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Don't tell me Jinho is going to leave by himself.

294
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Are you lonely?

295
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I was just a child who was worried about the temple.

296
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm sure you've been...

297
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
...silly.

298
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You?

299
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Dark.

300
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's you!

301
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's you!

302
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'll go to the main point.

303
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Come out, you bastard.

304
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's you!

305
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:12,220
Led Saber

306
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,940
MAGS

307
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,940
I think we need to think about the use of the technique.

308
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,940
Let's leave the bullet to Kiba for now.

309
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,940
I see. Did the pregnant woman come?

310
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:46,940
Yes. She told us that she was pregnant.

311
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,940
I'm sorry.

312
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,940
Is it a dead body?

313
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:58,940
Yes. She is attacked by the water every time, and she can't wake up at last.

314
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,940
Why am I in such a condition?

315
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:08,940
The person who is born with low blood pressure is said to be killed by the long-term blood pressure.

316
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,940
Do you have a family member or a family member who is a hunter?

317
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,940
You...

318
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,940
My son is a hunter.

319
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:25,940
I can't say that it's the cause.

320
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:32,940
In this world where magic exists, I have no magic resistance.

321
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,940
I'm the one who was defeated.

322
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,940
Even so, you're peaceful.

323
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,940
You're peaceful. Do you want to go fishing after this?

324
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,940
Wait, wait. I'm looking around.

325
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,940
Oh, that's...

326
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:03,940
To raise the efficiency, I divided the stage into six and sent it to each region.

327
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:08,940
When I sent it, I gave two orders to the soldiers.

328
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,940
To divide it into half and defeat all the enemies you can see.

329
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,940
To find the new entry permission and let them know.

330
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:21,940
I abandoned the permission, but the attack pace increased.

331
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:28,940
It was supposed to be, but the pace is decreasing after two days after reaching the 80th floor.

332
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,940
The cause is...

333
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,940
The shadows are being destroyed by someone.

334
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,940
Is that the A-Han that's lost?

335
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,940
The one who defeated the A-Han that's lost even though he was in a state of malice.

336
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,940
A-Han will be called back once and go to the castle.

337
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,940
A-Han was defeated by B-Han.

338
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,940
I don't know the identity, but it's quite a strong enemy.

339
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,940
But it's strange.

340
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,940
There must be a Kiba-Han right next to A-Han.

341
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,940
Why did the B-Han get away?

342
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,940
It's not as much as winning the Kiba.

343
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:13,940
If you're attacking with the aim of winning, you'll have the ability to see the strength.

344
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,940
If that's the case, then the next opponent is...

345
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,940
I see.

346
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,940
They can't win the monster army.

347
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,940
I see.

348
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,940
I've been curious about it.

349
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,940
Do you feel the fear of the monster?

350
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,940
I finally understood the answer.

351
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,940
I came here to test luzG.

352
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:25,940
In fact, my feelings were forbidden so

353
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,940
I was wondering.

354
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:38,940
I did a test, I finished begins where it is not over yet.

355
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,940
I won't let go of the love I have for you
