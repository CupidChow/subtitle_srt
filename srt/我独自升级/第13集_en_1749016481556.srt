1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Happy Holidays.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Happy Holidays.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Excuse me.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You're still asleep?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I was a little tired.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What time do you think it is?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You remember that there's a security guard today, right?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Well...

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You're my brother, aren't you?

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Strange.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The world has been in a state of chaos for the past several years.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The monsters that exist in the gate,

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and the humans that have been able to control the power of the anti-communist force,

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
the fight between the hunters,

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
are continuing to grow.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The existence of the mother of the sick,

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and the living expenses for the students' sister,

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
are the lowest in the hunter's ranks,

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and the EQ.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The ability of the hunter is not to grow from the individual,

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and the rank will not change.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
However, the existence of the hunter is a level-up power

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
that is like being captured by a game in the raid in the 20th floor.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The existence of the hunter, which increases the ability in the fight,

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and the recipe of life that will heal the sick,

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and the work of the hunter that can make the soldier of the shadow be trusted,

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
are the weapons of the shadow.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The existence of the hunter, which increases the ability in the fight,

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and the work of the hunter,

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
are the weapons of the shadow.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The existence of the hunter, which increases the ability in the fight,

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and the work of the hunter,

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
are the weapons of the shadow.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The existence of the hunter, which increases the ability in the fight,

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and the work of the hunter,

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
are the weapons of the shadow.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The existence of the hunter, which increases the ability in the fight,

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and the work of the hunter,

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
is the weapon of the shadow.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The existence of the hunter, which increases the ability in the fight,

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and the work of the hunter,

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
is the weapon of the shadow.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The existence of the hunter, which increases the ability in the fight,

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and the work of the hunter,

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
is the weapon of the shadow.

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not here.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not here.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not here.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not here.

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not here.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not here.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not here.

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not here.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not here.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not here.

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not here.

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not here.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not here.

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not here.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That's all for today.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Would you mind if I ask you something?

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What is it?

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
If you were to be a hunter,

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
would you be willing to be a hunter?

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
No.

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I see.

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Um...

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Son, I'd like to ask you to be careful.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Um...

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Um...

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What is it?

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You know this guy, right?

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What?

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Jina?

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Brother?

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You're not good at acting.

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I don't know what you said,

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
but I'm not going to school anymore,

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
and I'm not going to stop being a hunter.

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You're an EQ.

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You can't live.

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You can't live.

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You might have earned it by our attack,

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
but that's special.

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If you're just here to be a teacher, please go home.

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And you're an EQ, right?

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I didn't come here to say stop.

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What?

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Let's go.

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Welcome.

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Fan Don's Hunter.

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's a horrible country.

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Even so, the leader of the Hunter Association

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
is coming out right away.

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
How long will you be in the army?

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I don't think I'll be able to think of this country for a long time.

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't worry.

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You're here to meet the two of them,

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
the ones who left the country, right?

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
To meet them?

102
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Don't ask me that.

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You're just pretending to not notice.

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What should I do with them in the dungeon?

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
First, I'm an EQ.

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Next, I'm an EQ.

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Or do you think I'm just trying to stop them?

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You're the one who's trying to stop me.

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm just doing my job.

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You're a good guy.

111
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The problem is that the sea of death has fallen.

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
In other words, they're looking at the sky.

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Even if the distance is still short, it's still fine.

114
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Hmm.

115
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Let's go over there first and recommend that investigation.

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Hmm.

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Long time no see.

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Chief Anka, Mr. Kyon.

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Long time no see.

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm glad you called from the Sun Hunter.

121
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Hello.

122
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Oh?

123
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Oh, you're here.

124
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Sorry for the trouble.

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No, no. I was just asking for the Sun Hunter.

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I was surprised that you wanted to train.

127
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But you...

128
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah.

129
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It was a perfect timing.

130
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The gate was under development.

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
CQ gate was just open the other day.

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
How long have you been talking?

133
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm not here to get involved.

134
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Sorry, Sugu.

135
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That guy?

136
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
He's an EQ.

137
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
As you can see, he's a tank.

138
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
EQ?

139
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Actually, he was trained for young people.

140
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
He's also the leader of this attack team.

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
He's been trying to get a chance to get a chance to train.

142
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Damn it.

143
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
He's got a lot of EQs.

144
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And two of them?

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So, this attack team has one AQ, five BQs,

146
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
and eight CQs.

147
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And they're both famous for their skills.

148
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I thought I'd think about it if I knew the cruel truth.

149
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But it's a battle.

150
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's meaningless if it's easy to clear.

151
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Sun Hunter.

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I hope you don't mind the new Hunter's appearance.

153
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Please take care of it.

154
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm not angry.

155
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Let's get started.

156
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm not going to be told.

157
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Let's go, brother.

158
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'll be right back.

159
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Something's wrong.

160
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
This is a terrible thing.

161
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What's this?

162
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What the hell is this?

163
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Sun Hunter!

164
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Mr. Hunter!

165
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Please contact the main attack team!

166
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm coming!

167
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Red Gate?

168
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Why is the new team going to be Red Gate?

169
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'll be right there.

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What's going on?

171
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The gate's gone!

172
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
We can't go back!

173
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's Red Gate.

174
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Brother, what's Red Gate?

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Unlike normal gate,

176
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
if you step on one leg,

177
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
you'll be completely shot at.

178
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You can't get out until you defeat the boss.

179
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You have to get out of the way.

180
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Besides, the monster on the top of the stairs is going to appear.

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Then, is this the CQ?

182
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Shredder, come on!

183
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Thank you.

184
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
No, don't worry.

185
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'll be right back.

186
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'll be right back.

187
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Thank you.

188
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
No, don't worry.

189
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Ice Elf?

190
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
In that place?

191
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's far away.

192
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I don't notice that distance.

193
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
If we aim for the weakest two of us,

194
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
it would be me two months ago.

195
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Brother, what's that?

196
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Ice Elf.

197
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's a cruel and cruel planet.

198
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's afraid of hunters and white creatures.

199
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Main chain walk!

200
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
As you know, this Red Gate is above the original gate.

201
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The difficulty level is above BQ.

202
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
If this happens,

203
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'll be the one who has the highest rank to survive.

204
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
No matter how many times I pull everyone in,

205
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'll split up and move forward.

206
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What?

207
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'll raise the level a little bit.

208
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'll be the one who will be killed,

209
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
not the one who will be killed.

210
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'll make sure that the one who follows me will survive.

211
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'll follow you.

212
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'll be with you.

213
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'll be with you.

214
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You can't do it.

215
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You and the CQ of the CQ.

216
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You can't take the CQ.

217
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
One day here is one hour outside.

218
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You can defeat the boss and wait for the dungeon break.

219
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
If you fail, it will take a few months.

220
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You have to leave the luggage.

221
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Don't be so pessimistic.

222
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You can go home if we defeat the boss.

223
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Excuse me.

224
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Can I go over there?

225
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Do as you wish.

226
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
A girl with a heart of gold?

227
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Kim didn't even notice that room.

228
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You're not an EQ, are you?

229
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Is that all you have to do?

230
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Thank you.

231
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You're welcome.

232
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Hey.

233
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
We're going to the open road.

234
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Then we'll go to the forest.

235
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Pray for your luck.

236
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'll go there.

237
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Boss.

238
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Look.

239
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That's...

240
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Ice Bear.

241
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
That EQ will make everyone die.

242
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm sure he didn't take the right education.

243
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm so unlucky to have come to the sword school.

244
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Wait.

245
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
There's an EQ and an EQ explosion.

246
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Why do I think he's the leader?

247
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Reign!

248
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You guys should think about something you don't know.

249
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm sure he's the leader.

250
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Stop!

251
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What's wrong?

252
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You'll see.

253
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
This is the entire forest is the name of Ice Bear.

254
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Let's go back before we meet.

255
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
That's why I'm going to the forest.

256
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What?

257
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
If this is the name of a bear,

258
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
you should be careful of the bear while you're in the forest.

259
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's better than the ice elf in the forest.

260
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
That means there are more Ice Bears than strong monsters.

261
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I didn't think about that much.

262
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Even so, the forest is cold.

263
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Here's a slip of the tongue.

264
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
An air-conditioned magic?

265
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
This is the limit to bringing out a level-level item in an advanced hunter.

266
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's warm!

267
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What the hell is that?

268
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I brought you here, so I'll protect you.

269
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Don't ask anything else.

270
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Please, both of you.

271
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Don't ask me anything.

272
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Don't ask me for anything.

273
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'll protect you.

274
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
The truth is...

275
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
...it's a change.

276
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It's completely closed.

277
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I wonder if there are a few people who are lucky enough to come out alive.

278
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
There's no other way to get to the Kim Hunter.

279
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
There are some other people in our attack team.

280
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Recently, I've been looking for a hunter called Sonjin.

281
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
What is it?

282
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's an EQ.

283
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But it's not a re-established hunter.

284
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Is that true?

285
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's still from the main character.

286
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What the hell?

287
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You're trying to get rid of the hunter?

288
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Did you open the EQ gate?

289
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Fandors?

290
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's been a while, Bec Yunho.

291
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I didn't think I'd meet you here.

292
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Why are you here?

293
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Why are you in my area?

294
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm here to protect you.

295
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm here to protect you.

296
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You're in my area?

297
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
My area?

298
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Then you're asking me.

299
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Why did you put in an EQ gate in the Gorypanas' 100th Gate?

300
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
What?

301
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'll protect you.

302
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
He's...

303
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I came here to protect you, but it's a red gate.

304
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'll make you pay for it.

305
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
This is not what I'm talking about.

306
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You're lucky.

307
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
If you become a red gate, you won't get a chance to be a Fandors.

308
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
But you'll be able to live with this power.

309
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Red gate is a completely different experience.

310
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You're really someone?

311
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I can't eat a bear's meat.

312
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
The number of attacks has decreased a lot, but you've almost defeated the Sun Hunter.

313
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I don't have a clue yet. I'm worried.

314
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
But after all that, you're a good hunter.

315
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You're a weirdo.

316
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You're right.

317
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
The number is the same.

318
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Come out.

319
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
The number is the same.

320
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You're the first target.

321
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Go.

322
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Go.

323
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Go.

324
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm a suspect and she insect.

325
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,500
How about I touch her?

326
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:19,000
irse

327
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
coração

328
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
The war is coming soon.

329
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm looking forward to it.

330
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I don't have much money left.

331
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
My parents are here.

332
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
His Maori army is leading to a terrible death.

333
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm sure it's not over.

334
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Eagrid

335
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
The first attack is a very strong attack.

336
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
The opponent is a very strong opponent.

337
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
The opponent is a very strong opponent.

338
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
The opponent is a very strong opponent.

339
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
The opponent is a very strong opponent.

340
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
The opponent is a very strong opponent.

341
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Sans is 저기 and...

342
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
He is the strongest, However,

343
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Goliath can't be defeated.

344
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
The opponent is so strong that she can't be defeated soon...

345
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
How's my level?

346
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,500
No, I might be weaker than him.

347
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,500
Thank you for your hard work.

348
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,500
Help!

349
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,500
That's not possible.

350
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,500
I'm the man who will become the elite of the Pya Cochirid.

351
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,500
Will you accept this?

352
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,500
It's okay.

353
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
The most important thing is my demonstration.

354
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:30,500
The condition that can be seen from the bottom of the screen is a sign.

355
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,000
A hot, nice skill.

356
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
A hot, nice face.

357
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
A hot situation.

358
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,000
A hot, nice skill.

359
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
A more long sense.

360
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
A long time ago.

361
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I'll cut you off!

362
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'm sorry, sorry.

363
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'll leave you alone.

364
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I'll be there soon.

365
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Goodbye, goodbye.

366
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
We just like my world.

367
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
No one can touch it.

368
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Good luck.

369
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Look at the clock.

370
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
We're counting on you.

371
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Hello, my friend.

372
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It's quite simple.

373
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It's getting boring.

374
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
There's no risk.

375
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,500
I'll take care of you.

376
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,500
Give me all the money.

377
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Say yes again.

378
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Say yes again.
