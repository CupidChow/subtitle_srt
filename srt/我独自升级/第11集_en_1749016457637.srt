1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm not sure if this is the only way to get away from this town.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I don't know what's going on.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
A quest to change the world.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
A quest that came out last time when I beat Level 40.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I've had two dungeons that were given as key items, but...

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I don't know what to do with this.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I don't know what to do with this.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I've had two dungeons that were given as key items, but...

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I've never had a quest that was directly imported from a system like this before.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And this time, unlike other quests, it's given a time-consuming advantage.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's all it's got to do with quests.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
If you think about it normally, it's an event that can get a great skill for food.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'll become stronger.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yes.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh, no, daily quests.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Well, I'll just go back.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Now that I've finally seen this game start in its original form,

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I wonder what's waiting inside.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Looks interesting.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'll go back to the game.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'll go back to the game.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'll go back to the game.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'll go back to the game.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'll go back to the game.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'll go back to the game.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'll go back to the game.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'll go back to the game.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'll go back to the game.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'll go back to the game.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'll go back to the game.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'll go back to the game.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'll go back to the game.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'll go back to the game.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll go back to the game.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll go back to the game.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'll go back to the game.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll go back to the game.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The game has been completed.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'll go back to the game.

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'll go back to the game.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's late.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
No, it's about time, Jinson.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's been a while, Jinho.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Brother.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You're a normal dungeon than I thought.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But you can't use the potion and the recovery of the body?

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You can't even get out without completing the quest.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You have to think about it and move.

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You're a weak type of monster.

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'll go back to the game.

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I can't hear you.

52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'll go back to the game.

53
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I can't hear you.

54
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
If you're a weak type of monster...

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll go back to the game.

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm in front of you!

57
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I couldn't recover the damage I've been given.

58
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I couldn't recover the damage I've been given.

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But...

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I can't let you do that.

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Of course.

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What's wrong, Jinho?

63
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You're not eating too much.

64
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
No.

65
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Jinson, how about the guild's recovery?

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You said you were rejected by the SQ Hunter.

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's in my ears.

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm sure the Minbyeong Hunter and the Chahen Hunter were rejected.

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But there's no problem.

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
They're currently working on a project with the SQ Hunter.

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
They're signing with the SQ Hunter.

72
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
They're also the SQ Hunter's orders.

73
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That's right.

74
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
They're overseas? I see.

75
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Jinho.

76
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I know you're moving around behind you.

77
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You're trying to make a move by selling the SQ Raid at a high price.

78
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm fine with the hobby, but...

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Don't disturb me.

80
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't know you, brother.

81
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
If you have the strength, I'm sure...

82
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm tired of fighting.

83
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm going to take a breath.

84
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
A secret?

85
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Will you come out to use your secret?

86
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This time, I used magic.

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And I left the battlefield.

88
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What's going on with the SQ Hunter?

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It seems like the Kaisaku Sword is just a fight.

90
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's a more troublesome quest than I thought.

91
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The monster has the ability to help.

92
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The knight has a lot of gold, the square has a sense of smell, and the archer has a speed.

93
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The gold power is low, and the knight has no damage.

94
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The Kaisaku Sword is low, and the square is not in the state of the body.

95
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Is it a matter of power?

96
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Use magic.

97
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm sure it's a place to resist with intelligence.

98
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I haven't raised the level of intelligence and love.

99
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I can't save money.

100
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I want to keep the skill.

101
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The hero is here.

102
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I hope I don't run away too soon.

103
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It seems that everyone is gathering.

104
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's almost time.

105
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's rare to see such a thing.

106
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's been saved from the monster.

107
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The level of intelligence is also low.

108
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The knight's ability is also low.

109
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Speaking of which, I haven't tried the equipment.

110
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Oh, it's transparent.

111
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's safe to say that it doesn't look like it.

112
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I can't get in the way of movement.

113
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I don't have the feeling because I don't have the state recovery, but I've got the level.

114
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I've collected gold and items.

115
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I've recovered the hero.

116
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'll try to move on to the next stage.

117
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Well, how strong is the enemy on this door?

118
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
If I can't get out without attacking, I have to move on.

119
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I can't get out without attacking.

120
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
This area is so scary.

121
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The hero is here.

122
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
If I wasn't thinking about it,

123
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The hero is now entering from underground

124
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That's it.

125
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
They're in thetext.

126
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,780
The sai of Arcane Blood, her name is Akakuroi.

127
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,160
That's different than before!

128
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,240
I require you to大家 not to have any nominees.

129
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,020
G-This has arrived…

130
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,120
Let's take the stars to the sky!!

131
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,680
Why is it so dull?

132
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,880
Finally, I found the big knot and turned a blind eye with it,

133
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
What the hell is this?

134
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,880
I knew it!

135
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,880
What the hell is this?

136
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,880
Speed is just as good as it looks.

137
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,880
But it's just that it's destructive.

138
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,880
It's not even a single shot because of the armor.

139
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,880
Is there a way I can win this guy?

140
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,880
I've been able to do more than I thought.

141
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,880
But...

142
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,880
I don't feel like I can win this guy.

143
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,880
I have to do this to give damage to my teammates.

144
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,880
Is this a knight's sword?

145
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,880
I'm not going to let this happen.

146
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,880
Episode 3

147
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,880
Please.

148
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,880
Captain, you still can't go home?

149
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,880
I can't go home.

150
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,880
I was cleaning up the work I had accumulated.

151
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,880
Same here.

152
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,880
I had to do a good job today.

153
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
You're finally home.

154
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,880
I'm just making a mess.

155
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,880
It's me.

156
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,880
You're leaving now?

157
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,880
Yes.

158
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
First of all, I'd like to thank the chairman.

159
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,880
Thank you for inviting me to this project.

160
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,880
You're welcome.

161
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,880
You guys have been interviewing and publishing on TV

162
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,880
and you've been talking about Jeju Island many times.

163
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,880
The atmosphere of the world has changed

164
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,880
despite the fact that you haven't forgotten the tragedy of that island.

165
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,880
I've only been a little too busy with that flow.

166
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,880
I'm afraid I'll be in trouble if I don't get the news.

167
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,880
I'll be able to handle that.

168
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,880
But be careful.

169
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,880
Jeju Island is a dangerous place.

170
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,880
I'm aware of everything.

171
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,880
The purpose of this project is to reduce the power.

172
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,880
To investigate the enemy's forces and hope with a light approach.

173
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,880
I have a head for your efforts.

174
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,880
Episode 3, Jeju Island Raid.

175
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,880
That battle is within me.

176
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,880
It's still going on.

177
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,880
That's fast!

178
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,880
I feel like my body has been turned into 500.

179
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,880
It was the right thing to do.

180
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,880
I might have died if I had been trapped in the grave.

181
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,880
Even if I had been thrown away, this power is too strong.

182
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,880
If I don't get the attack power,

183
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,880
I'll be able to do this.

184
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
If I don't get the attack power,

185
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,880
I'll be able to do this.

186
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,880
I can't catch up.

187
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,880
I can't catch up with the passive skill.

188
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,880
I can't catch up with the passive skill.

189
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,880
I can't catch up with the passive skill.

190
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,880
I can't catch up with the passive skill.

191
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,880
I can't catch up with the passive skill.

192
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,880
I can't catch up with the passive skill.

193
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,880
I can't catch up with the passive skill.

194
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,880
I can't catch up with the passive skill.

195
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,880
I can't catch up with the passive skill.

196
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,880
I can't catch up with the passive skill.

197
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,880
I can't catch up with the passive skill.

198
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,880
This is it.

199
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,880
This is it.

200
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,920
Festival of Dreams

201
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,520
сред hive

202
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,160
I

203
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:41,720
Have not lost

204
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,960
realize

205
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,480
that result is truly disquieting

206
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,840
find y'all and return!

207
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,240
hot, extinction!

208
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:33,120
current

209
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,120
I won, right?

210
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,120
It was pretty tough.

211
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,120
You won, right?

212
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,120
Skill, ability, experience.

213
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,120
I can feel that with all of that.

214
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,120
I'm sure you won.

215
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,120
I'm sure you won.

216
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,120
Skill, ability, experience.

217
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,120
I can feel that with all of that.

218
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,120
I'm so bad at this.

219
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,120
Four rewards?

220
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,120
The gold that was worth 150,000 gold.

221
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,120
And the same thing with the Eglid.

222
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,120
And the SQ item!

223
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,120
The SQ was also the key to the devil's castle.

224
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,120
But this is the first SQ item in the equipment.

225
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,120
The 15% damage reduction of physical damage.

226
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,120
And the 25% of physical damage.

227
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,120
And the 25% of physical damage.

228
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,120
That's a huge deal.

229
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,120
And the skill of the Rune-Seku's commander.

230
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,120
What kind of skill is that?

231
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,120
I'm sure you'll understand.

232
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,120
More importantly, the SQ.

233
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,120
I can't keep it in inventory.

234
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,120
Why does the SQ come out at this time?

235
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,120
I don't think the transfer quest is still...

236
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,120
...finished?

237
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,120
The time of the war? Really?

238
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,120
The upper class?

239
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,120
I'm praying for the good luck.

240
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,120
Unlimited Wave?

241
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,120
The SQ.

242
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,120
If it was the Eglid class, I would have been killed in a few seconds.

243
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,120
If it was these guys, I could have beaten them enough.

244
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,120
But this guy is a monster!

245
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:57,120
Even if I beat them, the next time I'll get out of the gate and gate!

246
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,120
The transfer quest is about the time of the execution.

247
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,120
Then...

248
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,120
The secret is the C.O.G.200.

249
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,120
The first mana is needed in a second.

250
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,120
The remaining 190.

251
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,120
I'll spend all my time.

252
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,120
The secret is being watched over!

253
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,120
That was amazing.

254
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,120
I can't use the secret anymore.

255
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,120
The execution time is...

256
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,120
...just 5 seconds!

257
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,120
I can't do anything about it.

258
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,120
I'll use the transfer quest!

259
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,120
The second mana is the secret.

260
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,120
The second mana is the secret.

261
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,120
The second mana is the secret.

262
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,120
The second mana is the secret.

263
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,120
The second mana is the secret.

264
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,120
The second mana is the secret.

265
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,120
The second mana is the secret.

266
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,120
The second mana is the secret.

267
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,120
The second mana is the secret.

268
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,120
The second mana is the secret.

269
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,120
The second mana is the secret.

270
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,120
The second mana is the secret.

271
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,120
The second mana is the secret.

272
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,120
The second mana is the secret.

273
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,120
The second one is the secret.

274
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,140
The second one is the secret.

275
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,120
The second one is the secret.

276
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,120
The second one is the secret.

277
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,120
The second mana is the secret.

278
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,120
The second mana is the secret.

279
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,120
The second mana is the secret.

280
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,120
The secret is being watched over!

281
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:09,840
The

282
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,840
secret is...

283
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,840
Hoida-1 is the secret.

284
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,840
The last one!

285
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,120
Thank you for watching!
