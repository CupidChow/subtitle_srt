00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,140
Happymaking

2
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:15,460
Another

3
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:15,580
!

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,140
Until

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,140
...

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,140
...

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,140
...

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,140
...

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,140
If there is another chance...

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,140
...

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,140
...

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,140
...

13
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,140
...

14
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,140
...

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,140
...

16
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,140
...

17
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,140
...

18
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,140
...

19
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,140
...

20
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,140
...

21
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,140
...

22
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,140
...

23
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,140
...

24
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,140
...

25
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,140
...

26
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,140
...

27
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,140
Well, I hope you notice me?

28
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,140
Well,

29
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,140
...

30
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,140
I am Manager Ujin Thanhsource of the GE E3 Hunter competitive of HANTAom.

31
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,740
It's the discount zone.

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,320
Resort zone...

33
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,960
What the hell is with her now?

34
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,960
Let's get ready for the 그룻

35
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,140
I'm not sure if I can do it

36
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,140
Feeling, feeling

37
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,140
All those things are yet to come

38
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,140
There's no real in, feeling

39
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,140
Let's get it

40
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,140
So give it yourself

41
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,140
You give it yourself, don't let it shine

42
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,140
You give it yourself

43
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,140
You give it yourself, don't let it shine

44
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,140
Don't you gotta get

45
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,140
So no, what you gonna get

46
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,140
It's very up to you

47
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,140
So no, you're giving your best shot

48
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,140
You give it yourself, don't let it shine

49
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,140
You give it yourself, don't let it shine

50
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,140
You give it yourself, don't let it shine

51
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,140
Get up, reach out for it

52
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,140
You give it yourself, don't let it shine

53
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,140
You give it yourself, don't let it shine

54
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,140
Just get it, get up, get on to it

55
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,140
Game over but they give it all to she-coast

56
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,140
Little kitty in the gutter with the body rolls

57
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,140
Undercover body doesn't even be close

58
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,140
Your head lines, your head runs

59
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,140
So we shot body, I'm gonna let go

60
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,140
Don't go, boy, and you came in from a zero

61
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,140
Everybody we can punch my thumb

62
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,140
Power rolls and rolls

63
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,140
Let's get it

64
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,140
Huh?

65
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,140
I lost my consciousness for three days?

66
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,140
Chih-Hee and Son-san

67
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,140
Are they okay with you two?

68
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,140
Yes, but

69
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,140
Son Chiyoru Hunter has lost his arm

70
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,140
He might be able to get better

71
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,140
Good Chih-Hee Hunter has a lot of mental shock

72
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,140
He's getting treatment

73
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,140
I wonder if she can continue with Hunter

74
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:34,140
The only six hunters who came back alive from the 20 dungeons

75
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,140
I found this time

76
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,140
Hunter always says he's always with danger

77
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,140
But this is not the end of the story

78
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,140
What do you mean?

79
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,140
When the survivors received the message

80
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,140
And went to the field with the back guild

81
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,140
At that time, only Son-jin Hunter was left

82
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,140
The temple and the ruins

83
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,140
Were left behind

84
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,140
Really?

85
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,140
You can't believe it

86
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,140
The survivors' testimony was a bit wrong

87
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,140
If only a part of the victims' bodies were still in the field

88
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,140
It was a place to suspect you two

89
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,140
Huh?

90
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,140
By the way

91
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,140
This is our plan

92
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,140
Son-jin Hunter

93
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,140
You have been awakened after the awakening

94
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,140
Awakened after the awakening?

95
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,140
Hunter's ability is determined by the awakening time

96
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,140
It will never change

97
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:48,140
But there seems to be a hunter who is re-evoking

98
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:52,140
He will be able to be an AQ and an SQ

99
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,140
Maybe I too...

100
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,140
It's a magic device

101
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,140
Please give me your hand

102
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,140
As the survivors' testimony said

103
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,140
If there was a monster at the level of the dead

104
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,140
The SQ hunter wouldn't be able to survive

105
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,140
And that's why he disappeared

106
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:17,140
AQ, no, it's impossible for an SQ hunter

107
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,140
We should first suspect Son-jin Hunter's re-evoking

108
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,140
How is it?

109
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,140
How many rank is the re-evoking?

110
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:33,140
It seems that he did something rude

111
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,140
Even though he's an AQ, he can surpass 70

112
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,140
But that doesn't change the general person

113
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,140
The worst investigation of the dungeon has disappeared

114
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,140
How did he survive?

115
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,140
What?

116
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,140
I expected it

117
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:56,140
But I wonder if those people didn't care about this

118
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,140
I can't believe it

119
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,140
I can only see myself

120
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,140
Isn't it a touch panel?

121
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,140
I knew it was going to be like this

122
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,140
Jina

123
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,140
Please take care of your body

124
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,140
You must have been very worried

125
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,140
Sorry

126
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,140
Other people are fine

127
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,140
But you are always very worried

128
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,140
You are worried

129
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,140
I was planning to die leaving my sister behind

130
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,140
What? Is it strange?

131
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,140
If something happens again

132
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:51,140
I will quit school and work so that you don't have to do the hunter's job

133
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,140
I understand, I understand, sorry

134
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,140
By the way, Jina, do you see this?

135
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,140
This?

136
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,140
Sorry, nothing

137
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,140
Well, for example, there is a message in the game

138
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,140
A game?

139
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,140
How should I read it?

140
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,140
Will you take it with your head?

141
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,140
Jina, I used to play games

142
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:17,140
Well, I guess you should open the message box

143
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,140
Open the message box?

144
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,140
Why are you talking about the game all of a sudden?

145
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,140
No, I was bored

146
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,140
I was wondering what the player was like at that time

147
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,140
If that's the case, it seems to be fine

148
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,140
Well, I'm going

149
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,140
That's good, I'll be waiting

150
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:42,140
The main system supports the growth of the player

151
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,140
If the system does not follow the instructions of the main system

152
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,140
There is a penalty that is passed

153
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,140
The reward has been executed

154
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,140
I don't know what it is

155
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,140
I'm going to ask for a daily quest

156
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,140
Confirm

157
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:02,140
Udetate, return, squat, running

158
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:06,140
If you can't complete everything, the penalty will be added

159
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,140
What is this?

160
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,140
Please be more careful

161
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,140
There is no such power during the entry

162
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,140
What's going on?

163
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,140
I'm a hunter who knows the rules

164
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,140
But I didn't do anything wrong

165
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,140
Chairman Go

166
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,140
I see

167
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,140
The reason I didn't go to the dungeon break is because of the report

168
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:35,140
But this time, there are too many things that are too complicated

169
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,140
Yes, I don't think there are any cases like this

170
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,140
The dungeon has many things that are difficult

171
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,140
I understand

172
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,140
This time, the case is a special case

173
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,140
I need to register for the data bank and re-enact it

174
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,140
I understand

175
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,140
Good work

176
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,140
Next BQ raid

177
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,140
Please participate as a exchange

178
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,140
Exchange?

179
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,140
This raid is also under the training of the newbie and the actual owner

180
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,140
Please

181
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,140
I don't think I'm looking for a leader

182
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,140
You can fight as usual

183
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,140
Everyone looks at your back and learns

184
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,140
You have that much of a skill

185
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:29,140
We hunters guilds are counted as the five main guilds in the country

186
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,140
But if you look at it from a world perspective, it's not enough

187
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,140
It is impossible to raise the rank of the individual

188
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,140
But it is possible to train the actual power

189
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,140
You should come to that time

190
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,140
What? A gate?

191
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,140
There is a gate here

192
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,140
You are still here?

193
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,140
I don't know what to do

194
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,140
Sh-Shit

195
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,140
Sh-Shit

196
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,140
What's going on?

197
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,140
Is it a dream?

198
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,140
I was just about to...

199
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,140
Sh-Shit

200
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,140
What?

201
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,140
What's wrong?

202
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,140
The hunter in this room...

203
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,140
What are you doing?

204
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,140
There is another stone!

205
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,140
Were you there?

206
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,140
No, I was looking for another room

207
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:31,140
I see, I don't think you went outside the hospital

208
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,140
It's gone

209
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,140
Sh-Shit

210
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,140
Penalty...

211
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,140
Quest...

212
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,140
Son?

213
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,140
Son, are you okay?

214
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,140
Yes, the results are good

215
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,140
I think I can retire soon

216
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,140
I'm glad, I was worried about you

217
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,140
I'll take care of you when you retire

218
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,140
Yes, I understand

219
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,140
Let's go

220
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,140
I'm Raid?

221
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:41,140
Yes, I was on the DQ gate at the Hapchon

222
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,140
But I was hungry

223
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,140
Of course, I can't say it's impossible

224
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,140
I understand the situation of the hunter

225
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,140
I'm sorry

226
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,140
No, I don't care

227
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,140
Oh, yes, you were cold-hearted

228
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,140
Son, Jin Hunter

229
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,140
Really?

230
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,140
Jin Hunter

231
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,140
Jin Hunter, you were safe

232
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,140
I'm glad

233
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,140
Look, you're running again

234
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:21,140
Well, I'm always like this since I'm conscious

235
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,140
Jin Hunter

236
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,140
I said I'd retire soon, unlike the average person

237
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,140
But I want to change my body

238
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,140
I didn't ask you to stop saying it's impossible

239
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,140
I just got a big result

240
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,140
I'm sure I did

241
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,140
After I got conscious, I got 4 days in a row

242
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,140
I've learned a few things

243
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:48,140
First, this is not a limit

244
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,140
If you do a daily quest, you can get 3 rewards

245
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,140
Revenge in the state

246
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,140
I'm so tired

247
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,140
Next is the ability point

248
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,140
The ability you get is the ability you like

249
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,140
I guess it's the ability

250
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,140
It's so strong that I can give you the ability

251
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,140
It's a little bit like the ability you got

252
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:17,140
You can use it as an inventory

253
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:21,140
I'm now in the middle of a strange world

254
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,140
It's like a game

255
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,140
Ah

256
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,140
And the last daily quest reward

257
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,140
Random Box

258
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,140
What will it be today?

259
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,140
Key?

260
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:53,140
I've only seen a few things like pens and a lot of things

261
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,140
Instance dungeon?

262
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,140
What is that?

263
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:03,140
I wonder if it's an event that can be strong because of the flow

264
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,140
So, today's gate is open

265
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:14,140
New DQ gate has been opened

266
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:19,140
The CQ gate of the tube called the upper tower is currently open

267
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:24,140
As you creates an attack gate that allows your acts of attack to be saved

268
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:28,140
While the Emperor's Guild is dead in a cut out of shape

269
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:32,140
It doesn't matter. Some attacks will be done

270
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,140
She is the victor

271
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,140
Let me take your sarcastically.

272
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,660
Mother!

273
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,300
Mother! Get up!

274
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,520
What's wrong?

275
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,540
Mother!

276
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,980
I didn't really wake you up!

277
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,660
A Dro pliers?

278
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,060
Different!

279
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,260
Sadly that is the last seat you can see.

280
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,600
Right here!

281
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,160
You Waiting for the same omen!

282
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,140
I did it, Soshina!

283
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,140
Now I can make your mother pay for the treatment!

284
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,140
But it's dangerous, right?

285
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,140
It's okay. Leave it to me.

286
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,140
What are you doing?

287
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,140
You're already a smith!

288
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,140
Damn, you're so good at playing the E-class.

289
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,140
I told you!

290
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,140
I won't let you do that!

291
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,140
I'm sorry, Yaku Tadazu.

292
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,140
Power point...

293
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,140
...and muscle power.

294
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,140
The equipment is ready.

295
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,140
I did what I had to do.

296
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,140
I'm confident in running away.

297
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:09,140
If it's dangerous like before, let's run away with our full speed.

298
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,140
Isn't this boss killing Deng?

299
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,240
A master of power...

300
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,240
I can't believe it!

301
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,240
Did he just take my hand?

302
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,240
I see.

303
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,240
This is a two-dimensional dimension.

304
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,240
Instance dungeon is not just a dungeon.

305
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,240
I've never been there, but I think it's a red gate.

306
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,240
I'm not sure.

307
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,240
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure.

308
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,240
I was going to run away, but I can't run away.

309
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
A meteorite?

310
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,240
What?

311
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,240
I can't get out until I clear it?

312
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,240
I can't defeat the second-class monster.

313
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,240
I'm so happy to clear the dungeon by myself.

314
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,240
I'm really going to lose without a party.

315
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,240
But I have to do it!

316
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,240
I'm going to lose.

317
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,240
What should I do?

318
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,240
I feel like I'm losing.

319
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,240
I got it!

320
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,240
And three more!

321
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,240
I'm going to lose.

322
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,240
I'm going to lose.

323
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,240
I'm going to lose.

324
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,240
I'm getting stronger.

325
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,240
Wolf God.

326
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,240
I can feel it.

327
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,240
I'm stronger than the five of you.

328
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,240
I'm stronger than the five of you.

329
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,240
My legs don't move.

330
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,240
Why?

331
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,240
I didn't think there would be a trauma.

332
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,240
I thought it was a meteorite.

333
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,240
I don't have a healer.

334
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,240
It's over if I get hurt here.

335
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,240
I'm going to lose.

336
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,240
I'm going to lose.

337
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,240
I'm going to lose.
