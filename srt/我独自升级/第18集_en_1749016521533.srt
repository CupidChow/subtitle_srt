1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm going to go.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What? Did something happen inside?

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
No, it's personal.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Don't worry.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Excuse me, can you borrow some weapons?

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Um, do you have anything else?

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
A sword or a spear?

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Do you have anything else to talk to me?

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm fine with it.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'll go.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So, Hunter, are you really okay with a hand?

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Even so, you're better than the right one.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Okay.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The Rock is High, the Face is High.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Good job, huh huh, good job, huh.

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Good job, huh huh, yeah, I'm done with it.

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
How did they get out of here?

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
If only one of these abandoned houses were out...

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Maybe one or two of them would be destroyed.

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Especially those four.

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm not going to let them get away with it.

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The gate is closing, it's our mission.

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The dungeon boss, we must defeat them.

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm scared.

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Humans.

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What do you mean?

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You have so much magic power.

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Compared to him, a magic like me is way too much.

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What's wrong with us?

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We're here.

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We're here.

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Kill you all and have a dark, peaceful life.

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Kill you all and have a dark, peaceful life.

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The evil church?

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Our plan is only the evil church.

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Our lives are for him.

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
If it's broken, it's only a toy.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Humans are mixed in the mystery.

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That's enough.

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Stop it!

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
15 songs.

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You fool.

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
A magic of half-doubting power.

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
A power of power.

62
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Dai-chan!

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Gi-hun-san.

64
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Captain Son.

65
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is the dungeon of the hunters.

66
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm not supposed to be the one to intervene.

67
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But the attack team is falling into the trap.

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll ask you one thing.

69
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Can I get all the monsters here?

70
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Please.

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Salmanen.

72
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But the enemy is dead.

73
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's the first time I've seen such a strong aura.

74
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Of course.

75
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But unfortunately, the match is the worst.

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Of course.

77
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'll take you.

78
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
A guard?

79
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Why is there a guard here?

80
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I don't know.

81
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Someone, call the guard.

82
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Why is he here?

83
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Two days ago.

84
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What's wrong?

85
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Where is the hunter Son Jin?

86
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Son-san?

87
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I knew it!

88
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I thought something was wrong.

89
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He came to me and made a face.

90
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I thought he'd be killed.

91
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So, what about the hunter Son?

92
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
He's on the other side of the gate.

93
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
He's not looking for any monsters.

94
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Instead, he's looking for a monster.

95
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yes.

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The next one is a monster?

97
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
If it's an SQ, it means that all the actions are related.

98
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I hope it's the right time.

99
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What?

100
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You'll know if you watch the news.

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But, I heard the same thing about the hunter.

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The hunter.

103
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What's going on?

104
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The hunter is not the one we just saw.

105
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I thought he'd be killed.

106
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Hurry up, the magic power.

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yes.

108
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We have to hurry.

109
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I don't know how Gifen and the others defeated the number of monsters.

110
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
But, if the magic power is the boss,

111
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
they will die meatceasingly.

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
�

113
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And you can't face the Ale Ox there.

114
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You didn't hit the devil.

115
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'll hate on that.

116
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The AMK's preparations were nothing but the dead.

117
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
At level 70 Level Ultimate,

118
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
the martyred cymbal needs an appearance.

119
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Their bodypower also became the strongest out of the devil'srog.

120
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You don't believe me? Even without reaching me I'm finally MП with two fighting dignity Outside of the book I'll taunt you

121
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,780
ULTIMATE

122
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You wretched freak!

123
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
IAudiness!

124
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,600
We've DIED!

125
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,700
You di doe tenduying with your crime [? 한다 more ouste].

126
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,100
villeggs are too strong or moj perquè talkomo.

127
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,140
Merciless Hookz,defend your path through this.

128
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,140
I have to kill you.

129
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,140
The target of the Dragon!

130
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,140
Your soldiers are just too much to handle.

131
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,140
They can't be taken away.

132
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,140
You're not being taken away either.

133
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,140
They play so many times.

134
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,140
The target of the Dragon!

135
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,140
Speed!

136
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,140
The target of the Dragon!

137
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,140
The half-weight demon!

138
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,140
Speed!

139
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,140
Then, until your magic power is gone,

140
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,140
until you destroy it,

141
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,140
I will show you how many times!

142
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,140
The song of the Dragon!

143
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,140
The song of the Dragon!

144
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,140
You're going to make a huge magic power

145
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,140
and get close to the magic of the faraway highlander?

146
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,140
Then, how long will you be a prisoner?

147
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,140
The result is out!

148
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,140
It's a gate that is as close to the level as possible to the SQ!

149
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,140
The magic speed is...

150
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,140
We will quickly contact the representative of the Hunters.

151
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,140
We are ready.

152
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,140
We will go to the attack force.

153
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,140
Yes, sir!

154
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:55,140
How come the number of heroes in the world is more powerful than the number of them?

155
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,140
Your magic power is a matter of time.

156
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,140
A matter of time? What are you talking about?

157
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,140
The number of Necromancers is coming from here.

158
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,140
Wake up!

159
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,140
To the world's peace and order!

160
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,140
You guys will soon be my shadow.

161
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,140
Of course...

162
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,140
You...

163
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,140
No way...

164
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,140
You're a traitor!

165
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,140
No way...

166
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,140
That guy...

167
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,140
Then, why are you here?

168
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,140
When I first opened my eyes here,

169
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,140
I heard the same command from the head.

170
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,140
Human curry!

171
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:01,140
No matter what the reason is,

172
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,140
it's just a matter of order and order.

173
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,140
Go!

174
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:13,140
Kill them all and bring the human bodies to life!

175
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,140
Is it the SQ?

176
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,140
If it was the original speed,

177
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,140
it would have been possible to attack with the Songifun Hunters,

178
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,140
but it was a terrible situation.

179
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,140
If we break it, it will be the worst of the Jajutsu.

180
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,140
There is still time for the disaster.

181
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,140
We will use the Hunters' power to respond to the situation.

182
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,140
The Hunters are already more than a level of emergency.

183
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,140
If it's the worst,

184
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:47,140
they might be able to support the Bacchus and the Shinnigami.

185
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,140
But then...

186
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:53,140
I will do my best not to do that.

187
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,140
I will do my best not to do that.

188
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,140
I will do my best not to do that.

189
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:28,140
This Ehe is more dangerous than the Hunters.

190
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,140
This is impossible.

191
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,140
Let's make it work.

192
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,140
Yes.

193
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,140
The Song of the Adventure, the Song of the Light!

194
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:41,140
The audience is not the ones who will be on stage.

195
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:47,140
I will make you wear a more nameful mouth.

196
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,140
The Song of the Water Demon, the Song of the Dragon.

197
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,140
The Song of the Light!

198
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,140
What?

199
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:59,140
There is a big fight between the Poison and the Poison.

200
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,140
The Song of the Water Demon!

201
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,140
I will destroy that evil shield.

202
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,140
What the hell is this?

203
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,140
What is this?

204
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,140
Did they summon us?

205
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,140
There are so many people.

206
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,140
Vice President?

207
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,140
Why are we here?

208
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,140
The leader is fine.

209
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,140
I'm glad.

210
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,140
What is this situation?

211
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,140
What is this situation?

212
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,140
You should do your best.

213
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,140
The Song of the Light, the Song of the Power, the Song of the Poison.

214
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:00,140
The monsters like you will destroy the sea.

215
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,140
What the hell?

216
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,140
I don't remember the Poison well.

217
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,140
I will follow you.

218
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,140
The Song of the Water Demon!

219
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,140
The Song of the Water Demon!

220
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,140
This is not over yet.

221
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,140
Can this Kalkalgan be defeated?

222
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,140
If you are big, you will be able to set your goals.

223
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:54,140
The magic sword will not stop the attack of the Dark Sphere without hesitation.

224
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,140
The Song of the Water Demon!

225
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,140
Is it still not enough to fight?

226
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,140
Then...

227
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,140
Take this.

228
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,140
Vice President?

229
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,140
Everyone, you are safe.

230
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,140
I feel a sense of joy outside.

231
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:45,140
I came to the support of the attack team.

232
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,140
I guess I was worried about the future.

233
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,140
Even the leader of the Kanshika...

234
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,140
No matter how you look at it, he is a top class combat hunter.

235
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,140
Even though he is a summoner.

236
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:01,140
This is the power of the Song Hunter.

237
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,140
Who is that person?

238
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,140
You know him, right?

239
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,140
I know him a little.

240
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,140
I know him a little too.

241
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,140
Did you lose your voice?

242
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,140
I lost using the magic.

243
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,140
This body...

244
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,140
This body will not be destroyed!

245
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,140
It should be destroyed!

246
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:50,140
I defeated the boss, but it's a little hard to get an item.

247
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:55,140
But it's okay to be in the middle of the shadow.

248
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,140
Wake up!

249
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,140
It's a little quiet after becoming a shadow.

250
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,140
Name?

251
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,140
What was it?

252
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,140
It's light.

253
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,140
Sorry, I forgot.

254
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,140
I'll put it on the enemy.

255
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,140
Kiba, your name is Kiba.

256
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:24,140
It's the first time I've seen a voice-night.

257
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:28,140
I just got out of the boss of the AQ dungeon.

258
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,140
It's pretty big that I got the power of the Sun.

259
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,140
The Zhang Jinhan.

260
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,140
Chief Wu?

261
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,140
I didn't notice that I was in the middle of the shadow.

262
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,140
Mr. Sun!

263
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,140
What's that, Mr. Nimochi?

264
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,140
Well, what should I say?

265
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,140
I'm Kanshika, the Hunter of the Hunter.

266
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:56,140
I'm the best-level secret case about the Song Jin Hunter.

267
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:01,140
I'm sorry for not being able to tell you today.

268
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,140
I'll lead you to the outside.

269
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,140
This is the best way to avoid troublesome situations.

270
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,140
Oh...

271
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:14,140
The Song Hunter has become a place where you can use the power to attack the SQ.

272
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:18,140
I hope you can leave quietly from here.

273
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,140
Wait a minute.

274
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:27,140
I have so much power.

275
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:31,140
I think something is going to end.

276
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,140
I won't ask you why you were killed.

277
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:42,140
But thanks to you, we were able to survive.

278
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:46,140
I'm very grateful for your help.

279
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,140
Oh, right.

280
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,140
I'll go back to the clothes.

281
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,140
Well, let's go around.

282
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,140
Excuse me, Chief Fukuoka.

283
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,140
Yes.

284
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,140
Why do you have a fishing rod?

285
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,140
I...

286
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,140
I wonder if I was thought to be a weirdo.

287
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,140
Who was it?

288
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,140
No, it wasn't someone else.

289
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:24,140
It was a disaster that everyone came back safely.

290
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:30,140
In other words, we were saved by the Bacchus and we were saved by him again.

291
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,580
It surpassesMa dasai voices that were able to summon sentelemon destroyers

292
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,140
and Jinwara-ka sent separately.

293
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,140
Why begin to oppress again...?

294
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,140
People may believe it.

295
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:46,140
We all know about the Song Hunter but which does he believe most?

296
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:58,140
Raido is able to do demonicless grudges and tracks the Таку stacking by having an extraordinary ability.

297
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,140
I thought that was the common sense.

298
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:08,140
Can you clear the water level dungeon that is the hardest in the AQ?

299
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,140
It's impossible.

300
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:16,140
I'm ashamed to be called the final weapon.

301
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,140
President!

302
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,140
I understand.

303
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,140
I will definitely...

304
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,140
Let's try our best.

305
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,140
Brother!

306
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,140
It was too late.

307
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,140
How was it?

308
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,140
The sword of the guild master?

309
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,140
You talked to your father, right?

310
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,140
Brother...

311
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,140
Actually, I'm talking about that.

312
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,140
We're just here to meet the Tantar Association.

313
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,140
It's a great opportunity.

314
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,140
We're here to meet the Tantar Association.

315
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,140
We're here to meet the Tantar Association.

316
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,140
You're all gathered for me, right?

317
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,140
The man who made all the money.

318
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,140
Min-san.

319
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,140
He even got the power to control humans.

320
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,140
Well...

321
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,140
It's not bad.

322
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,140
The Tantar Association

323
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,140
The Tantar Association

324
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,140
The Tantar Association

325
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,140
The Tantar Association

326
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,140
The Tantar Association

327
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,140
The Tantar Association

328
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,140
The Tantar Association

329
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,140
The Tantar Association

330
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,140
The Tantar Association

331
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,140
The Tantar Association

332
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,140
The Tantar Association

333
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,140
The Tantar Association

334
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,140
The Tantar Association

335
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,140
The Tantar Association

336
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,140
The Tantar Association
