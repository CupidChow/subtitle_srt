1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry for the noise.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry for the noise.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry for the noise.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Wake up.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,180
Aren't you having fun in your

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,260
kid?

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:37,300
before I was released

8
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,240
You're like power,

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,240
you can't miss the

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,640
I have real weak aim for living close

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,920
I'm just a little bit of a loser

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,720
Take you up and spit you out

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,680
Statue of a living body count

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,520
Oh, I'm a little bit of a loser

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,360
Yeah, I'm a little bit of a hitman

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,280
I give back the light

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,120
It gave me what I please

18
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,360
You guess no, you're my only one

19
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,320
Cuz I'm back here

20
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,120
This game's no red skull

21
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,800
A new scenario

22
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,760
Cuz I'm back here

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,480
This game we can survive

24
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,360
More dark stories, match the hunger

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,920
Sprite, the day is silent

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,320
Take you in a one game, I'm a one game, I'll say

27
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,600
You never go on

28
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,680
So I'm gonna go to a window

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,360
I'm gonna go to the school again

30
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,480
I'm gonna take a rainbow

31
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,600
Then I walk on a shadow

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,080
So I'm gonna take the pain

33
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,200
So I'm gonna take the pain

34
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,080
Cuz I'm back here

35
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,880
This game's no red skull

36
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,720
A rise, hazing down

37
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,560
Sun to the show

38
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,520
Cuz I'm back here

39
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,320
This game we can survive

40
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,880
More dark stories, match the hunger

41
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,840
Sprite, the day is silent

42
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,680
Good chocolate, oh, oh

43
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,600
Good chocolate, oh, oh

44
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,040
Good chocolate, oh, oh

45
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,560
Yeah, I'm tapping

46
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,400
How long has it been?

47
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,640
About three hours

48
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,240
I think it's been three days or so

49
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,880
Is the red gate's environment in the past?

50
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,720
Yeah

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,880
Then, you must have died too

52
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,920
Come and do that

53
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,960
No, wait

54
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,840
You're not a 100 guild, right?

55
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,200
Why did you get involved with the attack team?

56
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,920
It's my acquaintance

57
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,200
I brought him here because I wanted to see the CQ raid

58
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,240
What?

59
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,280
You mean that?

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,400
What the hell did you think?

61
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,360
What did you come to find this time?

62
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,040
You were lucky to find something interesting from the past

63
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,920
Fandans

64
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,480
Let go of my hand

65
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,520
You're gonna kill me?

66
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,520
You're just living in a real country

67
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,880
What?

68
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,120
I have to stop it quickly

69
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,240
The battle of the CQ raid is about to start

70
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,840
You're gonna do it?

71
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,040
It's so cold

72
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,000
I wish I could have been a soldier

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,520
I thought the ice bear wouldn't come with one

74
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,720
Could it be that the CQ raid was...

75
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,000
No, there shouldn't be that kind of power

76
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,960
I see, the 100th...

77
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,400
The 100th is here

78
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,520
Damn it

79
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,520
I'm gonna do it

80
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,520
Thanks to you two helping me out

81
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,520
I was able to keep my arm safe

82
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,520
I don't know what the fan hunter is asking for

83
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,520
But two months ago

84
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,520
I made a decision about him

85
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,520
The Sun Hunter is not wrong

86
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,520
The fan hunter is a monster

87
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,520
The fan hunter is saying that he was able to get the order

88
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,520
I made a decision

89
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,520
That's a foreign thing

90
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,520
It's a lie

91
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,520
The thing I did was a friend's search

92
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,520
Then why did you follow the Sun Hunter?

93
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,520
Of course

94
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,520
It's just a matter of time

95
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,520
To kill him

96
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,520
I can't say anything

97
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,520
Fan Hunter

98
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,520
The one who knows the power of the Sun Hunter is me

99
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,520
He'll come out alive

100
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,520
Then the money to buy weapons will be gone

101
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,520
No, it's true

102
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,520
The money is gone

103
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,520
You guys are weak

104
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,520
You're still alive

105
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,520
You're a monster, a monster, a monster

106
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,520
That's what you mean

107
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,520
You guys

108
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,520
Kinahata?

109
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,520
All of my attack units are gone

110
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,520
I'm not gonna let you get away with this

111
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,520
Who's gonna take care of that?

112
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,520
Who's gonna take care of that?

113
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
Who's gonna take care of that?

114
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,520
I'm gonna kill you

115
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,520
Oh, I see

116
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,520
Mr.Hijin

117
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,520
You knew him from the beginning

118
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,520
That's why you followed him

119
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,520
If you're gonna kill him, it's all a crime

120
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,520
You have to find out until you find out

121
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,520
One

122
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,520
Two

123
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,520
Fan Hunter

124
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,520
I'm not gonna let you die

125
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,520
Okay

126
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,520
Who's the one who's gonna kill his friends?

127
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,520
Big brother

128
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,520
You're so brave

129
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,520
You're too strong to hide your secret

130
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,520
That's Ice Elf

131
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,520
And that's...

132
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,520
That's Boss

133
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,520
You're really there

134
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,520
You're gonna use it in the game

135
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,520
What?

136
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,520
You're gonna use us in the game?

137
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,520
Oh, Commissioner Haruhabu

138
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,520
Hey, do you know what we're talking about?

139
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
Why do you know?

140
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
You're talking about the words of the monster?

141
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,520
This is a system effect

142
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,520
If you know the words, then it's too early to talk about it

143
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,520
You're the one who told me

144
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,520
If you have something strong in you,

145
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,520
I'm telling you I want to fight you

146
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,520
What?

147
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,520
Yeah, interesting

148
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,520
You're not gonna let me down easily

149
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,520
That's interesting

150
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
By the way

151
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,520
Why are you mixing it up with the human?

152
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,520
Yes

153
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,520
I don't think I know anything

154
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,520
I hear voices

155
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
I kill humans

156
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,520
But I can't hear it

157
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,520
You can hear voices?

158
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,520
Is it similar to the system's orders?

159
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,520
I can't hear voices

160
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,520
Is it the effect I became a player?

161
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,520
We don't need to fight

162
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,520
We're going to be efficient

163
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,520
Give the humans behind you

164
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,520
Then you won't be able to handle it

165
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,520
What do you think?

166
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,520
What are you guys doing?

167
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,520
Why are you fighting humans?

168
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,520
We're...

169
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,520
Give the humans behind you

170
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,520
Then you won't be able to handle it

171
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,520
What?

172
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:09,520
Well, our plan is to kill them

173
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,520
You're right

174
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,520
Are you going to kill us?

175
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,520
I'm not going to kill you

176
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,520
Which one?

177
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,520
What's this?

178
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,520
It's a monster! A monster appeared!

179
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,520
It's a black soldier and a black ice bear!

180
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,520
Is this you, Son Hunter?

181
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,520
You're a bad guy, Son Hunter

182
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,520
Bad guy?

183
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,520
Is that so?

184
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,520
Hurry up!

185
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,520
We can't get any further!

186
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,520
To白 Cycle

187
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,520
I've been teasing so far

188
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,520
Because of the misint cranial

189
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,520
The crocodiles have a limit

190
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,520
My limit isn't a long time

191
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,760
It Yunseo

192
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:38,520
Stronger than me

193
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,520
It looksских even Ietear gets fixed with the England

194
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,520
I don't understand a single soldier.

195
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,140
I need a stronger power.

196
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,400
My name is Balkan.

197
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,760
What is your name?

198
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,260
Sonjin.

199
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,400
You.

200
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,640
I finally got ride of the Geed god.

201
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,120
My è..

202
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,520
I'm not going to let you go!

203
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,520
I'm not going to let you go!

204
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,520
I'm not going to let you go!

205
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,520
I'm not going to let you go!

206
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,520
I'm not going to let you go!

207
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,520
I'm not going to let you go!

208
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,520
I'm not going to let you go!

209
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,520
I'm not going to let you go!

210
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,520
I'm not going to let you go!

211
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,520
I'm not going to let you go!

212
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,520
I'm not going to let you go!

213
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,520
I'm not going to let you go!

214
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,520
I'm not going to let you go!

215
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,520
I'm not going to let you go!

216
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,520
I'm not going to let you go!

217
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,520
I'm not going to let you go!

218
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,520
I'm not going to let you go!

219
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,520
Sanji!

220
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,520
Die!

221
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,520
Kim Chol, you're going to die.

222
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,520
I'm not going to let you go!

223
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,520
I'm not going to let you go!

224
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,520
I'm not going to let you go!

225
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,520
I'm not going to let you go!

226
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,520
I'm not going to let you go!

227
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,520
Sorry, you're in the wrong place.

228
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,520
Wake up.

229
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,520
Stop it!

230
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,520
I'm sorry.

231
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,520
Ayan, you're from today.

232
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,520
Ayan.

233
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,520
Isn't it interesting?

234
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,520
I'll cut you into pieces!

235
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,520
You're too slow to move.

236
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:52,520
Ejin, is that how you always feel when you fight with the hunters?

237
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,520
If that's the case, I'm not used to being a hunter.

238
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,520
It's my first time seeing you like this.

239
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,520
I'm sorry, it's not a dream.

240
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,520
This guy is not alone.

241
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,520
You and that knight, come together and fight!

242
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,520
Yes.

243
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,520
You're the one!

244
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,520
What?

245
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,520
If you keep fighting like this...

246
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,520
You're too sweet to me.

247
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:51,520
You're strong, but what about your soldiers?

248
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,520
What?

249
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:03,520
But if I kill you, that coward,

250
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,520
I'll be a fool if I lose my sight.

251
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,520
Ayan!

252
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,520
Ayan!

253
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,520
You did me a favor!

254
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,520
I'll kill you all!

255
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,520
You're too strong.

256
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,520
Don't be ridiculous!

257
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,520
You're too much!

258
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,520
I should have said that.

259
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,520
The conclusion is here.

260
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,520
I could have killed you somehow.

261
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,520
Hey, stop it!

262
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,520
Just keep fighting.

263
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,520
I'm worried about the attack.

264
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,520
Is it over?

265
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,520
Yes.

266
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,520
Let's go out.

267
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,520
Outside of the gate.

268
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,520
Yes!

269
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,520
I can go home!

270
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,520
Before that...

271
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:17,520
It's been a week since the gate was closed.

272
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,520
We're waiting here.

273
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,520
Please go home.

274
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,520
I can't go home even though the guild is inside.

275
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,520
I'll wait until morning.

276
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,520
There's a person!

277
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,520
Kim Hunter.

278
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,520
I thought you'd do it for me.

279
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
Mr. Bec!

280
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,520
Park Hunter.

281
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,520
Go Hunter.

282
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,520
Anyway, I'm glad you're safe.

283
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,520
Where are the other hunters?

284
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,520
Song Hunter!

285
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,520
It's my own way of reading.

286
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,520
The gate is gone.

287
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,520
Where are the other hunters, Kim Hunter?

288
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,520
No.

289
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,520
The one who came back is only the Park Hunter.

290
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,520
What's going on inside?

291
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,520
Let's go home.

292
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,520
I'll send you home.

293
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,520
Yes.

294
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,520
Please wait.

295
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
I'd like to ask you something.

296
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,520
I'm tired today.

297
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,520
Please listen to the guild.

298
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,520
This is not a request.

299
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,520
Order.

300
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,520
Or a punishment.

301
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,520
We're going to have six guild members this time.

302
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,520
As a punishment, we'll have to listen to them.

303
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,520
Maybe.

304
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,520
But I saved the two of them.

305
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,520
If you're a punishment, you should be the one to say the order first.

306
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,520
I'm sorry.

307
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,520
You're right.

308
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,520
I'm sorry.

309
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,520
Park Hunter.

310
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,520
Yes.

311
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
Why are you so scared?

312
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,520
You seem to be in a bad mood.

313
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:27,520
After I defeated the boss, I suddenly felt uncomfortable.

314
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,520
I think the heroine has reached the peak.

315
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,520
She's not a bad person.

316
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,520
Chief Anka, please take him to our guild.

317
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,520
Yes.

318
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,520
I didn't expect this.

319
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,520
Good work.

320
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,520
Be careful.

321
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,520
Jinu.

322
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
Jinu?

323
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,520
Thank you for today.

324
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,520
I'll see you tomorrow.

325
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,520
Oh.

326
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,520
By the way, I haven't been here for a day.

327
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,520
So this is the only way to get a good look.

328
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,520
Is it because he's too different from the power plant?

329
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,520
I couldn't get out of the three rounds.

330
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,520
I was so scared.

331
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,520
No.

332
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,520
This is the third round.

333
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,520
Brother, I'm hungry.

334
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,520
I'm going now.

335
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,520
Good morning.

336
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,520
Are you dressed like that?

337
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,520
Yes.

338
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,520
Let's go.

339
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,520
Well, I'll pick up one of you on the way.

340
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,520
Good morning, Captain.

341
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,520
Good morning.

342
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,520
I'm sorry.

343
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,520
Jinu.

344
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,520
Jinu?

345
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,520
I slept a little after that.

346
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,520
I couldn't sleep.

347
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,520
Well, I was injured when I got home.

348
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,520
I'm back.

349
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520
One of you?

350
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,520
Jinu.

351
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,520
That's what you two were talking about.

352
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,520
I'll pick you up.

353
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,520
Thank you.

354
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
Brother.

355
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,520
Yes.

356
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,520
Han is two-year-old.

357
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,520
Yes.

358
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,520
Where is he?

359
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,520
No.

360
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,520
I don't care.

361
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,520
I'll go and clean up.

362
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,520
Yes, Jinu.

363
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,520
Yes.

364
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
I don't like you.

365
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,520
I don't like you.

366
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,520
What a situation.

367
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,520
I don't like you.

368
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,520
I'm a little younger.

369
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,520
I don't have a heart.

370
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,520
Kiss me.

371
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
Sorry, sorry.

372
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,520
You're leaving.

373
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,520
That's right.

374
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,520
We're lovely.

375
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,520
We're so cute.

376
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,520
I'm sorry.

377
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,520
