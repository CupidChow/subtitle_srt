Aboutτη

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,680
Compared to Kuro's computer,

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,100
his AI isn't as efficient as anyone's.

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,800
.. What is this!?

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,540
What are these black E어S like!?

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,840
Haaaah.

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,420
Retreat.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not sure...

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Why am I here?

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What's wrong with you?

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure...

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Why are you here?

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure...

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not sure...

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure...

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not sure...

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not sure...

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000

Son...

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You're talking about the broadcast, right?

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Hmm...

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What the hell is going on?

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What the hell is going on?

Episode 7

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Daviles, the scene is also confused.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The most important thing is to check the hunters.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We'll be back soon.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes, sir.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Director!

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The telephone line is about to be cut off.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We need to restart the broadcast.

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We can do it if we can!

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We can't contact the video from the scene.

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We can't contact the video from the scene.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We can't contact the video from the scene.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What if the rescue hunters are all killed?

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What if the rescue hunters are all killed?

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What if the rescue hunters are all killed?

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Hey!

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What's going on?

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Damn it!

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The camera is so good at this moment!

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Ayan!

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Do it.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What the hell is going on?

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What the hell are they?

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Why are the rescue hunters here?

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The rescue hunters are here?

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
When will they be here?

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And how?

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We'll explain later.

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We'll fix your wound first.

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What's this?

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh, right.

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I can't get the shot.

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Drinking medicine.

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Do you need a medicine?

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Well, Shihan.

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Open your mouth.

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Ah...

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What's this?

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The wound...

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
is gone.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The recovery operation...

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Why can't I hear it?

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Is it the same as before?

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Why am I getting weaker?

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I can't fix my wound this far.

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Let's get out of here quickly.

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'll open the way.

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Got it! Wait!

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
From next to next,

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
the wind is too strong.

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Damn it!

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Captain!

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
How is the attack?

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Nothing yet.

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It seems that a temporary communication barrier is happening all over the island.

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I've been in touch with Japan, but I can't catch up.

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The public media has also stopped the video from being cut off since the black-eyed man appeared.

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Hurry up and recover the communication barrier.

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We'll contact the medical team and the recovery team as soon as possible.

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes, sir!

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I've never thought that I would be so angry with this body and heart.

91
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
If I get a job, I hope we can fight together.

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Captain...

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Please...

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Please be safe.

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What a joke!

96
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
If I think that the watch is stopped, I can't even watch TV.

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I can't fix that.

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'll go to the room.

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I might be getting information on my phone.

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I won't bother you.

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What do you mean?

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Mr. Goto's survival signal has arrived.

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The sound of the communication barrier before the disaster.

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The enemy's reaction has been very powerful for a moment.

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The person who was killed.

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What else?

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We're checking it now.

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Hurry up and check it.

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The other people's death will be affected by the next attack.

110
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yes, sir.

111
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Goto was killed?

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What a joke!

113
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What's happening in that island now?

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm not sure if I'm a Ygritte or Iron class.

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm not sure if I'm a soldier or a Yaires.

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I want to improve my skills.

117
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm in a situation where I can see people.

118
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
No.

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Everyone.

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'll go to the room.

121
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll open the door to the room.

122
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Everyone.

123
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Please follow him.

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The other guys will be there.

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
When the person who killed him comes late, please take care of him.

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I understand.

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Please leave it to me.

128
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yes, sir.

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And please take care of the Tagon.

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
No way.

131
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He's back.

132
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
No way.

133
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Goto was killed?

134
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The king wasn't outside.

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Is he here?

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The king is calling for him.

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The shadow that got him to the island was killed.

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
His life.

139
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What?

140
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Hey!

141
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The King of Humans

142
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You are the king of humans.

143
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yes.

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You're talking to the cow.

145
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Humans.

146
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You're the king of humans.

147
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The cow is the cow.

148
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Even the Sun Hunters.

149
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
They're the other guys.

150
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Director, the video is back.

151
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What?

152
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
This is...

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The broadcast is resumed. Hurry up!

154
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What?

155
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
If we start now, it'll be a live broadcast.

156
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
There's no use in the time when something happens.

157
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We're talking to you.

158
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's over. Do it.

159
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yes.

160
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Our...

161
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
No.

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The fate of the world is on this man.

163
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Sun!

164
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
No way.

165
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What is this?

166
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
No way.

167
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Why?

168
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Brother?

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
He's coming out for a while.

170
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What?

171
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Again?

172
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You did it!

173
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Sun Hunters!

174
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But how do we end this?

175
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That's not good.

176
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'll trust him.

177
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
If the magic system is so close to you...

178
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It seems you were looking at the ant.

179
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You're dead.

180
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You're...

181
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You're the king.

182
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Vexian.

183
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Cheshire.

184
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Is he really a magical form?

185
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
He doesn't even know himself.

186
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
He can't be here.

187
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
He's quite a grumpy guy.

188
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
He's got a shell.

189
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What a fight.

190
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm finally able to stand on my own.

191
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I can't lose my power just by the flow of magic.

192
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm being attacked.

193
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Why?

194
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
What is this man?

195
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What is he?

196
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What?

197
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What is this?

198
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The poison that I absorbed from the ocean's ocean.

199
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I've already used it with my magic.

200
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I can't move any faster.

201
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Now you're finished.

202
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You're dead.

203
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You're dead.

204
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You're dead because you're dead.

205
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What are you talking about?

206
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
No, it's true.

207
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I got a call from the other hunters.

208
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I got a confirmation.

209
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's not a water-based attack.

210
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What is this?

211
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And then, a powerful reaction appeared near the caldera.

212
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's probably the answer to defeat the Goto.

213
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Why are you still alive after fighting the Goto?

214
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Why are you heading to the pool?

215
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I don't know.

216
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Is there a purpose?

217
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Did you get hurt and go back to the pool?

218
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
The other hunters' lives are uncertain.

219
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But if they're alive, they'll get along.

220
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
They couldn't stop the Goto.

221
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
They're the ones who got the signal.

222
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
The other hunters are weak in the series.

223
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
If we kill them, the rest will be the end of the Goto.

224
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
There's still a chance.

225
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Retreat the remaining three people.

226
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The second attack team of the ship and the Goryu forces.

227
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Get out of here!

228
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That's right.

229
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The enemy is arriving at the time.

230
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Roger.

231
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
The strategy was set up in the plan 9.

232
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Let's go.

233
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's no use.

234
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm a monster.

235
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
We can't fight back.

236
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Be strong!

237
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Don't let them get away!

238
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I can't beat them like that!

239
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
If they don't run away, they'll be killed!

240
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You're pathetic.

241
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
There's no choice but to do it.

242
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I...

243
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I got three Bигonds with Goro after I fought.

244
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I was back in the那麼 room when weawan got after the Eventful Ballis.

245
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
With Shins LOVE,

246
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Was K throughout the event?

247
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
After writing a script and predicting the slope of the boat.

248
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
he injured the wound that comes to his mouth.

249
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
He's got concern about Forehead Canyon while he's still next turn.

250
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,480
ib

251
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
A Sony girlfriend.

252
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Then?

253
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
A Allenbell.

254
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I thought I could feel the same as I did.

255
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
But I can feel his emotions as his power has increased.

256
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I can see his anger.

257
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's the same here.

258
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I have to finish this quickly.

259
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I can't feel his anger.

260
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I can't feel his anger.

261
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I can feel his anger.

262
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I can feel his anger.

263
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I can feel his anger.

264
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I can feel his anger.

265
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I can feel his anger.

266
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I can feel his anger.

267
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I can feel his anger.

268
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I can feel his anger.

269
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I can feel his anger.

270
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I can feel his anger.

271
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I can feel his anger.

272
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I can feel his anger.

273
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I can feel his anger.

274
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Upgrade...Land?

275
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
What is this?

276
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
What?

277
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Freedom power?

278
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What is this?

279
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
What is this?

280
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
THAT Midayosh eldest brother

281
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I can feel his anger.

282
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:02,880
If, there's no other route you're going, Jeanas governo can wurde cią SC legendary..

283
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,880
Now, I hate something that just stinks possibly too much for a better than others..

284
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:15,780
My game might be thrown upon fans like Traitor or Boyd, so I keep CCing sunflowers.

285
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:21,580
you can only bereachtli Sweat Man like Neathead and sugar swallow szczede, looking further white as minerals forILLs.

286
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:25,580
I was born stronger than anyone else.

287
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:32,580
I was the one who was able to swallow everything and grow up towards the top.

288
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:36,580
I was supposed to be the king, but...

289
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,580
If I had to run away...

290
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,580
I wouldn't have to run away to live!

291
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,580
I'll run away a little bit!

292
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,580
Hurry! Hurry!

293
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,580
Hurry! Run away!

294
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,580
Run away!

295
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,580
Run away!

296
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,580
The aliens...

297
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,580
Run away...

298
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,580
Did you find him?

299
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,580
Song Hunter!

300
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,580
I don't have any more of my own.

301
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,580
Let's get out of here!

302
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,580
The aliens are waiting outside.

303
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,580
If we get on that...

304
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,580
No.

305
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,580
Let's just stay there.

306
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,580
Then what should we do?

307
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,580
I can't hear that.

308
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,580
I haven't tried this yet.

309
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,580
The death of my mother's death,

310
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,580
this is the last order.

311
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:42,580
The Kouka Taishoukai?

312
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,580
Didn't you hear that?

313
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,580
There's no way I can get out of here.

314
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,580
I can't hear anything.

315
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,580
It's still taking me a while to get the Kouka Taishoukai.

316
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,580
What is it?

317
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,580
Isn't there something else?

318
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:22,580
The final death of my mother's death,

319
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,580
this is the last order.

320
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,580
The death of my mother's death,

321
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,580
this is the last order.

322
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,580
The skill that doesn't work,

323
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,580
the face that doesn't work,

324
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,580
the situation that doesn't work,

325
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,580
the skill that doesn't work,

326
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,580
the sense of the world that doesn't work,

327
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,580
the sense of the world that doesn't work,

328
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,580
that is all of it.

329
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,580
Sorry, sorry I'm reaching for you.

330
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,580
It's all so lovely

331
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,580
that I just wanna throw you away.

332
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,580
Goodbye my weakness like this Ah, my world

333
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,580
Even though I'm defined as weak,

334
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:12,580
I cannot break out of this world

335
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

336
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

337
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

338
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

339
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

340
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

341
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

342
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

343
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

344
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

345
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

346
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

347
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

348
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

349
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

350
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

351
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

352
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

353
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

354
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

355
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

356
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

357
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

358
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

359
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

360
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

361
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.

362
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,580
I'm not sure if I can make it.
