1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm the one who's going to be the next one.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm the next one.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
There are many things that have changed.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Each person has a different effect on their experience.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's right.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It seems like I'm too busy with Hunter's work.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I tried to recover, but it didn't work out well.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I should have participated in A-class and B-class, but I was able to participate in D-class and E-class.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I think I've always been a little bit worried about knowing you.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I was hurt many times at first, and it was a little troublesome.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
But I was sure that you would live.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I will never forget that strong man who has a strong life.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It was a promise to go to dinner with me.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'll return this.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
No way.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I decided to retire.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'll be back in a while.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If you have anything to say, please contact me.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'll guide you.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Then, I'll invite you to dinner again.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yes.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I don't think you defeated the B-class Kante Shiku.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The one who wants to retire is enough for the last time.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'll tell you that.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
If you want to live long, you can do it.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'll tell you that.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'll tell you that.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'll tell you that.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'll tell you that.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If you want to live long, please be careful.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What do you mean?

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The Fandons attack the previous incident.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The survivors were only D-class hunters and you.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The Fandons hunters, who are the younger brothers of the Fandons,

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
might be aiming for you.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The Fandons of the S-class hunters are my children?

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It has nothing to do with what happened inside.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The important thing is that the Fandons die and you came back alive from there.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
If the other party becomes S-class hunters, they can't fight.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
They are like the other side of the world, when they are in a miracle.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The monsters that are afraid of monsters might be aiming for you.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
If possible, I think it's better to take your family and leave this country.

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
There's one more reason I can't be strong.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If I can't be strong, I can't live.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The Fandons of the S-class hunters are my children?

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The Fandons of the S-class hunters are my children?

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yes.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The Fandons of the S-class hunters are my children?

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yes.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The Fandons of the S-class hunters are my children?

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yes.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The Fandons of the S-class hunters are my children?

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yes.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The Fandons of the S-class hunters are my children?

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yes.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The Fandons of the S-class hunters are my children?

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The Fandons of the S-class hunters are my children?

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The Fandons of the S-class hunters are my children?

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yes.

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The Fandons of the S-class hunters are my children?

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yes.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The Fandons of the S-class hunters are my children?

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The Fandons of the S-class hunters are my children?

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yes.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The Fandons of the S-class hunters are my children?

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes.

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The Fandons of the S-class hunters are my children?

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes.

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The Fandons of the S-class hunters are my children?

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes.

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The Fandons of the S-class hunters are my children?

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yes.

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The Fandons of the S-class hunters are my children?

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yes.

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
A beautiful day is brothers and sisters,

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,640
together to devotion,

82
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,000
unbreakable friends.

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The one who Stellar �season 10,

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and the legendary Illuminati Maracord Saint Vivante

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
let's keep moving my prisoner andателей.

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:04,000
There are some hunter-like figures, but we've gathered people who are unable to act due to their circumstances and those who are in trouble with their lives.

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Call the injured.

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That's better. At least eight people are needed at the CQ Gate.

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh, right. The child is involved.

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
If you're in charge of the whole thing, there's no problem at all.

91
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Hey.

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Excuse me. I'm a hunter who's been in the history of the world.

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But you're a high school student, right?

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm not.

95
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You're a rank EQ.

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So what?

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Well, whatever. I'll wait outside.

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'll send you two of me and Jinho to the dungeon.

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Are you really going to go alone?

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And you're just waiting outside for 300,000?

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yes. I'll get 300,000 for the raid once a month.

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's delicious to get it without fighting.

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But it's an emergency.

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
If the prison is revealed, I'll pay 10 times the reward of the contract.

105
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The secret ruins of the prison that I took away from the prison.

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Let's use them right away.

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Okay. Looks like I did a good job.

108
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What's with that outfit?

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's a full set of fortress armor made in the Italian factory.

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'll go around the dungeon with my brother and I.

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I don't need this much of armor.

113
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Don't say bad things. Come out quickly.

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yes.

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Brother, can you lend me your hand?

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Let's go.

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm nervous.

118
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm still thinking about it.

119
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm just going to use the armor.

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Okay, okay. Let's go.

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yes.

122
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I really went with you two. Are you okay?

123
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'll pay the price for the contract if I get it.

124
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It doesn't matter.

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Are you two of the CQ Raid DQ and EQ?

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The blood-sucking monsters are all over the world.

127
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That guy is so rude.

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
How long have you been here?

129
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
About an hour.

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It takes more than two hours to get to the attack.

131
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's still too late.

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You're running away. You're lucky.

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
No, I'm not running away.

134
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The gate has started to close.

135
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Are you kidding me? Did you beat the boss?

136
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Where's the next gate?

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It'll take about an hour from here.

138
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Okay, I'll hurry up.

139
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Everyone, let's move.

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
There are three places today.

141
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's a chance to earn 9 million yen a day.

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Are you going?

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What are these guys doing?

144
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Brother, the battle is over.

145
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Roger that.

146
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'll take care of this.

147
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'll be right back.

148
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You're working today?

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Yes, I'll be right back.

150
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You have such a strong skill.

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You're getting stronger.

152
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You have a great skill.

153
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I don't like the new hero.

154
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You're a great skill.

155
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You can fight without losing your form.

156
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Did you get the level of the skill?

157
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The new skill, the advanced sword skills and the old skill.

158
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You can use it quite well.

159
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Thank you for your hard work.

160
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's over after you've recovered this.

161
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Please rest a little.

162
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yes, I'm counting on you.

163
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You have a lot of fun skills.

164
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But no matter how much you use it,

165
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
you don't have enough time to train.

166
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You have to be able to use your ability in the future.

167
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But do you challenge the demon on the path?

168
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But..

169
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
IIntro

170
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Eatery Quest?

171
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
This now.

172
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
This now.

173
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Look at this, Chief Anka!

174
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What's wrong, Gijuul?

175
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
About the purchase of the CQ Gate...

176
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
1.5 million?!

177
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Are there any of them who used 1.5 million to participate in the CQ Gate?

178
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yes.

179
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Recently, there's a attack team that's been doing more than a few times since the CQ Gate was launched.

180
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The leader is...

181
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yujinho?

182
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I've never heard of his name.

183
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's the leader of the Yujin Construction Company.

184
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The Yujin Construction Company?

185
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
This is a bad idea.

186
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm so excited to see the full-fledged offsake.

187
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Hm?

188
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Is Sonjin the CQ?

189
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yes.

190
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's like everyone's been gathered together.

191
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What are they planning to do?

192
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Hmm...

193
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
No.

194
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
This Sonjin is a case of the previous 20th-century dungeon.

195
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
This is a bad idea.

196
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Sorry, I'm late.

197
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
No, not at all.

198
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's faster than I expected.

199
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I was too busy with the full-fledged offsake than I thought.

200
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Let's go.

201
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You must be tired. Let's go back to the car.

202
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Hm?

203
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I don't have time to do anything.

204
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
That's all.

205
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Oh, really?

206
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What?

207
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I don't know.

208
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Hm?

209
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Huh?

210
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Is Sonjin Hunter the CQ?

211
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yes, that's right.

212
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What's the reason?

213
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Son Hunter was safe even though he was in the third floor.

214
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
The first one was the 20th-century dungeon.

215
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The second one was the full-fledged offsake.

216
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The third one was the suicide case of the CQ.

217
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
He survived even though most of the participants were gone.

218
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
If he wasn't the most likely to be alive, he wouldn't have explained it.

219
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yeah, that's...

220
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
By the way, Chief Anka, where are you going?

221
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm sure.

222
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Hmph.

223
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm going to kill Sonjin as a scout.

224
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
What?

225
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's like a farce.

226
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Uncle, here.

227
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's a temporary shelter.

228
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Oh, sorry.

229
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I was just wondering if there were people like Hunter.

230
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That's a gate, right?

231
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Are you sure you're nearby?

232
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Don't treat kids like that.

233
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm a Hunter too.

234
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Huh?

235
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Then you're also in this attack team?

236
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yes.

237
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Huh?

238
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
But...

239
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Son Hunter!

240
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You're the only one who's been in this attack team?

241
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's been a while since I've had a big one.

242
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
No, it's a huge one!

243
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I see. You're in the wrong.

244
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Then be careful.

245
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Hey, are you going again, Chief Anka?

246
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Captain is coming out!

247
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Get ready to retreat!

248
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What's tomorrow's schedule?

249
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I remembered the rest of the training, but I can't rest.

250
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Tomorrow?

251
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I have a meeting with the gate, but...

252
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Cancel it?

253
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I don't need to do that.

254
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I don't have enough money.

255
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'll take it up to two days.

256
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Hmph.

257
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Then I'll leave it to you.

258
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I understand.

259
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Thank you for waiting.

260
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Now, let's go to the next one.

261
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Huh?

262
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Again...

263
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That dream?

264
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's finally here.

265
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Well then, good work.

266
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm sorry to have to say this, Son Hunter.

267
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It's a pleasure to meet you,

268
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
the second manager of the Bacchogild, An Sanmin.

269
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Can you give me a little bit of time?

270
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't think we need to explain this,

271
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
but Bacchogild is the top level guild in this country.

272
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
However, the excellent geniuses are always needed.

273
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Let me introduce you to the leader directly.

274
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
We promise to make a two-time appointment with the leader,

275
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
so would you like to come to Bacchogild?

276
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
We will try to make Son Hunter's expectations higher.

277
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
How about it?

278
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
For the Bacchogild who was in the EQ,

279
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
there is no chance for you again.

280
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I will definitely say yes.

281
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Bacchogild is a great leader.

282
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
He's a great leader.

283
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I will let you know.

284
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
How much is the Bacchogild's building?

285
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yes.

286
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Well, it's about 500 million.

287
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So you're going to give it to me?

288
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm sorry.

289
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
300 million!

290
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You're here.

291
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
The building that my friend Kensetsu has been offering is 300 million.

292
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I thought I could give you 500 million because I did two times that,

293
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
but if you can't believe it, I have a proof here.

294
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But that's...

295
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
If you're that much of a student, I'll talk to the top person by myself.

296
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Then that's all.

297
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You're too impatient.

298
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:33,560
You should have looked up the

299
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,560
What?

300
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,560
This is a secret skill?

301
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,560
You were a re-established student until the secret.

302
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:52,560
Then I will be satisfied with the gold that my friend Kensetsu has presented.

303
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,560
I'm sorry for the impudence.

304
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,560
But it's not like I was wrong.

305
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,560
Don't overdo it.

306
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,560
The new year is coming to an end.

307
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,560
We can't let them enter the actual battle.

308
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:13,560
So I went to the gate to find out who the person I was trying to contact was.

309
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,560
I found out about the Song Hunter.

310
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,560
How many people know about me?

311
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:25,560
Only me and one of the group.

312
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,560
I don't want to be known by people.

313
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:34,560
If my rumors come true, I will be the one to be the one to be the first to suspect An.

314
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:40,560
There is a report from the police station, but I don't want to die.

315
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,560
I will make sure to keep my mouth shut.

316
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,560
Thank you.

317
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,560
I was worried about the CQ.

318
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,560
But I'm sorry, but I'm going to keep going for a while.

319
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,560
It's a problem. If I keep going, I can't do anything about it.

320
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,560
Then, shall we get a cab?

321
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,560
A cab?

322
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,560
I will sell the CQ gate that I've been working on.

323
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:13,560
If I let this go, I can't participate in the CQ for a while.

324
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,560
It's like a bathhouse.

325
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,560
But I understand. How much is it?

326
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,560
About 3 billion yen.

327
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,560
3 billion?!

328
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:31,560
The CQ gate is about 2 billion yen.

329
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,560
I hope you can keep it up to 2 billion yen.

330
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,560
I'm sure.

331
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,560
It's a small-scale operation.

332
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,560
Then, I'll give you 3 tickets.

333
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,560
Yes. 3 CQ gates, 6 billion yen.

334
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,560
Then, I'll...

335
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,560
I'll take the entrance ticket today.

336
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,560
Then, I'll put it up here.

337
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,560
Can you close your eyes and open your mouth?

338
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,560
It's okay. I won't eat the machine.

339
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,560
No way! The wound disappeared!

340
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,560
Then...

341
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,560
You've shown me everything.

342
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,560
Do you think it's okay to trust me?

343
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,560
I'm not going to reveal the secret.

344
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,560
Chief!

345
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,560
How was the scout?

346
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,560
Hey, Gichiru.

347
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,560
What?

348
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,560
He might be the biggest one I've ever seen.

349
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,560
I've confirmed the entrance ticket.

350
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,560
It's really 6 billion yen.

351
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,560
How did you get the gate to cancel it?

352
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,560
Where did you get it?

353
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,560
It's a business secret.

354
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,560
What? The CQ gate is in the air?

355
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,560
Yes. Other than that 3-ticket, the staff haven't been involved.

356
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,560
The entrance fee is only 7 million yen.

357
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,560
I was just kidding!

358
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,560
I didn't just fail the scout, but I even got a chance to meet Sagini.

359
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,560
I don't know what to do.

360
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,560
I'm not afraid of anything I do.

361
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,560
Message? Who is it?

362
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,560
It's Son Jin.

363
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,560
Let's pour the secret into the water.

364
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,560
I see. You're here.

365
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,560
I got caught.

366
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,560
I can't take it.

367
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,560
Maybe it's from Son Hunter.

368
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,560
Yes.

369
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,560
I got a lot of information this time.

370
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,560
I got a call from Son Hunter.

371
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,560
I'll make it a good deal this time.

372
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,560
A transfer quest?

373
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,560
I'm looking forward to it.

374
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:42,560
The secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret

375
00:22:42,560 --> 00:23:12,560

376
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,480
Strike on your Moh Megami

377
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:22,860
Wherever you cross, you run into the unknown

378
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:28,780
The impale can't escape your�

379
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:33,100
I destroyed myself and trapped the human who metabolismo

380
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,200
We're The F Snakes

381
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,440
It's Where it Wears a earthquake

382
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,000
This is the song
