1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Let's go back to operators in town

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
My body is so fragile

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Ah...

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I've been trying to get rid of the big one!

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
How long are you going to keep on chasing me?

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'll kill you!

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Huh?

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I lost my ability to use my power...

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But...

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm still stronger than I am!

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
No, you can't hear me!

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm going to kill you!

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm fine!

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Feeling, feeling

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
All those days are yet, there's no realing, ceiling

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Let's get it!

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So give it yourself!

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You're giving yourself the best shot!

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You're giving yourself!

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You're giving yourself the best shot!

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's important, so no, what you gonna get?

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's very important, so no, it's giving your best shot!

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You're giving yourself

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You're giving yourself

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Fill it for me, IRPF

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You're giving yourself

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Get I get onto it!

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I can't see anything, I can't see anything from a zero

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Everybody with them punch my thumb, power rose and rose

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Let's get it!

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's impossible to be alone

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
No healer, no party

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Riku only has water and food

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You're a piece of shit

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
If you have a weapon that can save your power

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll kill you right now!

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Why is this in here?

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Did you say you won with 300,000?

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I have an item that can't reach me

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I can't do anything about it, I'll use it

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What? Itomigo?

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
If I have a weapon...

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm not afraid!

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What?

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I can't get through!

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Please, get out of here!

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm not a go-dead!

48
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm a big-headed dog!

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What are you going to do?

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
These guys...

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Compared to them...

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Nothing will change

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Huh? Level 2?

54
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's 2 now, but it didn't change in the daily quest

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I see, this is a real battle, so the wounds healed

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
If you level up, all the abilities will be increased to 1 point

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
All of them have 5 points

58
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The daily quest has 3 points, so it's better to level up through the battle

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
How much power does it gain if it gets up to 1 point?

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's also a lot of blood and senses

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's easy to understand, but it's only 32

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But it's much lighter

63
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's a good idea, but the higher the base ability, the more it gets up

64
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I understand that it's a point to level up

65
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I can really become stronger

66
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It might be a big deal if a small monster gets 5 points

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Are these guys not magic books?

68
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Are they going to give me items instead of magic books?

69
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The mysterious phenomenon I'm in...

70
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
If they're controlled by a system like the game...

71
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Are the monsters here different from the real gate?

72
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh, I found a store...

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Come here!

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I can't use the beginner...

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'll buy it

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
20 gold?

77
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
How much does it cost to earn money?

78
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Well, this dungeon is about the best level

79
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So 20 gold is not a big deal

80
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Well, what should I do?

81
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I can't go out until I defeat the boss

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I can go out if I have a machine gun

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But I don't know where it is

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
If I become a long-term warrior, I'll lose my food

85
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I can't defeat the boss alone at the level of EQ

86
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I might be able to level up

87
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I might die before that

88
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'll go out

89
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm not afraid

90
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I've already experienced death

91
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I don't want to die so easily

92
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You guys should also get up

93
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm sorry, but I can't kill you in an instant

94
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You've been under the control of the Hunter

95
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'll make sure my mother's health is cured

96
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If I have another chance...

97
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's hot!

98
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Let's fight it hot!

99
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I can't go out until I'm alive

100
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
If I can become strong

101
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'll make sure I become a bad ruler

102
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I can't go out until I'm alive

103
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Oh, my God

104
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I can't move

105
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
This is so boring

106
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's a piece of cake

107
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I can make a lot of money

108
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But I can't make a lot of money

109
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But I'm getting better

110
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm 34, a wolf's horse

111
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm 2 old, a traveler's clothes

112
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And I've got a machine gun

113
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'll go home

114
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But I might not have a chance to become strong

115
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What will happen to this dungeon if I use a machine gun?

116
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Will it disappear?

117
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It might disappear like a game or a limited edition event

118
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I might be under the control of something I don't want to know

119
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The one who's holding the Buddha's hand

120
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Shall I move forward or back?

121
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yes, it's Izuhi

122
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm sorry about the Hunter's incident

123
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That gate is a dungeon break?

124
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm so close

125
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I refused

126
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm trying to get a free hunter

127
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But I don't have enough money

128
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I got it

129
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
As the level rises, the easier it is to defeat the monster

130
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The color of the text has changed

131
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's probably not as white as before

132
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's probably the same as me

133
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The red color is strong

134
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The first red-colored Lai Kan is now white

135
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That means I'm getting stronger

136
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But I don't feel like I can beat the monster that's under the level

137
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I can feel it because the power of the senses has been increased

138
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The red color is under the level

139
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I can't get a level up here

140
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I can't get a sword if I keep fighting

141
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The stairs to this station are so long

142
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Thanks to the station, I'm 0

143
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's fast

144
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
The sword

145
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I've raised the level quite a bit

146
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But the name is...

147
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Genji?

148
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You're the master of this place

149
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You're being chased by a tiger, and you can't get a sword

150
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You should have a sword

151
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
The attack that hit the monster was so strong

152
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I have to stop his defense

153
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
But what should I do with this thick armor?

154
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'll die if I take this with me

155
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I thought I got a little stronger

156
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
But I'm still not strong

157
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:00,000
If I get stronger, I can destroy this life that's been kept laughing

158
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Human's worst weapon?

159
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You've been being called that lately

160
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Yes

161
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
They're all so stubborn

162
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Do your best to be able to change you

163
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yes, I understand

164
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I can't get a level up because I'm weak

165
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I can't get a level up because I'm weak

166
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm ashamed of myself

167
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
If I get stronger

168
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
If I have overwhelming power, I can stand with honor and honor

169
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I can't stand the power of the weak

170
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I can't stand the power of the weak

171
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm just afraid of the weak

172
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm just afraid of the weak

173
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Even if I have knowledge, even if my head rotates fast

174
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Even if I wait for people

175
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'll be betrayed in front of the weak

176
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's meaningless to be kind

177
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
That's why I'm strong

178
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That's why I'm here

179
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm not strong

180
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I can't get stronger

181
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I can't get stronger

182
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I can't get stronger

183
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
If I compare it to the fear of that time

184
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I can't get stronger

185
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I can't get stronger

186
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I can't get stronger

187
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
If I'm the weak

188
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
If I'm the weak

189
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'll be the weak

190
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm strong

191
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm strong

192
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm strong

193
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Thanks to you, I got a good one

194
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Is it a sword made from wood?

195
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It has two attacks and two swords

196
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It can also evade evil and blood

197
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's too scary to use it

198
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Let's keep it for now

199
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I can't get stronger

200
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Did you clear it?

201
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
No one is here, but what time is it now?

202
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Hey!

203
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's a problem if you come in

204
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I can't hear you

205
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What do you mean?

206
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Don't get me started

207
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Are you a hunter?

208
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yes, I'm a hunter

209
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Sorry, I'm sorry

210
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'll take you to the site

211
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Yes

212
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Is something wrong again?

213
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Dungeon Break

214
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It seems like the monster has come out

215
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's almost clear

216
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
But there's one big one left

217
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Is it because the ability of the senses has been upgraded?

218
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Feel it

219
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The one over there is the boss

220
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Please don't take the picture

221
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's a very dangerous situation

222
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It's dangerous

223
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Everyone, please concentrate on the tank

224
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'll do whatever I can

225
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What are you doing?

226
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
There's no defense

227
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
He has a very high defense

228
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
There are too few magical hunters in the world

229
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Sorry, I'll take you

230
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The results of the rescue team are not good

231
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
The rank is low

232
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Probably, the DQ is one of the 8 EQs

233
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Because the DQ is a tank

234
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's too much to stop it

235
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
The healer is a BQ for the two DQs

236
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Hey, sister!

237
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Please let me recover quickly

238
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's a BQ healer

239
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Why are you fighting?

240
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Yes!

241
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Take it easy, Zaku!

242
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I couldn't recover for a week

243
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Well, it's not impossible

244
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Me too

245
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
No

246
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
The boss is a DQ

247
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
If you try to defeat the boss you fought before

248
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'll finish you all!

249
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's impossible without a rescue

250
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
If you can do it without his protection

251
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'll win!

252
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'll take the powerful attack that will break the rock

253
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I hate you!

254
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
The enemy is gone!

255
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'll take you!

256
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I hate you!

257
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
We did it!

258
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
The attack didn't work

259
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
But the defense failed

260
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Our attack didn't give us 1mm damage

261
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Something flew by

262
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
The boss's DQ that was not hurt by the Chinese

263
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I can't defeat him with this

264
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Excuse me!

265
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yes?

266
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Who threw it?

267
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
That's the hunter over there

268
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
What a great destruction

269
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Is he a top-class hunter?

270
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I can't believe I can defeat him with just one shot

271
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Maybe that Golem didn't have much power

272
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Jin...

273
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
The End

274
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
The End

275
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
We press, we press

276
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
The voice of the heart

277
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
We press, we press

278
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
The strong heart

279
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
The number one thing that makes you freeze

280
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
The mirror, the mirror

281
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Are you a truth?

282
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I am me

283
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
The hidden truth

284
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
The color of despair

285
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I'll crush the darkness

286
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'll break through the darkness

287
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'll never let you go

288
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'll destroy myself

289
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And take what I've got

290
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
The End

291
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
The End

292
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
The End

293
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
The End

294
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
The End

295
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
The End
