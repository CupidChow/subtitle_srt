1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,480
vy

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,460
pee

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,660
Deja sogar

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,160
They're both dead!

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,160
Don't move! If you move, you'll get another attack!

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,660
Jackie! Jackie!

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,660
It's a total failure.

8
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,660
If Son hadn't noticed, everyone would have died.

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,160
What?

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,660
Didn't you know that you were screaming?

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,660
No, but I felt like it was dangerous.

12
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,160
Son! The arm!

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,160
I'll have to do something if I get bitten by a tree.

14
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,160
Will I be able to do it?

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,160
I should have asked the chief to do it, but she's very kind.

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,160
She's a BQ healer, but she can only use simple raids.

17
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,160
I've experienced BQ twice or three times before.

18
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,160
She's an AQ.

19
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,160
Or an SQ.

20
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,160
The Caltenon Temple that was written on the wall is...

21
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,160
One, guard the gods.

22
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,160
Two, obey the gods.

23
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,160
Three, trust the gods.

24
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,160
Those who can't protect the gods will live.

25
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,160
Son, that god must be his.

26
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:42,160
A few years ago, a tour was made on the site and the gate of the temple.

27
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,160
A great event was born that was able to surpass the common sense in the world.

28
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,160
The appearance of the people called Hunters is a good example.

29
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:59,160
Hunters are the role of defeating monsters hidden in the dungeon on the other side of the gate.

30
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,160
They never change the power given to them.

31
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,160
And sometimes, on the other side of the gate,

32
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:15,160
they are afraid and wait for the ultimate monster to be defeated.

33
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,160
The temple is a temple that is not only a temple, but also a temple that is a temple of the gods.

34
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:44,160
The temple is also a temple that is a temple of the gods.

35
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,160
The temple is a temple that is a temple of the gods.

36
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,160
The temple is a temple that is a temple of the gods.

37
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,160
The temple is a temple that is a temple of the gods.

38
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,160
The temple is a temple that is a temple of the gods.

39
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,160
The temple is a temple that is a temple of the gods.

40
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,160
The temple is a temple that is a temple of the gods.

41
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,160
The temple is a temple that is a temple of the gods.

42
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,160
The temple is a temple that is a temple of the gods.

43
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,160
The temple is a temple that is a temple of the gods.

44
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,160
Very good.

45
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,160
The temple is a temple that is a temple of the gods.

46
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:45,160
Let's get it.

47
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,160
ااااااا.

48
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,160
Did you see this?

49
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,160
What were you doing? The class is about to start.

50
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,160
Just a minute.

51
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,160
Jina's brother is a hunter, right?

52
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:06,160
That's right. Well, even if you say he's a hunter, he's good-looking, so it's always hard to get hurt.

53
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,160
But he's just a real body now.

54
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,160
Why did you suddenly talk about that?

55
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,160
I can do better if I'm the one.

56
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,160
It's too strong to fight.

57
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,160
If you calm down, let's find a way to escape.

58
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,160
I'll be able to do that easily.

59
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
Don't die like that!

60
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:32,160
I finally got to the point where I signed with the Oogata Guild, but I can't let it end up like this!

61
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,160
What are you doing? You can't do this!

62
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,160
I can't do this. I'm not confident in that.

63
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,160
I'll do it before I get killed.

64
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,160
I can't do this!

65
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,160
If you're worried about that, you can kill us all.

66
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,160
That's also a way to make it easy for us to get rid of the insects.

67
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,160
But why won't you kill us right now?

68
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,160
You can't kill us even if we have the power to kill you.

69
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,160
It's different from the monsters that will come and run right away.

70
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,160
Son, what happened to the first one?

71
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,160
Wake up.

72
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,160
The first one is to erase the God.

73
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,160
God?

74
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,160
There's a rule in this dungeon.

75
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,160
What are you doing?

76
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,160
If my life is right...

77
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,160
Hey, stop it!

78
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,160
That's not the way to give up on living.

79
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,160
I'll kill you.

80
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,160
Everyone! Put your head down on that stone!

81
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,160
Put your head down?

82
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,160
What are you saying? Did you understand?

83
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
Yes.

84
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,160
I don't think he's going to attack if his head is low.

85
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,160
The God is correct.

86
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,160
Are you sure you have a secret?

87
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,160
Yes.

88
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,160
What do you think?

89
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,160
Then...

90
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,160
Is this going to help?

91
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,160
By this way...

92
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,160
Money?

93
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,160
His face has changed.

94
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,160
Nothing will come.

95
00:06:50,160 --> 00:07:06,640
Hey, the

96
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:19,160
Is this the end of this?

97
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,160
Son, there's a plan next.

98
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,160
There's no such thing.

99
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,160
But I don't think we can break the law here.

100
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,160
The second one is to erase God.

101
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,160
That's the key.

102
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,160
Erase?

103
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,160
Erase?

104
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,160
Please leave it to me.

105
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
I was researching the human power.

106
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,160
I remember the words of the three gods who gave God to me.

107
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
Oh, God...

108
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
The God who brought the world to its end.

109
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,160
How did you react?

110
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,160
It seems like the movement has become slow.

111
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,160
Show me the path of truth.

112
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,160
Wait, this is...

113
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,160
The words of God that I wish for...

114
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,160
It's not a word that can defeat this God.

115
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:14,160
I will destroy you, the God who brought the world to its end.

116
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,160
Damn it! Run!

117
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,160
It's dangerous to be in a hurry.

118
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,160
Yes, sir.

119
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,160
Sir, run!

120
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,160
Why are you going to die in a girl's place?

121
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,160
You want me to wait for you?

122
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,160
It's okay to go this far, right?

123
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,160
Hey, Fakus!

124
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,160
Go!

125
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,160
Fakus!

126
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
God, please.

127
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,160
God, please.

128
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,160
What do you mean by that?

129
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,160
It's not just a joke.

130
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,160
But...

131
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,160
It's not like I'm going to kill you.

132
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,160
What's wrong with you?

133
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,160
No...

134
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,160
Ono...

135
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,160
Ono...

136
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,160
Ken...

137
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,160
Gakkei...

138
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,160
Gakkei...

139
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
Everyone!

140
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,160
Run away before the enemy who has Gakkei!

141
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,160
Gakkei...

142
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,160
Are you playing?

143
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,160
Hey!

144
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,160
The enemy who has Gakkei is not attacking!

145
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,160
Damn it!

146
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,160
Hurry up and make a sound!

147
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,160
Hurry up!

148
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,160
I can't believe it's the two of us.

149
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
Don't move, Shiki!

150
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,160
Mr. Shin!

151
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,160
It's a trap!

152
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,160
It's not there!

153
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,160
Mr. Shin!

154
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,160
Not yet!

155
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
Not yet!

156
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,160
Not yet!

157
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,160
This is the answer to the world.

158
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,160
Mr. Shin!

159
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,160
It's okay!

160
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,160
Yes, somehow...

161
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
Mr. Shin!

162
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,160
Yes...

163
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,160
The bridge...

164
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,160
It's okay, Shiki.

165
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,160
It's okay.

166
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,160
What are you saying?

167
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,160
I'll fix it and show you!

168
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,160
Mr. Jyuhi...

169
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,160
This is a tragedy.

170
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,160
It's a shame.

171
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,160
It's a pity that I'm not good at arm wrestling,

172
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,160
but I've made a very careful decision.

173
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,160
The cause is the law.

174
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,160
It's terrible!

175
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,160
In the first place, Kim-san...

176
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,160
You've decided it all, right?

177
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,160
You've also made a decision.

178
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,160
I've made a final decision.

179
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,160
I have all the responsibility.

180
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,160
It's not the time to be angry.

181
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,160
There's still one more thing to do.

182
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,160
What the hell is this?

183
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,160
What is that?

184
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,160
Saidan...

185
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,160
You're a good person, aren't you?

186
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,160
I'll give you the treasure and the sword that will be given to the gods.

187
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,160
You'll wake up the third person and believe in the gods.

188
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,160
You're stupid.

189
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,160
You know what you've been through so far.

190
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,160
Sonno,

191
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,160
you have to give me the sword.

192
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,160
You're a fool!

193
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,160
The man who was in the world before the departure

194
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,160
was taken to the dead.

195
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,160
You should know that.

196
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,160
I haven't forgotten the words I said.

197
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,160
I'll take responsibility, leader.

198
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,160
You're such a bastard!

199
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,160
Shut up!

200
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
I understand.

201
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,160
Let me go on my own.

202
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,160
Son-san is not the only one who's bad.

203
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,160
I've decided to come here with a final decision.

204
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,160
What are you trying to do?

205
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,160
Son-kun!

206
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,160
I have to do something else.

207
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,160
What do you mean?

208
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,160
I didn't need a film.

209
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,160
I'm sorry.

210
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,160
I want to find out about Saidan,

211
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,160
so could you help me walk?

212
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,160
Please stay close to Saidan.

213
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,160
But then...

214
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,160
Nothing will happen.

215
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,160
Did you find out something?

216
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,160
No, not yet.

217
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,160
If I wait here,

218
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,160
will someone come to help me?

219
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,160
The gate will open today and take a week.

220
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,160
They'll move out before the help comes.

221
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,160
If the gate is open, it will be completely released.

222
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,160
It's called dungeon break.

223
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,160
Then, the monster will come out of the gate.

224
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,160
To prevent that,

225
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,160
the goal of the raid is to defeat the dungeon boss

226
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,160
and seal the gate.

227
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,160
If we fail now,

228
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,160
that will be the outside world.

229
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,160
Hello.

230
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,160
Son-san, you're always welcome.

231
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,160
Mom, I'm here today.

232
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,160
I heard that you're late today.

233
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,160
I said you have a job,

234
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,160
but you're always sleepy.

235
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,160
And the previous test.

236
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,160
You two should come here.

237
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,160
Then, the fire of the mission will stop.

238
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,160
If something happens, it will be at that time.

239
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,160
The door is open.

240
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,160
Is it okay to go out?

241
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,160
This is a trap.

242
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,160
What is this sound?

243
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,160
The monster is coming this way.

244
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,160
What should we do?

245
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,160
Why are you coming here?

246
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,160
Mom!

247
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,160
Shiki, don't close your eyes.

248
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,160
Don't move when you open your eyes.

249
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,160
It's the same as the game you played when you were a kid.

250
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,160
Everyone, don't open your eyes from the beginning.

251
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,160
Wait!

252
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,160
Son-kun, what's going on?

253
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,160
The door was closed a little, but that person saved us.

254
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,160
Why?

255
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,160
The blue flame disappears with time.

256
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,160
The orange flame disappears with one drop.

257
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,160
The first one is the alarm.

258
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,160
The second one is the alarm.

259
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,160
The third one is the alarm.

260
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,160
It must be a trap.

261
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,160
A hope of fear and danger.

262
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,160
A hope of hope.

263
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,160
It may be a test to keep believing in God.

264
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,160
I can't do this anymore.

265
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,160
Chou-kun!

266
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,160
Stop it!

267
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
Don't move!

268
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,160
If there are no more people, we can be disqualified.

269
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,160
Son-kun, what are you doing?

270
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,160
Explain it to me!

271
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,160
If you keep your eyes off me, it's okay.

272
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
The blue flame is a timer.

273
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,160
When everything disappears, everyone should be saved.

274
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,160
But, brother,

275
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,160
when all the flames disappear,

276
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,160
it's possible that it will be closed.

277
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,160
Honestly, I didn't think the weakest brother would be so active.

278
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,160
If we could live this way, it's all thanks to you.

279
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,160
Him-san...

280
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,160
But, I have a family.

281
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,160
I don't want to die yet.

282
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,160
I want to live.

283
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,160
I'm already disqualified.

284
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,160
I'm sorry.

285
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,160
Why?

286
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,160
It's not over yet.

287
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,160
I'm sure I'll survive.

288
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,160
I've been able to live like this for so long.

289
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
You two should live.

290
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,160
Son-san...

291
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,160
I'm sure if you stay here alone,

292
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,160
the door won't be closed.

293
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,160
You two should still be saved.

294
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,160
Jyusha, please save Son-kun.

295
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,160
Yes, sir!

296
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,160
I can't...

297
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,160
I can't do anything!

298
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,160
It seems like you've done nothing to save Son-kun.

299
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,160
Son-san, please run away from Jyusha.

300
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,160
I said I'll stay here!

301
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,160
Then who will take care of Jyusha?

302
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,160
There's no time! Hurry!

303
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
No! Jyusha!

304
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,160
If that's the case, I'll...

305
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,160
It was a promise to keep the food safe, right?

306
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,160
Please eat first.

307
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,160
If you leave here, I'll go get some fish.

308
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,160
Please let me go!

309
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,160
I'm sorry.

310
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,160
I don't have time anymore.

311
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,160
Please.

312
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,160
Yes.

313
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,160
I'm glad I'm the only one who's going to die.

314
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,160
If that's the case,

315
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,160
I should have gone into the hot garden a little earlier.

316
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,160
You can't do it!

317
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,160
It's not?

318
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,160
He wanted to do Jyusha with me.

319
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:07,160
I'm been misunderstood for this on and on.

320
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,160
You blood-thirsty beast!

321
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,160
What is your name?

322
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,160
I'm good at everything.

323
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,160
Is it human path?

324
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,160
I've been living this far.

325
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,160
But...

326
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,160
I can't...

327
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,160
I can't... I can't...

328
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,160
I've become stronger...

329
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,160
But I couldn't...

330
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,160
But I...

331
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,160
I've been living this far, doing my best to do my best!

332
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,160
I've been living this far, doing my best to do my best!

333
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,160
Ugh!

334
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,160
What a fight...

335
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,160
It's all the same for everyone...

336
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,160
But in the end, you're just making yourself feel better!

337
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,160
I'm so happy that you're thanking me!

338
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,160
I'm the only one who thinks of myself the most!

339
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,160
I have a family too!

340
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,160
I want to live too!

341
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,160
I'm glad I'm the only one who dies...

342
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,160
You idiot!

343
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,160
You're hurting me!

344
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,160
No...

345
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,160
I don't want to die...

346
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,160
I have another chance...

347
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:23,160
I'm the only one who feels better...

348
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:30,160
I'm the only one who feels better...

349
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:37,160
I'm the only one who feels better...

350
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:44,160
I'm the only one who feels better...

351
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,160
We're friends! We're friends!

352
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,160
Our voices of truth...

353
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,160
We're friends! We're friends!

354
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,160
Our strong hearts...

355
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,160
I'm the only one who feels better...

356
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,160
Let's see the mirror...

357
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,160
Are you the truth?

358
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,160
I am me...

359
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,160
The hidden secret...

360
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,160
I color my despair with my heart...

361
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,160
I paint my weakness...

362
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:20,160
I can't escape the darkness...

363
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:26,160
I'm the only one who can break me...

364
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,160
I'm the only one who feels better...

365
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:38,160
I'm the only one who feels better...
