1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,560
The two-third-year-old Katsu Porto Shizuo

2
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,400
The 21st century Hito Shizuo

3
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,240
I give back the light

4
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,120
It gave me what I please

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,280
You guess no, you're my all

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,280
Cuz I'm back here

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,040
This game's no where to go

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm the one who's hit by the new

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,760
Cuz I'm back here

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,440
This game we can survive

11
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,040
I'm the one who's smashed the hum

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,200
The pride

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,920
The pain inside us

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,040
Two in one game

15
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,240
I'm the one who will win

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,560
You never go

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,680
So I'm gonna go

18
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,680
To win you

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,960
My life in this story

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,560
I'm gonna go

21
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,720
To the one who's shazel

22
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,960
So I'm gonna go

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,200
To the one who's shazel

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,120
Cuz I'm back here

25
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,920
This game's no where to go

26
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,600
I'm the one who's hit by the new

27
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,600
Cuz I'm back here

28
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,320
This game we can survive

29
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,680
I'm the one who's smashed the hum

30
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,080
The pride

31
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,920
The pain inside us

32
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,920
Cuz I'm back here

33
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,520
This game we can survive

34
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,680
Cuz I'm back here

35
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,680
I'm the one who's shazel

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,160
I'm lost on the road

37
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,440
I'm here

38
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,960
Lost on the road?

39
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,680
Are you from the mining team?

40
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,200
This is the boss room

41
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,960
Please leave

42
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,560
Chahen

43
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,800
You're not just a person

44
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,760
I didn't realize you could talk to me

45
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,800
You're mistaken

46
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,120
I didn't have any weapons

47
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,520
I'm sorry

48
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,680
Please get out of here

49
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,400
If you attack the boss now

50
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,200
The mining team will all be killed

51
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,400
I understand

52
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,040
Um, wait

53
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,040
Yes

54
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,480
It's not smelly

55
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,320
What is it?

56
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,600
Are you really a hunter?

57
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Well

58
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,480
I'm a good hunter

59
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,200
Nothing

60
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,120
Please be careful

61
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,800
The dungeon is big

62
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,600
I understand

63
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,800
Is it because the rank is low?

64
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,600
It wasn't smelly

65
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,040
It smells good

66
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,160
I'm lucky to be able to go to Chahunters

67
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,040
I'm lucky

68
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,760
I can't see you from far away

69
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,880
He's going to take us from the boss

70
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,840
He'll give us a break every time

71
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,400
He's young

72
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,000
That's why the boss room is...

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Chahunters don't like the smell of other hunters

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,800
The smell of hunters?

75
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,200
It's a good room

76
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,200
You always have flowers on your belly

77
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,760
Yes

78
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,760
That flower is...

79
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,560
I don't smell like a hunter

80
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,960
I'm sure he said something similar in the red gate

81
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,400
I'm a player

82
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,880
The only one who can understand the system

83
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,960
What is a player?

84
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,800
Thank you for your hard work

85
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Thank you

86
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,120
Thanks to you, I'm done

87
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,480
I didn't expect you to finish early than the recovery team

88
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,520
I'm sure you have it

89
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,760
I thought you were hiding it in the Power Showbell

90
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,680
No, I didn't

91
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,560
I've been doing it for a long time

92
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,680
But I've never seen someone as good as you

93
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,680
Ha...

94
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,280
Sousa, would you like to work under me?

95
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,160
I'll take care of the rest

96
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,520
I'm happy to hear that

97
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,400
But I just came in the open

98
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,960
I see

99
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,760
I'm sorry

100
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,080
Can you come in a day?

101
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,360
A day?

102
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,240
Yes

103
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,680
The raid tomorrow is the doubleheader of AQ and CQ

104
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,040
The fastest is tomorrow

105
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,720
I've found out if I can attack today

106
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,120
Wait, tomorrow?

107
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,560
The hunters have raids tomorrow

108
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,480
And the AQ and CQ?

109
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,800
Yes, I hope they come tomorrow

110
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,600
The second attack?

111
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,080
This is our strength

112
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,000
The guild that can attack with two AQ gates

113
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,280
Is there anything else in the country?

114
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,560
Where should we go tomorrow?

115
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,560
You'll come tomorrow, right?

116
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,640
Then I'll tell you tomorrow that I'll go to the Vidas

117
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,360
Huh? No, not yet

118
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,360
Well, well, my face is not even on the line

119
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:05,040
Can you check if you know the person working in the mining team?

120
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,920
The Sun Hunter

121
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,600
Do you know him?

122
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,040
Actually, I heard the same thing about the Chairman of the Che

123
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,520
Chairman of the Che?

124
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,880
Yes, but the information is now out of the air

125
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,640
What?

126
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,080
The top level hunter is not here, but the church is locked

127
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,080
I saw it for the first time

128
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,880
Is that so?

129
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,440
The code in the dungeon

130
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,040
The order of the Chairman

131
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,600
The sun of the church

132
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,560
There must be something

133
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,440
There have been many hunters so far

134
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,440
I smell good

135
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,440
I'm beginning to smell that person

136
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,720
Oh, here it comes

137
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,920
Sun

138
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,520
Good morning

139
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,040
Brother, did you eat properly?

140
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,080
Hey, Sun

141
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,440
Jinna, don't get hurt today

142
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,440
I forgot about this feeling for a while

143
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,440
Let's eat lunch together today

144
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,440
That's right, since it's a pleasure

145
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,440
Yes

146
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,440
Okay, first of all, it's from CQ

147
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,440
The attack team will be out soon

148
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,440
Get ready

149
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,440
Today is amazing

150
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,440
After all, it's early to have Sun

151
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,440
It's early to have Sun

152
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,440
Thanks to that, I can't rest until the AQ dungeon

153
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,440
I was surprised by the recovery team

154
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,440
Don't you really work at home?

155
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,440
Nitto, go

156
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,440
Yes, sorry

157
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,440
Hey

158
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,440
Chairman Songi

159
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,440
Can't you borrow one from the mining team?

160
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,440
I can't get the luck board

161
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
You don't know?

162
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,440
If you don't have the luck board, you'll get used to the recovery team

163
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,440
It's like a human being's fault

164
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,440
If you attack, you'll get a big risk

165
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,440
It's impossible to be a high-level hunter

166
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,440
No matter how many hands you get

167
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,440
No one is there

168
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,440
I'm going

169
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,440
Hey, Sun

170
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,440
You're saying it's useless?

171
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,440
There's a high-level monster inside

172
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,440
It's not as much as a life-threatening goldfish

173
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,440
It's okay

174
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,440
I have a lot of problems

175
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,440
No, not a problem

176
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,440
I don't know anything because I came here the first time

177
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
Where's the rank?

178
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,440
It's an AQ

179
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,440
So, to someone else?

180
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,440
No, I'll ask him

181
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,440
This time, I'm the captain of the attack team

182
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,440
I'm Sun Gifun

183
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,440
I'm Sun Jin

184
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,440
It's bigger than yesterday

185
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,440
But the amount of magic is less than yesterday

186
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
Please rest assured

187
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,440
If the danger is high, the two armies' houses won't be left behind

188
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,440
AQ is 6, BQ is 3

189
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,440
Those without an SK are not

190
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,440
If they're other guilds, they won't be placed in the two armies

191
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
Let's go back

192
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,440
Do hunters have two such attack teams?

193
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,440
The magic that's flowing is less than yesterday

194
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,440
But why?

195
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,440
I feel the same way as Red Gate

196
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,440
It's because of the tree

197
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,440
Don't worry

198
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
Gifun

199
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,440
The hunters here are all strong

200
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,440
There's no way to attack the monster without moving

201
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Thank you

202
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,440
If I succeed in this raid, I'll be entrusted with a military position

203
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,440
I'm not a representative or a deputy

204
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,440
I'm an AQ hunter

205
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,440
I can't do it

206
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,440
There's no order to fight

207
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,440
They're coming

208
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,440
It's a dungeon jackal!

209
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,440
What?

210
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
Get out!

211
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,440
Why is the dungeon jackal an AQ dungeon?

212
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,440
It's a normal monster

213
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,440
The dungeon jackal is a CQ monster

214
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,440
It's not that special

215
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,440
My neck...

216
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,440
Look, it seems someone has been changed

217
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,440
It means that he was killed as a double sword

218
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,440
I feel bad for him

219
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,440
The Gryșt In жить

220
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,440
It's growing

221
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,440
What?

222
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,440
It's the majesty

223
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,440
I can't hear you!

224
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,440
I'm aiming for the castle!

225
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,440
Be careful!

226
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,440
I can't do it that easily!

227
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,440
I can't hear you now!

228
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,440
How can you be so magical?

229
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,440
I'm too strong!

230
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,440
I can't move!

231
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,440
I'll shoot you!

232
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,440
You're a traitor!

233
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,440
You're a traitor!

234
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,440
I'll kill you!

235
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,440
I used a lot of mana.

236
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,440
How about this?

237
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,440
Ah!

238
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,440
Piro!

239
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,440
Please! Wait!

240
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,440
I'm coming!

241
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,440
There are many enemies!

242
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,440
If you get caught, you'll be in trouble!

243
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,440
Make a tank for three people!

244
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,440
I'll get caught!

245
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,440
The hell is this high-earning that I know about the B-class?

246
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,440
This is not someone that B-class members can do!

247
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,440
Damn!

248
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,440
I'll kill you all!

249
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,440
Next! Don't move!

250
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,440
I'll finish you off!

251
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,440
I'll kill you!

252
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,440
What... what happened?

253
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,440
What's this?

254
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,440
The way they're moving is...

255
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,440
Now!

256
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,440
Take this!

257
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,440
I don't want to be a part of this company.

258
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,440
I can't do anything wrong.

259
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,440
I'll let you go to the wrong side.

260
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,440
I'll let you go to the wrong side.

261
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,440
I'll let you go to the wrong side.

262
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,440
I'll let you go to the wrong side.

263
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,440
I'll let you go to the wrong side.

264
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,440
Is there any gunner?

265
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,440
It seems like it's okay.

266
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,440
It's a miracle that everyone is safe.

267
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,440
Hey, there's something strange happening during the battle.

268
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,440
The enemy's movement suddenly got worse.

269
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,440
Did Gina do it?

270
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,440
There's no way I can do it.

271
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,440
The thing I can use is a little bit of a magic that can be used as a little bit of a attack.

272
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,440
Other members are also powerful, right?

273
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,440
There's no one who can do such a thing while they're not in the secret base.

274
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,440
However, the key is the door, and the win is the win.

275
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,440
That's right. I'm glad you're lucky.

276
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,440
That little thing is making our attack team stupid.

277
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:46,440
I feel like I was hiding with some secret, even though there's a magic caster.

278
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,440
Well, I'm sure you helped me.

279
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,440
I'll make sure I didn't see it because there's a reason.

280
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,440
Captain Son, do you want to go first?

281
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,440
It's too dangerous for our attack team.

282
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,440
At least the two healers and magic users need three people.

283
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,440
I know it's a pity that you left the captain alone for the first time,

284
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:14,440
but I think it's better to turn back.

285
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,440
You don't want to give up, do you?

286
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,440
I want you to clear it.

287
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,440
But if you're a wise captain...

288
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:30,440
Then let's get rid of him first.

289
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,440
I'm so angry that I can't move forward.

290
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,440
I'm not that stupid.

291
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,440
What the...

292
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,440
It's a disaster. That's also a joke.

293
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,440
I didn't know you'd come.

294
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,440
Can you get rid of him?

295
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,440
What we can't do without time is...

296
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,440
The existence that can use the previous magic caster is in the dungeon.

297
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,440
I'm glad I turned back.

298
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,440
After all, we can't attack here.

299
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,440
What is this magic power?

300
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,440
You're kidding me!

301
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,440
The dungeon boss...

302
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
Hurry up, help me.

303
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,440
I got it.

304
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:20,440
The BQ Hunter's magic caster is so strong that I can't even feel it.

305
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,440
I'm cursed!

306
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,440
Semi, the new magic!

307
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,440
What's wrong? What did you do?

308
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,440
Gifu, you can't see this.

309
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,440
Gifu...

310
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,440
Don't come.

311
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
I just want to die even if I fight here.

312
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,440
You're going to die.

313
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,440
It's not over yet.

314
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,440
I'll take care of you.

315
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,440
I'm going to kill you.

316
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,440
I'm going to kill you.

317
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,440
I'm going to kill you.

318
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,440
I'm going to kill you.

319
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,440
I'm going to kill you.

320
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,440
Humans.

321
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,440
My name is Karygargan.

322
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,440
I want to meet you humans.

323
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,440
Karygargan, you're the one who closed your mouth.

324
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,440
That's right.

325
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,440
I'm the great master of the most proud.

326
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,440
Is there a stronger existence in this cave than you?

327
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,440
Do you think there's a strong existence in the world?

328
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:53,440
Do you think you can kill the spirit or come to meet the world?

329
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,440
Meet the world?

330
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,440
Son Hunter.

331
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,440
Yes.

332
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,440
When the boss comes out, we'll start attacking right away.

333
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,440
The result will be different.

334
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,440
He'll be taken care of and can't support the decision.

335
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,440
Please contact the main attack team by hand.

336
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
Are you going to die?

337
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,440
Our goal is to close the gate, not to live in the dungeon.

338
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,440
I have a request too.

339
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,440
It's a short message, but it's a good one.

340
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,440
Please give it to my family.

341
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,440
We can't go to the dungeon.

342
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,440
But you're wrong.

343
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,440
Please live here.

344
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,440
This despairing situation is like us in the dungeon.

345
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,440
Everyone at that time.

346
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,440
But these people...

347
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,440
I'll handle it for now, but I hope it doesn't happen.

348
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,440
I hope so.

349
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,440
Is there anyone there?

350
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,440
I wonder if he quit his job.

351
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,440
You mean, Hunter?

352
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,440
What's wrong? You're off today, right?

353
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,440
Um, isn't there anyone called Son Jin?

354
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,440
Ah, Son.

355
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,440
I just went to get him as a gift.

356
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,440
So, you're inside the gate?

357
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,440
We are human.

358
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,440
I meget Max.

359
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,440
To reach the top

360
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,440
Goodbye my weakness like my world

361
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,440
The lame of the world and I could lie

362
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,440
Look at the clock, the girl thing

363
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,440
Oh, ooh

364
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,440
Hello my crime, this white sound for us

365
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,440
It's getting old, excuse us, I can't hear you

366
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,440
I'm the morning of my love

367
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,440
Say goodbye, yes you can

368
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,440
Say goodbye, yes you can
