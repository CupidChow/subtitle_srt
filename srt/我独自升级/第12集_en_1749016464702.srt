1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I lost the first-aid kit.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I can't find it.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I have to kill all of them.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
There's no way I can survive.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I can't use the water gun.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I can't use the water gun.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But I'll give up.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'll show you how I live.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I've been in the hospital for a long time.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I know the way to the hospital.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
But I couldn't save the people I love.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That brother...

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
He's the worst weapon in the world.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The worst weapon?

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
No, not the worst.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yeah.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm just gonna get hurt and get pregnant.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm the weakest in the hunter.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Son, are you okay?

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Don't do anything more.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That's right, Jinu.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You better not do that.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm gonna die.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm gonna die.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Why are you trying to go down a dangerous path?

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You've grown so much in the past.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I think that's enough.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Isn't it?

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Jinu?

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm gonna die.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm gonna die.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Why are you trying to go down a dangerous path?

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You've grown so much in the past.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm gonna die.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Why are you trying to go down a dangerous path?

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You've grown so much in the past.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm gonna die.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Why are you trying to go down a dangerous path?

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You've grown so much in the past.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Covered by the doesn't even beat the rules.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The headlines, the head burns.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So we got a body, a heart and an ankle.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Boke a bullet and it came in from a zero.

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Everybody with a bunch of muscle power grows and grows.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Let's get it.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The third Jijutsu Raid.

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
My body has already been able to fight.

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I couldn't participate.

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You participated, didn't you?

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yes.

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I was a guest for the foreign exchange.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Many people have become victims.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The ones who have come back alive have a deep wound in their hearts.

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If it's a hunter, everybody has a wound.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But if you can't fight that wound,

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
the one waiting for you is a destruction.

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And this is really me?

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm a different person.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The body has grown and the body has improved.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You look strong.

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
But the only thing that changed was the appearance.

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The inside is still weak.

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's the same for me.

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You're not an EQ hunter.

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You're just like that.

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I don't know much about the water.

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Shut up!

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's not over yet.

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The result of the words that I said was prepared is broken.

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You're the one who killed you.

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
In the end, it's the same.

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
At that time...

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What happened after this?

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
A quest?

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The one who has a strong soul.

79
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I don't want to let you die here.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
See you later.

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'll see you later.

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
This is...

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Denartison.

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I didn't let you finish the daily quest.

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What should I do?

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Nice timing.

87
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Thanks to you, I was saved.

88
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I pray for your good luck.

89
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Is it a difficult quest so far?

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Or are you praying for my good luck and supporting me?

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Well...

92
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yes.

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's the first time that Hiroto has surpassed 90.

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Hm?

95
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
In the final state, I can't recover the potion and HP.

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'll wait for the natural recovery.

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm just looking forward to the recovery at the level up.

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I was worried about the path.

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The ladder...

100
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
That's right.

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'll meet you again when I'm alive.

102
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
If I can't take your life,

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'll give you the power to do the work.

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm just giving you my life!

105
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What a dream.

106
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Hm?

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You haven't come home yet?

108
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You're not working until now.

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I didn't expect you to come.

110
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm not sure.

111
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I said I had a security guard today,

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
but I wonder if he'll come.

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yeah.

114
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's convenient to recover at the level up.

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
There's more than 10 minutes left.

116
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'll prepare the equipment later.

117
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Hm?

118
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'll buy it.

119
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Knight Killer.

120
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
25% additional damage to the hero monster.

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm a little sleepy, but it's not bad.

122
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This is the rest.

123
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The ruins I got from the Eglid Line.

124
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'll definitely help you this time.

125
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The commander...

126
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Is it a useless skill?

127
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It seems efficient.

128
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I can give you physical training without touching it with my hands.

129
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That's the one at that time?

130
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Can't you still move big things?

131
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
This is how much I can prepare for it.

132
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I have to leave the rest to luck.

133
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I think the number of times I've been waiting has increased like a fool.

134
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Jezuto, we're going to the emergency meeting.

135
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I understand.

136
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
This situation is painful for you.

138
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
No, it's no problem.

139
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
When I was in the third Jezuto Raid, I wasn't a hunter,

140
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
but I understand the representative's feelings.

141
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'll help you if you say so.

142
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Representative Shin, I'll show you the secret reaction of the enemy.

143
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
This is...

144
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'll have to use it when I can't.

145
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm already tired of it.

146
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But what's this discomfort?

147
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
No matter how many times I beat it, I can't handle it.

148
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I can't even level up.

149
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What's the magic trick?

150
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Even though I'm in the prison, I can't do magic attacks.

151
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What's the magic they're attacking?

152
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But is it a summoning magic?

153
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The Nights are just summoning, but they're like weapons.

154
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So even if I beat them, I can't get the experience.

155
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'll aim for it if I can.

156
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Magic trick! You guys!

157
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I knew it.

158
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The spell is a magic trick.

159
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
If you know that,

160
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
there are five left.

161
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Four more.

162
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
How long are you going to hide behind me?

163
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I got you!

164
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
A goal?

165
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
4

166
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Do you think I made a power-up sought after with Nights?

167
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Do you think Ijąk instead made your goal?

168
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The End

169
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It seems like it's over.

170
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
What will happen next?

171
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
According to the points I've got,

172
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I can transfer to a higher class of jobs.

173
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I can analyze the activities of the job quest and give jobs.

174
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I can choose, right?

175
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Huh? What does it mean?

176
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The End

177
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The army of the old man?

178
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Huh?

179
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Wait, what is this?

180
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Is this my job?

181
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Necromancer?

182
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Wait, wait!

183
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I couldn't raise the capacity of the function.

184
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Why is that?

185
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Necromancer is a magical food that can summon and control the monsters of the undead.

186
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
On the other hand, I'm a assassinator.

187
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm close to fighting style.

188
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I've been gaining a lot of status and skills.

189
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
If I become a Necromancer of the high-ranking class,

190
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
it will be useless.

191
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yes, no.

192
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Can I pay for it?

193
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The return of the Necromancer's job is too much.

194
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
No.

195
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's a revolution.

196
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Is there any special power?

197
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Necromancer, if there is anything like Japan.

198
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Summoning magic?

199
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yes. The summoning magic used by this magic is also called the Necromancer and its close ability to control other people.

200
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And the battle here, it seemed like everyone could repeat the battle so far.

201
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
The battle was being held in a restaurant and the selection was being made.

202
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
System failure.

203
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But it's interesting.

204
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
They had no power to fight.

205
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
But I have it.

206
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Necromancer can't fight in the front line.

207
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
If the job is one of the status, it should be strengthened with the level up and the skill.

208
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And it's not strange that the army of the Moujian is stronger.

209
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
In other words, I'm not the only one who will level up.

210
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Isn't that good?

211
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Here you go.

212
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Thank you.

213
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The world is opening up.

214
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I think the Chaehunters will arrive soon.

215
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Hmm. Sorry for being late.

216
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
No.

217
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I was just saying that.

218
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Could you please come up with a little bit of my story?

219
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
The world is opening up.

220
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

221
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

222
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

223
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

224
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

225
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

226
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

227
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

228
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

229
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Oh.

230
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The Kanshu of the Shadow?

231
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
The suddenly rainbow-colored.

232
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Did he get that much points?

233
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
The skill of the profession and the ability to do business.

234
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And the reward.

235
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
The quest is over.

236
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Did he get the money?

237
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I can hear something like a secret.

238
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's like I'm talking to myself.

239
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
The Chaehunters of the Shadow.

240
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
The order is...

241
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Wake up.

242
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
This is amazing!

243
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
The Chaehunters of the Shadow and the reward of the Shadow?

244
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
The skill that can be used to summon the enemy who has been neutralized

245
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
by the skill that can be used to summon the shadow soldier.

246
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So they are the shadow soldier?

247
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
The power of the time of destruction is the power of the Chaehunters.

248
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It's better to be careful.

249
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Besides the knight, the magic user.

250
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And if they are in the Tokyo?

251
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
If the shadow of the AQI SQ can be neutralized

252
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
by the power of the power of the power of the time of survival.

253
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Alright.

254
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Besides the reward, the number of the summoner is the same as ours.

255
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
The Chaehunters of the Shadow and the reward of the Shadow?

256
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's bad to summon them.

257
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Alright.

258
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
The knight's team leader, the Chaehunters of the Shadow

259
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
can be neutralized by the power of the time of survival.

260
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Wake up.

261
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What?

262
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Is this the machine that was used earlier?

263
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Two more times.

264
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Wake up.

265
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Damn it.

266
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
We are not the Chaehunters now, but we are not the Chaehunters.

267
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
We can't go down without increasing the power of the Chaehunters.

268
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
That's why we have to train our team.

269
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Maybe they are waiting for the king's return.

270
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Maybe they will come back someday.

271
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Knight's Team, Yigurid.

272
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You are a warrior.

273
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It's the only thing you can do with your sword.

274
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Is it okay to let the sword be crushed by such a scabish place?

275
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
If you need someone to give you a sword, use me.

276
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I don't want to protect the shadow of the Shadow that disappeared.

277
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Protect me in front of you.

278
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Wake up.

279
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
What?

280
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
But...

281
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I will fight against time.

282
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Now, the new students who are still alive.

283
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's decided.

284
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Yigurid.

285
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
That's your name.

286
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Inside of you...

287
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
is the King of the Chaehunters.

288
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I will protect you.

289
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I will protect you.

290
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
That's your name.

291
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Inside of you...

292
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
is the new power that surpasses our imagination.

293
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's not like it's born at this moment.

294
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Please.

295
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Please.

296
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Please.

297
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Please.

298
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Please.

299
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Please.

300
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Please.

301
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Please.

302
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Please.

303
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
President Chae.

304
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
What the hell is this?

305
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I don't know.

306
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I shouldn't have known this.

307
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
But this is...

308
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
...a evolution.
