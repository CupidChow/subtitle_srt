I look handsome and I’m outgoing.

I have a rich family and I’m good at basketball.

And I can sing well.

I’m a perfect guy.

Since I’m such a great guy,

Pei Xiaoyun has no right to criticize me.

She’s nagging about study all day.

It’s not like you can do whatever you want if you study well.

My dad is pretty much illiterate.

Yet he’s living a good life.

you don’t need to say anything now.

And I also don’t need to force you to study.

189

It’s your own business anyway.

It’s really because this is emergent.

Thanks.

Are you okay?

545
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:18,890
Let’s go to the hospital.

546
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,090
No, our time will be wasted.

547
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:23,730
Do as I said.

[ICU  Emergency]

549
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,380
It’s 8:06 now.

550
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,310
According to our agreement,

551
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:40,630
today is coming to an end.

552
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,710
There are three hours and fifty-four minutes left.

553
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,520
A minute less is not a whole day.

554
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,900
Where can we go at a time like this?

555
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,670
Although you’re not disabled,

556
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,560
your legs are still injured.

557
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:54,750
You don’t have to do this.

558
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,300
So, are you caring about me?

559
00:32:58,490 --> 00:32:59,680
You’re so glib.

560
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:00,950
Seems like you are fine.

561
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:03,150
You will know if you follow me.

562
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,000
No more stairs.

563
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,870
We’re arriving soon.

564
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,280
Open your eyes.

565
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,570
This was my world.

566
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,910
It was colored when you came.

567
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,860
It was you

568
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:38,490
that made me want to

569
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:40,110
hug someone.

570
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:43,110
Of course, I was too impulsive.

571
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,160
So, maybe you think

572
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,850
my feelings are just temporary.

573
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,530
But I’m not that kind of man.

574
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:53,450
I don’t do this to everyone.

575
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:55,870
I know

576
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,460
you won’t have feelings for me today.

577
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,060
But I just want you to be happy.

578
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:06,430
That’s enough.

579
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:10,960
Cheng Feng.

580
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:13,909
Will you let me

581
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:15,179
spend this winter with you?

582
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,260
Just a winter?

583
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:33,530
Even if I say yes,

584
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,570
how long do you think we can be together?

585
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:40,739
Actually,

586
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,639
we are kind of alike, don’t you think?

587
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,260
We are lonely

588
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:45,800
though we don’t seem so.

589
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,560
We seem to be passive.

590
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,659
It’s all because that

591
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,170
we haven’t met the one.

592
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:52,800
We seem indifferent.

593
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,350
But we are more enthusiastic than anyone else.

594
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,550
And we also aspire for love.

595
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,760
Yes, I still don’t know you well enough.

596
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:01,860
But I believe that

597
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:02,830
this could work out

598
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,900
if you give me time since we are so similar.

599
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,220
I will get to know you.

600
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,200
I can. Trust me.

601
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,030
Know me?

602
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,880
To know me is to ignore my will

603
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,460
and enter my life without permission.

604
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,060
To know me is to give me troubles

605
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,900
after I refuse you.

606
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,460
To know me is

607
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,760
to disturb me,

608
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,160
yet you will study abroad soon.

609
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,580
You think that’s how

610
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,770
you love me.

611
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:34,950
But it’s irresponsibility.

612
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:36,760
We don’t

613
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,940
have common interests.

614
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,260
No common topics.

615
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,300
How can we continue

616
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,150
when the passion subsides?

617
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,200
We can make it happen.

618
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,130
No.

619
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,460
Even if we don’t have common topics,

620
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,310
I can find one.

621
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,390
You… You said

622
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,460
you like dancing, and you like cats.

623
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,260
You like drinking. I like

624
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,060
everything you like.

625
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,580
How would you think these are what I like?

626
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,850
I drink because

627
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:41,170
I haven’t found anything

628
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,620
more nerve numbing than alcohol.

629
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,780
I have a cat

630
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,720
just because I think he’s poor

631
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:47,900
and feed him some food.

632
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,420
As for dancing,

633
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,020
it’s you who think I like it. Not me.

634
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:56,830
I don’t even know

635
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,930
what I like myself.

636
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,030
How can you like what I like?

637
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,570
So, don’t waste your energy anymore.

638
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,500
Please abide by the agreement.

639
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,190
So, you

640
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,090
faked all

641
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:11,750
your feelings today?

642
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,180
You are still clear-minded.

643
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,260
So, seems like you haven’t touched yourself.

644
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:20,200
Tell me

645
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,570
if it’s disappointing

646
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,990
to work in vain?

647
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:29,350
This is me.

648
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:31,950
I’m selfish and cruel.

649
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,500
You said we are alike.

650
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,300
Let me tell you this.

651
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:38,630
I don’t even like myself.

652
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:41,320
How can I like you?

653
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,070
I don’t believe you haven’t been touched

654
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,260
for a moment today.

655
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,090
Playing basketball. Riding a bicycle.

656
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,630
Your eyes won’t lie.

657
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,050
Although I don’t know

658
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:55,840
what happened to you before,

659
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,520
♫ I want to know why you feel lonely ♫

660
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:01,380
I know you

661
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:03,280
♫ I want to stay with you ♫

662
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,610
deserve to be liked.

663
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,120
You have every right to be liked.

664
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,630
♫ I wanna tell you not to be afraid of the dark since I’m here ♫

665
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:11,410
Cheng Feng, I won’t give up.

666
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:15,700
♫ I want to keep you warm ♫

667
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,420
I won’t.

668
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,390
♫ Pray that you will keep it ♫

669
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:26,030
♫ It’s okay. I will rest assured if you are happy ♫

670
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:31,260
♫ How satisfactory can love be

671
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,140
♫ It’s the dearest company

672
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:38,520
♫ I’ve been used to it ♫

673
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,730
Some people like you.

674
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:43,290
♫ Even my tears are brave ♫

675
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,910
But they stop liking you after they know you.

676
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:47,270
♫ The moments of our memory ♫

677
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:49,830
After I saw your laziness and sensibility,

678
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:52,500
♫ The answer you are looking for in every minute ♫

679
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:54,180
I found that you are lonely and weak.

680
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:59,440
♫ I really want to shoulder everything for you ♫

681
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,740
I felt your cruelty and indifference.

682
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,310
♫ I may feel lonely in youth ♫

683
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,820
But I got more obsessed.

684
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,120
You said I haven’t touched myself.

685
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:07,250
♫ I can be brave when I’m with you ♫

686
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:06,760
But I

687
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,690
♫ Time has taught us ♫

688
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:09,540
never treated this

689
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:15,420
♫ to be grateful for having each other ♫

690
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,440
as a game.

691
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:19,430
♫ I laugh and cry because of you ♫

692
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:24,410
♫ I spent all the best time with you ♫

693
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:31,560
♫ Staying with you is my best habit ♫
