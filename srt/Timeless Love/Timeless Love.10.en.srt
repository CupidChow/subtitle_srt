[Linxi First Hospital]

6
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,890
Dian

7
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,470
seems to be smart,

8
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,750
but, in fact,

9
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,670
he is quite a fool.

10
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,600
Say…

11
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,800
He did so many things

12
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,690
without telling anyone.

13
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,800
He was preparing

14
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,160
for the physics competition

15
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,970
while working day and night

16
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,240
to do the virtual reality project for you.

17
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:01,500
So, he got himself exhausted.

18
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,080
I didn't know

19
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,040
he had done so much for me.

20
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,210
I don't mean to blame you.

21
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,050
If someone were to blame,

22
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,500
blame him for being a

23
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,080
poor boy that no one loves.

24
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,400
His father

25
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,150
always

26
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,650
neglects him.

27
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,280
And his mother always

28
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,090
pushes him to study business.

29
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,900
She doesn’t care about other things.

30
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,620
Being a child raised this way,

31
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,430
he doesn’t know how to

32
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,620
repay people’s kindness.

33
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,600
If you are kind to him,

34
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,060
he wants to give you

35
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,950
the nicest things he can have.

36
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,760
No matter what lies in the future for him,

37
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:39,960
Cheng,

38
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,460
you work so hard for Jiang Dian,

39
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,650
keeping yourself busy.

40
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,290
You're a good girl.

41
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,500
In fact,

42
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,610
I just want you to be nicer

43
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:52,630
to Jiang Dian.

44
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:54,079
This kid’s life

45
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,660
is so hard.

46
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,910
He has suffered too much.

47
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,050
He doesn’t say anything

48
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,950
about his sufferings.

49
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,730
Now it's good.

50
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,910
He has you now.

51
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,470
When he is with you,

52
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,740
he won't suffer anymore.

53
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,750
He just wants to take care of you.

54
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,990
One can only be

55
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,970
devoted to one person.

56
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,890
Don't worry, Professor Chen.

57
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,220
I will take good care of him.

58
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,960
Good, Cheng,

59
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,850
Jiang Dian is so lucky to have you.

60
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,190
Okay, let me check on him.

61
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:49,960
I…

62
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:52,640
Well…

63
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,230
You brat.

64
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,510
I have come to see you, bringing some fruits.

65
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,750
You should be happy.

66
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,200
Why are you disappointed?

67
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,830
Why are you here?

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,350
I…

69
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,230
I was going to ask you that.

70
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,780
You brat!

71
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,460
I thought the jog of

72
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:11,740
you lying to your mother was up.

73
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,990
Do you think your mother did it on purpose?

74
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,550
She changed the time for the interview

75
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:18,870
and it would be the time

76
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,010
for the physics competition.

77
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,470
The interview can be rearranged,

78
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,280
but

79
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,160
the physics competition can't.

80
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,010
It's a done deal.

81
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:27,930
I don't care.

82
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,380
You must not stand me up

83
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,610
for the competition!

84
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:31,670
Or else,

85
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,430
I can't take it.

86
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,070
Well,

87
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,650
your mother

88
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,850
can't see the talent in you.

89
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,000
That's alright.

90
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,070
But your health

91
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,170
is so poor.

92
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,750
If I were your father,

93
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,150
I would have…

94
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,040
Alright.

95
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,870
Let's not talk about it.

96
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,210
Cheng is good.

97
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,710
Cheng is really kind to you.

98
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,230
Cheng, you're back.

99
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,090
Here, you take care of him.

100
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,210
Tomorrow, whether he can go to Hua City

101
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,440
or not depends on you.

102
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,110
Don't worry.

103
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,170
I won't let you down.

104
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,810
Great! Great!

105
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,910
Okay, you guys talk.

106
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,920
I'll go home.

107
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,120
Bye.

108
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,090
Are you feeling better?

109
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:20,990
Yes, I'm better.

110
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,550
The doctor said you are overworked.

111
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,780
You need to rest.

112
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:27,900
Dian.

113
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,790
Don't hurt

114
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,850
yourself again.

115
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:31,290
Okay?

116
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,310
Even if it’s for me.

117
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,440
Cheng, in fact, I…

118
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,360
Let me finish my words.

119
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:41,850
Dian, you are an individual.

120
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,650
You don’t belong to anyone.

121
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,950
Although in the past,

122
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,760
no one worried about you when you were sick,

123
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,040
now it's different.

124
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,020
If you're sick,

125
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,860
I'll be concerned about you.

126
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,460
So,

127
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,610
for my sake,

128
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,120
take care of yourself, okay?

129
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,440
You know what?

130
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:04,730
Ever since I was a kid,

131
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,580
no one has ever cared about me.

132
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,070
You're the first one.

133
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,110
Dian.

134
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,660
I don't have much.

135
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,600
So,

136
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,400
take care of yourself.

137
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,000
I want to accompany you for a longer period of time.

138
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:21,800
I promise.

139
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,060
Lu Bie.

140
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,450
Have you ever kissed anyone? Tell me.

141
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:06,680
What does it feel like?

142
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,140
Watch it.

143
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:09,800
But don’t pinch me.

144
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,280
Why are you staring at me?

145
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,440
The feeling?

146
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,490
How can I tell you?

147
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,560
Try it. It can’t be taught.

148
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,420
You old bachelor.

149
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,310
As if you had kissed someone.

150
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,850
You, you're the bachelor!

151
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,910
Your whole family are bachelors.

152
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,360
Don't you know that?

153
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,110
Why do you ask?

154
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,070
So sour!

155
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,920
Damn monkey, you ate my orange

156
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,540
and you tell me it's sour?

157
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:40,430
It’s not okay.

158
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,700
I must try it for Dian first.

159
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,200
It’s sweet.

160
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,960
Stop eating.

161
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:45,840
This is for Dian.

162
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,850
Don’t eat it all.

163
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,570
How dare you?

164
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,060
You've crushed my flowers.

165
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:50,990
They have all wilted.

166
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,100
Don’t talk about the flowers.

167
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,070
You came visiting the sick.

168
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,120
Why did bring yellow and white chrysanthemums?

169
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,190
Are you sure you are here to visit the sick?

170
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,860
People who don't know will think you're here…

171
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:00,760
What should we do?

172
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,000
Why don't we go down and buy some more?

173
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:03,920
And we can come back later.

174
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,560
You're here.

175
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,850
We have been here for a while.

176
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,570

00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,410
The day after tomorrow is the visa interview. Be serious about it.

349
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:50,860
Something came up suddenly.

350
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:51,560
I can't go there.

351
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,280
When you finish your interview,

352
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,250
call me as soon as possible

353
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,170
and tell me the result.

354
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,250
Mom, I really

355
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,620
love physics.

356
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:00,670
That's enough, Dian.

357
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,860
I have given you so many chances.

358
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,140
What do you want from me?

[Jiang Dian]

360

Everything you have

361
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,349
is from me.

362
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:11,980
Good education

363
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,390
and a chance to study abroad

364
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,190
are so important to others.

365
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,790
But you keep disobeying me.

366
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,200
Why can’t you behave like

367
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,650
other children who are obedient?

368
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,160
Why do you have to disobey me?

369
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,050
Do you want to hurt my feelings?

370
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,140
I hope this is the last time

371
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,200
you say this to me.

372
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,350
From now on, the only thing

373
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:32,920
on your mind is

374
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,330
to study economics.

375
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,050
If you keep doing this,

376
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,190
we'll all be embarrassed.

377
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,070
Others will laugh at us.

Do you understand?

379
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,920
I want you to think about it.

380
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:44,720
Don't be so naive.

381

There is a limit to my patience.

can you tell what I added to the soup

after you had left?

Why did you add Hangzhou white
chrysanthemum and loquat?

465

Because you need them.

466

They can clear toxic material and moisten the lung.

467

They can also reduce internal heat.

But a long time ago,

487
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,590
she planned my life.

488

She wants me to live as she wishes.

00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:15,750
Previously, I thought

490
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,460
it was maternal love.

491
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,130
Therefore, I tried very hard

492
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,540
to win her attention.

493

Later on, I found that

she only wanted to manipulate my life.

495

She doesn’t care about me at all.

496

For example,

497
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,800
my classmates’ parents would pick them up.

498
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,910
She only sent a driver to pick me up.

499

Most of the time,

No one will praise me when my score is high.

No one will blame me when my score is low.

693
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:52,980
I don’t want them to look at you.

694
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,300
If Dian doesn’t like it,

695
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:58,700
I won’t let them look at me.

696
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:00,770
Dian,

697
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,020
I will give you

698
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,510
what your parents haven’t given you.

699
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,620
Go now. Try your best!

700
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:18,500
OK.

and they finally are.

[National Physics Competition for College Students]

716
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:32,480
Hello, Baoling!

717
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,950
Cheng, I have sent you

718
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,180
the demo of Lian Ruoshen’s song
for his debut.

719
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:36,880
Please take a look.

720
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:38,990
This time

721
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,310
I want you to compose a dance for him.

722
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,550
Don’t refuse me.

723
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:42,730
OK.

724
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:47,220
Cheng, I’m serious.

725
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:47,930
Don’t lie to me.

726
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,300
I’m not joking with you.

727
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:51,710
I don’t have much time.

728
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,690
On the one hand, I want to help you.

729
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,140
On the other hand, I have my own plan.

730
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,420
Baoling,

731
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:59,010
I want to open a dance studio.

732
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:04,510
Baby, you finally want to launch your career!

733
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:06,800
I’ve persuaded you for half a year.

734
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,990
You didn’t respond much to me.

735
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:10,500
Why did you change your mind?

736
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:13,670
I’m going to the bookstore.

737
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,370
Wait for me!

738
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,300
Come to see me in Hua City.

739
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:20,310
Hua City? What are you doing in Hua City?

740
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,420
I’m with Dian. He participates in a competition.

741
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:26,780
I think

742
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,050
I don’t need to see you in Hua City.

743
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,340
Now I know that

744
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,570
the power of love

745
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:32,540
has made you change.

746
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,610
Please tell me

747
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:35,440
how did he persuade you?

748
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,610
Tell me.

749
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,860
No matter how talented you are,

750
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,840
on learning,

751
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,330
you can’t have accomplishments at one stroke.

752
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,140
You must try hard.

753
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,730
You must make the great effort

754
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,450
that no one knows.

755
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,400
In this way, you may appear effortless to others.

756
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,700
Cheng? Cheng?

757
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:41,970
There is no signal?

758
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,160
Cheng, are you listening?

759
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,280
Since the one I love is so excellent,

760
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,310
I want to become a better man.

761
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:54,510
Yeah. Falling in love is so sweet.

762
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,960
I am witnessing PDA.

763
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,160
I hope your love affair

764
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,400
can help you

765
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,580
compose a great dance.

766
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,920
Cheng, I have sent

767
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,410
the demo to your mailbox.

768
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,160
Please take a look.

769
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,740
Tell me if there are any problems.

770
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:08,990
-OK.
-Bye-bye!

771
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,150
♫ A beautiful transformation. ♫

772
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,550
♫ Break the cocoon at the last second
and become a butterfly. ♫

773
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:25,490
♫ Being laughed at ♫

774
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:29,230
♫ was like a passing wind that can be ignored. ♫

775
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,400
♫ Create a world that belongs to your own. ♫

776
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,630
Can you be quiet for a moment?

777
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:37,150
You are made of iron.

778
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,570
But I’m not. Let me take a nap.

779
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,230
Why do you sleep?

780
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,390
You should work hard on this beautiful day.

781
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,150
Recently I practiced singing

782
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:48,980
all night.

783
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,830
I didn’t say I was tired. Why are you tired?

784
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,920
How can you say that?

785
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,420
Haven’t I spent the whole night with you?

786
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,970
Haven’t I helped you

787
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,030
write this song?

788
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,530
I was wrong. I was wrong.

789
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,210
I really didn’t mean it.

790
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,780
Hello, Baoling!

791
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:09,710
OK!

792
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:16,130
OK! Thank you, Baoling!

793
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,360
I need to thank Cheng!

794
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,150
What is it?

795
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,520
Cheng will compose a dance for me!

796
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,310
Really!

797
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,940
I’m so happy!

798
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:26,870
I’m going to fly!

799
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,320
Will I become famous?

800
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,590
Of course!

801
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:37,950
I thought you had stopped

802
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:39,410
thinking about becoming a star.

803
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:40,770
I’ve prepared so many materials

804
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,090
so that you can review the lessons.

805
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,600
I think I was carrying coals to Newcastle.

806
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,550
Yun!

807
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:49,390
Yun!

808
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:53,840
Gosh! I’ve bombed the exam.

809
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,110
I’m too ashamed to see Mr. Chen.

810
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,710
How can the questions be so difficult?

811
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,910
Anyway, it’s the final.

812
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,410
The questions can’t be simple.

813
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:04,880
Why are you still here?

814
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,250
I asked you to go home and wait for me.

815
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,050
Because I know

816
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,550
you would like to see me

817
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:10,210
when you come out.

818
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,380
Don’t be too nice to me.

819
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:20,590
I’m afraid I can’t leave you.

820
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:22,700
I’m even more afraid that it is a dream.

821
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:26,660
Dian,

822
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,420
let’s go for a date.
