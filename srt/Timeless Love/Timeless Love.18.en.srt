177

You’ve never cared about me like this.

you don't deserve it.

Do you know?

182
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,590
You would stay here another night

183
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,550
if I hadn't talked to the lawyer.

184

Fine. Stop looking around. She's not here.

185

She's choreographing

with her ex-boyfriend.

187
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:54,590
How would she have time to come here?

188
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,670
Forget it. Come home with me.

10 A.M. tomorrow.

196

What did the police say?

197
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,980
The suspect insisted he hadn't drugged me.

198
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,390
The police are collecting evidence.

199

Of course it’s him!

Very good.

202
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,980
You made progress.

203
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,470
But there's still room for improvement.

204
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,380
Go back to work.

205
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,350

Cheng, thank you.

207
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,150
Ms. Cheng.

208
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,150
There was a little misunderstanding before.

209
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,230
But I hope you can

210
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:27,830
treat them equally.

211
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,230
You can't be partial.

212
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,780
This is my job.

213
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,430
It's unnecessary

214
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,670
to ruin my reputation for a certain someone.

215
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,670
I think…

216
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,750
this choreography

217
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,750
is not as good as yours for Lian Ruoshen.

218
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,190
Even if it's the same dance,

219
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,830
different dancers

220
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,830
will have different feel.

221
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,230
The point is whether the dancer

222
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,310
is capable to handle it.

223
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,110
It's not her problem.

224
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,350
It's my fault.

225
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,430
Good. A self-aware man.

227
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,670
It's good for Zhou Yao

228
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,740
to dance like this

229
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,790
in just a week.

230
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,820
But we all know

231
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,870
Cheng should get all the credit.

232
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:17,950
Baoling's right.

233

235
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:22,550
it'll be better.

236
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:23,940

I'm sorry, Dian.

I would stay away from him.

288

But…

00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,790
I know you did this for me.

290

only lasts until his album release.

294

It'll be over soon.

295

I won't let it go.

Why didn't you answer my calls?

309

You wanna get rid of me

310
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,990
after what you've done?

311
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,470
If it's true,

312
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,790
why would I prepare you for going abroad

313
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,620
and give you a great deal of money?

Gibberish.

315
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,310
If you prepared indeed,

316
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:45,990
why didn't I receive that?

317
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,910
The preparation

318
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,110
was only finished today.

319
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:50,990
If you don't believe me,

320
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,500
I can show you the texts.

321
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:56,950
An Yin,

322
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,470
I consider you my friend.

323
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,740
Why do you think

324
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,590
I risked to do this

325
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:03,700
with you?

326
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,190
I admit,

327
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,780
I dislike Cheng Feng.

328
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,710
But I don't hate her like you do.

329
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,910
Think about it,

330
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:12,830
what happened to her

331
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,870
is something you'd like to see.

332
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,390
But for me,

333
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,780
I don't care about it.

334
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,350
So how can you explain

335
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,180
Zhou Yao saving Cheng Feng?

336
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,820
His appearance was too coincidental.

337
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,150
Can you guarantee that

338
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,350
you never told him?

339
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,790
You think I would be that stupid

340
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,030
to tell Zhou Yao our plan

341
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,790
knowing he likes Cheng Feng?

342
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,590
Shoot ourselves in the foot?

343
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,150
An Yin,

344
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,550
you doubt me like this.

345
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,300
It hurts me.

346
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:49,670
Sorry.

347
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,510
I didn't mean it that way.

348
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,030
I'm just too anxious.

349
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,990
The police began investigation.

350
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,590
I'm afraid they'll suspect me.

351
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,670
Rest assured.

352
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:03,870
Everything's gonna be okay.

353
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:05,980
To speak bluntly,

354
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,300
even if something happens,

355
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,350
I won't let you

356
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,470
suffer for nothing.

357
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,550
I'll make her payback.

358
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,260
Wait a moment.

359
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,470
It'll be ready soon.

360
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,150
I gotta take this.

361
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,630
Jiang Dian.

362
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,870
Come on over here.

363
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,190
Something went wrong in the program.

364
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,910
I have to go to school.

365
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:24,710
Don't worry.

366
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,110
I'll meet you at home.

367
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,310
I'll be right back.

368
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,310
Look what you did!

369
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,670
Our program is suspended.

370
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,550
Professor Chen was kicked out of our program.

371
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:42,460
It's too late to say anything.

372
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,780
You disappeared for four days.

373
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,630
There're mistakes in your data,

374
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,540
which weren't corrected in time.

375
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,630
Now we have huge problems

376
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:48,350
with our experiment.

377
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,110
We failed to submit results of this stage.

378
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,510
So we have to pay for it.

379
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,220
I'm sorry.

380
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,070
I will take on the responsibility.

381
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,590
How are you going to?

382
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:00,550
Do you know

383
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,750
how much responsibility and pressure

384
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,550
Professor Chen took on for you?

385
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,510
You will take on the responsibility?

386
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:04,950
Enough.

387
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,990
Anyway, Professor Chen was suspended.

388
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,350
You should be grateful
that you have such a good supervisor.

389
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,380
Cheng.

390
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,830
Why did you drink so much?

391
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,070
I miss you so much.

392
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:43,670
What's going on?

393
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:51,540
It'll be okay.

394
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:52,910
I'm always here with you.

395
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,150
Zhou Yao!

396
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,860
Shame on you!

397
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,620
How dare you steal my endorsement!

398
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,580
Mind your words.

399
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,660
How can you say I stole it?

400
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,790
It's you who have a bad reputation.

401
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,740
Your sponsors worried they would be at risk

402
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:19,590
so they came to me.

403
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,380
What did I do?

404
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:22,580
What did you do?

405
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,190
If it weren't for you defaming me,

406
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,630
would I have a bad reputation?

407
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,470
You play innocent now?

408
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,110
I'm not blind.

409
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:36,540
You're not blind

410
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,030
but a blockhead.

411
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,620
How dare you!

412
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,310
Stop!

413
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,670
What're you doing?

414
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,340
Go ahead.

415
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,910
I told you before,

416
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,910
behave yourself in the company.

417
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,310
No one will baby you.

418
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,110
So when he steals my endorsement
with dirty tricks,

419
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,340
you baby him?

420
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,430
You have so many endorsements.

421
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,980
It won't hurt if you give him one.

422
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,550
Nonsense.

423
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,870
Why should I give it to him?

424
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,430
Even if I gave it to someone,

425
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:06,950
it wouldn't be him!

426
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,310
You better watch your attitude.

427
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:10,270
Do you believe

428
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,390
I can take away all your endorsements?

429
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,260
I worked so hard to get those.

430
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,220
If you give them away

431
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,470
with a word,

432
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,470
I quit. I'd rather have none of them.

433
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:24,910
Stop!

434
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:26,470
Do you hear me?

435
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,430
I look down upon those

436
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,790
who do little tricks behind.

437
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,510
How shameless.

438
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,190
Battle with me, face to face, if he dare.

439
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,350
Play dirty.

440
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,790
It makes me nauseous.

441
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,630
You're right definitely.

442
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,340
But not everyone can do that.

443
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:53,220
Well,

444
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,950
everyone is complicated.

445
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:55,860
So we all

446
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:56,980
behave in a different way.

447
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,300
You can't

448
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,230
ask everyone

449
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,110
to treat you the same

450
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,070
by your own standards,

451
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,870
especially those sophisticated people

452
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,070
like Zhou Yao.

453
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,420
As you can't do that,

454
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,420
how about staying away from them?

455
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,740
Listen to Baoling more.

456
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,270
Are you my friend?

457
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,860
Let's slow down here.

458
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:19,670
Let me go.

459
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,870
You don't help me and even

460
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,820
piss me off.

461
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,270
How could you?

462
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,350
Did I owe you two something

463
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,390
in my last life?

464
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:32,830
I should let you guys drink together
and make each other crazy.

465
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:33,940
How great it would be.

466
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,510
Why do I have to be the one

467
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,630
who suffers from this?

468
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,190
Where are you going?

469
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,990
Drink with me.

470
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,320
[Dai Baoling]

471
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:29,620
Hello?

472
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,750
Where are you?

473
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,750
Get your ass back!

474
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,660
Baoling, I'm home.

475
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,110
Wait a moment.

476
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,270
I'm getting up.

477
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,380
Liar!

478
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,550
I'm ringing the doorbell

479
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,520
at your house.

480
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,070
I heard no sound on the phone.

481
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,140
Lian Ruoshen,

482
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,550
what on earth are you doing?

483
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,750
Where are you?

484
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:58,390
Baoling,

485
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,390
I have to tell you.

486
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,190
Someone might have tricked me to sleep with them.

487
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,260
I'm panicking.

488
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:07,870
Send me your location.

489
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,660
I'll be there in a moment.

490
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:12,430
Shut up. Can you be quiet in the morning?

491
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,020
Lian Ruoshen, shame on you!

492
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,390
You were really…

493
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,590
Send me your location.

494
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,740
I'll come find you.

495
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,060
Baoling.

496
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,310
I can explain it.

497
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,500
It's not like that.

498
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:28,900
Where are you going?

499
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,910
Dude, I'm sorry.

500
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:35,910
I might have gotten the wrong room.

501
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,500
What are you talking about?

502
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,750
You asked me to check in.

503
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,750
How could you get the wrong room?

504
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,540
Lian Ruoshen, I'm gonna kill you!

505
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:44,910
Baoling.

506
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:45,940
You got it wrong.

507
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:46,790
It's our own people,

508
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,190
it's Lu Bie.

509
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,750
You explain to her.

510
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:50,830
Explain what?

511
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,550
How you tortured me last night?

512
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,190
Disgusting.

513
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,710
Don't speak so ambiguously.

514
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,750
Come on, explain to her.

515
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,350
Stop it.

516
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,110
Boss's gonna have you set aside.

517
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,190
You're in the mood for fun?

518
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,660
Come back right now.

519
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,270
Who is it at this time?

520
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:21,700
The police station.

521
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:24,780
Hello?

522
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,100
Hello, may I speak to Cheng Feng?

[Xingfu Street Police Station]

524
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,150
I feel quite disappointed

525
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,070
not seeing anger on your face.

526
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,220
I'm very frustrated.

527
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,710
After all of these,

528
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,430
I didn't send you to hell

529
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,310
but got myself like this.

530
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:47,460
Is there

531
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,180
any justice?

532
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,500
Don't just blame others.

533
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,870
Nobody owes you anything.

534
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,630
You can only blame your nasty mind.

535
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:02,910
Say it.

536
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,470
Who directed you?

537
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,590
I'll be always

538
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,390
watching you.

539
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:28,990
Baoling.

540
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,390
Go ahead.

541
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,070
I would feel better.

542
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,500
It won't solve the problem.

543
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:39,820
Fine. I won't beat you.

544
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,020
Anyway, you saw

545
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:42,750
Boss's attitude just now.

546
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,750
Cut to the chase.

547
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,350
It depends on how you behave in the future.

548
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,270
As your agent,

549
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:49,870
what I can do is to get more resources for you.

550
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,820
But it all depends on yourself.

551
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,260
Baoling.

552
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,710
I won't do that again.

553
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,260
I know you're talented.

554
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,310
But

555
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,670
can you try to

556
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,460
control your temper a bit?

557
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,030
Do you want Zhou Yao

558
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,150
to overtake you?

559
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:14,350
I promise,

560
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:15,350
I'll

561
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:16,870
control my temper

562
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,540
and never cause trouble.

563
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,070
If I break my promise,

564
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,430
I'll force myself to be a monk as punishment.

565
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,220
You will be a monk?

566
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,790
Look what you and Lu Bie did yesterday.

567
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,590
There's a misunderstanding. I was drunk

568
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:36,430
yesterday.

569
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,140
And I threw up on myself.

570
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,550
He was tired

571
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,070
so we…

572
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,350
We found a hotel

573
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,470
for the night.

574
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,940
Nothing happened.

575
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,260
It sounds like

576
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,460
you regret that?

577
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,540
No, no, no. How dare I?

578
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,630
Come on.

579
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,300
Let's go, Baoling.

580
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:54,980
-Let's have a drink.
-Knock it off.

581
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,180
I don't want you to throw up on me.

Have you finished your experiment?

597
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,420
Almost. I’ll finish it soon.

598

00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:29,590
He's standing there

610
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,590
for hours.

611
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:32,940
He's my student.

Why don't you go there?

614
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,750
Does he want to talk to you?

615
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,100
He doesn't come,

616
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:39,860
which means he's not in a hurry.

617
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,150
Never mind.

618
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,580
You captured my chariot?

619
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:58,700
Cheng,

620
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,100
where's Jiang Dian?

621
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,420
Is everything okay with him?

622
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:06,670
What do you mean?

623
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:07,910
During my breakfast,

624
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,190
I heard from a Physics professor

625
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,750
that he hadn't attended classes for days.

626
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,389
So I came to see him

627
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,100
in my free time.

628
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,739
He's upstairs.

629
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:18,110
Could you please

630
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,060
explain to that professor?

631
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,949
Dian's not feeling well

632
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,429
so I want him to rest for a few days.

633
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,540
Maybe he's too tired

634
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,739
so he forgot to ask for leave.

635
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,420
OK.

636
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:29,179
I'll give him your message.

637
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,230
If that's all there is,

638
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,190
I gotta go.

639
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:40,909
Well,

640
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,219
how's Lian?

641
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:47,860
He’s doing well according to Baoling.

642
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:48,860
Don't worry.

643
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,750
So I'm gonna go.

644
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,310
Dian,

645
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,580
what happened to you?

646
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,460
I'm finished.

647
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,300
Dian.

648
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:26,670
What's up?

649
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,340
Well,

650
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,990
I just wanna remind you not to overwork.

651
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,470
Mom,

652
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,550
look at that girl.

653
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,390
She's crying at that boy.

654
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:25,950
Stop looking around.

655
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,070
Papa is waiting for us.

656
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,190
[CLOSED]

657
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,790
Haven't you finished working yet?

658
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,260
Dian.

659
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:58,900
I bought some dessert.

660
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,310
Can we eat together?

661
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:17,940
Why do you wanna eat dessert

662
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,700
at this time?

663
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,070
Because it'll

664
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,710
make people happy.

665
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:26,940
What's going on?

666
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:30,750
Dian,

667
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,390
I know it.

668
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,190
You didn't attend school.

669
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,270
What's the problem

670
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,700
with your physics experiment?

671
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,020
Can you talk with me?

672
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,270
I don't wanna talk about it today.

673
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,100
I beg you.

674
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:49,990
Dian.

675
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,870
I'm not pushing you.

676
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,670
I just wanna tell you,

677
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,020
No matter what happens,

678
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,420
I'll be with you.

679
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,350
Something came up. I'm gonna go out.

680
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:26,380
Remember to have breakfast.

681
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,140
I'll be right back.

682
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,740
Are you going to see Zhou Yao again?

683
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:48,510
One, two, three, four.

684
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,550
Practice it yourself.

685
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,270
Cheng,

686
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,470
what do you think

687
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,550
of this move…

688
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,440
[I'm sick.]

689
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:19,750
Today's choreography

690
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,230
isn't finished yet.

691
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,510
If I remember correctly,

692
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,630
it's my day off today.

693
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,070
But my album release isn't far off,

694
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,350
-so…
-Today you can

695
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:29,590
practice it yourself.

696
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:30,700
As for those difficult parts, watch videos.

697
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,470
Cheng.

698
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:32,700
Hands off.

699
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,740
Why are you suddenly having a fever?

700
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,350
You're back.

701
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,580
Get up. I'll get you to the hospital.

702
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:07,670
No.

703
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,540
You're my medicine.

704
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,270
Cut it out. I'm serious.

705
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,420
I'll give you some medicine.

706
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,060
Will you leave later?

707
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,670
If you take medicine, I won't go.

708
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:18,670
You promise.

709
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,220
[Zhou Yao]

710
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,430
Are you feeling better

711
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:36,780
after a shower?

712
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:37,710
Yes.

713
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,470
I asked Xuedong to cook some porridge for you.

714
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:41,980
You have to bundle up.

715
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:42,940
OK.

716
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,980
[Zhou Yao]

717
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,190
[Delete]

718
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:20,760
[Delete]

719
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:32,700
What are you doing?

720
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:34,750
Your phone fell.

721
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:35,950
I picked it up for you.

722
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,910
The porridge should be ready.
Let's go downstairs.

723
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:46,070
What's wrong?

724
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,470
Why did you take a cold shower?

725
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:51,620
Don't you have a fever?

726
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:56,460
Why did you hurt yourself?

727
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:00,180
I can explain.

728
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:03,180
I felt too hot so I took a cold shower.

729
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:05,070
It's true.

730
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,340
The most important is

731
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,540
to keep his condition stable.

732
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:12,670
Because of his strong self-control,

733
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,350
the more intense his inner conflict is,

734
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:15,790
the worse his illness will be.

735
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:17,310
We have to try to

736
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:19,460
avoid the transition

737
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,180
from unconscious to intentional.

738
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:23,500
Cheng.

739
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:25,870
Dian.

740
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:26,900
If you miss me,

741
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,430
you can call me back.

742
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:31,190
But, don't hurt yourself. OK?

743
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,350
Are you still mad at me?

744
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:36,110
I'm not.

745
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,110
But it doesn't mean I don't care about you.

746
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:38,630
I wanna tell you,

747
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:40,510
you can tell me what you think directly,

748
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,070
rather than hurt yourself.

749
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:43,470
Moreover,

750
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:45,790
don't hide it from me, alright?

751
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:53,710
Cheng.

752
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,420
Cheng, you have a guest.

753
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:14,510
I'm not disturbing you, am I?

754
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:16,300
What are you doing here?

755
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,420
I texted you that

756
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:20,230
I would come to practice with you.

757
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:22,110
Haven't you read it?

758
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,020
Or

759
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,790
someone deleted it?
