[The Second Welfare House of Linxi City]

6
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,870
Recently the children in the welfare house

7
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,970
had an origami lesson.

8
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,300
They made a lot of stars and paper cranes.

9
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,970
These are the gifts for you.

10
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,600
Thank you! You’ve been

11
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:52,570
taking care of them for so many years.

12
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,070
Tell the children that I want to thank them.

13
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,100
Please tell them I will

14
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,850
bring more nice things to them
when I come next time.

15
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,790
Chengcheng, you’ve really changed a lot.

16
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,870
Although you are still a cold person,

17
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,490
the feeling you give people
is much better than before.

18
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,310
I remember the first time

19
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,280
I saw you.

20
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,360
The way you behave

21
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,650
was like a Queen’s.

22
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,980
It seemed that the words “No stranger”

23
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,210
had been printed on your forehead.

24
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,150
Later on,

25
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,480
I became your dancing partner.

26
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,550
I found that it was not very difficult
to get along with you.

27
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,970
Chengcheng, you really

28
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,470
don’t want to perform on the stage again?

29
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:39,870
I don’t have such a plan now.

30
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,730
Dear children,

31
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,470
please come here!

32
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,770
They should be people from the Linxi University.

33
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,180
Will you go to take a look?

34
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,360
OK. I’ll take a look.

35
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,690
Ladies and fellow villagers,

36
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,120
are you ready? Let’s get started.

37
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,720
♫ Ba Ba Ba! ♫

♫ Do you add spice? Do you add pepper? ♫

39
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,360
♫ Do you add spice? Do you add pepper? ♫

40
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,170
♫ I don’t add pepper. ♫

41

♫ Ba Ba Ba! ♫

42
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,240
Little boy, don’t cry!

43
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,690
I’ll buy you a new one, OK?

44
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:28,840
I don’t believe you!

45
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,740
What’s wrong with you, Lian Ruoshen?

46
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,970
You are bullying a kid!

47
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,600
Do you know why we can come to
the welfare house?

48
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,450
Because Jiang Dian has pleaded
with the old professor.

49
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,510
If you blow it,

50
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,690
I’ll punish you!

51
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,510
Put it on!

52
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,050
What’s wrong? Put it on!

53
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,480
Slowly. Slowly. Slowly.

54
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,880

Are you well-behaved?

68
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,040

Dian!

79
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,400
do you have a crush on that lady?

80
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,420
Do you need me to help you?

81
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,910
Dian, why did you hit me?

82
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,000
Miss Goddess,

83
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,810
Yun asked me to

84
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,130
go to the warehouse together with you.

85
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,400
We have to find some small light bulbs.

86
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,460
OK.

87
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,280
Miss,

88
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,040
I suddenly have a stomachache.

89
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,490
I need to go to the bathroom.

90
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:34,460
Can you go there first?

91
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:35,640
OK.

92
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,710
Do you think it’s true?

93
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,070
No.

94
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,210
What’s about you?

95
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:43,610
Yes.

96
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,000
Dian!

97
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,070
Dian,

98
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,360
I have loose bowels.

99
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,720
Can you go to the warehouse

100
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,480
and take out the small light bulbs
instead of me? Over there.

101
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:56,940
Look after the kids.

102
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,820
Thank you, Dian!

It’s you?

106
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:45,820
Who do you think I am?

107
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,770
Is anybody there?

108
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,320
Let me do it.

109
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,550
Is anybody there?

110
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,270
Is anybody there?

111
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,970
We are locked inside.

112
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,420
Please help us open the door!

113
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:11,830
Open the door!

114
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,720
Can anyone open the door for us?

115
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,000
Is anybody there? Open the door!

116

Cheng Feng! Cheng Feng! Cheng Feng!
What’s the matter with you?

117
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,450
Did you...

118
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,680
Did you hear

119
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,440
a beeping sound?

120
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,100
Look at me, Cheng Feng!

121
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,120
Listen to me. There is no sound at all.

122
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,360
I’ll find someone.

123
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,280
Don’t go!

124
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,550
Don’t go! Don’t leave me!

125
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,190
Don’t worry!

126
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:47,730
I’m always here.

127
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,150
Are you feeling better?

128
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,420
Dian, awesome!

129
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,310
You two are hugging!

130
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:07,970
I was trying...

131
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,030
Jiang Dian,

132
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,540
Chengcheng suffers from claustrophobia.

133
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,420
How can you do this to her?

134
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:16,900
And you!

135
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,000
I’ll talk to you later!

136
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:21,960
Dian,

137
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,750
I...

138
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,980
I...

139
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,370
Will you leave yourself

140
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,730
or shall I call the police?

141
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,549
I’m sorry. What happened in the warehouse just now

142
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,740
was not what you thought it to be.

143
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,970
I can explain it to you.

144
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,250
I thought

145
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,010
you were just a spoiled child.

146
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,340
Now I know that I’ve underestimated you.

147
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,360
Please believe me.

148
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:53,860
I can explain it!

149
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,460
I don’t care about what reason you have.

150
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,730
Please stay away from me!

151
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,400
I’m afraid of troubles.

152
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,780
And I don’t want to get into trouble!

153
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:02,840
But I want.

154
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,450
I like you.

155
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,730
Like? How do you like me?

156
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,430
Do you like

157
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,900
my face?

158
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,440
Do you like my stature?

159
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:21,980
Or do you want to sleep with me?

160
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,670
We’ve just seen each other several times.

161
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,900
Do you know about me?

162
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,870
But you said you liked me.

163
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,330
You had a sudden feeling,
but you thought we were true love.

164
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,050
Don’t you think you are being ridiculous?

165
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,270
I don’t have the time and I’m not
interested in flirting with you.

166
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,030
I have no feeling

167
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,520
for a younger man.

168
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,860
Since you are Yun’s student,

169
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,140
I’ll draw a line here.

170
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,410

00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,720
There are all kinds of species in this world.

341
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,650
You are a rare weirdo.

342
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,710
Your idea

343
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,810
rocked my world!

344
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,260
Bro, you are really talented.

345
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,850
I feel sorry

346
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,120
for your future girlfriend.

347
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:53,730
Hey!

348
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,190
A few days ago, I saw a sneaky man

349
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,950
at the door of the cafe.

350
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,560
How does he look?

351
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,210
I thought

352
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,450
he just adored the lady.

353
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,030
So I didn’t pay much attention to him.

354
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,580
You don’t want to be beaten,

355
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,640
so you made it up?

356
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:13,930
If I had lied about anything,

357
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,200
you would be my father.

358
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,960
I don’t have such a weird son like you.

359
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,990
You want to acknowledge it?

360
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,140
Stop it, Lian Ruoshen!

361
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:23,960
Let go of me!

362
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,530
I won’t!

363
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:33,420
Thank you!

364
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,450
I should not accept the money. I feel shameful.

365
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,920
Miss Goddess, what happened in the warehouse

366
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,250
was Lu Biebie’s idea.

367
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,880
It had nothing to do with Dian.

368
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,730
Please don’t get angry with Dian.

369
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,590
You know how to blame others.

370
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,640
Usually you don’t remember

371
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,480
what I said to you.

372
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,710
But you remember

373
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,850
my casual words clearly this time.

374
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,550

375
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,520
as your cousin,

376
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:57,790
I see you

377
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,720
as my real sister.

378
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,990
Cheng, I’ll take it.

379
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,850
Lu Biebie, you are so shameless!

380
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,430
Stop!

381
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,160
Take it!

382
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,390
I don’t want to owe anyone a favor.

383
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,570
I’m sorry. I don’t want cash.

384
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,110
It seems it’s not the collection code.

385
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:22,830
It’s the code for adding a new friend.

386
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,020
I want a red envelop from you.

387
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,220
You can only accept

388
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:27,580
what I give you.

389
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,350
I have the right to refuse you.

390
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,430
You look awful.

391
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,030
Is it caused by claustrophobia?

392
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,720
It’s none of your business.

I can’t go on the night shift.

I’m sorry about it.

We are from the Happiness Street Police Station.

00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,470
I’m sorry for calling you at this hour.

401
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,450
We’ve found

402
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,510
a girl.

403
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,560
She told us that

404
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,660
her boyfriend was cheating on her.

405
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,510
She has found your photos and videos

406
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,230
in her boyfriend’s phone.

407
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,640
She thought you were his secret lover.

408
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,880
She did it in order to show her anger.

409
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,160
We have

410
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,780
criticized and educated her.

411
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,420
OK. Thank you very much!

help me! I don’t know him!

If you don’t let go of me, I’ll call the police!

421
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,450
Why are you here?

422
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,170
I want to protect you.

423
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,850
It’s you want to do it, but it doesn’t
mean that I need it.

424
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,360
A man is protecting her.

00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,080
Yeah.

My bestie was detained because of her.

430

Don’t persuade me.

Were you a thief last night?

You slept through the entire morning.

to send it to my father.

445

Are you sure

446
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,020
when your father sees your score,

447
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,700
he will maintain a good relationship with you?

My dear father said that

as long as my score was higher than
the previous time,

450

he would double the pocket money
he would give me.

This is the score I got this time.

457
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,820
It’s twice the score I got last time.

about men’s appearance, either.

look so much alike.

to pick them out.

Although they look similar,

481
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,340

482
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,190
two eyes and one mouth.

00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,050
OK, Baoling!

511
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,500
What happened just now?

512
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,030
I have to say

513
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,100
that you two are matching each other.

514
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,350
Why are you staring at me?

515
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:27,850
Did I say something wrong?

516
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,400
You are both good-looking
and your characters are similar.

517
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,720
Neither of you can be trifled with.

518
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,280
A wild wolf and a wild cat are
a perfect match.

519
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:38,230
Your life might be turbulent

520
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,200
in the future.

521
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,720
You are talking too much today.

522
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,540
I’m joking with you. Don’t take it seriously.

523
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,340
A younger man is a younger man.

524
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,880
They are not suitable for us because of our age.

525
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,300
It’s very tiring to be with a younger man.

526
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,850
Chengcheng! Chengcheng!

527
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,830
Yesterday Lian Ruoshen told me that

528
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,020
someone had written

529
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:57,990
some offensive words

530
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,040
on the windows of the cafe.

531
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,980
Why didn’t you tell me?

532
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,840
You are in the mood to have a hotpot!

533
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,740
What are you talking about?
What happened?

534
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,910
Nothing. The issue has been solved.

535
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,710
Who did this to you?

536
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,470
You don’t go out very often.

537
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,570
Who can you offend?

538
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,640
A young girl.

539
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,750
She misunderstood that I was
in a relationship with her boyfriend.

540
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,610
What a big joke!

541
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,780
Which girl? Do you have an impression on her?

542
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,410
No.

543
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,550
I think I need to

544
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,480
tell you something,

545
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,290
though you don’t want to know

546
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,560
any news about him at all.

547
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,820
Someone interviewed Zhou Yao yesterday.

548
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,890
He talked about your love affair

549
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,070
and behaved as if he was deeply in love.

550
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,050
When his fans saw the interview online,

551
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,860
they responded actively.

552
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,620
Can it be related to the incident?

553
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,570
Previously nothing happened to you.

554
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,020
Once he talked about you,

555
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:52,720
something happened to you.

556
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,310
Which interview was it?

557
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,330
There is no right or wrong about love.

558
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:04,780
A person suddenly appears

559
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,520
in your life.

560
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:14,020
He or she will lower other people’s importance.

561
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,310
You are willing to give everything to her.

562
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,390
But in the end, you two can’t keep

563
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,230
the relationship.

564
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,680
No one has made any mistake.

565
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,490
We are just immature.

566
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,840
Sometimes I was thinking

567
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,040
if I had tried harder

568
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,490
to keep our relationship,

569
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,950
would our story end differently?

570
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,350
But it’s a pity that there is no “if”.

571
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,580
Mr. Zhou

572
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,380
is a man who can love so deeply.

573
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,450
The woman whom you can’t forget

574
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,370
is such a happy woman.

575
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,820
If she can see

576
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,720
you still love her so deeply,

577
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,140
will she regret it?

578
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:02,810
What are you watching?

579
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,260
Zhou Yao.

580
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,510
His expression obviously shows that

581
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,870
he is still thinking about my sister.

582
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,460
As to my sister,

583
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,949
she is cold to other people.

584
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,230
She has not been in a relationship
for several years.

585
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:14,429
It’s obvious that she can’t forget him.

586
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,010
I don’t understand

587
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,820
why the two

588
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,960
have broken up.

589
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,530
My sister’s ex-boyfriend, Zhou Yao.

590
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,630
A super star.

591
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,960
Haven’t I told you about him?

592
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:34,840
Maybe there is too much I need to tell you.

593
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,520
I need to give you some time

594
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:37,570
to be psychologically prepared.

595
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,520
Now it’s the right time.

596
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,409
Dian,

597
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,520
although I admire you very much,

598
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,050
your...

599
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,159
Go on!

600
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,380
your psychological burden

601
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,480
should not be too high.

602
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,290
You can see

603
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,080
his age and his background.

604
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,179
Compared with him, you are...

605
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,840
Bro, give me your beer, please.

606
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,510
I’m a bit thirsty.

607
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,850
I believe you and I

608
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:12,950
are all very curious

609
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,000
about the woman

610
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:14,800
whom Mr. Zhou can’t forget.

611
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,260
I don’t know whether it’s convenient for you

612
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,050
to reveal her identity.

613
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,800
Does she

614
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,180
work in entertainment sector or not?

615
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:25,970
She is a person who loves to be quiet.

616
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:28,740
I don’t want to

617
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,550
bring her any trouble.

618
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,500
I hope the media

619
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,680
can leave her alone.

620
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,050
Therefore,

621
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,190
let’s go on

622
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,030
talking about my new song.

623
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,460
We have to say that

624
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,790
Mr. Zhou’s new song is still a hit.

625
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,020
The choreography

626
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,250
has always been wonderful.

627
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,850
We still have a deep impression

628
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,570
on the choreography of your debut.

629
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:55,230
He was mouthing high-sounding words.

630
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,690
Does he want to restore
his relationship with Chengcheng?

631
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,650
Even if he wants to, it is impossible.

632
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,410
Although I don’t know

633
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,290
what happened on earth

634
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,530
between them,

635
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,590
I know how Chengcheng conducts herself.

636
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:08,740
Their breaking-up must be his mistake.

637
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,160
Now he wants her back.

638
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,610
He can only get her back in a dream!

639
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,730
Zhou Yao has chosen this time

640
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,540
to express his deep love.

641
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:18,730
He must have a purpose.

642
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,590
Maybe his words have encouraged

643
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,470
a fangirl to cause a disturbance

644
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,830
in the cafe.

645
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,090
Oh my Gosh! This is horrible!

646
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,120
In this way, Jiang Dian is better.

647
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,130
At least, he is very simple.

648
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:36,410
Come on! Drink some beer!

649
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,910
You don’t have a glass of beer?

650
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,100
Here you are. Drink mine.

651
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,080
Come on!

652
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,250
Brother-in-law, you are my brother-in-law.

653
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:49,790
I will tell you

654
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,150
everything

655
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,170
I know.

656
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:52,870
Go on.

657
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,030
Tell me all

658
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,730
you know,

659
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,090
please!

660
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,610
I have to say that

661
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:01,890
at that time

662
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,740
Zhou Yao was shining among the people.

663
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:06,330
He was handsome and he studied very well.

664
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,800
He was a very nice guy and had
the virtue of patience.

665
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,160
In simple words,

666
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:11,090
you can say

667
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,230
he was a hero in a Korean TV drama.

668
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,530
All the girls were crazy about him.

669
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,590
My sister

670
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,570
was also mad about him.

671
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,470
She wrote some love letters to him.

672
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,720
Dian has also received a lot of love letters.

673
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,040
Go on.

674
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,840
My memory is so poor!

675
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:31,850
No. My sister

676
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,090
didn’t wrote love letters to him.

677
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:35,990
Zhou Yao wrote some love letters to my sister.

678
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,410
Later on, my sister joined the dance regiment

679
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:39,460
and she went abroad.

680
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,270
Zhou Yao got enrolled in

681
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,540
the music school she was in.

682
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,270
He was courting my sister fervently.

683
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,120
At that time, it caught a lot of people’s attention.

684
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,580
My sister didn’t give much response to him.

685
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,160
Later on, they became lovers.

686
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,930
My sister was quite famous at that time.

687
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,180
She did performances in various places abroad.

688
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,140
She gradually had a lot of resources.

689
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,520
Zhou Yao began to work on his music.

690
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:04,150
I’ll omit ten thousand words here.

691
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,040
Later on,

692
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:06,960
for some inexplicable reason

693
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:07,980
the two broke up.

694
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,090
I don’t know the exact reason.

695
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,380
My sister quit the dancing circle.

696
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,830
She never danced again on the stage afterwards.

697
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:15,900
Dian,

698
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,350
these are all I know.

699
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,760
Are you satisfied?

700
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,700
After she broke up with him,
she quit the dancing circle.

701
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:26,540
Such a heavy blow?

702
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:29,890
Dian,

703
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,580
it will be difficult for you

704
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,170
to warm up her heart.

705
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,480
As I understand the love between
a man and a woman,

706
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:41,810
it’s absolutely impossible for them
to restore their relationship.

707
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:45,070
Dian, you have a chance.

708
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,220
Come on! I think highly of you.

709
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:54,700
My stomach is hurting so much!

710
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,360
Lian Ruoshen, go to the bathroom
together with me.

711
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,600
You are so womanish.

712
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:01,570
You need a company to go to the bathroom.

713
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:02,580
Go there yourself!

714
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:03,860
I want to be with Dian!

715
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,800
After a man suffers a blow,

716
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,900
he doesn’t want

717
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,440
other people to see his weak side.

718
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,710
We have to give him some time

719
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,810
to adjust himself.

720
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,800
What is love supposed to be?

721
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,390
Everything has its vanquisher.

722
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,070
Dian!

723
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,160
Step aside!

724
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,400
I will leave after asking you a question.

725
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,730
Last time, you said

726
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,860
you had no feeling for a younger man.
Is it true?

727
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:43,500
I think I made it

728
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,550
very clear last time.

729
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,280
I have no feeling for a younger man.

730
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,040
Have you heard it clearly?

731
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:49,790
You are lying.

732
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,460
Now that you have no feeling for younger men,

733
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,960
why were you talking happily
with those three men?

734
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,160
Is there any problem with it?

735
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,190
I have no feeling for you who is younger.

736
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,440
But it doesn’t mean that I have
no feeling for other younger men.

737
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:07,480
What’s the matter? Is it a blow?

738
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:11,260
Do you feel very uncomfortable here?

739
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,110
This is the way I am.

740
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,500
Therefore, stop bothering me!

741
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,060
Is it because

742
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,110
you still can’t forget Zhou Yao?
