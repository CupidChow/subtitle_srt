Yes.

You surprised me.

77

It’s so difficult

00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,390

you did much more

83
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,570
than what Cheng and I imagined.

84

You love her indeed.

85

But everyone has his own secrets.

00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,050
Thank you.

524
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,639
I used to hate the sun

525
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:13,219
which is glaring.

526
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,730
But now I wanna be the sun,

528
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,199
So you’re upset

529
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,130
you didn’t see whom you wanna see.

530
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,210
Just kidding.

532
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:37,900
I switched shifts with him.

533
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,650
It took me some time

534
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:40,850
to persuade him to have a rest.

535
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,010
I have never seen such a stubborn person.

536
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,250
Have some soup.

537
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,280
I have no appetite.

538
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:49,960
What a pity.

539
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,469
It was cooked

540
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:54,449
by Jiang Dian.

541
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:56,250
If you don’t eat, I’ll.

542

Cheng.

543
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,100
So you’re in a relationship?

544
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,720
What are you afraid of?

545
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:17,460
Maybe he’s your remedy.

546
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,400
Look at me,

547
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,470
can he stay with me?

548
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,890
It doesn’t matter.

549
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,740
You can be healed.

550
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,230
It’s just

551
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,290
a mental problem.

552
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,180
Besides, Jiang Dian

553
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,020
doesn’t care about that.

554
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,250
And he wants to

555
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,020
tie himself to you,

556
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,300
to be with you.

557
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,680
Cheng,

558
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,360
you’ve let him down

559

many times.

560
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:47,820
However fiery his soul is,

561
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,360
he can’t stand constant rain.

562
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,520
So

563
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,720
think twice.

564
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,610
Do you wanna stand still

565
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,030
or move on?

566
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:13,120

What’s your problem?

00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,740
Well,

584
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,710
I wanna know

585
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,750
how to treat a patient

586
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,330
who resists something in her mind

587
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,310
so much she would faint.

588
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,730
I have to know her symptoms and triggers

to attack her problem.

590
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,350
The story goes that one of my friends

591
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,240
learned dancing abroad

592
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,430
and then…

593
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,240
That’s all.

594
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,930
So how can I help her?

595
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,180
What you said

596
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,500
reminds me of

597
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,200
one of my patients.

598
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,580
But as for her treatment,

599
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,720
you’d better

600
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:30,600
bring your friend here

601
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,110
so that I can deliver accurate judgement.

602
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,310
Just from what you said,

603
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:36,850
she’s

604
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,040
in serious condition.

605
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,390
Even though there are many treatment plans,

606
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:43,850
I have to

607
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:45,520

and willingness.

612
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,350
Whatever plan we adopt,

613
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,150
her mood is the key.

614
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,000
We can’t give her too much pressure.

615
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,610
What pressure?

616
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:02,240
Both inside

617
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,210
and outside pressure

618
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,890
are bad for her.

619
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,640
What’s pressure?

620
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,930
Without pressure, we have no motivation

621

Without motivation,

622
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,570
how can we move forward?

623

If we can’t,

624
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,880
we won’t find our way to triumph.

625

[Awesome owner of book café,

700
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:55,250
You two thought

701
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,610
you were the trending topic.

702
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,500
It turns out it was my sister.

703
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:00,830
Someone

704
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,680
may be disappointed.

705
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,450
I’ll be always trending topics.

706
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,240
Wait and see.

707
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,360
Always trending topics?

708
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:09,720
Are you still thinking about

709
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,860
what Baoling said?

710
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,600
I tell you…

711
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:15,400
Well,

712
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:16,410
let me borrow it for a second.

713
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,080
I’m gonna show it to Ms. Cheng.

714
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,620
As she made contributions,

715
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,720
we can’t take it

716
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,820
for our own, right? Bye.

717
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:22,960
Wait a second.

718
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:24,900
Ms. Yun, goodbye.

719
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,620
You have classes this afternoon.

720
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:50,150
♫ I wanna know why you feel lonely ♫

721
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:54,170
♫ I wanna stay with you ♫

722
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,280
Both inside

723
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,160
and outside pressure

724
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,840
are bad for her.

725
00:41:55,150 --> 00:42:00,360
♫ I wanna tell you not to fear darkness since I’m here ♫

726
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:59,180
In the end,

727
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,640
your pressure

728
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:02,870
comes from me.

729
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:06,700
♫ I want to keep you warm ♫

730
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:10,220
♫ Pray that you will keep it ♫

731
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:17,130
♫ It’s okay. I will rest assured if you are happy ♫

732
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,280
♫ How satisfactory can love be ♫

733
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,880
♫ It’s the dearest company ♫

734
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,290
♫ I’ve been used to it ♫

735
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:34,150
♫ Even my tears are brave ♫

736
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:38,050
♫ The moments of our memory ♫

737
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:42,900
♫ The answer you are looking for in every minute ♫

738
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:49,860
♫ I really want to shoulder everything for you ♫

739
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:50,700
I do believe

740
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,980
♫ How satisfactory can love be ♫

741
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,800
you were moved even if just for a second.

742
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,870
We played basketball and rode bicycles.

743
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:58,100
♫ It’s the dearest company ♫

744
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,360
Your eyes told me the truth.

745
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,040
Though I don’t know

746
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:57,740
what happened to you before,

747
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:01,340
♫ I’ve been used to it ♫

748
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,410
but I know

749
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,910
you’re a good girl.

750
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:06,210
♫ Even my tears are brave ♫

751
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:03,640
You deserve love.

752
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,670
Cheng Feng.

753
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,120
♫ The moments of our memory ♫

754
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:09,620
I won’t give up.

755
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:15,080
♫ The answer you are looking for in every minute ♫

756
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:13,360
Although my heart is beating

757
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:16,840
but it’s empty.

758
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:22,240
♫ I really want to shoulder everything for you ♫

759
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:17,890
It’s OK.

760
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,500
I can fill it with my heart.

761
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,160
♫ I laugh and cry because of you ♫

762
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:31,090
♫ I spent all the best time with you ♫

763
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:38,330
♫ Staying with you is my best habit ♫

764
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:32,810
Jiang Dian.

765
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,050
I wanna see you.
