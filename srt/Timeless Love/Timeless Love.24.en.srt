- We’re finally going to meet. - Do you want to meet me?

173
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,970
The day finally came, Cheng.

174
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,280
I miss you so much.

175
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,660
Dian,

176
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,990
I also miss you.

177
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,930
Yun is getting married.

178
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,210
Have you heard that?

179

Do you still remember

180
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,710
the promise you made

181
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,200
in Hwaseong?

182
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,930
In the future, I’ll exchange my wedding ring

183

Two days ago,

191

something happened to my research lab,

192
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,820
and my phone powered off at that time.

193
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,410
So, I didn’t reply to you in time.

194
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,690
The physical experiment can’t be an excuse.

195
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,500
Your phone can’t be an excuse, either.

196

I remember

197
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,900

Cheng,

199
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,070
I’m sorry.

200
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,040
It won’t happen again.

201
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,890
Again? I don’t wanna meet you again.

202
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,470
By the way,

203
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,230
you flirted with other women

204
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,120
in front of me.

205
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:12,870
Are you jealous?

206
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,210
Yes. It’s obvious.

207

Excuse me. I’m sorry to bother you.

208

your second speech is going to start.

210
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,370
- I’ll be right there. - OK.

211
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,570
I owe you. I’ll make up for it next time.

212
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,590
I don’t care.

Chengcheng, what do you think of them?

215
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,840
Chengcheng, what’s wrong?

216
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,410
A person can be

217
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,130
completely different within three years.

218
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,630
What happened?

219
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,210
Why did you say that?

220
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,600
Dian changed.

221
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,650
He’s not cute anymore.

222
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,870
It’s no big deal.

223

as long as your love remains the same.

225
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,450
By the way, you also changed.

226
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,130
You became more jealous

227
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,400
and cuter.

228
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,380
You’re totally different with

229

233
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,150
Great.

234
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,830
You’ll also be married soon.

235
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,730
The man who’s waiting for you

236
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,310
has come back.

237
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,010
So what?

238
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,590
He doesn’t have time to see me

239
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,050
and he even flirted with other women.

240

You told me that

244
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,150
you haven’t found the best man.

245

I’m not the bride.

Why should I get dressed?

Well. Did you invite Baoling?

Nothing matters, right?

00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,810
It’s lucky to meet you.

511
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,730
It’s lucky to meet you

512
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,620
at the best time of my life.

513
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,969
It’s lucky to be loved by you.

514
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,770
It’s lucky to fall in love with you.

515
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:37,370
It’s lucky to be together

516
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,510
with you during these years.

517
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,219
I’d like to ask you a question.

518
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,429
In the future,

519
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:47,750
would you like to

520
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,980
grow older with me?

521
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,540
Dian,

522
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,920
our love is equal.

523
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:07,860
So,

524
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,230
you don’t have to get down on one knee.

525
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,070
You said it’s lucky to meet me.

526
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,580
Actually, I want to say

527
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,280
I’m more grateful

528
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:25,100
to meet you.

529
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,260
You changed my life.

530
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,030
Thank you for loving me

531
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,380
and letting me know that

532
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,900
love can be pure

533
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,920
without betrayals.

534
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,310
Thank you for

535
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,210
becoming a better man for me.

536
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,200
Dian,

537
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:50,800
I love you.
