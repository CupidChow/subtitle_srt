Pang Ting. She came to me a few days ago.

Recently she has some problems.

126

00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,200
Think. If our boss knows,

133
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,440
he’ll…

134
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,480
What will he do?

135
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,040
You betrayed me.

136
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,680
Even if I have to die, I won’t die alone.

137

138
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,280
Give me the phone!

139
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,960
I can give it to you.

140
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,120
I still have a lot of copies.

141
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,560
Zhou Yao, you say I’m devious.

142
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,110
What about you?

143
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,200
In order to achieve your goal,

144
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,440
you did many devious things.

145
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,000
You wanted to be the endorser for HA

146
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,400
and you know Rich

147
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,560
likes affectionate people

148
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,370
so you pretended to be affectionate.

149
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,360
Your fans scolded Cheng Feng online.

150
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,160
Later you

151
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,680
pretended to be nice.

152
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,400
Knowing that without Cheng Feng’s choreography,

153
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,920
you’re nothing.

154
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,040
So you managed to trap her.

155
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,450
The sale of the house

156
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,280
and what happened to Lian Ruoshen,

157
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,480
they’re related to you.

158
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,160
Now you want to say you’re innocent.

159
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,720
Don’t you think it’s too late?

160
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,240
I was so stupid before

161
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,680
that I thought even if you’re selfish,

162
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,360
you still have a conscience.

163
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,360
I thought as long as I treat you well,

164
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,080
you’ll be grateful to me one day.

165
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:20,600
Now I think

166
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,120
I overestimated you.

167
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,160
You know what it is, right?

168
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,720
What you said just now

169
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,160
has already been spread.

170
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,480
The whole world knows about you!

171
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,690
Don’t you dare touch me again.

172
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,600
Pang Ting.

173
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,400
If it has been publicized,

174
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,360
it’ll be interesting.

175
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,680
It’s shocking.

176
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,560
Now Zhou Yao can’t deny the claim.

177
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,210
He’d better not deny it

178
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,440
because no one will believe him.

179
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,560
DK!

180
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,440
You bastard!

181
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,360
You’re shameless!

182
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,330
You slept with me and took a video.

183
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,200
Send the video to me!

184
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,050
He’s a monster.

185
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,680
He took advantage of his prestige

186
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,130
to seduce a lot of girls.

187
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,720
I’m one of the victims.

188
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,480
You’re talking nonsense!

189
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,280
Stop!

190
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,960
How dare you try to

191
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,160
slap her in public.

192
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,410
You set a trap for me together.

193
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,610
I won’t forgive you.

194
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,840
Let’s discuss after you’re released.

195
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,600
I’ll wait for you.

196
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,970
Come with us.

198
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,360
Zhou Yao is here.

199
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,280
Zhou Yao.

200
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,720
May I ask if what you talked about

201
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,890
between you and your manager is real?

202
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:02,890
May I ask did you use your fans

203
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:03,720
to hurt Cheng Feng?

204
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,320

Say something.

206
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,200
As a celebrity,

207
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,450
you should tell us about the truth.

208
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,770
Sorry, I don’t have anything to say.

209
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,720
Please answer our questions.

210

Hi, is it the police department?

This is Pang Ting.

Great!

I’m glad you’re happy.

Well, about Lian Ruoshen,

what’s your plan?

Why do you treat me this way, Cheng Feng?

230

Are you happy to ruin my life?

Why did you do this to me?

Are you happy to ruin my life?

Don’t move.

I’m innocent. You can’t arrest me.

242

- Are you okay? - Let me go!

Why are you here?

263
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:24,770
I’m here to see you.

264
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,650
So what did you find?

265
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,930
Did I change?

266
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,450
No.

267
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,240
You’re still like before.

268
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,760
You’re still quiet and cute.

269
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,810
But you changed.

270
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,530
The black hair is suitable for you.

271
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,400
It makes you look more reliable.

272
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,210
However, I prefer what you looked like before.

273
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,530
You were more energetic.

274
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,849
Yun, you were my faith before.

275
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,640
What about now?

276
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,530
You’re still my faith,

277
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:24,170
but I have to keep it secret.

278
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,810
Before, I often made you angry

279
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,280
and teased you.

280
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,040
The way you look

281
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,690
when you got angry was funny

282
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,730
and cute.

283
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:34,850
Later,

284
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,810
I didn’t want to

285
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,170
be a loser anymore,

286
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,050
so I hoped that I could

287
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,450
become a famous singer

288
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,480
and prove myself to you.

289
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,730
However, I didn’t realize

290
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,170
that I already fell in love

291
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,250
with you at that time.

292
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,090
Now I realized that,

293
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,290
but it seems to be too late.

294
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,930
We can’t go back, can we?

295
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,810
Yun, I did love you.

296
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,650
Do you believe me?

297
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:28,770
I lost. I lost everything

298
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,250
and I even missed you.

299
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,890
Yun, have you hung all the clothes?

300
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,170
It’s time to have dinner.

301

00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,500
You’re going to break up with me.

508
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,900
What I did has nothing to do with you.

509
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,180
You’re going to give up on me.

510
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,140
When did I say I want to give up on you?

511
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,740
Dian, it’s you. You’re giving up on yourself.

512
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,340
Do you know that I’ve been trying

513
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,180
to help you and become better with you?

514
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,100
What about you?

515
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,380
You threw your medications away secretly.

516
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,730
Do you know what you did?

517
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,060
Did you ever think about me?

518
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:22,810
Jiang Dian,

519
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,500
why didn’t I tell you?

520
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,630
You’re horrible when out of control.

521
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,820
Don’t you know that?

522
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:36,420
Jiang Dian, I’m not a god. I’m a human being.

523
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,740
I can go to the hospital with you,

524
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,940
but I’m not your cure.

525
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,990
The reason why I didn’t tell you

526
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,980
is that I love you.

527
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,020
Now I still want to love you.

528
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,420
But Jiang Dian,

529
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,150
do you think we can still be together?

530
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,180
Yes, we can.

531
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,110
We definitely can.

532
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,860
Cheng, please stay here. Please don’t leave me.

533
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,940
I won’t be mad anymore.

534
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,460
Please don’t leave me, Cheng.

535
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,100
You… You’re giving up on me.

536
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,510
Now you’re afraid of me.

537
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:05,990
Dian. Bie. I’m going to leave here.

538
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,260
Where will you go?

539
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:12,910
I haven’t made up my mind. Maybe Africa.

540
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,550
What? Are you going to dig gold?

541
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,900
Can you take me?

542
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,220
You won’t feel lonely on the way.

543
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,790
You always want to get involved.

544
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,940
I can’t take you this time.

545
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,140
I want to leave on my own.

546
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:33,950
Can you stay here?

547
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,670
Even you will leave me.

548
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,220
No kidding, Dian.

549
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,700
You still have Cheng.

550
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,260
You won’t leave.

551
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:54,900
Unlike me. I’m single.

552
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,350
Wherever I go, I won’t miss anyone

553
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,300
and no one will miss me.

554
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,140
How dare you say that.

555
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,460
We’re gonna miss you

556
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,220
but you won’t miss us.

557
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,469
What about Baoling?

558
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:10,820
How to deal with her?

559
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,020
What can I do?

560
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,540
I can’t give her what she wants.

561
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,420
If I stay with her,

562
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:20,500
I’ll be a burden on her.

563
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,580
That’s not what I mean.

564
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:24,020
I mean,

565
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:25,139
will you say goodbye to her?

566
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:27,980
I feel ashamed,

567
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,060
so I won’t meet her.

568
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,500
I don’t want us to be sad.

569
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:41,150
Dian, live a happy life with Cheng.

570
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,060
Help us enjoy the life

571
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,790
we missed. Then I’ll feel like

572
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:47,820
my terrible youth

573
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,900
is kind of worth to be remembered.

574
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,550
Let’s toast our passing youth.

575
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:00,630
Cheers.

576
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,830
Let’s go get hammered tonight.

577
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,950
♫ When I have wings ♫

578
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:16,230
♫ I can fly to a bigger world ♫

579
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,670
♫ I change ♫

580
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,230
♫ in the last second ♫

581
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,190
Your music is lousy!

582
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:29,300
Let’s toast our youth.

583
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,820
Cheers!

584
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,020
♫ I change ♫

585
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,150
♫ in the last second ♫

586
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,870
♫ Breaking the cocoon into a butterfly ♫

587
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:05,940
♫ I may feel lonely in youth ♫

588
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,500
Why are you crying?

589
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,860
♫ I can be brave when I’m with you ♫

590
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,140
♫ Time has taught us ♫

591
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:17,650
♫ to be grateful for having each other ♫

592
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:21,410
♫ I laugh and cry because of you ♫

593
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:26,940
♫ I spent all the best time with you ♫

594
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:34,280
♫ Staying with you is my best habit ♫

595
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:43,850
♫ Staying with you is my best habit ♫

596
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,030
None of your business.

597
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,030
Get out, all of you!

598
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,420
Get out!

599
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,500
What are you doing?

600
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,190
What are you doing?

601
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:02,750
Get out!

602
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:03,750
What are you doing?

603
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,310
Let’s go upstairs.

604
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,510
Cheng!

605
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,230
Cheng!

606
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,230
Cheng!

607
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,350
Cheng!

608
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,390
Break it!

609
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:15,550
Jiang Dian, come here as soon as possible.

610
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,780
Someone’s destroying our cafe.

611
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,350
Cheng, should I call the police?

612
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,180
She’s Jiang Dian’s mother.

613
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,310
I’ll close the store today.

614
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,100
You can go back now.

615
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,740
We’ll stay with you.
