Why are you here?

6
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:41,990
I sent you a text message before.

7
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,789

Shut up if you want to continue.

172
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,630
Can’t sleep?

173
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,030
Let me fold it with you.

174
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,140
OK.

175
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,100
Dian,

176
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,270
do you remember

177
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,220
what did you write on the second paper plane

178
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,020
you sent to me?

179
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,580
You wrote that,

180
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,020
“if you can fold

181
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,940
the same paper plane,

182
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,260
my trouble will be gone automatically.”

183
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,860
Is this promise

184
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,460
still valid now?

185
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,180
Cheng,

186
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,220
what do you want to say?

187
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,220
Dian,

188
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,570
are you happy to be with me?

189
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,020
Yes.

190
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,420
What about you?

191
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,700
Are you happy?

192
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,570
Sorry, Dian.

193
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,260
It’s because of me.

194
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,100
Because of me,

195
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,980
you came to beat him

196
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,580
and missed the experiment.

197
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,340
Professor Chen has been suspended.

198
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,260
You have to

199
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,420
suppress your emotions.

200
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,460
Stop talking, Cheng.

201
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,820
The whole thing

202
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,100
has nothing to do with you.

203
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:39,740
You don’t have to blame yourself.

204
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,180
If you become unhappy

205
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,980
because of me...

206
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,540
Dian, please stop talking.

207
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,450
Cheng, I know you’re tired.

208
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,660
I won’t make trouble anymore.

209
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,300
I won’t. OK?

210
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:57,860
Dian,

211
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,500
can you give me a chance

212
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,540
to help you get better

213
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,420
and become a physicist?

214
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,010
This time,

215
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,180
I’ll chase you.

216
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,940
Let’s

217
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,170
get back the Dian

218
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:17,930
who dreamed to

219
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,180
spend his whole life

220
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,300
on physics.

221
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:22,860
OK?

222
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,100
Cheng,

223
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,980
will he be back?

224
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,300
Yes,

225
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,180
as long as you want.

226
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,220
I’m gonna move the Rook

227
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,540
to catch your Pawn.

228
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,420
The first Cannon.

229
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,860
The first Cannon?

230
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,860
Don’t look at me this way.

231
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:12,740
It’s ugly.

232
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,370
It’s not suitable for you.

233
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,980
- Li, play a game for me. - OK.

234
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:27,620
Sorry,

235
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:29,890
I let you down.

236
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,460
You scared me, kid.

237
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,700
Why so formal?

238
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,100
Tell me.

239
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,770
If Cheng is not here,

240
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,060
will you still come to me?

241
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,250
Kid,

242
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,140
do you know that

243
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,580
your apology

244
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,820
will only work once or twice.

245
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,660
Apologies will be useless if there are too many.

246
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,140
Kid,

247
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,579
that incident

248
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:06,339
doesn’t matter to me.

249
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,980
I can stay with my friends.

250
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,220
We play chess

251
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,540
and water the flowers.

252
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:12,540
Every day I feel happy.

253
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,140
But what about you?

254
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,970
That incident matters to you.

255
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,540
Jiang Dian,

256
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:18,900
I know

257
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,420
you’ve been through a lot.

258
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,300
You’re gifted in physics,

259
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,530
but

260
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,260
if you can’t balance

261
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,780
your relationship and your career,

262
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,020
your life will be miserable

263
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,540
no matter how successful you are.

264
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,970
You’ll regret it.

265
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,580
Do you understand me?

266
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,740
My teacher also

267
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,060
told me that

268
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,380
he would never give up on me.

269
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,260
However, under pressure from my mom,

270
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,730
He left.

271
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,580
Afterwards

272
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,980
when I heard the same words,

273
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,810
I didn’t believe it.

274
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:57,980
Until I met you,

275
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,740
I realized that

276
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,210
there are people who will never give up on me.

277
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,730
You always support and encourage me.

278
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,370
I’m not good at expressing my gratitude,

279
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,300
but I remember

280
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,250
everything you did for me.

281
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,420
It’s my fault this time.

282
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,650
I’m sorry.

283
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,530
I let you down.

284
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,500
You can scold me.

285
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:13,900
Scold you?

286
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,780
I… I even want to beat you!

287
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,020
I said I’m not mad, but it’s not true.

288
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,660
I know

289
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,340
how important

290
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,540
Cheng is to you.

291
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,130
In that situation,

292
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,420
if I were there,

293
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,700
I would also let you go.

294
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,330
Think. You

295
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:33,700
suffered a lot before.

296
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,100
It’s not easy to meet a girl

297
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:36,860
who treat you so well.

298
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,620
How could I stop you?

299
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,540
I’m not that ruthless.

300
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,060
Alright.

301
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,090
You’re a man.

302
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,340
You should let it go

303
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,220
instead of giving up on yourself.

304
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,260
Take a good rest.

305
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,300
Go back now.

306
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,410
It’s not too late.

307
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,050
I’ll bring you back to school.

308
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,430
[Linxi University]

309
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,530
Dean,

310
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,220
the experiment failed.

311
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,290
It’s my fault.

312
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,490
It has nothing to do with Professor Chen.

313
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,450
I’m responsible for it.

314
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,570
Professor Chen is an expert at

315
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,650
fluid mechanics

316
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,340
and a re-employed

317
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,780
retiree of our school.

318
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,780
He’s highly respected among the field.

319
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,330
He guaranteed your ability to do that project.

320
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,450
Otherwise, we wouldn’t approve.

321
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,380
You made such a big mistake.

322
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:40,940
They think we’re accountable.

323
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,290
By convention

324
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,370
Professor Chen is the leader,

325
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,500
so he should take responsibility for

326
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,580
the loss caused by the experiment.

327
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:50,850
One week.

328
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:51,970
Dean,

329
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,410
please give me one week.

330
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,690
I’ll make up for the mistake.

331
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,980
Are you sure you can do it within a week?

332
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,540
Yes, I’m sure.

333
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:03,530
OK.

334
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,370
I’ll talk to them.

335
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,980
If you can do it.

336
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,250
I’ll manage to

337
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,650
bring Chen back.

338
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,780
Our school doesn’t want to lose

339
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,780
such a good professor.

340
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,860
Dean, thank you.

341
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:19,860
Go.

342
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,410
Don’t let Chen down.

343
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,050
Chengcheng,

344
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,690
I have sent you the demo

345
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,130
of Lian Ruosheng’s new single.

346

It’s a single about love.

347
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,380
It’s called Thoughts.

Dean agreed!

351
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,570
He gave me a week.

352
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,530
As long as I complete the experiment this week,

353
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,730
he’ll bring Mr. Chen back.

I may have to

357
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,980
work overtime and stay at school.

358
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,330
It’s OK. Focus on your experiment.

359
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,460
I will. Promise me

515
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:47,970
Yes.

516
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:49,410
It’s important.

517
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:51,000
Today I’m here to

518
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,000
invite Chengcheng to attend

519
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,050
my celebratory party tomorrow.

520
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,520
I can refuse the invitation.

521
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:56,960
Attend it.

522
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,930
Why don’t you attend it?

523
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,650
It’s a good chance to market yourself.

524
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,210
You should take it.

525
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:04,410
OK.

526
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:06,810
This dress

527
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:08,520
I booked is of your size.

528
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,770
Dian,

529
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:14,680
I choreographed a new dance.

530
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,410
Let’s go home. I’ll show you.

531
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:18,050
OK.

532
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,850
I paid someone to make it for you.

533
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:23,010
It’s expensive.

534
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,410
If you don’t take it,

535
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,130
it’ll be a waste.

536
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,290
Showing off

537
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,370
means you’re not confident of your relationship.

538
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,890
You’re not confident.

539
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,450
Why do you dream of

540
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,800
things that don’t belong to you?

541
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,130
Thank you for the dress.

542
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,570
By the way,

543
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,330
you seem to be confident.

544
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,880
Sooner or later I’ll find out your secret

545
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,420
and let you know

546
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,640
what it feels like to be a nobody.

547
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,370
I hope that you can always be confident then.

548
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:07,970
The punch last time,

549
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,680
I’ll manage to give it back.

550
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,160
Why were you with him?

551
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,090
- Why didn’t you answer the phone? - It hurts!

552
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,560
Do you want to be on the show with him again?

553
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,840
Dian, calm down. I can explain.

554
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:36,960
How can I calm down?

555
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,010
What do you want to say?

556
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,600
I told you many times.

557
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,360
Don’t be with him.

558
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:41,040
Don’t be with him.

559
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,920
What did you do?

560
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:42,850
Size.

561
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,170
How did he know your size?

562
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,170
Tell me!

563
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,280
Why did he come to you?

564
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,600
Answer my questions!

565
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,290
Hey,

566
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,090
you want to admit it, right?

567
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,000
Answer me!

568
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,810
Why don’t you say something?

569
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,360
Dian. Dian.

570
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,730
Dian, please stop.

571
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,120
Please, Dian.

572
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:06,880
Dian.

573
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,250
What do I have to do

574
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,840
to make you feel better?

575
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:16,969
I didn’t answer the phone

576
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,520
because my phone powered off.

577
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,320
About what happened on the show,

578
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:21,480
I knew nothing before.

579
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:22,679
When the show ended,

580
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,600
I directly took your

581
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,360
favorite dessert and came to see you.

582
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:26,730
You were not there, so I decided to go home.

583
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,760
I don’t know why

584
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,730
he would show up downstairs, Dian.

585
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:33,960
Dian,

586
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:36,210
I have nothing to do with him.

587
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:37,530
Please believe me.

588
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,320
I… I don’t know

589
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:43,719
why I would be angry.

590
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,969
When I saw you with him,

591
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:50,810
I felt upset and angry.

592
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,370
I know what I did

593
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,679
will make you hate me more.

594
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,600
You’ll dislike me.

595
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,680
But I couldn’t control myself.

596
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,160
I didn’t mean it.

597
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,450
I didn’t want to hurt you.

598
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,400
Please don’t leave me,

599
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,690
Cheng.

600
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,410
I just hope

601
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:20,880
you can always be there for me.

602
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:40,110
♫ Love is transitory ♫

603
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:43,910
♫ I can laugh while regretting ♫

604
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:47,400
♫ I’ve been used to it ♫

605
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,230
♫ Even my tears are brave ♫

606
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:56,110
♫ The moments of our memory ♫

607
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:01,040
♫ The answer you are looking for in every minute ♫

608
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:08,260
♫ I really want to shoulder everything for you ♫

609
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,440
Dian.

610
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:12,380
♫ I laugh and cry because of you ♫

611
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,690
How can I make you feel better?

612
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:17,310
♫ I spent all the best time with you ♫

613
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:24,760
♫ Staying with you is my best habit ♫

614
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:34,340
♫ Staying with you is my best habit ♫

615
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,760
How’s the celebratory party?

616
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,720
I heard that

617
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:00,880
you booked an evening dress.

618
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,800
You sent someone to watch me.

619
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,600
Don’t worry.

620
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,120
I’m your agent. I want to

621
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,320
know your daily life.

622
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,200
It’s normal.

623
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,480
Zhou Yao,

624
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,690
you hide it from me.

625
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:19,960
No.

626
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,200
You did a lot of things by using me.

627
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,120
You’re clear on that.

628
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:25,360
About the issue of An Yin,

629
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,370
are you telling me you don’t know anything?

630
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,130
I’m not your friend.

631
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:44,650
The enemy of my enemy

632
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,320
is a friend, right?

633
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,400
It’s time for her to

634
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,160
get the endorsement for HA?

635
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,400
Can you tell me

636
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,160
if someone spread rumors now,

637
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,800
what will happen?

638
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,320
Stop talking.

639
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:00,400
Tell me what you want me to do for you.

640
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,640
Not do for me. Cooperate with me.

641
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,040
Sorry.

642
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,000
I only like to work things out by using money.

643
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,120
I can find someone to help you spread rumors.

644
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,040
About how to spread rumors, I don’t care.

645
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,960
You did know it.

646
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,560
Why didn’t you tell me?

647
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,960
Do you think I’m a fool?

648
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,520
Don’t you think

649
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,760
you’re stupid recently?

650
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,490
You always say you know me.

651
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,320
But if you do know me,

652
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,720
why do you care about

653
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,040
my relationship with Cheng Feng?

654
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,050
Did time

655
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,160
make you forget who I am?

656
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,040
Or did you change?

657
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,480
Can’t you follow my steps anymore?

658
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,930
The reason why I chose you before

659
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,640
is that

660
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,160
you can help me get what I want

661
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:12,000
and I can also help you get what you want.

662
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:17,840
I enjoyed working with you these years.

663
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,560
But recently

664
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,920
you did something stupid

665
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,600
because of your mood.

666
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,520
Now I doubt that

667
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,320
if you can keep helping me.

668
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,690
Pang Ting,

669
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:44,920
I hope what I said

670
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,960
to you tonight

671
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,040
will enlighten you.

672
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,360
Don’t let me down again.

673
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,720
My tolerance for you

674
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,720
is limited.

675
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,200
By the way,

676
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,560
don’t come to my apartment

677
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,760
without telling me again.

678
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:06,770
I don’t want journalists to write about us.

679
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,720
Does your hand still hurt?

680
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:42,960
Dian,

681
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,920
Let’s go out today.

682
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,280
I’m going to the beach.

683
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,960
You should go to attend that party.

684
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,160
After all,

685
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,320
your choreography helped

686
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,320
his song become a hit.

687
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,800
You can’t let him

688
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,760
enjoy the fame alone.

689
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,960
At the party,

690
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,360
you’re the one who should be adored.

691
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,720
I can attend the party,

692
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,000
but I want you to be with me.

693
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,240
Because

694
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,680
I just want

695
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,760
you to adore me.

696
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:23,640
OK.

697
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:32,880
Hi.

698
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,760
Dian, something happened.

699
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,080
Go back to school now.

700
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,360
OK.

701
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,040
Something happened in the lab.

702
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:42,920
I have to go.

703
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,280
Later I’ll attend the party with you.

704
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,200
OK.

705
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:57,800
What’s wrong?

706
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,000
The result has been submitted, hasn’t it?

707
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:04,640
Tell me.

708
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,160
It’s easy to be irritable

709
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,920
in the morning.

710
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,240
Have some desserts.

711
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,720
Desserts can make you feel happy.

712
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,520
Surprise!

713
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:18,920
We know that you worked hard

714
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,000
to bring our teacher back,

715
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,720
so we decided to give you a surprise.

716
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,320
Professor, we miss you so much.

717
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:25,760
Yep. Professor,

718
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,910
when you were not here,

719
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,080
experiments became boring.

720
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,720
Professor, I have to deliver the file now.

721
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,320
OK. Go!

722
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,760
Study hard. I’m counting on you.

723
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,520
Professor, thank you.

724
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,350
Professor, thanks.

725
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:42,800
Looks like there’s no dessert left.

726
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:45,440
You’re kidding me.

727
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,160
Let me take a look at you.

728
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:50,920
Dean told me that

729
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,280
you led them to

730
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,600
work on the experiment day and night.

731
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:55,880
Good job.

732
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:00,920
What’s wrong with your hand?

733
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,520
It’s OK.

734
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,630
What happened? Tell me.

735
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:06,920
I hit it. Never mind.

736
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,920
Jiang Dian,

737
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,040
if there’s anything wrong,

738
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,350
let me know.

739
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,400
Why are you so impulsive?

740
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,680
Is it because of Cheng?

741
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,760
I think I hurt her last night.

742
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,240
I didn’t mean it,

743
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,760
but I found I couldn’t control myself.

744
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:46,800
You’re

745
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,680
sick.

746
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,040
Mentally sick.
