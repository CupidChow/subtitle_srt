Why not waiting for me at home?

12

Dian,

81
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:19,760
it’s my fault in the past

82
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,210
to lock up my heart

like physics.

Sorry, I don't know.

but you didn’t allow me to tell him the specific reason .

261

So I said nothing.

But why don't you tell him?

263

so I didn’t ask him.

267
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,060
I have persuaded him

268
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:09,850
not to sell the house.

269
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,390
Why did he suddenly change his mind again?

270
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,850
I asked him the same question,

271
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,560
but he didn't say anything.

272

I’m just trying to mollify him.

288
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,380
The guy is not so wise, you know.

289
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,970
I'm afraid he can't understand me if I talk normally.

290
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,980
Could you stop talking?

291
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,770
I doubt you

292

despised him not as a normal human being.

293
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,500
Of course he isn’t. I’m just telling the truth.

294
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,000
Can a normal person do such a thing?

295
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,109
Shut up.

296
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,520

Are you OK?

301
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,420

302

express my depression

Why do you follow me?

Do you wanna watch me cry?

328

I dare not!

Please don't be angry.

330
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,480
I didn't mean that.

You know me, I always

332
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,660
speak faster than I think, so...

333
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:43,810
You needn’t explain it anymore.

334
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,880
Tell them

335
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,550
I won’t care for you any more.

336
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:49,570
I'm busy.

337
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,800
If you don’t want to study,

338
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,260
I’ll spare my time to supervise others.

339
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,060
I can’t give up others

340
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,600
just because of you.

00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,650
and his passion

681
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,010
moved you.

682
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:30,930
I don’t know

683
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,570
whether you are really a fool

684
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:34,310
or you are pretending to be a fool.

685
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,120
Can’t you see

686
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:37,440
that he was trying

687
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,360
so hard for someone?

688
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:39,550
That someone is you.

689
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,570
He wants to prove to you that

690
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,470
he is worth paying special regard.

691
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,010
Yun,

692
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,290
I hope you

693
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,920
can try to believe in him once.

694
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:58,910
He is trying very hard

695
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:01,900
and he is suffering a lot.

696
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,940
Now we’ve finished recording
the song for his debut.

697
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,870
After Cheng composes the dance,

698
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:08,720
he will make his debut.

699
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:11,890
-At that time...
-At that time it will all be

700
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,740
his own business.

701
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,950
Everything is OK as long as he won’t regret it.

702
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,130
A malignant star.

703
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,010
She is absolutely a malignant star for me.

704
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:41,810

705
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:43,970
[Mr. Yang (Landlord) ]

706
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,770
Hello!

707
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,890
Have you prepared enough money?

708
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:53,690
I’m not urging you.

709
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,410
I just care about it.

710
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,650
We’ve been getting along with
each other for several years.

711
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:58,880
I am unwilling to

712
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,950
make things too difficult for you.

713
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:02,890
Don’t worry.

714
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,910
I will prepare enough money in a few days

715
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,490
and send it to you according to the time we’ve agreed on.

716
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:07,900
OK.

717
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,130
If you insist on doing so,

718
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,010
I have no comments.

719
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,510
See you then.

[Rich]

721
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:26,730
Hello,

722
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,610
Liqi!

723
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,400
Can I still be the ambassador for the brand HA?

724
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:43,940
Hello!

725
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,720
Cheng has finally agreed.

726
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,360
I will meet her later

727
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,160
and we will talk about

728
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,260
the details of cooperation.

729
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,670
You may also come

730
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,550
if it’s possible.

731
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,050
You can meet her formally.

732
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,950
I must settle this issue as quickly as possible

733
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,320
in case she will regret it.

734
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,560
See you at the bookstore then.

735
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,460
Congratulations! I will be on time.

736
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:07,210
OK.

737
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,310
[Cheng Feng]

738
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:30,090
Dian, I can’t go there because I have
something to do.

739
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,430
[HA Official Couple: Cheng Feng and Zhou Yao]

740
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,900
The two of them

741
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,140
are very suitable to cooperate with each other.

742
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,060
They look very much like a couple.

743
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,420
Mr. Liqi,

744
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,300
Brand Manager of HA,

745
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:45,490
said that he had always believed that

746
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:47,120
Zhou Yao and Cheng Feng

747
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,140
had been the most suitable ones for HA.

748
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,640
Cheng has left.

749
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,270
Will you look for her outside the bookstore?

750
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,490
Who asked you to go upstairs?

751
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:22,010
Of course, Cheng.

752
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:24,870
She invited me to go upstairs.

753
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,220
It’s just the beginning and you are so angry.

754
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,120
If you know that

755
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:43,840
Cheng and I

756
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,110
took a photo together for HA performing lovers,

757
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,310
you will get mad at me.

758
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,240
Stop.

759
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,410
Dian. Please don’t do that.

760
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:56,770
Are you OK?

761
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,100
I’m fine.

762
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,950
I can understand that

763
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:02,620
her boyfriend is angry.

764
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,330
If there is nothing you want me to do,

765
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,080
I’ll go upstairs

766
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,280
because I have to coax my boyfriend.

767
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:20,000
Let’s go.

768
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,140
Thank you for watching Entertainment Hot Events.

769
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,080
We have the latest entertainment news

770
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,310
and special reports about the stars

771
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:32,320
you want to know.

772
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:33,470
HA has just

773
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:34,260
officially announced

774
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,140
its female brand ambassador.

775
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:35,970
She was on the hot search

776
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,000
because of a dance.

777
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:39,710
She is the beautiful dancer

778
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:40,330
Cheng Feng.

779
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:43,010
We believe she will have a bright future

780
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,770
after cooperating with the brand HA.

781
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,590
You won’t speak to me again?

782
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:31,850
Dian,

783
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,320
please let me explain.

784
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,390
It’s simply a job.

785
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,440
Please don’t think too much.

786
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:39,820
Is it really nothing important?

787
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:42,810
You know

788
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:44,790
he is the other brand ambassador.

789
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:45,800
Why do you still choose to do it?

790
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:49,230
Because I think

791
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:50,820
it is simply a job?

792
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:52,090
There is nothing I should avoid.

793
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,810
It is simply a job for you. What about him?

794
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:55,610
Are you sure it is simply a job for him?

795
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:57,550
There are so many jobs

796
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:58,250
you can choose to do.

797
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,130
Why do you

798
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:00,010
choose this one?

799
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:00,890
You know

800
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:01,600
I hate him most.

801
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,920
Why did you go to see him?

802
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,680
Dian, please calm down.

803
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:08,290
Calm down? How can I calm down?

804
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,570
My girlfriend and her ex-boyfriend

805
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:11,410
are brand ambassadors and they are
performing a couple.

806
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:12,250
How can I calm down?

807
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:13,260
Have you

808
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,400
considered my feeling?

809
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:15,550
I’m just going to do a job.

810
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,910
Why are you so angry?

811
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,710
I told you that

812
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:19,770
we were only strangers.

813
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:20,560
Why do you take it

814
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,570
to heart?

815
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:22,940
Because I care about you!

816
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,700
Do you understand? I care about you!

817
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:25,450
I don’t want you

818
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:26,770
to be related to him in any way.

819
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,020
Please don’t work as their brand ambassador,

820
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:37,630
OK?

821
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:44,500
It’s just a job.

822
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:51,490
I thought I was important

823
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:52,370
in your heart.

824
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,310
I’ve overestimated myself.
