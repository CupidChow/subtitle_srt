102

You know I trust you, don't you?

106
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,370
It's just because

107
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,050
I don't trust myself.

108

I accepted the endorsement

116
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,090
because the house-owner wants to sell the book cafe

117
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,460
but I want to buy it

118

and change it into a dance studio.

119

The endorsement

120
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,780
can fix the money problem

121
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,300
as well as introducing me to the public.

122
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,500
It lays the groundwork for recruiting.

123
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,460
These are the reasons.

124
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,260
It has nothing to do with Zhou Yao.

125

You are still a student.

128
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,530
I don't want to make you

129

feel stressed so early.

130

Don't you think so?

If you don't tell me at the first time

135
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:52,740
and hide it from me,

136
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,460
it makes me feel that you don't need me

137
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,500
and it makes me feel I'm useless.

for the book cafe.

144
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,700
I will settle it if it's not enough.

145

How did you get so much money?

146

149

I’ve been saving.

150
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,380

I have you now.

155

And

00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,980
I don't want to go.

173
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:18,980
Stop that.

174
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,660
I will go to HA for MV later.

175
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,300
I will drive you there.

176
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,380
You may finish your thing first.

177
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,900
If time permits,

178
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,220
you can drive me there.

179
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:28,660
Wait for me.

180
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,190
[Certificate]

181
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,860
My student Jiang Dian, the champion

182
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,260
of National Physics Competition

183
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,580
of College Students.

184
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,660
Chen, so great for you.

185
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,380
You!

186
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,570
When did you come? You scared me.

187
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,620
The moment you were talking tall.

188
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,530
I wasn't talking tall.

189
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,730
The champion the of Physics Competition.

190
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:50,900
You. Jiang Dian.

191
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,700
Jiang Dian, you are excellent.

192
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:53,660
Thank you, sir.

193
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,620
Congratulations.

194
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,540
Jiang Dian, the champion of the Physics Competition.

195
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,690
I'm proud of you.

196
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,220
By the way,

197
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,300
I'd tell you one thing.

198
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,210
I made a decision for you

199
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,380
without

200
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,940
your permission.

201
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,580
It's the salon.

202
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,780
I hope you to go.

203
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,780
All there

204
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,260
are top physicists of the world.

205
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,410
But you'll stay abroad for a few days.

206
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,460
I promise it will be

207
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,100
of great benefit to you

208
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,500
in physics.

209
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,500
I will go.

210
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,700
That's good.

211
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,900
I'll let you know when the time is set.

212
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,280
Oh, right.

213
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,220
How about your major transfer?

214
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,860
I already submitted the application.

215
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,860
At first, you were not allowed

216
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,020
to transfer from business to science.

217
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:42,820
Since

218
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,900
you won the championship

219
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,260
of the Physics Competition

220
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,500
and did credit to the college,

221
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:50,140
you got the special approval.

222
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,460
Take the opportunity.

223
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,300
I got it.

224
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,220
So,

225
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,780
does your mother agree with it?

226
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,780
No, I decided it by myself.

227
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,650
I originally thought

228
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,530
to chat with her.

229
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,700
Now it's unnecessary.

230
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,140
Jiang Dian.

231
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,620
No matter what decision you make,

232
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,620
I will respect your wishes.

233
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,620
Last time you said

234
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,660
someone wants to buy my patent.

235
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,660
How's it now?

236
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,780
So,

237
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,060
are you sure about it?

238
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,220
No kidding.

239
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,060
It's urgent.

240
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,980
Keep a close eye on it.

241
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:23,540
OK.

242
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,070
Lower.

243
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,500
Yes. Right. That's it.

244
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,630
Harder. Bro.

245
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,390
Harder.

246
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,430
Hey, Lu Bie.

247
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,750
Why so hard?

248
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,290
You asked me to be harder.

249
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,430
Now you don't want it.

250
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,190
What on earth do you want?

251
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,200
You just danced.

252
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,230
Is that so hard?

253
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,120
Not so hard?

254
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,790
You can try.

255
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,900
I'm sure it'll make you disabled.

256
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,310
You are fine now, aren't you?

257
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,630
You are not disabled.

258
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,740
I mean you.

259
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,620
I'm talented.

260
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,470
We are different.

261
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,190
I could be so familiar to it

262
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,520
in such a short period.

263
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,510
You'll never find another one.

264
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,970
It's be so familiar with it.

265
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,430
Idiot!

266
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,050
I'll never find another one

267
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,300
more shameless than you.

268
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,050
What did you say?

269
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:20,820
You want me to hit you?

270
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,220
So graceful.

271
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,260
She's really beautiful.

272
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,380
She looks great even without
using the filter.

273
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,010
Why are you still laughing?

274
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,820
I'm laughing because you are cute
when you are busy.

275
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,450
It almost kills me.

276
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,240
I wonder why

277
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,380
it becomes so busy suddenly

278
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,310
when it had no buyer yesterday.

279
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,150
Cheng.

280
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,490
I happen to attend an activity near.

281
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,120
So, I'd see if you have left.

282
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,390
Will you go

283
00:14:58,970 --> 00:14:59,760
together with me?

284
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,130
Zhou Yao,

285
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:10,980
if you don't want me

286
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,610
to expose you,

287
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:13,790
you'd better keep away from me.

288
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,010
Cheng.

289
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,810
I know

290
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:19,430
it won't help now

291
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,440
no matter what I say.

292
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:22,590
I never expected you

293
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,520
to forgive me.

294
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,950
I come here today

295
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,490
to make up for it.

296
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,170
I mean for all that I did to you.

297
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,410
Are you serious?

298
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,020
Of course.

299
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,130
Then talk to my mother.

300
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,380
You stole the dance

301
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,050
as a birthday gift for my mother.

302
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,210
Why don't you apologize to her face to face?

303
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,480
I...

304
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,170
Forget it.

305
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,050
I know

306
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:46,970
it's useless no matter what I say.

307
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,510
It's the set time.

308
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,930
We won't be late if we go now.

309
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,000
You're always on time.

310
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,800
I don't think you want to be late

311
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,900
and make the shooting delayed.

312
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,510
My car is over there.

313
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:00,610
I'll wait for you.

314
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,240
Am I late?

315
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,340
It's the right time.

316
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,740
Why are you gossiping all the time?

317
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,760
Cheng didn't advertise it for fame.

318
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,340
She wants the ownership of the store.

319
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,090
But she's hard up for money.

320
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:35,460
Sure.

321
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,610
The book cafe is very important to her.

322
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,320
You two, be closer.

323
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,210
Our theme is willful love.

324
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,010
You have no passion at all.

325
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,300
Cheng Feng, why are you avoiding?

326
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:08,460
Hey, Cheng Feng, why are you avoiding?

327
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,250
You need to feel the passion of love.

328
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:15,369
The passion in the eyes of you two.

329
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:18,010
But you have no feelings at all.

330
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:19,369
Again.

331
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:32,970
Dian.

332
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,120
It's working time.

333
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,500
May you pay attention to this point?

334
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:43,920
Who is this person?

335
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,200
Where is he from?

336
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,650
Someone come here, hurry!

337
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,670
He's my boyfriend.

338
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,170
You are so unprofessional.

339
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,060
Why did you take your boyfriend here?

340
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,600
We don't have enough time.

341
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,610
You've been in the wrong state.

342
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:55,890
Will you shoot or not?

343
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:56,810
Let's just stop it if not.

344
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:01,830
He's still young.

345
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,330
Please don't get mad.

346
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,780
Have some water. And take a break.

347
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,250
Go back yourself.

348
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,330
If you don't want to

349
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,210
make trouble for Cheng,

350
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,130
you'd better listen to her.

351
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,510
Director, please excuse me!

352
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,830
My girlfriend can't relax

353
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:28,450
in front of others.

354
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,210
So, I'm here to help her.

355
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,490
We'll be OK very soon.

356
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:32,980
OK. Ready.

357
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:34,830
Prop. Spray.

358
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,550
Relax. Relax.

359
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:50,060
♫ Meeting is like on top of the dream ♫

360

Cheng Feng is so passionate.

392
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,100
She isn't indifferent all the time.

393
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:06,520
Will we

394
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,360
continue?

395
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:08,590
If not...

396
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,600
Pang Ting.

397
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,280
We can go to the charity activity

398
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:11,980
this afternoon.

399
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,000
OK. I'll arrange it now.

400
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,020
Dian.

401
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,480
If you keep staying here,

402
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,440
it will prolong the period

403
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,460
of being with him.

404
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,780
You need to go to the pub

405
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,880
for work, right?

406
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:22,980
Go first.

407
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,300
When you get off work,

408
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,720
I also finish mine. Let's meet at home.

409
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,710
No. No.

410
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,640
Release your hands.

411
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,440
Let's continue. Hang in there.

412
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:43,920
No. No.

413
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,080
Man, sing. You won't feel hurt that way.

414
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,270
♫ Unity is strength ♫

415
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,020
The strength...

416
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,840
- No, I can't stand it.
- Be persistent.

417
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,550
No.

418
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,360
It kills me.

419
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,940
It kills me.

420
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,220
Stop. Stop! You guys.

421
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,100
Come back. Help me.

422
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,240
Dian, where are you now?

423
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,730
I miss you so much.

424
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,970
[Cheng, I have a piece of good news.]

425
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,430
[Mr. Chen said I can go to the physicist salon abroad.]

426
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:02,240
[I miss you.]

427
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,840
Table five, two, Mojito.

428
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,490
The lady of K22

429
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,310
must be a superwoman.

430
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,190
Now I know the woman

431
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,560
can only become charming

432
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:17,070
when she reaches a certain age.

433
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,690
But it's a pity!

434
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,060
She's in danger now.

435
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,330
I don't think she can escape

436
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,090
from the old lecher tonight.

437
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:24,730
I can't think of it.

438
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,440
It makes me get gooseflesh.

439
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,100
Jiang Dian.

440
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,340
You go to K22.

441
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,610
I will serve table five.

442
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,250
Mr. Jiang, let me make a toast.

443
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,850
Please stand by me

444
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,310
in the Shareholders Meeting

445
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,710
for replacing the president.

446
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,960
Sure. Cheers.

447
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,290
Vice-president Chen, you are frank.

448
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:58,920
Anyway, I like it.

449
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,130
If I didn't go wrong,

450
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,010
it's the first time you buy me a drink.

451
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,210
I believe we will have

452
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,450
another round tonight.

453
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:08,730
Come on.

454
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:11,850
Finish it.

455
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,750
Then everything will be OK.

456
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,240
There are 13 votes.

457
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,050
According to the regulations,

458
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,040
the one receiving the majority

459
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,980
will be the next president.

460
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,960
As far as I know,

461
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,670
both you and Mr. Jiang

462
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,170
have six votes.

463
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,900
And I'm the only one who didn't vote.

464
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,740
Mr. Jiang treated me with meals

465
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,010
several times in private.

466
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,290
Anyway,

467
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,780
we are all friends.

468
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,400
It's

469
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,730
hard for me to take a side.

470
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:01,000
Now

471
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,020
you want me

472
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,740
to betray him.

473
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,860
I don't think you are sincere enough.

474
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:08,790
Sincere?

475
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,200
I am sincere.

476
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,160
You used the fund

477
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,480
for You Ke Project

478
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,180
to cover your deficit.

479
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,360
If he knows this,

480
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:21,800
what do you think will he do?

481
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,560
Uh.

482
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:26,830
You are threatening me.

483
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:28,840
I dare not.

484
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,220
I'm showing my sincerity.

485
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,360
Anyway, Mr. Jiang,

486
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,180
such sincerity

487
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,160
is like a delayed-action bomb.

488
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:37,420
Will we explode it or not?

489
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,060
It's up to you.

490
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,440
Mr. Jiang, please excuse me.

491
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,040
How many things are you hiding?

492
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,150
At the beginning,

493
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:16,860
I thought

494
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,690
you got into a huff

495
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,230
because of physics.

496
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,650
If I ignore you for a few days,

497
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,020
you will go home.

498
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,340
Unexpectedly,

499
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,660
you can adhere for so long.

500
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,500
Have I underestimated you?

501
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,360
You'd rather work as a waiter

502
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:31,820
than inheriting my company.

503
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,090
Let me ask you.

504
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,980
Inheriting my company is bad for you?

505
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,860
What else

506
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,180
will you do to surprise me?

507
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,240
Say something.

508
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:42,680
What have you talked

509
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,560
with the man in K22?

510
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,620
It's none of your business.

511
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,290
Then please leave me alone.

512
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,610
How can you be so rude to your mother?

513
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,150
Is it what I taught you?

514
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:50,030
So unruly.

515
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,150
[Cheng Feng]

516
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,930
- I have to go now.
-Wait!

517
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:01,690
I haven't finished yet.

518
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,480
If it is the same as

519
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,100
what you said last time,

520
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,940
please stop that.

521
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:06,970
Jiang Dian.

522
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,100
Yin, I took you

523
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,330
and Cheng Feng abroad

524
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,490
because I found your talent

525
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,410
for dancing.

526
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,510
You were bright and sensitive.

527
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,990
But now,

528
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,530
you don't have any of it.

529
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:49,170
Do you know

530
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,090
you are a burden now?

531
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:52,850
In that case,

532
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,140
you'd better give up.

533
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,470
Think it over.

534
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:06,370
An Yin, what brings you here?

535
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,450
I saw you didn't look well last time.

536
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,210
So, I bought some lavender tea for you.

537
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,850
Thank you. Come on. Sit.

538
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:14,600
OK.

539
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,340
This may be unnecessary anymore.

540
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:23,790
I'm recovered now.

541
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,160
Really?

542
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:26,480
It's great!

543
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:28,500
When?

544
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,480
Why didn't you tell me?

545
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,220
In that case, I'd not come today.

546
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:35,100
It makes me tired.

547
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,970
How are you now?

548
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,790
Much better.

549
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,780
I hope I can stand up

550
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,970
as the doctor said

551
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,380
after the last surgery.

552
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,410
Don't worry. You will.

553
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,010
I watched the TV news.

554
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,680
You got an international brand endorsement.

555
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,930
You are so cool, Cheng!

556
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,910
I knew you could do it.

557
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,090
You were dancing just now.

558
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,210
So are you ready

559
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:07,710
for returning to the stage?

560
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,490
Comeback? Not that.

561
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,940
I just want to start a dance studio.

562
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,240
For comeback,

563
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,440
it will depend.

564
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,130
It'll be great!

565
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,020
I knew you could do it.

566
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,230
Our master said

567
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,120
you will be an outstanding one

568
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,440
among us.

569
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:30,980
As expected.

570
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:32,740
I'm sure master will be happy

571
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,180
if she knows it.

572
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,740
Come on. Be quick.

573
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,740
Cheng, you are back.

574
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,160
What's this for?

575
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,020
Lian Ruoshen hurt his leg

576
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,120
during the splits.

577
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,710
I'll get him a stretcher

578
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,630
and carry him back.

579
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,830
We made him disabled, why...?

580
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:55,450
Shut up!

581
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,510
He didn't mean that.

582
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,310
Where is Lian Ruoshen?

583
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,550
He's not here.

584
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:12,460
Did he

585
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,620
get back by himself?

586
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,090
Cheng, please excuse us.

587
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:18,990
- Let's go.
- Bye-bye.

588
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,770
It's late now.

589
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:23,650
I also have to leave now.

590
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,100
We'll have an activity tomorrow.

591
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,070
I'll prepare for it.

592
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,260
OK. I will walk you out.

593
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:28,670
No.

594
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,190
I can go by myself.

595
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,770
- Be careful.
- OK.

596
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,440
Hello.

597
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,700
I found the affair of President Jiang.

598
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:51,810
OK. I got it.

599
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,090
Listen.

600
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,420
Jiang Dian is working at 24K.

601
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,620
Find a way to get him fired.

602
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,730
And have a reliable man

603
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:00,960
to follow him all the time.

604
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:01,670
OK.

605
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,120
Tell me if anything happens.

606
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:03,560
OK.

607
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,100
Yao, drive.

[Half-Moon Book Cafe]

610
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,780
Lonely person

611
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,470
doesn't need too much warmth.

612
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,650
A lamp

613
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,500
is enough.

614
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:01,810
Dian.

615
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:06,700
Don't do this next time.

616
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,110
A light lamp is OK.

617
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,030
Sleeping this way may cause a cold.

618
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:10,530
You silly.

619
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:13,520
The lamp is for you to find our home.

620
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:16,020
Where someone is waiting is home.

621
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,700
What is the kiss for?

622
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,990
I know my Dian

623
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,060
needs encouragement.

624
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,760
What's going on?

625
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,790
Nothing special.

626
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:33,980
It's just because

627
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,530
my mother knew the Physics Competition

628
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,070
and I'm working in the pub.

629
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,340
Very soon after she knew it,

630
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,750
I got fired.

631
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:42,910
She's been like this since I was little.

632
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,670
For everything I like,

633
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,940
if she doesn't satisfy,

634
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,750
she forces me

635
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,760
to stop.

636
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:49,950

637

Physics.

639
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,030
It's all the same.

640
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,140
She reaches her goals

641
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,520
by any kind of means.

642
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,300
You are Jiang Dian's mother.

643
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,370
He's so talented.

644
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,910
You don't allow him to draw

645
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,110
but paying attention to

646
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,780
complaining me to my leaders

647
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,510
about ignoring the wishes of the parents

648
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,710
and taking Jiang Dian to competitions.

649
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,670
I've told you seriously

650
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,090
Jiang Dian only needs to learn

651
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,810
finance and business.

652
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:23,520
I signed him for extra classes.

653
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:25,770
It's none of your business.

654
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,310
He is so little.

655
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,230
But you let him learn finance.

656
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,590
Isn't it too hard?

657
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,310
At this age,

658
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,500
he needs

659
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,600
a happy childhood only.

660
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,740
He doesn't need childhood.

661
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:40,990
Dian’s Father?

662
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,010
Do you also think so?

663
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,160
It's up to her. I agree with her.

664
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,420
- You...
- Wen.

665
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:52,740
Accompany him to the door.

666
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,320
This way, please.

667
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:55,380
No, thanks.

668
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:00,260
Dian.

669
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:01,890
They are your parents.

670
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,830
I can't make comments.

671
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,160
What I can tell you is

672
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,800
no matter what happens,

673
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,160
I would never

674
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,390
let you go.

675
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,730
So, don't worry.

676
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:16,010
I'm afraid you may get hurt.

677
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,230
I originally want to

678
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,230
share with you

679
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,350
the good news from Mr. Chen.

680
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,730
But it becomes like this now.

681
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:26,970
I will return

682
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,510
when everything is settled.

683
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:29,910
Idiot!

684
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,850
I'm not that weak.

685
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,830
I picked you.

686
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,590
Then I'll face all difficulties

687
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,950
with you.

688
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,580
What's more,

689
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,470
I rent this place

690
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,790
because I'd have a home

00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:27,970
has nothing to do with you.

865
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:29,950
After all,

866
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:31,840
crisis pr won't solve it fully.

867
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,480
Only evidence can solve the problem.

868
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,000
I called them.

869
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,320
But nobody answered the phone.

870
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:40,950
I will call later.

871
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:43,590
The heat is on.

872
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:45,040
Will you

873
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,360
close the book cafe?

874
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:48,210
You'd better not go out recently.

875
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:50,590
Avoid unnecessary troubles.

876
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:57,670
But the troubles come to me.

877
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:58,900
Avoiding is useless.

878
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:00,000
Miss Cheng.

879
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:00,880
Is the hearsay

880
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,110
about you real?

881
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,170
Yes. Is it the truth?

882
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:03,610
Please say something.

883
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:04,840
You said it's the hearsay.

884
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,940
So, do you think it's reliable?

885
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,570
Can you say something simply

886
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:08,980
about the details?

887
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,120
It can't be said simply.

888
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,440
No matter what I say,

889
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:12,760
the news released in public

890
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,990
will be what you surmise.

891
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:14,960
So, instead of

892
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,110
wasting time here,

893
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:17,600
you'd better write what you want to.

894
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:19,490
But I'd state clearly here,

895
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,740
if you write anything I didn't do,

896
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:23,320
you will take legal responsibility

897
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:24,770
when I get the evidence.

898
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,090
You can keep staying here.

899
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:30,050
I can't stop you.

900
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:31,020
If you get thirsty,

901
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,470
I'll provide you drinks for free.

902
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:34,500
No food. But the premise is

903
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:35,470
respecting.

904
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,090
Don't affect my business.

905
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,470
Just small business. Please excuse me.Thank you.

906
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:41,490
Miss Cheng. Miss Cheng.

907
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:42,240
Don't push.

908
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:42,730
Please say more.

909
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:48,050
Baoling. Did you read the top trending searches?

910
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,030
You know what to do, right?

911
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,320
It'll be Lian Ruoshen's audition

912
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,020
very soon.

913
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:54,610
I don't want

914
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:56,280
any bad news.

915
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,390
Choreographist works backstage.

916
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,190
Maybe it won't affect too much.

917
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:00,940
Maybe?

918
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:03,670
People nowadays are very capable

919
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:04,510
to find out everything.

920
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:07,410
Everyone getting involved in his debut,

921
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:08,910
cast or credits,

922
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,450
no stain is allowed.

923
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,160
If he gets involved,

924
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,570
the company's investment

925
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:14,410
and arrangement

926
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:15,200
will meet problems.

927
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:18,010
Sir.

928
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:20,170
I understand you.

929
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:21,880
But it's not a good thing

930
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:23,380
to replace the ghoreographist now.

931
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:25,450
Schedule is the first problem.

932
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,870
Ruoshen knows nothing about dancing.

933
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,980
If we replace the ghoreographist now,

934
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:30,950
it means he'll restart it.

935
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:33,060
He'll need a lot of time

936
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,290
to learn it and get used to it.

937
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:37,280
The company's investment

938
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:38,650
will be in jeopardy.

939
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,320
If the new ghoreographist

940
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,420
isn't as responsible as Cheng is,

941
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,660
the dance won't be prepared

942
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,500
especially for Ruoshen,

943
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,830
and it won't bring

944
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,240
a good performance.

945
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,200
Fine. She can stay.

946
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:53,430
But no signature.

947
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,410
Don't let the public know
she's the ghoreographist.

948
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:58,980
Sir, you just said

949
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:00,300
people nowadays are very capable

950
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,880
to find out everything.

951
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,420
In that case,

952
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,610
it will still cause news.

953
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,980
It's better to let them know the truth

954
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:08,880
instead of being criticized

955
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:09,760
after they find it

956
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:14,240
I'm sure you know

957
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,390
Cheng Feng's ability.

958
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,840
I don't think

959
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,160
we have a better choice now.

960
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:22,520
I'd promise you that

961
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,320
if Lian Ruoshen doesn't

962
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,210
create ripples in entertainment,

963
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,060
I'd take the blame and resign.

964
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:30,350
You really trust yourself.

965
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,280
I trust Cheng Feng,

966
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,690
Lian Ruoshen,

967
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:35,670
and my vision.

968
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,050
OK.

969
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:39,760
I will wait and see.

970
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,110
Don't resign without thinking twice.

971
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:45,480
It's unlucky.

972
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,140
Why are you here?

973
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:06,340
Did you overhear?

974
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:08,140
Do you think it's worthy?

975
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:09,990
You mean

976
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,620
how did you get ruined

977
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:13,160
after you just getting better?

978
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,600
Do you think you can take the place

979
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:21,830
after I get ruined?

980
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:24,250
You have Zhou Yao.

981
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,700
But I'm still the first

982

983
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:27,850
You think so?

984
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,570
Let's wait and see.

985
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:30,980
Coincidently,

986
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,390
Zhou Yao will release the song

987
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,790
at the same time.

988
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:34,940
Let's see the results.

989
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:36,430
If you are scared,

990
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,110
go for the boss now

991
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:38,990
and eat your words.

992
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,220
You still have time.

993
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:52,320
What are you doing?

994
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:53,860
It's the office.

995
00:46:57,470 --> 00:46:58,870
You are arrogant, aren't you?

996
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:00,630
Why are you afraid?

997
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:03,980
I couldn't understand one thing

998
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:04,990
before.

999
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,600
You are not respectful.

1000
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,930
But you are not so aggressive, too. Why changed?

1001
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:13,530
I've figured it out now.

1002
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,610
It's because

1003
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:18,010
I saw you grovel.

1004
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:20,040
When you see me,

1005
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:21,930
it will remind you of that.

1006
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:24,750

1008
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:28,090
are always dirty.

1009
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:30,250
You made great effort to get everything.

1010
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,210
Then what?

1011
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:33,110
Does it really belong to you?

1012
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,170
What you precious

1013
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,810
may be valueless for others.

1014
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:40,370
So, stay away from my thing.

1015

We want to give Cheng

1037
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:31,010
a surprise.

1038
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:35,850
Why?

1039
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,150
She has done a lot

1040
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:40,420
for me recently.

1041
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:42,360
And because of the news.

1042
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:43,900
We hope to

1043
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:45,130
make her happy

1044
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:46,010
with the surprise.

1045
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:48,960
But we have no idea about what to do.

1046
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:50,320
Any advice?

1047
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,670
As long as you do it for her,

1048
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,810
she will like it

1049
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:55,740
no matter what it is.

1050
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:56,790
No, Baoling.

1051
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:58,110
Since it's a gift,

1052
00:48:58,330 --> 00:48:59,080
it should be

1053
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,270
what she wants.

1054
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,030
She is your sister.

1055
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,480
You should know what she likes.

1056
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,840
We are just cousins.

1057
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:05,900
But you are different.

1058
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,090
She is better to you

1059
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:07,840
than to me.

1060
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:09,510
So, you must know her better.

1061
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:14,830
Sure, you got the right person.

1062
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:17,650
Cheng prefers...

1063
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,150
[Linxi University]

1064
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:26,540
Boys.

1065
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,430
- Prof. Chen.
- Prof. Chen.

1066
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:30,670
You!

1067
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:31,640
Stop just standing here.

1068
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:33,310
Make a brief introduction,

1069
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:34,590
will you?

1070
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,350
Hi, guys, my name is Jiang Dian.

1071
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:38,990
I just transferred from business to science.

1072
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,440
Please render your help.

1073
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:47,480
Is that all?

1074
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:49,990
So fast?

1075
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:51,880
Fine, let me introduce him to you.

1076
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:53,730
Jiang Dian.

1077
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:55,750
I'm sure you already knew

1078
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,510
he's the champion of the National

1079
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,050
Physics Competition of College Students.

1080
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,650
He's very smart

1081
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,070
and very talented

1082
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,080
in Physics,

1083
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,800
especially in hydromechanics.

1084
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:08,470
Since

1085
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:10,450
the course is very difficult,

1086
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:11,990
I

1087
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:13,970
asked him

1088
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,990
to join our team

1089
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:17,840
to increase our strength.

1090
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:19,030
Please

1091
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,320
work together

1092
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:24,090
to make the project

1093
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:25,760
successful.

1094
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:29,370
Uh, any applause?

1095
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:30,990
OK. Good.

1096
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,870
Learning depends on your efforts.

1097
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:36,630
Show yourself, boy.

1098
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:45,340
Take your boss here.

1099
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,630
Or it won't end well today.
