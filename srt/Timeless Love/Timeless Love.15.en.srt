Chengcheng,

174
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,540
did anyone told you?

175
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,660
When you are concentrating on your work,

176
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,790
you look really charming.

177
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,180
You don't need to paint a picture.

178
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,820
You always look like a figure in a painting.

179

It seems you got good results this time.

180

They say the song is pleasant.

185
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,700
The choreography is also excellent.

Oh yes.

187

189

No.

He hasn't got the money yet.

205
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,340
But he used his own money

206
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,470
to buy me a massage chair.

207
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,460
I've been in show business

209

Shall I put it in your room or other places?

217
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,980
A massage chair?

Send it back. There is no room for it.

219

Does he care about other people?

220
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,140

[The 50th Anniversary of Linxi University]

Mr. Wang, I'll call you later.

225
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,420
At the anniversary of the university,

226
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,190
I looked back and saw him.

227
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,260
I was deeply attracted by his song.

228
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,030
Later on,

229
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,420
I found that he was full of sap.

230
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,340
He is very bold and he never bows to fate.

231
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,540
If he likes something,

232
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,700
he will hold on straight to the end.

233

I'm deeply moved.

234

If he likes something,
he will hold on straight to the end?

235

Don't you know whom he likes?

I don't care.

237

He can choose whom he likes.

238
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,420
But who I like is my thing.

239
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,290
Don't worry.

Previously I felt you were too young.

257

I thought you might be a drag on us.

DK's budget is tight.

265

She is still the most suitable.

266
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,290
She was just lucky.

267
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,810
If there was no video to make things clear

268
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,300
and the comments on the internet were all biased,

269
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,980
Lian Ruoshen was also involved.

270

I only value the result.

271

Now that she can help increase Lian Ruoshen's fame,

272
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,730
she can also be helpful to us.

00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,780
He can pay 1 million yuan

344
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,130
more than the original price.

345
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,570
He can pay me immediately.

346
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,650
We've known each other for so many years.

347
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,780
Please consider for me.

348
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,340
After all, I'm going abroad soon.

349
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,100
You know.

350
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,890
If you can

351
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,580
pay me 3 million yuan tomorrow,

352
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,730
you can have the house.

353
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,370
Otherwise,

354
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,490
I have to take back the house.

355
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,420
We've been friends for so many years.

356
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,420
I don't want to do anything bad to you.

357
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,380
Are you selling the house

358
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,780
by force?

359
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,130
What does it to do with you?

360
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,660
You are being aggressive in front of my girlfriend.

361
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,260
Does it have anything to do with me?

362
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:02,970
How much money is Chengcheng owing you?

363
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,100
I'll pay you.

364
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,450
It's our own business.

365
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,300
It has nothing to do with you.

366
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,770
He can solve

367
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:14,610
your girlfriend's problem.

368
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,220
What can you do?

369
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,010
Miss Cheng,

370
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:21,740
It might be improper for me to say so.

371
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,170
You should find a boyfriend

372
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,730
who is older than you.

373
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,140
He should be rich

374
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,570
and love you dearly.

375
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,860
You and I

376
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,090
have finished our talk.

377
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,210
Goodbye!

378
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,730
I have nothing

379
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,420
to say to you.

380
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,100
You can just go back.

381
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,130
Don't be an eyesore here.

382
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,180
Chengcheng,

383
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,460
I'm the only one

384
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,050
who can help you now.

385
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:50,930
Is it so difficult for you

386
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,660
to accept my help?

387
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,060
Don't go too far!

388
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:55,970
Can you help her?

389
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,330
Why are you so confident?

390
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:00,900
I only want to help you.

391
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,340
Stay away from me if you want to help me!

392
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,100
I don't want my boyfriend to be jealous.

393
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:14,930
All right.

394
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:18,740
If you need me,

395
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:19,650
you can call me.

396
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:20,770
You know that

397
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,220
I have never changed my number.

398
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,460
Is there anything else?

399
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:39,620
I thought you were smart.

400
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,450
You didn't find

401
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:42,450
a suitable boyfriend.

402
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,610
You chose him.

Dian,

404
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,690
maybe we need to

405
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,650
find a new home this time.

406
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,820
I will try to solve this.

please watch Entertainment Hot Events.

Give me some support.

Lian Ruoshen,

413
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,050
your new song has been available online for only 5 hours.

414
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,340
It has topped

415
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,690
the major billboards.

416
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,370
It is the hottest super topic.

417
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,490
Over 3 million people

418
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,740
followed you on Weibo overnight.

419
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,170
No one has become famous

420
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,530
so fast.

421
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,020
How do you look at the fact

422
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:29,900
that you suddenly became famous?

423
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,050
How do I look?

424
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:32,250
Well,

425
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:33,980
pretty good-looking...

426
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,530
They all say that

427
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,820
I'm another Eddie Peng.

428
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,700
But in fact,

429
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,460
I don't care very much

430
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:41,660
about appearance.

431
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,450
I care more about cultivation.

432
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,010
A man should be

433
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,530
regarded highly,

434
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,020
as a well-cultivated person.

our next question.

He is too nervous.

439

I'm good at answering questions in advance.

440
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,530
What was your last question?

441
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:05,980
Why do you think

442
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,210
you could become famous overnight?

443
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,330
Is there anything special about you?

444
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,570
Anything special?

445
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,530
I don't know whether this counts.

446
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:16,810
When I was a child,

447
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,610
Uncle Zhang in our village told my fortune.

448
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,970
He said I would depend on my voice in my life.

449
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,210
God has given me a nice voice.

450
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,090
Uncle Zhang will become famous.

451
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:26,660
He can't.

452
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,220
He was cremated several days ago.

Just now

454
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,650
I was joking. I wanted to make you laugh.

455
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,210
In fact, what I really want to say is that

456
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,050
no one can easily succeed.

457
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:46,530
There are several reasons for my achievement,

458
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:47,970
the support

459
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,130
of my fans, "sea cucumbers",

460
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,730
the help of my friends

461
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,010
and my own efforts.

better music.

still be buried now.

484
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,090
supervised the production of your MV herself,

485
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:31,970
but also invited

486
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,220
Cheng Feng, a leading dancer of modern dance
who is out of the entertainment circle,

487
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,450
to choregraph for you.

There is something else I want to say.

493
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,290

my good friend, Lu Bie.

when I was writing this song.

497
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:50,650
I want to thank him, too.

is matching his song.

504
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,730
It is filled with the vigor of youth.

505
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,050
It's a good display of his confidence.

506

This is what your performance lacks.

507

I've seen the dance for your new song.

508
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,140
The choreography is pretty ordinary.

509
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,930
It's emphasizing the format, but not the content.

510

It doesn't have a soul.

516
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,610
The fans are also expecting it.

517
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,640
We have also announced the time to boost popularity.

518
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,050
If we postpone the time of releasing the song,

519
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,450
it will be very harmful to Zhou Yao.

520
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,650
If a singer

521
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,810
stops temporarily to release new songs

522
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,690
and keeps his fame by spreading news

523
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:41,730
and other methods,

524
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,490
it will

525
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,530
gradually lower the enthusiasm of the fans.

526
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,650
Now Lian Ruoshen is the man of the moment.

527
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,090
You don't need to compete with him.

528
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:51,970
It will be an internal competition in the company.

529
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,330
It's not an issue about internal competition.

530
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:55,770
-It's about...
-I think what our boss has said is right.

531
00:24:58,690 --> 00:24:59,890
I'm also not satisfied

532
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,880
with the choreography.

533
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:03,850
After I saw the video

534
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,050
of Lian Ruoshen's dance,

535
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,130
I believe a good method

536
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,450
is to cooperate with Cheng Feng.

537
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,330
After all, Cheng Feng was famous

538
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:12,530
in the entertainment circle.

539
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,530
And she is indeed talented.

540
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,410
Lian Ruoshen's MV

541
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:19,130
has made her famous again.

542
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:20,330
Therefore,

543
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,650
if our company can have

544
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,210
an in-depth cooperation with Cheng Feng,

545
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,290
I think it will be a very good thing

546
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,410
for both the company and I.

547
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:27,520
I don't want to cooperate with her.

548
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:29,930
She is not the only one

549
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:30,770
who can choregraph.

550
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:31,970
Now that she refused me,

551
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,050
I don't believe I can't find

552
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,050
a choreographer who is more suitable.

553
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:36,570
Sir,

554
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:37,850
I don't think it was the right time

555
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:38,850
to talk to her last time.

556
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,210
I heard that

557
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,570
she did not have enough money

558
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,210
on hand recently.

559
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,370
If we ask her to cooperate with us now,

560
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,850
we will be providing timely help.

561
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,570
Why it must be her?

562
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:02,930
If you can find a better one,

563
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:04,210
I can accept it.

564
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,850
But you are clear

565
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,050
about the current situation.

566
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:09,490
To cooperate with Cheng Feng

567
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:10,530
is a win-win situation for us.

568
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,130
After all,

569
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,530
you don't want to postpone

570
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,930
the time of releasing my new song.

571
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:25,650
Hello,

572
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:26,770
Honey!

573
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,240
Are you going to give us

574
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,490
Zhou Yao's endorsement contract?

575
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,250
I'm sorry.

576
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,840
Lian Ruoshen will be the brand ambassador instead.

577
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:36,720
I can do nothing about it.

578
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,570
The boss's mother

579
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:39,530
likes Lian Ruoshen.

580
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:42,930
It doesn't matter.

581
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,730
I can understand.

582
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,810
I look forward to our future cooperation.

583
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,290
The man has a narrow vision!

584
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:55,770
I want to see whether
he can be famous in his entire life!

585
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,360
What's the matter?

586
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,530
Lian Ruoshen has replaced you

587
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:04,970
to be the brand ambassador.

588
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,130
Will I

589
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:13,360
become a has-been?

590
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:15,970
Don't worry.

591
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,640
I won't let that happen to you.

592
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,170
Don't push! Don't push!

593
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,640
In good order! In good order! Order!

594
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,250
You can take a photo with him and get an autograph.

595
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:31,400
Be patient! Be patient!

596
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,250
Be patient!

597
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,450
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

598
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:42,530
How much do you still need?

599
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,330
I have 800 thousand yuan.

600
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,000
Dian gave me a million.

601
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,490
I still need 1.2 million.

602
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,170
I have 300 thousand.

603
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,880
You seldom ask me to help you.

604
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,810
I must help you this time.

605
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,450
If I sell those stuff,

606
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,850
we might get

607
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,290
enough money.

608
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:19,730
I will sell

609
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:21,330
my car.

610
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,010
On the wall of my house,

611
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,290
there is a collection of bags.

612
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:26,370
I'll sell all of them.

613
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,720
Then we might have enough money.

614
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,090
From your expression,

615
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,610
I can see that

616
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,490
you really don't want to sell them.

617
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:37,960
It doesn't matter.

618
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,330
I will find a way myself.

619
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:41,920
Even if you sell another collection of bags,

620
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,850
you won't be able to get enough money.

621
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:47,610
Chengcheng,

622
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,600
there is another solution.

623
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,410
DK wanted to sign a contract with you.

624
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,560
If you sign a cooperation contract

625
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,080
with Royal Entertainment,

626
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,330
I think you will

627
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:00,840
solve the issue.

628
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:02,920
No.

629
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:04,530
I don't want to be related

630
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,410
to Zhou Yao in any way.

631
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,880
Because of Jiang Dian?

632
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,210
You used to be

633
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,920
out of touch.

634
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,320
When you choose between love and bread,

635
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:18,560
love is your choice.

636
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:21,610
But I'm really happy

637
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,690
for you.

638
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,410
Because you have a younger heart.

639
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,880
I will also

640
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,490
try to

641
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,080
find more resources for you.

642
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,210
Baoling, thank you!

643
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,650
You are welcome!

644
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,130
Don't make a long face.

645
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,320
Go to Linxi University with me.

646
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,930
Lian Ruoshen will perform there this afternoon.

647
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:45,920
Come with me

648
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,210
and enjoy yourself.

649
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:53,400
Mrs. Chen, you've come.

650
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:54,640
Please come to my office.

651
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,450
It's not necessary.

652
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,010
I only have a few words to say.

653
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:58,130
First,

654
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,440
Jiang Dian will stop doing research.

655
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,090
Second,

656
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,320
I have made the arrangements and he will go abroad.

657
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,640
I hope you can leave him in peace.

658
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:06,890
Goodbye!

659
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:08,360
Mrs. Chen,

660
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,890
I have a few more words to say to you.

661
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:12,320
Jiang Dian

662
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,080
is talented and ambitious.

663
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,490
He is a good student.

664
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:17,690
He knows clearly what he wants.

665
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,450
He is also trying very hard to achieve it.

666
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,730
As his parent,

667
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,050
you should support him.

668
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,000
You should not always deny him.

669
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,640
He is the only son of the Jiangs.

670
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,090
He only needs to grow up

671
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:30,770
in a way that is defined.

672
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,920
After he was born,

673
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,210
we made arrangements

674
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,440
for his future.

675
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,200
The so-called talent and ambition

676
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,250
are nothing to us.

677
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,280
He has to undertake his responsibility.

678
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:41,720
I have said so much to you.

679
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:42,840
I hope

680
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,730
you will not contact my son again.

681
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,290
If you hadn't encouraged him

682
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:47,760
to go to another department,

683
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,520
how could he be so rebellious?

684
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,250
Goodbye!

685
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,280
Mrs. Chen...

686
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,530
There is no need to go on talking.

687
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:01,690
I... I...

688
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,650
[Lian Ruoshen, Shenshen, love you]

689
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:26,920
Thank you!

690
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,560
Thank you!

691
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,690
Shenshen!

692
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,800
Shenshen, love you!

693
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,170
We will support you forever!

694
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,400
Shenshen, I love you! Shenshen, I love you!

695
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:38,600
Shenshen! Shenshen, I love you!

696
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,290
I want to be with you!

697
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:43,120
Shenshen! Shenshen, my husband! Kiss you!

698
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,290
Bro, I'm a man!

699
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,600
Shenshen! Shenshen! Shenshen! Shenshen!

700
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,920
Shenshen, I love you! Shenshen, I love you!

701
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,200
I told you not to get off the car.

702
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,490
Someone

703
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,520
wanted to have close contact

704
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,370
with his fans.

705
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,920
Now he understands what it is.

706
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,840
Baoling, next time

707
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,920
you should tell me in advance.

708
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,170
It's so scary.

709
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:04,850
Let's first get inside.

710
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,760
Thank you! Thank you!

711
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,010
You won't answer it?

712
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,160
What if there is something urgent?

713
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,000
A matter of routine. I don't need to answer it.

714
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:44,190

Jiang Dian! Chengcheng!

727
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,720
Stop making out.

728
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,520
Follow us!

729
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,159
Send me all the information

730
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,159
about what Jiang Dian has done recently.

731
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,199
Hello! What's the matter?

732
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,760
OK. I see.

733
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,210
What's the matter?

734
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,760
My mother has discovered that
I have gone to another department.

735
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,120
I have to go home.

736
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:43,639
Do you need me to go with you?

737
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,159
No.

738
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:46,639
Wait for me.

739
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,770
I can solve it.

740
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,800
This woman ordered a cup of coffee.

741
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,480
It's been two hours.

742
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,360
She hasn't drunk a drop.

743
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,040
Who is she?

744
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,600
I've never seen her.

745
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,490
Cheng! Cheng!

746
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,400
What's the matter?

747
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,240
That woman wants to see you.

748
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,560
She's been sitting there for a long time.

749
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,650
She was motionless and she looked scary.

750
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,240
Do you want to see me?

751
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,520
Please sit down and let's have a talk.

752
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,490
You were a dancer overseas when you were a kid
but quit dancing without reason.

753
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,720
Recently there are scandals about you.

754
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,280
You have just terminated the agreement with HA.

755
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,040
So that's you, Miss Cheng Feng?

756
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,400
Are you Dian's mother?

757
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,720
Nice to meet you!

758
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,160
I'm sorry I wasn't able to

759
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,600
visit you first.

760
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,080
If you are curious

761
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,360
about me,

762
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:09,840
you can ask me directly.

763
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,000
You don't have to investigate me.

764
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,330
Your coffee is cold.

765
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,480
I'll give you a hot cup of tea.

766
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,440
You don't need to.

767
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,640
Since we are not so intimate,

768
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,760
we won't drink tea together.

769
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,480
I think you know why I am here.

770
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,530
Leave Dian.

771
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:34,400
Does Dian

772
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,130
know that you've come here?

773
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:36,760
He doesn't need to know it.

774
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,520
I decide everything for him.

775
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,680
I just hope

776
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,850
you can leave Dian.

777
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,320
I have prepared the files for him
so that he can go abroad.

778
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,130
Why are you sneering?

779
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,520
Nothing.

780
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,240
I just feel that

781
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,320
it was not easy for Dian

782
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,760
to become an excellent man

783
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:55,960
in such an environment.

784
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,680
Don't say such nonsense.

785
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:00,840
I've seen a lot of women

786
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:01,920
like you.

787
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,120
Dian is too young

788
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,400
and you want to coax him

789
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,360
in order to have a sudden rise in life.

790
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,600
You want to become another Cinderella.

791
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,080
I will never let you succeed.

792
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,040
You can have

793
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,120
your own ideas.

794
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,480
Since you are

795
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,240
Dian's mother,

796
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,040
I don't want to say anything bad.

797
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,640
But you

798
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,330
don't need to persuade me

799
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,480
to leave Dian.

800
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,080
Only if

801
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,840
Dian tells me to himself.

802
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,400
It's an opportunity to leave him decently.

803
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,080
But you don't want it.

804
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,320
Don't regret it in the future.

805
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,400
Cheng,

806
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,800
are you OK?

807
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,480
I'm fine.

808
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,440
When she asked you to break up with him,

809
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,200
her way was quite different

810
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,240
from what I've seen

811
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,560
in the novels and TV series.

812
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,520
She should give you a stack of money

813
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,360
or a check

814
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,120
and ask you

815
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,360
"How much money do you need

816
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,440
to leave my son?"

817
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,400
She didn't

818
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,320
give you a penny.

819
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:15,880
She is so stingy.

820
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,520
She even got the cup of coffee for free.

821
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,480
You should

822
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,880
never let Dian know it.

823
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,760
Don't worry. I'm the most tight-lipped.

824
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,280
I might go back late tonight.

825
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:37,680
You go to bed early.

826
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:38,480
Don't wait for me.

827
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,080
It's me who wants to go to another department.

828
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,160
You can ask me directly if you have any questions.

829
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,160
You don't need to talk to my teacher.

830
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,880
If I hadn't talked to him,

831
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,390
when would you tell me?

832
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,880
How many things haven't you told me?

833
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,480
I have a girlfriend.

834
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,200
How long have you been with her?

835
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,600
Over a month.

836
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,320
You are learning physics

837
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,440
but you didn't tell me.

838
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,040
You found a part-time job secretly.

839
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,440
You went to another department without telling me.

840
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,440
I thought these were the limits of your rebellious actions.

841
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,240
I never expected you

842
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,080
to be in a relationship

843
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,640
with such an indecent woman behind my back.

844
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,310
I'm really disappointed at you!

845
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,800
Who is indecent?

846
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,240
Do you know her?

847
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,640
Disappointed?

848
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,720
Are you qualified to say you are disappointed?

849
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,350
Are you qualified because you were showing no care?

850
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,880
Are you qualified because you want to control me?

851
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:36,990
I'm qualified because I'm your mother!

852
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,960
Mother?

853
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,360
Do you really know me?

854
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:41,710
What do I like to eat?

855
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,590
What do I dislike to eat?

856
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,880
What am I allergic to? Do you know?

857
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,600
How many times did we see each other
in the past nineteen years?

858
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,550
Do you remember?

859
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,240
Why did we see each other

860
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,310
each time?

861
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,040
Do you still remember?

862
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,760
When I want to say something to you,

863
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,080
most of the time you would say

864
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,200
"no, don’t, you can’t".

865
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,200
What does the word "mother" to do with you?

866
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,480
The girl has taught you

867
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,000
how to use your sharp tongue.

868
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,560
A mother can send someone

869
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,880
to follow her son.

870
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,670
Do you think I should feel disappointed

871
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,720
or desperate?

872
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,120
If you were obedient,

873
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,360
how could I send someone to watch you?

874
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,070
Now I know that

875
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,200
this man is following your orders.

876
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,150
You taught him

877
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,560
how to report to me.

878
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,800
You are really awesome!

879
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,840
If we can have a good talk,

880
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,480
I don't need to do that.

881
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,590
Every time I want to talk to you,

882
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,440
you always ask me to stop talking.

883
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,880
Or you would say you are busy.

884
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,640
Yes. You are busy, but I'm not free, either.

885
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,920
I just want to ask you

886
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,260
whether you will break up with her.

887
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,060
No.

888
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,390
Only when I die.

889
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,120
You love is whimsical.

890
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,560
You could easily

891
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,960
say the word "die".

892
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,750
Life is very long.

893
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,000
When you are no longer so passionate,

894
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,200
if you can still say this,

895
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,640
you two will be true love.

896
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:50,880
Other people will think

897
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,520
you are childish to say so

898
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,160
when you are at a young age.

899
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,760
I remember you said you liked physics.

900
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,680
Physics is your dream, your obsession.

901
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:01,640
Fine.

902
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,320
Now I give you two choices

903
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:04,760
and you can choose only one.

904
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,190
If you break up with her,

905
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,160
I will allow you to learn physics.

906
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,440
You are always so confident,

907
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,790
so self-righteous.

908
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,110
You will see

909
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,070
whether she and I are true love or not.

910
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,950
You asked me to choose between the two.

911
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,560
I'm tired of this game.

912
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,440
I was expecting

913
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:26,670
to win your love.

914
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,840
I just wanted you

915
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:29,840
to pay a bit more attention to me.

916
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,760
Now I want to choose both.

917
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,470
I decide what to do in my life.

918
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,160
You are fully fledged.

919
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,990
You will regret your decision on this day.

920
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:43,590
What do you mean?

921
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,280
Is there something wrong with you?

922
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:49,640
After you get the visa,

923
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,120
I will send you abroad immediately.

924
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,630
Wait in your room before that.

925
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:53,440
Let me go!

926
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,360
Send him to his room.

927
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,520
I won't go abroad!

928
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,150
I won't go abroad!

929
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,590
Let go of me!
